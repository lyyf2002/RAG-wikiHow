Book a flight with a plane that has a bigger cabin or larger seats.,
Avoid walking by the first class section.,
Skip the alcohol and pills.",How to Handle Air Rage3," Sitting close to strangers, fighting for room, and feeling claustrophobic are all reasons why people in airplanes become on edge. Additionally, dealing with inconsiderate passengers, like those who kick the seat in front of them, talk too loudly, or have no regard for those around them, can increase a person’s stress level.


The combination of all of these factors is enough to cause someone to become so irritated they react differently to being agitated than they would otherwise., Research has shown that some air rage occurs because passengers feel they are the subject of inequality. People who aren’t sitting in the first class section are often upset because of the amenities provided in that section aren’t offered to them. As a result, they may lash out on other passengers or the crew because they feel like injustices are occurring.


You can avoid this cause of resentment by booking a flight on a plane that doesn’t have a first-class section. Select the right company to fly with and you may avoid feeling this rage., Some people turn to drinking or pills before they get on the plane to help combat anxiety about flying. Although it is a good idea in theory, doing so may actually backfire. People tend to become more impulsive and let go of their inhibitions when they are under the influence of alcohol or sedatives. This means you may experience rage you wouldn’t normally, and lash out on someone who is irritating you."

Alert a flight attendant.,
Locate “Lavatory” sign on the door.,
Lift “Lavatory” sign and shift the lever underneath the plaque.",How to Free Your Child from a Locked Airplane Bathroom," Before tampering or manipulating any equipment on an airplane it’s imperative that you notify an official first. Without at least trying to notify a flight attendant, or doing this on the sly could land you in hot water with the Feds so think before you touch.


Tell the flight attendant that your child seems to be locked in the bathroom, his/her state of mind and age.
Ask flight attendant to release the child from the bathroom.;
, In the event you have to release the door (if, after attempting to get flight attendant’s attention but to no avail), first find the plaque located on the door that reads, “Lavatory.”


The sign is typically located above the “Occupied” and “Vacant” sign on the door.

, Depending on the door position, you will need to manipulate the lever until the “Occupied” sign has moved to “Vacant.”

Read a book or magazine.,
Bring your own music or games.,
Write in a journal or draw in a sketchbook.,
Do offline things on a laptop.,
Download movies and TV shows.,
Play a game.",How to Have Fun on an Airplane1," Bring a book, magazine, or newspaper from home, or buy one or several from the airport to read during the flight. Or load an e-reader or tablet with e-books to save space in your luggage.


Keep your reading materials in an easily accessible place throughout the flight, either in a small bag you’re allowed to keep under the seat in front of you, or take them out of a carry-on bag before the flight begins and put them in the seat pocket so you can reach them.
If you’d rather listen to books and save some space in your luggage, try downloading audiobooks to a phone, MP3 player, or tablet and make sure to bring headphones so you can listen to them.
Try bringing along a guidebook or other travel book for the destination you’re heading to so you can prepare in advance.;
, Load your phone or MP3 player with music you can listen to without an internet connection. Or bring a handheld gaming device with games to play.


Remember to bring your own headphones or earbuds. The airline usually provides them, but they are often low-quality or of a special type with two prongs that will only fit into the seat for the in-flight entertainment.
Never listen to music or have your game sounds on out loud without headphones. Even when you do wear headphones, make sure the sound isn’t so loud that others around you can hear it.

, Bring along a notebook or journal to write down the experience of your trip, or write a story, poem, or letter. Doodle or draw in a sketchbook, or color in a coloring book.


Try drawing or writing about other passengers on the plane, the clouds out the window, or other things you see and hear on the plane.

, Go through and edit photos, play games, or other things you can do when you aren’t connected to the internet on a laptop.


Your plane may even have WiFi available, in which case you can do everything you normally do using the internet, like browsing social media, chatting with friends, or playing internet games.

, Get your favorite movies or TV shows, or ones you’ve been meaning to start watching, on your laptop so you can watch them during the flight. Choose just what you want to see instead of being stuck with the limited in-flight options for TV and movies.


Make sure you download shows or movies for offline viewing, because your plane may not have WiFi available.
Never pirate or download TV shows or movies illegally. Stick to iTunes or other credible sources to download any media for personal use.

, Do a crossword or sudoku puzzle, or play a game with a nearby friend or family member like I Spy, 20 Questions, or other verbal games that you might typically play in the car on a roadtrip.Try playing a game that’s unique to airplane travel, like counting the snowflakes or frost swirls on plane windows, or picking the item you’d most like to have on every page of the SkyMall catalog.Try a handheld game, too, like a Rubik’s cube, Etch-a-Sketch, or something else that will keep your hands busy for long periods of time.
Make sure the game you choose isn’t too loud or requires a lot of movement that will disturb other passengers.

Build your e-book library.,
Store media on high-capacity external storage device.,
Install long, time-consuming games on your phone.,
Accomplish something productive.,
Relax better with a white noise generator.,
Pack a high-capacity power bank or two.",How to Get Through a Really Long Flight with Your Trusty Smart Phone," Avid bookworms often have very little problems dealing with long stretches of time on a plane. And the great thing about smartphones is that they provide a convenient little window for viewing literally thousands of books on your phone. Simply install an e-reader app of your choosing and settle down to a good book to help the hours zip by.


Amazon Kindle has perhaps the widest selection of e-books in a single market, with its own app for iOS, Android, and Windows phones. Simply log into the Kindle App with your Amazon account, purchase the books you want, and let the Kindle App download them to your smartphone.Koboand Barnes&Noblealso have a strong offerings, and it will be worth your time to explore their virtual shelves as well.






You can also opt to install one of the many multitudes of free e-reader apps out on the market, from the aptly named Ebook Reader by ebooks.comto Aldiko Book Reader by Aldiko Limited.This option is extremely useful if you often read indie books from alternative ebook retailers like Smashwords. You will, however, have to manually transfer your e-books to your smartphone and will have to format them into a format that is compatible with the app of your choosing.





;
, You might get away with streaming music and video, but storage space is king when you don’t have access to the Internet on your flight. You will thus need to store your favorite music and videos for a long flight. This in turn means that you need to invest in high-capacity external storage devices to hold your files for you.


Owners of most non-Apple devices will be able to easily expand the storage on their devices by keeping a stash of micro SD cards. These come in 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and even 128 gigabyte variants—giving you the option to store as many audio and video files as you want on your smartphone.






Owners of Apple devices, however, will not have the option to use micro SD cards. They can instead use wireless card readersor specially designed flash drives with lightning connectors to hook up to an iPhone., Puzzle games, word games, and board games can be fun for around 30, maybe 60 minutes. But a long flight will last much longer than that. This is where long-form games come into the picture. Adventure games (Walking Dead, République, Broken Age) role-playing games (Final Fantasy, Dungeon of the Endless, Knights of Pen and Paper), strategy games (XCOM: Enemy Within, Doorkickers, Worms), platformer games (World of Goo, Rayman, Megatroid)—these genres are particularly good at sucking up the hours without you even noticing. The best part is that many of these long-form games work even when you don’t have access to the Internet. So experiment and try out these game genres if you haven’t already. You may be surprised at what you find available out there—especially on iOS and Android.You can also try your hand at working with emulators. These apps allow you to play games from consoles of old on your phone, ranging from classics like the NES and Gameboy to more recent offerings like PSP and NDS. You have GBA4ios and nds4ios for iOS devicesand the aptly named DS Emulatorand N64 Emulatorfor Android, to name a few.







, Smartphones are amazing for productivity, and you would be surprised at what you can get done with your phone while on a long flight. You can review reports, read up on manuals, tap out drafts, proofread documents, organize your schedule, clean out your old messages, record your thoughts and opinions, and so much more. The key here is to look for something that you can do on your phone to help out with work or school. Granted it may not be the most fun way to spend your time, but it does hold the potential to help the hours run faster.


This is more easily done if you prepare the stuff you want to work on beforehand. Transfer documents to your phone, save an offline copy of your emails, save the articles you want to read or whatever. It is best to prepare your work beforehand while you have access to the Internet and your work computer.







, Let’s face it: it can be very hard to relax—much less fall asleep—when people are yakking all around you or someone’s baby is crying its head off across the aisle. This is why it is a very good idea to install a white noise generator to help filter out the noise all around you. Couple it with a noise-cancelling set of earphones or headphones, and you’ll be able to let the noise of the world around you fade away as you settle down to relax and eventually fall asleep.


Try to find generators that can produce ambient voice sounds. Apps like A Soft Murmur, MyNoise,and Coffitivityhave this feature, which makes them more effective at drowning out individual human voices so that they eventually fade away into the background. This is especially useful when people are boisterously chatting away beside you. All have iOS apps that can work even without Internet access, while A Soft Murmur and Coffitivity have Android versions that can do the same.







, Last but not the least, remember to keep your smartphone juiced up. It’ll be of no use to you when it runs out of power an hour into your 20-hour flight with no charger in sight. A power bank with a 10,000-plus mAh rating is good enough, although you may want to double up on the power banks if you plan to watch a lot of movies or play graphics-intensive games on your phone.


Just make sure you have a cable that can actually connect your power bank to your smartphone. The last thing you want to do is buy a high-capacity power bank only to find out that it doesn’t have a lightning connector to charge up your iPhone!

Also check out the SkyMall catalog or any other materials in the seat pocket in front of you.

, Talk to others around you on the plane, whether you know them or not. Get to know people by asking where they’re from, where they’re going, what they’re reading, or anything else you’re curious about.

, Walk back and forth in your cabin and even do some light stretching where there is room next to the lavatories, for example.Be careful not to bump or disrupt other passengers when you’re moving around, and don’t go into restricted areas that you’re not supposed to be in.
Don’t get out of your seat when the seatbelt signs are illuminated or the captain or attendants tell you to be seated. Obey all instructions from flight staff.

, Enjoy seeing the sights of the landscape you’re flying over, and how different things like clouds, mountains, and fields look from above.


Play a game like seeing if you and friends or family can guess where you’re flying over without looking at a map, or finding animal shapes in the clouds.If you’re not sitting in a window seat, you can get up and look out the window near a lavatory or other area on the plane with windows. Just make sure you don’t get in the way of other people waiting or flight attendants who need to move through the area.

, Set a challenge for yourself that you have to complete before the plane lands at your destination. Compete with a friend or family member if you can! Some ideas for challenges could be:


Learn 5 names of people on the plane you didn’t know before
Learn 10 new things about the city, state, or country you’re flying to
Try every free beverage on the beverage cart (ask nicely!)
Finish a book or piece of writing

Learn a language.,
Get maps for your destination.,
Make a bucket list or top 10.",How to Have Fun on an Airplane3," If you’re traveling abroad to a country where people speak a different language, use the flight time to pick up some of the vocabulary. Download an app or language learning program or software before the flight.


Get a free app like Duolingo to make language learning into a fun and easy game., Download digital maps or pick up physical ones for the country or countries you’re traveling to in order to familiarize yourself with locations or plan out a travel route you want to take.


Look over maps for public transportation, like bus routes, subway lines, or train stops. It will really help to get familiar with these in advance, especially in another language, so you don’t get lost!, Read a guidebook or do some research into popular destinations in activities in the country and city you’re visiting. Make a “bucket list” of all the things you’d most like to do before you leave, or simply narrow it down to a top 5 or 10 “must-do” items.


There are a lot of things to do in another country, so try prioritizing your list so that you have a group of things you absolutely must see or do, a group of less-crucial things or “maybes,” and a group of things that you’ll do only if you have the money and time.

Contact your airline to obtain necessary information about business class.,
Be flexible with your travel dates and book sufficiently in advance to get the cheaper business class fares.,
Sign up for a premium credit card.,
Look for a Y-Up fare (some airline companies call it as K-Up or Q-Up fare).,
Check for upgrades.,
Look for lesser known airlines for your flight.,
Shop at preferred stores.",How to Get the Best Deal On a Business Class Upgrade," Several major airlines have drastically reduced business-class fares by more than 50 percent. While business class fares may not be cheap, you can still search the Internet for available discounts. Avoid as far as possible peak business travel days like Monday and Friday. Add a Saturday night stay to reduce the fare further.;
, Always use the term 'lowest fare' when doing an airfare search online. Contact your travel agent to see if they improve on your online quote. Also use a specialist business class / first class consolidator who will have access to many unpublished airfares not available elsewhere.

, You can sign up for a premium credit card because premium credit cards generally offer two-for-one specials on airline tickets in business class. Opt for a credit card associated with your preferred airline. Alternately, visit your preferred credit card company and sign up for a premium card associated with an airline.

, A Y-Up is the airline industry's top guarded secret. They are priced like a coach ticket but you will invariably be seated in business class. Insist on Y-Ups fare particularly if you are traveling at the last minute. But remember that Y-Up fares are only available for North American flights.


If you are on European or Asian travel, then look for Z-fare. They are less common, but sometimes you can get a discounted business-class fare by asking for the Z-fare. You will particularly succeed in the month of December as also during the summer season. You'll have to ask the airline through a ticket agent.

, Before trying other means first seek to upgrade your economy fare ticket to business class. If you have already purchased a ticket, then ask the travel agent to upgrade it to business class.

, Always make it a point to book your flight ticket on a less-known airline. For instance, if you are flying transatlantic, from New York to London, consider flying on Iceland Air. Quite often, these airlines undercut the fares of larger airlines.

, Shopping at the preferred stores will earn you 2 to 4 miles (3.2 to 6.4 km) per dollar spent Assuming you spend 1,000 dollars a month, you can earn up to 3,000 miles (4,800 km) just by going through their websites. The products cost the same. Do all your shopping through the airline malls simply to enjoy the benefits of the extra miles.

Select an airline.,
Understand the airline rules.,
Choose your favorite seat.,
Keep carry-on luggage light.,
Wear comfortable clothes.,
Bring a blanket and pillow.,
Pack snacks and a drink.,
Wear noise-canceling headphones.,
Visit the restroom before getting on the plane.",How to Fly Comfortably in Economy Class," Your choice of airlines depends on your location, your travel destination and connecting flights. Here are some things to think about when selecting an airline:


Layovers between connecting flights. How much time do you want to spend hanging out in an airport?
Airport services. Airports offer a range of food and entertainment activities. When you're forced into a long layover, find an airport that has something you'd like to do. For example, at Chicago O'Hare airport, travelers can tour the airport's hydroponic vegetable garden.;
, Each airline has different rules about checked-in baggage and carry-on baggage. Check the airlines website before you travel to find out their weight and size restrictions. And, check to be sure you don't pack a prohibited item in your luggage.

, When you book your flight, choose your seat at the same time to be sure that you get the seat you want. Do you like to sit by the window? Or would you rather sit by the aisle? Here are some things to consider:


How does the airline board passengers? Are passengers boarded by row number with the back of the plane loaded first? Or, are people with window seats loaded first?
Do you need extra room to stretch your long legs? If you do, then an aisle seat or a seat in the emergency row may be your best choice.

, It's not easy lifting a heavy suitcase into the overhead bins and other travelers may not be willing to help. If you can't lift your carry-on, ask the ticket agent to check your baggage to your destination.

, Wear loose fitting clothes and slip-on shoes. Pack an extra sweater in case it gets cold inside the airplane.

, Long flights and overnight flights are a good time to catch up on your sleep. A small fleece blanket will keep you warm and fits in a small space. A neck pillow will give you a soft spot for your head and can be hung on a backpack.

, Instead of waiting for the flight crew to serve drinks and snacks, bring your own. Here are some ideas:


Nuts, dried fruit and trail mix. These snacks are easy to carry and don't make a mess. Avoid peanuts in consideration to other passengers.
Dark chocolate. Because chocolate makes everything better. Choose one that is labeled as 70% cacao or higher; these have less sugar.
Water. Buy a bottle of water from an airport vendor before boarding the plane. Take a sip every now and then during your flight to keep hydrated.
Cough drops. These will help relieve that itchy feeling from the dry air in the cabin.
Chewing gum. This will help keep your ears from popping when the plane takes off and lands.

, Listening to the airplane engines and the passengers can be distracting. A good pair of noise-canceling headphones will block the noise so you can watch a movie, read a book or go to sleep.

, Before it is time to board your plane, visit the airport restroom and freshen up. This way, you'll avoid the hassle of crawling over other passengers and waiting in line to use a cramped and smelly airplane toilet.

A list of plane friendly meals can be found here: http://www.thekitchn.com/travel-food-10-meals-you-can-c-149739.;
, To avoid any issues at airport security, you should wrap sandwiches in parchment paper, not tin foil, as security may require you to unwrap the sandwich if it is in foil. You should also store salads in plastic containers with airtight lids so they do not spill and are easy to identify in your luggage as you go through airport security.Make sure you remember to pack plastic utensils for your meals, especially for salads. You should also store all food in clear plastic bags so that if it spills, it does not get all over your carry on bag.

, Cut up watermelon, apples, oranges, or bananas and pack them in plastic containers for easy access on the flight.

Look for a healthy snack bar in the terminal.,
Select fresh fruits and vegetables.,
Buy snacks high in lean protein and whole grains.",How to Eat Healthy when Flying2," Most airports now offer healthy snack bars in the terminal or at least an aisle of healthy snack foods at small stands by the boarding gates. Do a quick walk around for a place that offers healthy food options.Though it may be tempting to go into the airport bar and order a burger, fries, and a drink, eating unhealthy before a flight can lead to indigestion, dehydration, and a serious case of jet lag when you deboard the plane. Instead, focus on healthy food options in the airport and go for these options while you wait to board your plane.
You can also look for juice bars that offer healthy fruit drinks and blended vegetable drinks that are high in nutrients and will keep you hydrated. Be wary of any added sugars in these drinks.

, If you can find a healthy snack bar, look for pre packaged fresh fruits and vegetables, such as apple slices, carrot slices, celery slices, or orange slices.

Choose nuts as your snack option.,
Avoid pasta, bread, and meals with refined carbohydrates.,
Skip packaged sauces and dressings.,
Drink lots of water while you fly.,
Have herbal tea, instead of coffee or soda.",How to Eat Healthy when Flying3," For shorter flights, you may be offered a snack option like raw nuts or pretzels. Try to go for the nut option, as it has a higher protein content than pretzels. It will likely contain salt, however, so you should make sure you drink a lot of water with your nuts while on the plane., Often, your food options on the plane will not be very healthy or nutritious, full of refined carbohydrates that will end up making you feel fatigued or low energy. Instead of having the pasta or bread option, choose the vegetarian option or the vegetable heavy option.If fish is offered on the menu, you may want to go for this option, as fish is a lean protein that will be easier for your body to digest.

, There is often a lot of sugar, preservatives and artificial flavorings in the packaged sauces and dressings given to you on the plane as part of your in flight meal. Try to avoid these options and keep your food fresh and preservative free., Use a filtered water bottle or ask for bottled water on the flight, as the tap water on your flight may not be safe to drink. Try to have at least 8 ounces of water for every hour you are in the air., Opt for herbal teas that are caffeine free and skip coffee or sodas, as well as alcoholic beverages. These beverages can dehydrate you further. Instead, opt for herbal tea or plain hot water."

If you have flexibility in the schedule, you can take advantage of the biggest offers and discounts.;
, Choose a travel website that offers details of flights, hotels, holiday packages and offers. Leading travel websites also help with visa procedures.

Number of passengers. You would need to fill the number of adults, children and infants traveling together, since all three categories may have different airfares.
Once all the information has been filled, you can click on Search or Find Flights

, Once you have identified a travel website that gives comprehensive information, you should consider factors like departure time, arrival time, duration of the flight, whether or not there it is a direct flight, which airlines are servicing that segment and, of course, price.

, Typically, a good travel website displays the search results sorted by Price. However, you should consider your priorities and sort the search results accordingly.

, Check to see if the portal allows you to filter all the flight details based on certain parameters. For instance, if you have a budget, you can filter the search to display only those results that cost less than the price specified by you. You may also choose other filters, like departure time, duration of flight, refundable tickets only, business class only or some airlines that you prefer.

, India has a number of leading airline companies servicing the domestic segment. Since there is a lot of competition, each airline offers something unique. If their offer and your special requirements match, it would be easier to make a choice. For instance, Air India allows hand baggage weighing up to 8 kgs, while other airlines usually allow up to 7kgs. Similarly, Indigo and Spicejet are low-cost airlines, while Air Vistara has comfort of flying as the primary objective.

, A travel website not only gives you comprehensive information and allows you to filter the results, but it also offers some of the best deals and discounts. If you've already planned the destination and schedule of your travel, booking hotels and flights together can make it more economical. If, on the other hand, your travel plans have more flexibility, you can look for attractive packages, like Goa packages. Some of these packages include travel, accommodation, meals and sightseeing. You can even choose multiple destinations with packages like Himachal Pradesh packages5, which would include a visit to the most popular cities and towns of this spectacular state.

, Once you have found something attractive, make the booking immediately. Offers and deals expire and you may not have another chance at getting a good discount.

, Some travel websites allow you to add travel insurance while paying for the flight tickets or holiday packages.

, Before your flight tickets are booked, you would be asked to fill up the personal details of all the travelers. Ensure that all the fields are filled and the information is correct. Some of this information will be printed on your ticket, so it is best to double check after filling all the fields.

, Choose one that is most convenient for you.

, Once your payment has been made, your ticket is sent to your email ID. There is no need to take a printout of the ticket. If you have a smartphone and can access your emails on it, you can simply show this e-ticket at the airport.

, After your booking is confirmed, check the flight details on the ticket. You should also check other things like how many hours prior to the departure time do you need to be at the airport and if there are any restrictions on things you can carry with you.

, Your credit card account should offer the option to search for flights that are purchasable with reward miles. Most credit cards will have limitations based on airlines, dates of travel, and destination, so you may have to search a little while and possibly compromise to choose a flight that works for you.


Your card may offer the option to use some of the points rather than all of them. For example, if you are purchasing a $400 ticket, you might use just enough points to pay for half of the price.
During the payment stage, look for an option about redeeming points. There should be a box where you can input how many points you want to use, or perhaps a checkbox that says “Use points for whole price,” or something similar.

Once you have selected your ticket(s), the site will automatically move you onto the payment stage and you’ll be asked to input your information.

, Each credit card, airline, or flight aggregator site may offer slightly different payment options. When you get to the payment stage, you may have to log into airline or aggregator accounts if you have not already.

A list will be generated showing results across a number of different airlines. The results can usually be organized by price. Price may be affected by a number of variables including the number of stops made, the destination or departure airport and the proximity to the date of travel.

, If you have an airline that you prefer you can book tickets online in much the same manner as on any of these travel websites. The disadvantage of this method is that you won't be able to compare prices or routes across different airlines.

, You can choose where you want to sit on the aircraft, but be mindful that some seats cost extra (e.g. front row seats and over wing exit seats), as they have extra legroom. Also if you choose not to have allocated seating, you may end up getting what's left on the day you travel, which can mean getting split up or getting the worst seats on the aircraft (e.g. The last row in the cabin with limited recline and behind the toilets.)., Snacks and drinks are often overpriced on board aircraft on low cost airlines. But you'll have to buy your own drinks after security at the airport, due to the worldwide liquids ban in hand luggage (before security).

Figure out your schedule.,
Calculate how long you will need to park.,
Determine how much you can pay.,
Call for more information.,
Think about the safety of the lot.,
Park close to the terminal, if you can.,
Have a backup plan.,
Leave your home with enough time.,
Choose your spot.",How to Choose Airport Parking," When choosing parking, you need to figure out your schedule, flight time, and general itinerary. Without this information, you won’t be equipped to choose a parking lot.


Locate the time of your departure and arrival. From this information, you’ll be able to determine how long you will need to park your car for.
Know the day of your departure and arrival. This may be important, as parking might be limited on peak travel days like Friday and Sunday. Thus, if you plan to travel at a busy time, you may need to consider an off-airport lot or keep a backup lot in mind.;
, The length of time you’ll leave your car in airport parking is also an important factor in choosing a place to park. This is because different parking lots and services are geared toward different amounts of time.


Hourly parking is great if you’re just dropping someone off at the airport and want to escort them to security check point. Very often, this parking is available from one to three hours.
Short term parking provides parking over the course of a day or even several days. This is best if you’ll park your car for less than two days.
Long term parking is parking for more than one or two days. Long term parking is best for people who need to park their car for several days, a week, or even longer.

, Cost is a major factor to consider when choosing airport parking. This is especially true if you are in a city or will be parking your vehicle for a week or more.


The price of long-term parking at on-site lots at smaller regional airports range from $8 to $16 a day. The cost at major airports like Los Angeles International can top $30.
Off-site airport parking at lots not affiliated with airports can be substantially cheaper. In Atlanta, you may find parking as cheap as $6 a day. However, make sure to consider safety and transportation to the terminal.
For people who need different options, the cost of short-term parking is about a dollar per hour at many regional air ports, and $3 or $4 an hour at major airports like Los Angeles International.
You should also consider ""Park and Ride"" options in your community. You may be able to park for free or inexpensively, and then use mass transit to get to the airport., When it comes to picking your parking lot, you may just want to call the lot or whoever is responsible for maintaining the lot. By calling, you’ll be able to gather important information that you may need when evaluating the lot.


Inquire as to whether you can reserve a spot.
Ask about the general availability of parking for the time you’ll need a spot. For instance, if you need to park your car from 10am on a Friday to 1pm on a Sunday, ask about how busy the lot is on the weekends.
Get exact directions, or ask if there is anything tricky about accessing the parking lot.
Find out about methods of payment. In the past, many lots only accepted cash. Over the last decade, though, many airport parking lots have begun to accept credit or debit cards., When it comes to picking a lot, you need to consider its safety. This is important, as you want to make sure that you or your vehicle are not exposed to crime.


Drive by the parking lot in advance, if you can. From driving by, you’ll be able to see if there are a lot of people loitering or if there is a police presence. If there are a lot of police around, this may be an indication that crime at the lot is relatively regular.
Plug the address of the parking lot into your local law enforcement’s crime record website. By doing this, you’ll see if any crimes have been reported in or near the parking lot. If there are a lot of robberies, grand theft auto, or other similar crimes reported, you should consider a different lot.
Conceal all valuables you may have in your car., Finally, when it comes to picking a lot, you’ll want to think about how close it is to the terminal. This is important, because depending on your schedule and psychical condition, it may be a major factor.


If the parking lot is off-location from the airport, meaning it is not on an adjacent piece of land, you need to think about transportation to the terminal. In many cases, the parking lot will offer a complimentary shuttle to the terminal. Make sure to factor this time into your schedule.
If the parking lot is on-location, but is far removed from the terminal, you’ll have to walk with your luggage to the terminal or take a shuttle. If you choose to walk, be prepared for a walk up to 10 minutes or even more.

, You should have a backup plan of where you’ll park just in case the lot you intend to park is full. This is especially important during busy travel times like the winter holiday season and during the summer.


Familiarize yourself with one of the other lots you investigated when choosing your lot.
Know the address of the lot and how to access it.
Carry cash on you, just in case that is a cash only lot.
Consider parking at long term parking provided by your community’s mass transportation system and then using mass transit to get to the airport., When it comes to parking before your flight, you’ll have to make sure to leave your home with enough time for you to get a spot and then make your way through security to your gate. Without providing yourself enough time, your parking may not run smoothly and you may be late for your flight.


Use popular websites like MapQuest or Google Maps to estimate the time from the airport to the parking lot.
When estimating driving time to the airport, add thirty minutes in case something goes wrong. If you live in a city with bad traffic, consider adding more.
Factor in time it may take to find a spot in the parking lot and then to walk from your car to the terminal.
Make sure to add in time it takes to check your bags, move through security, and walk to your gate.
For domestic flights at major airports, make sure you arrive at the airport two hours early. For regional airports, consider an hour or an hour and a half. For international flights, consider two and a half hours or more.
If you are picking an off-site parking lot, build time in for extra time it may take to get from your spot to the terminal., The spot you choose is also very important. This is not only because of its proximity to the terminal or to a shuttle, but because your car will be there for so long.


The closest spot is not always the best.
Park near a light, in case you return at night time.
Try to park in an over-sized spot or an end spot, so you can minimize the chance of your car being hit or dinged by someone else.
Find a spot close to a breezeway or in a garage. You’ll thank yourself if it’s raining or snowing when you return.
Write down your spot. As some parking lots are extremely large and confusing, make sure to write down the spot number and the section of the parking lot. This will save you a lot of time when you return for your car."

BWI is just slightly outside of Washington and has excellent transportation into the city from the airport.

, How much a flight costs varies greatly depending on many variables including the day you book, how far in advance you book, and even the website on which you book.By comparing prices from different sites, you are likely to get the best flight deal.


Book approximately six weeks in advance if you can.

Rear-facing and infant car seats clip into bases that are secured in cars. Some car seats work well without the base, and for some it is required.


Decide if you will bring the base on your trip. It is an extra hassle and a large item to take care of, but can be safer if you plan on spending a long time in the car.
For convertible car seats for older children, you generally have no option but to bring the entire thing.;
, An airline representative should be able to answer your questions and offer suggestions.


Some airlines treat car seats like carry-on luggage, some will let you check it for free, and some consider it part of the regular checked luggage allotment and will charge a fee.
Many airlines consider car seats to be fragile items and don’t accept liability for any damage. Find the airline car seat policy online and bring a printed copy with you to the airport to clarify if there are any issues.
Based on the airline guidelines, you can decide between the three options for checking a car seat: luggage check, gate check, or to bring it on the plane.

, A popular option is to check the car seat at the main reservation desk and pick it up on the baggage claim carousel at your destination. Checking the car seat as luggage is a simple solution because you don’t have to worry about hauling it through the airport or putting it through a metal detector at security.

, The downside is that checked luggage can get jostled around and an oddly shaped car seat can easily be damaged, making it less safe and effective for your children to use.


Protect the car seat by wrapping it in bubble wrap or placing it in a large box. At the very least, put it in a large plastic bag to keep it dry and (hopefully) free from scrapes.

, Make sure it is properly labeled with your contact information and stickers marking it as fragile.

, Checking your car seat at the gate allows you to bring it with you all the way to the gate and check it right before you get on the plane. Most airlines allow baby items to be gate checked for free, but double check with your airline to be sure.


Gate checking is only available for domestic flights, and is great for smaller babies who sit in their car seat clipped into a stroller.
It also potentially minimizes the amount of damage to the car seat because it is the last thing on the plane and the first thing off, plus it avoids being put through baggage claim.
However, checking items at the gate means you have to bring them through security, which can be an ordeal.

, They will print a baggage claim label and provide a color-coded gate check ticket. You then bring the car seat to the bottom of the jet way and leave it at the end of the ramp right before you get on the plane.

, Gate check items are brought to end of the ramp (the same place you dropped it off) when you reach your destination. Most airlines are quick about bringing out gate check items, but you might have to wait on the ramp for a few minutes if you are quick off the plane. .

, If you want to avoid the unknown of checking a car seat, you can bring it with you on the airplane. The major downside of this is that you will need to buy a ticket for a child under two to guarantee they have their own seat for the car seat.


If you don’t buy a ticket and bring your child on the plane as a lap child, you will have to wait to see if there are empty seats before you can use the car seat.

, The advantage of bringing the car seat on the plane is that it is safer, especially for infants.


It also frees up space and allows parents to enjoy the flight or help other children instead of having a baby on their lap.
You also have the car seat as soon as you get to the destination and don’t have to wait or worry about damage.

, To bring a car seat on the plane, make sure it is clearly marked as bring FAA approved. Don’t worry, almost all major car seats fall into this category.

, Be flexible and aware of the rules regarding having a car seat on the plane, because some flight attendants may make you move to a different seat.


In general, car seats aren’t allowed in exit rows and are placed in window seats to avoid blocking other passengers.

, If you gate checked or luggage checked your car seat, getting them when you get off the plane should be your top priority. Many car seats look alike, so make sure the car seat is actually yours before you take it away.

, If there is any damage to the car seat, try reporting it to the airline. However, it most cases the airlines are not liable for damages to fragile items such as car seats and strollers.

Pack everything you need in advance.,
If possible, check in online.,
Arrive early.,
Know where your gate is.,
Stay calm.,
Follow instructions from airline and airport staff.",How to Avoid Missing a Flight," The morning of a midday flight is not the time to start packing your luggage. Start preparing several days ahead or longer, to ensure you pack all that you will need and have time to buy or replace an item should you be missing something.


Most airports have small ""general"" stores or kiosks where you can buy commonly misplaced luggage items, though often at much higher prices than average. Still, this can be a reasonable solution should you forget an item you wanted to pack.
Adhere to all rules and restrictions about baggage. You do not want to get stuck paying airline baggage fees should your bags not comply with the rules.;
, An increasing number of airlines offer services where you can check in for your flight online, typically effective from 24 hours before your departure time. This method saves time at the airport, and you won't be as rushed.

, Make an effort to get to the airport on time, as you will have more time to get your tickets and everything you need to do ready to go. You should plan to be there no less than 2 hours before your scheduled flight. When you have everything ready for your flight, be patient, as there may be a long line heading into the plane.

,


When people start boarding, it is a good idea to hurry and get your bags checked and get on the plane. If you do not know where your plane is, how can you be ready to leave?

,


Various obstacles may affect your flight, including weather delays, mechanical problems, and many other problems may go wrong before you board. Be patient, and ready to board the plane.

,


The staff will most help you in telling you where your flight is, and what to do next, so it is always a good idea to listen to officials. Not only is this right, it is also expected and usually enforced.

Choose to add insurance or not.,
Book your ticket!,
Receive your confirmation and receipt.",How to Book an Airline Ticket2," The best time to book a domestic flight is between 112 and 21 days before you depart to secure the lowest fare. 54 days before is considered the perfect time. However, even booking 54 days before your trip is not guaranteed to get you the lowest fare.If you are booking an international plane ticket, you should book as far in advance as possible, especially if your destination is smaller or only has one nearby airport.If you are flying to a popular destination during a popular time, such as Florida during Spring Break, you should book as far in advance as possible. Because this flight is popular, it is unlikely that the fare will be lowered., Before booking, scan an airfare deal website, like Airfare Watch Dog, for sales. This is especially helpful if your destination or trip dates are flexible so you can take advantage of any deals.


Airlines sometimes share sales with their customers through their websites or newsletters. You can subscribe to the newsletters of your top airlines or visit their sites to search for deals.

, Visit an aggregator website that searches multiple airlines, like SkyScanner, Momondo or GoogleFlights, and enter your trip information. The website will be able to show you lots of flight options for your requested destination and dates that you can sort by price, airline or length of trip.Many aggregator sites will allow you to enter multiple destinations and search flights on multiple dates. This will help you find the best deal if your trip is flexible.
If you have time, check a few aggregator websites. Some sites may advertise different prices so it’s good to check around and ensure you’re getting the best deal., Many flights, especially to far away locations, will require you to make stopovers at airports along the way. Sometimes these will involve changing planes and going through security again. As you look at flights, remember to keep in mind how many stops you are comfortable making. Also check how long and what time of day the stops are.


You may be able to find a cheaper flight if you're comfortable adding an extra stopover. However, it's important to take into account if the length and time of the stopover is worth the money you will save.

, Once you have found the best trip, select it on the aggregator ste and move to the airline’s direct website to book your tickets. Some aggregators allow you to book the ticket through their website, but there may be an additional service fee., Many airlines will allow you to choose your seat at your time of booking. Ensure you choose seats for all of the passengers that you're booking airline tickets for. You can select to sit together, if there is space for your party, and whether you want an aisle, window or middle seat. You may also be able to select seat upgrades, like extra legroom, for an additional cost.


If you're airline does not allow you to select your seat at the time of booking, you may be able to do it when you check in. If you have a specific seat preference or need to sit with your travel companions, for example if you're traveling with a child, call your airline to see how you can make arrangements ahead of time.

, Towards the end of the booking process, your airline may suggest add-ons that you can book, such as hotels or car rentals. You can add these at the time of booking or book them separately from your airline ticket.


Before choosing an add-on like a hotel stay or car rental, you should do some research online and ensure your airline is offering you a good deal.

, If you require any special accommodations for your flight, such as a wheelchair, request these at the time of booking. If you are not prompted to enter this information during your online booking, call your airline directly.


Other special accommodations may include traveling with service animals, medical concerns and dietary restrictions.

, During the booking process, you may also be prompted to add insurance. Read the fine print and decide whether or not your flight and trip require insurance.


You might be covered by insurance through your work, healthcare or credit card. It's a good idea to look into these options and compare costs if you want to add insurance coverage for your trip.

, On the airline’s website, confirm that all of your trip information is correct. Then follow the prompts to enter your personal and payment information to finish booking your tickets. You may also need the personal information of anyone else flying with you.

, After booking, your receipt and ticket confirmation should be emailed to you. If you don’t receive this within a few hours of booking, contact your airline.

, Ask your friends and family for recommendations if you haven’t worked with a travel agent before. If you can’t get a personal recommendation, search online for a travel agency with good reviews., Depending on the travel agency, you may be able to go in-person or you may work with someone over the phone. Ensure your travel agent is knowledgeable, friendly and service-oriented. They should be able to answer all of your questions and have experience booking similar trips to the one you want to go on.

, Provide your travel agent with the destination and dates of your trip. If you are flexible with nearby destinations, multiple stopovers or similar dates, ensure you tell your travel agent that information.


Also let your travel agent know about your preferences and any required accommodations.

Check in at the airport kiosk.,
Check in early.,
Get bumped!,
Find discounted tickets.,
Plan long-term.,
Book directly with the airline.,
Buy a full fare coach ticket and ask for a first class seat.,
Shop around.",How to Get an Upgrade to First Class1," This is by far the easiest, most sure-fire way to get an upgrade. However, unless you fly often with the airline and have earned elite status, it's also the most expensive way to enjoy the perks of first class.;
, Airlines categorize their customers based on how often they fly—or more to the point, how much they spend!


At 50k miles a year, you are in the middle of the ""elite"" zone, a position that makes you important to the airline. You'll be rewarded with various perks along the way—from quick check-ins, to bonus miles, to first-class upgrades.
If you don't normally travel a lot for business or pleasure, consider ""mileage running."" This is the process of finding cheap, long flights and taking them whenever possible. The destination is not important—only the distance. A good rule of thumb for determining if a mileage run is worth it is if the price-per-mile cost is $.02 or below. Check out online resources such as Farecompare for prices and opportunities.You might also consider whether you fly frequently enough to maintain elite status.

, Arrive at the airport a couple hours early, and check in using the airline's kiosk. You will be able to modify your seat assignment as available, and if there are any first-class seats available, you may be able to purchase an upgrade at a significantly reduced cost.

, When there is one upgrade available and two elite flyers are requesting it, all else being equal: the one who checks in first gets it. You must have elite status with the airline for this to work.

, Take advantage of opportunities that arise during the normal course of travel. All airlines over-book flights, and sometimes, when they least expect it, everybody shows up for the flight. When that happens, they have to find people willing to be bumped from that flight. That could be you!


If the flight is very overbooked, your bargaining position is strong. Approach the gate agent, and be as genuinely charming and sympathetic as you can be. Ask them if they would consider rebooking you in return for an upgrade voucher in addition to whatever other incentives they might be offering.
This will be more likely to work if you don't have checked baggage, which would entail much more work on the part of the airlines in order to bump you.

, Some airlines have relaxed upgrade policies for full-fare coach tickets. You may also have friends who have upgrade vouchers they may be willing to sell.

, If you are a regular flier, are considering doing mileage runs, and are planning a big trip that you want to enjoy in first-class style, you can also purchase miles directly from the airlines.


Visit your airline's website, and locate the ""Purchase Miles"" page, generally located in the frequent-flier part of the site.
Enter your account number, and how many miles you wish to purchase.

, When you book directly with the airline, there is the possibility of also adding an OSI (Other Significant Information) notation to your record.


Based on that, ask about the possibility of an upgrade to first class. If you are a travel agent, travel writer, event planner, or captain of industry, it certainly won’t hurt your chances!

, Many airlines have a fare code that automatically grants first class privileges, but you have to ask. Call the airline directly and ask them how much a coach class ticket with first class seating privilege will cost. This will be much less than a first class ticket. Be careful though, like most coach tickets it will probably be non-refundable.

, Reward airlines that have reasonable prices for business-class travel. As with any airline, if you fly frequently, they appreciate your business, and a struggling upstart might appreciate your business even more.

Check a bag.,
Pack only what you need.,
Lay out what you are packing.,
Double-check for prohibited items.,
Avoid large objects.",How to Pack to Get Through Airport Security Fast1," A checked bag will allow you to bring more with you, and you will have to carry less in your carry-on. Put as much as you can in the checked bag instead of your carry-on. The less you bring in your carry-on, the less likely you are to be pulled for a bag search.Clothing, toiletries, and souvenirs can all be packed in a checked-bag.
Pack books in a checked bag unless you are planning on reading them on the plane.
Electronics, like cameras and laptops, and valuable possessions, like jewelry, should always be packed in a carry-on.;
, You should only put necessities in your carry-on. If you have too much in the bag, the security agents may not be able to use the X-ray properly, and it can increase your chances of being stopped for a bag search.Things you need may include:


Phone
Laptop/Tablet
Camera
Chargers
Magazine or book for the plane
Medication
Food or milk for young children
Extra set of clothing in case your checked bag is lost

, Before you pack your carry-on, lay out everything that you are planning to bring. You can do this on a bed, desk, or table. This will allow you to see if you are bringing too much, and it will help you organize your belongings in the most efficient fashion. It can also help you notice if you forgot anything.


When laying things out, keep similar things together. For example, stack all of your clothes together while placing any chargers with their appropriate electronics.
Make sure that you have your ID, passport (if travelling internationally), and ticket ready to go.

, Some objects can only be checked on an airplane while others are prohibited entirely. Always double-check that you are not bringing these items onto the plane. If you are caught with one of them, you may be delayed.


Bleach, lighter fluid, gasoline, aerosol cans, or any other flammable or explosive material are all forbidden from planes.
Weapons (like guns, Tasers, and knives), sporting equipment (like baseball bats, golf clubs, or ski poles), and electronic cigarettes must all be placed in a checked bag., Big, oddly shaped items are not technically prohibited, but they can get your bag pulled from the x-ray for a manual search. If you must bring items like this, pack them in a checked bag, or remove them before going through security.Some things you may want to watch out for include:


Large electronics, like Xboxes, portable DVD players, or CPAP machines
Bulky books, manuals, or dictionaries
Large crystals like geodes
Dense metallic objects

Book with a Travel Agent.,
Use a mileage broker.,
Ask the ticket counter agent nicely.,
If you were late because of a partner airline, make sure the airline is aware of that: it is their fault and they need to fix it.,
If you happen to be a travel agent, show your Iata or ARC ID.,
Ask a flight attendant for an upgrade if you see a seat available.,
Get to know the airline employees you deal with regularly.,
Look the part.",How to Get an Upgrade to First Class2," Agents are routinely allotted a certain number of upgrade vouchers. This will not come free but you can persuade your agent for a business class flight voucher if they have any available.


If you're not a frequent user of a particular travel agent, they have very little incentive to try to get you an upgrade. Whatever discretionary vouchers they may have will most certainly go to the people who have contributed the most to their agency.
Travel agents have much less input regarding your status now than they used to. Your seat assignments are done via computer now, and computers don't take into account notes that a travel agent may have added to your record. Computers are quite content to simply count the miles and use your earned status.

, Mileage brokers buy mileage from frequent fliers, and resell those miles to other travelers.


This is very risky. Airlines have very strict policies against buying frequent flier miles from a 3rd party. If they catch you doing this, you will likely lose your ticket, and you may also lose all your miles, earned or purchased.
As a result of strict policies, brokers are hard to come by.

, This will almost never work. In most cases, on most airlines, the ticket agent is not authorized to upgrade. Only the manager is, so if there is only one person at the ticketing counter, you are talking to them.


You will most likely need to use miles to get your upgrade. However, you might be able to ask the ticket counter agent to kindly add a code to your ticket. That signifies to the gate agent that you are potentially eligible for an upgrade.
You have a better chance with international airlines.

, Both airlines need to be on the same E-ticket number, so both airlines are responsible for getting you to your destination. If they can't get you to your destination on time, that's a great time to ask—as nicely as possible—for another flight, plus an upgrade voucher for your troubles.

, Again, if and only if seats are available will an airline offer a free upgrade and even though a travel agent might have some pull (this pull ended in the late 90's), you always have to assume that frequent flyer status will help more than just travel agent status. If you have both, you will only improve your chances of an upgrade. It certainly does not hurt to try.

, Typically flight attendants never upgrade passengers and simply asking for an upgrade is not going to work. However, there are legitimate reasons why a flight attendant might upgrade you. Here are a few:


A problem with your seat. In some cases where your seat has malfunctioned and you cannot comfortably sit there, i.e. a seat-belt problem or the seat will not stay in the up position, the flight attendant will make an attempt to find you another seat. If no other seats are available in coach yet space is available in first, you may be moved to first class. However, this is a very rare occurrence, and you should never try to purposely break your seat. Also note that if there is an elite flier in coach, they may get the bump to first class, and you would take the elite member's old seat.
Choose Seats at the bulkhead, where families with children get seated. This can result in an upgrades if they need your seat, which they often do.
A problem with a fellow passenger. If by chance you are sitting next to a passenger and you have a legitimate complaint such as harassment, the flight attendant can, at their discretion, move you to another seat. If there are only seats available in first class, up you go!

, Do you fly in and out of a certain airport regularly? If so, getting to know the agents you deal with often yields rewards. When a delay occurs, you could be the first person they think of to upgrade, or at least put to on a better flight. They will appreciate your loyalty and friendship, and will accommodate you accordingly.

, Dress like a business executive and at the very least, business casual. This means no jeans, athletic shoes or wear or other very casual attire. Looking like a first class passenger helps. Airlines are more willing to upgrade passengers who look as though they will fit in with those who willingly paid the extra money. You may also be able to get a seat in business class.


Be aware that most upgrades are not based on looks, but on status. If you don't travel frequently but look like an MBA all-star, and the choice is between you and a sloppy-looking but extremely well-traveled NBA all-star, your Gucci's just won't count.

Pack clothing on the bottom.,
Put your liquids in a plastic bag.,
Place electronics and liquids on top.,
Stick documents and money in the outside pockets.,
Organize everything neatly.",How to Pack to Get Through Airport Security Fast2," If you are packing clothing in your carry-on, you should fold or roll each item. Place clothing on the bottom of your bag. If you have any other items that you will not need until you land, place them with the clothing., Even if your local airport offers plastic bags, you should pack your own liquids ahead of time. Find a one-quart clear plastic bag. Containers for liquids must be no larger than 3.4 ounces or 100 ml, and they must fit into the plastic bag.If the containers are larger than 3.4 ounces, they must be placed in a checked bag, even if the amount of liquid inside is less than that amount.
Instead of buying travel sized versions of your toiletries, you can purchase reusable travel-sized bottles. Fill these up at home with your favorite shampoo, conditioner, soap, and other toiletries.

, Laptops and liquids must be removed when going through security. To remove these as quickly as possible, place these items at the top of your bag. Make sure that they are easy to access so that you can pull them out quickly., You will need to have your documents and wallet handy. They cannot be placed in your pockets as you go through security. Put your wallet and documents in an outer pocket of your luggage. You can pull out your ID and ticket when you need it to go through security.If you are bringing a purse or briefcase as an extra personal item, you can put your ID and ticket in there, but make sure that you can pull it out quickly. You do not want to have to rummage through your bag to find your ticket.

, Well-organized bags allow security to look through your bag quickly on the x-ray. When placing items in your bag, make sure that they are neatly stacked and arranged.Clothing should be folded. You can buy packing cubes to help keep clothing from crumpling in your bag.
Wind up chargers, and stick them next to the electronics.
Books should be stacked together.
Large electronics such as laptops must be removed before being placed in the x-ray. If you place the electronics near the top of your bag, you can quickly remove them without messing up the rest of your luggage.

Measure the bag.,
Look for a TSA-compliant laptop bag.,
Bring a small personal item.",How to Pack to Get Through Airport Security Fast3," Airlines have specific regulations for how large your carry-on bag can be. If your bag is too big, it may be stopped at security or at the gate. Check with your airline to see what their size limit is, and measure your bag to make sure it will fit.


While each airline may have its own regulations, most limit you to a piece of luggage that is 45 linear inches or about 115 linear centimeters. This means that the total height, width, and length of the bag equals either 45 inches or 115 centimeters.You should always measure a bag before buying. Just because the label says that it is carry-on compliant doesn’t mean that it is., A TSA-compliant laptop bag should have a separate laptop compartment. If you put the laptop in this sleeve, you will not have to remove it when going through the X-ray. Nothing else can be put in this compartment. The computer's mouse and charger must be kept in a different pocket., Most airlines will allow you bring on a small personal item with your carry-on. These can give you extra space to pack. If they are large enough, you can put your liquids, documents, wallet, and laptop in this personal item, and keep items that do not need to be searched in your larger carry-on bag. Common personal items include:


Purse
Laptop bag
Briefcase

Research each airport you will be passing through so that you know how to recognize which scams are common there.Make sure to look into airports where you have layovers as well as your departing airport and destination.;
, While there are many currency exchange kiosks at airports, many of these charge high fees and others may misrepresent the actual exchange rate.If you need to exchange currency, you will have better luck if you do it at a bank or bureau de change before you leave.

, You should pack cash, a credit card, and checks, just in case you run into trouble while traveling. If your cash is stolen or your credit card compromised, you will still have a form of money on you.


You may want to keep your cash in separate places. Carry a separate coin purse or wallet with extra cash just in case., Pack your bags at home using your own luggage. Always make sure that you know exactly what is in your luggage at all times. You should not agree to carry packages for strangers on airlines.


If you are offered free luggage, as part of a raffle or special prize, be suspicious. Some scammers will sew drugs into the lining of these suitcases and expect you to smuggle the drugs for them., As you go into the airport, remember to stay alert at all times. Keep an eye and a hand on your luggage to avoid theft. Even once you are past security, stay on your guard.


If someone tries to sell you a sad story, be suspicious. Scammers often will make up sad stories to convince you to go along with their scam.

Do not accept another person’s luggage.,
Check-in your luggage at the desk.,
Hold onto your bags.,
Avoid giving money to panhandlers.,
Lock your own luggage storage.,
Keep your wallet and passport close.",How to Avoid Airport Scam Artists2," If a stranger asks you to carry a mysterious package for them on the plane, refuse. The package could contain drugs, weapons, or other illegal items. If the items are caught by security, you will take the blame. Instead, only carry your own possessions., You should only ever check your luggage in at a desk where there are uniformed agents and computers. If someone comes up to you while you are in the lobby or in line offering to check your bag for you, they may be trying to steal your luggage. They may act as though they are an official employee, or they may wear a similar uniform. Keep in mind that the only place where you can check a bag is at the desk., As you travel through the airport, always keep a firm grasp on your belongings. If you let go of it for a second, someone might steal it. Occasionally, scammers will place contraband or illegal substances in your bag as well.Never leave your baggage unattended at the airport, even for a second.

, Panhandlers can appear at the airport too. Someone might tell you a story about how they do not have the money for an overweight baggage fee, or they might need money for a taxi or bus. In most cases, they are a scam artist.The best response to this is, “Sorry, I don’t have any cash on me.” If they persist, say firmly, “I am not giving you money.”

, If you are using luggage lockers at the airport, you should be the only one handling the lock or luggage. Occasionally, a friendly stranger will be taking their luggage out of a locker and offer you the locker. They may try to help you lock up your luggage, but they will secretly take the real key and give you a fake. You will no longer have access to your luggage.If someone offers you help, politely refuse and say, “It’s all right. I can handle it myself.” If they insist, you can add, “Thank you, but I prefer to handle my own luggage and locker.”

, As you travel through the airport, keep your money and passport in a safe place. You may want to purchase a special money belt that goes under your clothes. You also tuck it in an inside pocket that only you can access. This will prevent thieves from getting to it.


Do not keep your wallet in your back pocket. This leaves it open to pickpockets."

Check the ID of your pick-up service.,
Travel only on licensed taxis.,
Insist that you go to your hotel.",How to Avoid Airport Scam Artists3," If you are being picked up at the airport, always check the ID and credentials of the person picking you up. Even if they are holding a sign with your name, it is good to double-check. Some scam artists will copy the signs of legitimate services and pick up their clients, only to take them to expensive hotels, where they force them to pay higher rates.You should ask, “Are you from the pick-up service? Do you mind if I check your ID?”

, Taxi drivers can sometimes work a number of scams. They might try to take you on a longer “scenic” route. They may try to convince you that their meter is broken, charging you an extremely high rate once you reach your destination. To reduce your chances of these scams, you should only take licensed taxis with working meters from the airport.Wait in the official taxi line, even if there are other taxis without a line. The taxi driver should have their license displayed on their window or by the driver’s seat.


You can ask, “Do you mind if I see your taxi certification?” In most places, they are required to show you it.
If you can’t find a cab with a working meter, agree on a price before you or your luggage goes into the cab., If you are going to a hotel from the airport, tell the taxi driver exactly where you want to go. If they try to tell you that the hotel is closed or overbooked, insist to be taken there anyways. The taxi driver may be trying to convince you to go to a different hotel where they receive a commission. These hotels often are scams in their own right.If they say, “That hotel is closed. Let me take you to another one,” you should say, “No. I want to see for myself. Take me to my hotel.”
If you are worried, you can call the hotel on your way. Use the number on your confirmation receipt; do not let the driver call on your behalf. Ask, “My driver says you are closed. Is that true?”

For example, a tablet computer, a book, a portable music player, a handheld games console, or maybe a puzzle book. A watch is also a must. Children can become extremely impatient waiting around, keep them amused and entertained with a coloring book, or possibly a story book and don't forget their favourite toy!;
, Being able to freshen up when trapped in a crowded airport can really make a difference and lift your mood. Be certain to carry your cell phone charger, it's always important to keep your phone charged up and ready to go. You may want to have a separate small backpack or purse to keep things that you can easily take out in the airport.

, In many cases, other people stuck in the airport are going to be facing more difficult challenges than you are. Offer to hold a baby, or play a game with a child of a bewildered mum. Get some food for a frail woman who might have trouble walking down the long corridor. Offer to let someone use your cellphone or your laptop to make contact with worried relatives or friends.

For example, in some airports you can find out about aircraft from the past, such as the world famous Concorde.

, There are thousands of magazines and books for sale at most airports. This is a good time to open your mind and learn something new.

, Most airport shops will carry puzzle books. Anything from word search to sudoku can keep you pleasantly amused for quite a while, as well as exercising your mind.

, Your portable media player can be a life saver. Play a game, listen to music, or watch a video. The only requirement is a fresh charging and plenty of data.

, Airports can be a decent place to find something to eat, and drink. There will be a wide variety of dishes available, from a traditional meal to a quick takeaway. You are also likely to find some more exotic foods available, so why not be daring and give them a try? Or, if you enjoy the atmosphere of a pub, you can sit down and relax with a meal and drink. For the people who need a drink, there will be plenty of places to find one. If you'd like to get a morning energy buzz at any time of day, see if they airport has a food location that serves coffee, such as Dunkin Donuts. Vending machines and dedicated bars are the best place to buy. However, prepared to spend quite a bit more than you normally would for any given dish.

, Most airports have at least one shop, but some major, international ones have multiple gift shops. Shopping inside an airport can also make you more relaxed for your flight. You can buy small little gifts for family and friends, or buy something for yourself.

, Internet is usually available in all airports, although it can come at a heavy price, although some airports, such as the Boston Logan International Airport will offer it for free. So, if you have some money, the Internet can make the time fly by. Why not check your emails, or play some games? You could even contribute to wikiHow! If you have children, allow them to play some games as well, as this will keep them entertained for a little while longer, and keep them relaxed before the flight., Some international airports now offer massages, manicures, pedicures, and other treats. For a decent price you will be able to feel fresh and relaxed for your flight. Another treat is to try to buy yourself a place in an airport lounge, where you can spend your time doing things you enjoy, such as playing snooker, having a drink at a bar, or going for a dip in a jacuzzi. Although it can be pricey, if you can afford it, it will make your day.

, Talking is also another great time killer. Thousands of people use an airport every day, so you are definitely going to find someone to start a conversation with. If you are nervous about this, simply asking, ""Where are you flying to?"" will start a great conversation. Sometimes you can meet great people at airports. It is always handy to have friends in another part of the country, or even the world.

, Going through the travel plan with the rest of your party will not only pass time, but reassure everyone that everything is going smoothly, and that you are all going to have a great time. This can also start conversations with other people, who may join in your conversation.

, If you are in the airport because you have just completed a vacation, and maybe you met interesting people or took a tour of some interesting facilities or visited a beautiful beach. You probably learned a lot and have many details fresh in your mind. Why not use the opportunity to make some detailed notes about your experiences? You will never remember them as clearly as you do right now. If you are with some of your traveling companions, this airport downtime will present you with a nice opportunity to talk with them about the details of the trip as you are writing. When you get home you can add your notes to a journal, or a scrapbook, or perhaps blog about them. But more importantly, using your airport time to write will help you decompress or debrief about your trip.

, Take along a small knitting, crocheting, or other needlework project. Have a photocopy of the pattern, or use a pattern that is easily memorized. Most airlines allow knitting needles and crochet hooks on their planes. Teach your child to knit, crochet, embroider, or make other simple yarn projects.

, Take a deck of cards to the airport and play poker or other card games with your fellow friends or passengers (Always works).

Pack as little as possible for the flight.,
Don't be unprepared on a long flight.,
Enjoy your flight!",How to Enjoy Flying Solo as a Passenger," After you've decided on an airline and where you'll be headed, visit their website or give their reservations department a call. You will often find the cheapest rates if you book an economy class seat on a midweek flight, or better yet, a red-eye flight. Additionally, because of the fact that you are traveling alone, this will cut down the costs of your ticket considerably.;
, For example, a mid-morning weekend flight to Orlando, Florida will almost certainly be full of children and their families. If possible, try to fly during the following times:


Midweek (e.g. Tuesday, Wednesday)
Early morning, evening and nighttime
During the school year (September - June)
If your flight offers business class seating, you may find it useful to spend the extra dollars for the convenience of traveling with other adults.

, If you'd normally have to take two carry-on bags when flying with family, take only one. A small handbag that can be slung across your shoulder is adequate, as it weighs little and can be easily stowed under your seat. Make sure to have all other luggage checked; if you choose not to, you'll have to store it out of reach in the overhead compartments and possibly pay extra for the increased baggage size.

, It goes without saying that you should have a few items to keep you entertained during the ride. A few useful items to consider are

An iPod for music, games, and more
A laptop






Books, magazines, other reading material







, Flying solo is a great opportunity to relax, have fun and explore new places.

If possible, avoid the potential of being stranded on a plane.,
Understand that your rights as a passenger are very limited.,
Keep your cool.,
Pass the time.,
Resist the urge to use the restroom.,
When you are eventually permitted to deplane, take reasonable action against the airline for your trouble.",How to Cope When Stranded on a Plane," Frequently monitor weather conditions at your departure airport as well as at your destination to ensure that you're aware of any possible conditions that can keep planes grounded. This includes snow, ice storms, thunderstorms, heavy rain, heavy fog, etc. If any of these conditions are impacting the airport or your destination, try these solutions:


See if there are any later flights on the same airline to your destination. If the flight is cancelled or suffers a lengthy delay before boarding, you may be able to change flights for little to no cost (depending on the class and airline policies).
Have a ticket agent check for flights to your destination on different airlines. While a last-minute booking on a new airline may cost you more, if it is the only option available in the next few hours or even days, take advantage of the opportunity.
As a last resort, wait out the inclement weather conditions. In the unusual event that your flight is boarding at the onset of a slow-moving storm, the chances of it being delayed on the tarmac are very likely. It will be worth the inconvenience if the plane does get stranded and you waited behind in the terminal.;
, In the unfortunate event that you do end up stranded on a plane, in most cases, there is virtually nothing you can do in your benefit. Unjust as it seems, passengers have often been arrested and taken into police custody simply for attempting to leave a stranded plane without authoritative permission.

, When stranded on a plane crowded with impatient people, the last thing you want to have is a meltdown. Don't demand answers or compensation from the flight crew. Instead, stay calm, relax in your seat and wait for further information.

, If the flight is scheduled to be longer than half an hour, it's likely you've brought a few items to pass the time, so you may as well use them now. Listen to music on an iPod, play games on a portable gaming device, knit, start that novel you've been wanting to read, make a phone call, strike up a conversation with the person next to you, etc.

, Unfortunately, the lavatories on many stranded aircraft are often out of order or too foul-smelling to use. If you are able to hold it in, try your best to do so.

, If the circumstances that kept you stranded were repairable but the airline did not fix them, see if you can get a voucher for a free flight on a different date, or if you don't intend to fly the airline again, demand a refund.

Look for the following information to track your journey:A direct flight will list the same flight number for each leg of your journey. Traditionally this means a single plane, but many ""direct"" flights now require you to change planes. Check with the airline to confirm.
A connecting flight uses different flight numbers for each leg. You will have to change planes.;
, Most airport websites have a printable map. Stash this in your carry on luggage to save yourself time looking for your gate. In-flight magazines usually have some airport maps printed near the back, but these may only include the largest hubs.


If there's a separate map for each terminal, print every one. You may need to change terminals.

, You can sometimes find this information on the airport website or from your travel agent (if you have one).If official numbers aren't available, get a rough estimate:When transferring from a domestic to domestic flight, allow 60 minutes. A 45 minute layover is risky, but doable if the first flight is short and the two flights are run by the same airline.
Allow at least 2 hours if landing in another country, or if transferring from a domestic flight to an international one. A layover shorter than 90 minutes is very risky.
Add 30 minutes if you have gate-checked items (strollers) or limited mobility, if you are traveling at peak travel times, or if your layover airport has stormy or wintry weather.

, If your connection is shorter than the recommended amount, take steps to make it run smoothly. You can rebook your flight for a fee, or take these less drastic measures:


Choose an aisle seat as close to the front of the plane as possible, so you can disembark first.
Strongly consider bringing carry-on luggage only, so you don't have to pick up checked baggage. (Domestic/International transfers only.)
Download a smartphone app to track flight delays while you're in the air.

, For domestic flights, your checked luggage is almost always sent to your final destination. On some international flights, especially flights that land in the United States or Canada, you'll need to pick up your luggage and check it in again.Just to make sure, ask the airport staff checking your luggage for details.


If you made separate purchases for the two flights, you'll usually have to pick up your luggage during the connection.Many European countries are in the ""Schengen zone."" Flights between two countries in the Schengen zone do not require you to go through customs, and usually don't require you to pick up luggage. You'll still have to go through security., If you are passing through a foreign country en route to a different destination you might still need a ""transit visa."" Look up a nearby embassy for the second country, and check their website for information.


If you are passing through the US, check this website for more information. If your country appears on the Visa Waiver Program list, you do not need a visa.

, If you or a traveling companion has limited mobility, consider asking for a wheelchair at your connection. Contact the airline you purchased your ticket from to arrange this.


If you've forgotten to do this in advance, ask a flight attendant on your first flight as soon as you can. If you wait too long, the wheelchair may not be ready for you on arrival.
In some countries, it's polite to tip the porter pushing the wheelchair. A suggested amount is US$10 in US airports, or £2 in the UK., The pilot or flight attendants will sometimes announce gate changes near the end of the flight, or while you are taxiing to the gate.

, If your connection is tight, gather your carry-on items before the seat belt sign goes on for the descent.

, Get out your boarding pass for the next flight, plus your passport and customs form if traveling internationally. Stash these in a secure but easily accessible location, such as a purse or inside coat pocket.

, If your flight is delayed and it looks like you might not make a connection, ask the flight attendant to help you switch seats for the last few minutes before descent.Moving from the back to the front of the plane can save you 10–15 minutes.


You can also ask your fellow passengers directly, but remember you're asking for a favor. Be polite, and do not try this when you have plenty of connection time.
The descent can begin 30 minutes before landing. Don't wait until the last minute to ask, or you'll get stuck where you are.

, The first thing to do after getting off the plane is to find your next gate number. Do not assume the gate number on your boarding pass is correct, as flights often change gates. Instead, find a television monitor labeled Departures. Find the flight number listed on your boarding pass, and write down the gate number.


If you're in a rush, ask the flight attendants standing at the gate as soon as you disembark. They can often tell you the gate number and exact directions.

, You usually do not need to pick up your checked luggage unless you have just made an international flight, or if you purchased the two tickets separately. If you're certain you need to pick it up, do so as fast as possible. The baggage claim is often on the other side of security, so it can take a long time to pick it up and get back in.


After picking up your luggage, check it in again at the ticket counter for the airline operating the next leg of your flight.

, If you just completed an international flight, follow the signs to customs. The customs area is usually divided into two lines, one for citizens and one for non-citizens. Stand in the line that matches your passport. You may also need to go through a security screening, depending on the airport.


If there is a long line and you're running out of time, politely ask an airport employee whether you can go through a priority line so you can catch your flight. They will not always say yes, but it's worth a try.Stay calm and cooperative, even if the official puts you through additional screening. Rude responses or pleading will usually just slow down the process.

, Even if you have plenty of time, walk to your gate right away. Don't be afraid to ask directions from an information desk, or from any airport staff.


If you are transferring from an international to a domestic flight or vice versa, you will probably change terminals. If this involves a shuttle ride, it might take as long as 10–20 minutes.

, If you have time to spare, you do not need to stay at your gate the whole time. Most airports have restaurants, shops, and art exhibits. Just make sure you keep track of the time and keep track of how to get back to your gate.


Keep your luggage with you at all times.

, The exact boarding time is usually listed on your boarding pass. If it is not, get to your gate 30 minutes before the listed departure time.

, If you miss your connection, immediately phone the airline. The airline contact info is usually on your boarding pass, but for faster results contact its local representative at your current airport.You can find this number on the airport website, or by asking at an information desk.


If you do not have phone service, ask for a courtesy phone at the information desk. If you cannot find a phone, visit the ticket counter for the airline you arrived on instead.

, If you missed your flight because of the airline's fault, such as a delayed flight or an unreasonably short connection time, it is the airline's responsibility to get you to your destination. This is not true if you booked your two flights separately, or if you missed the flight due to your own mistakes — but most airlines are willing to compromise a little.Do not hesitate to ask for the following, calmly and politely:


Free standby on the next flight. Many airlines will grant this for any reason, if you ask no more than 2 hours after your scheduled departure. Standby passengers only get on the flight if there is an empty seat, or if someone agrees to give up theirs.
If your travel is urgent, ask the airline how likely it is that you'll get on with standby. If chances are low, ask for a reduced price guaranteed ticket on the next flight. (Not always available.)
Voucher for food and a hotel room, if you are forced to wait overnight. (Unlikely if the airline was not at fault.)
Free phone call to a contact at your destination, if you don't have a phone.

When traveling economy, try to reserve a seat on the aisle, as this will make it easier to go for a quick walk when you're feeling restless. You'll also be able to sprawl into the aisle for some extra leg room.


Some flyers prefer window seats. The benefit of a window seat is that you can use the side of the plane as a cozy nook in which you can sleep. Also, the view outside the plane can provide natural beauty you can enjoy if you find your activities are becoming tedious. The major drawback to window seats is the difficulty you'll face potentially crossing over two other people when going for a walk or trying to use the bathroom.;
, Airline headphones/earbuds aren't always the highest quality, so you may want to bring a pair of your own. Noise-cancelling headphones, in particular, are praised by veteran long-haul flyers, though these can be expensive. Earplugs are a good, affordable substitution for these and can be bought at most drug stores.


You might want to download some relaxing white noise tracks onto your media player to drown out other passengers or loud children. Rain sounds, beach sounds, and meditative tracks with gentle music accompanying natural noises can transport you to a more tranquil place.Many long flight travelers recommend wearing compression socks, especially when flying economy. The limited amount of space and long periods of time spent stationary can cause swelling in your feet and ankles or a dangerous condition called deep vein thrombosis. Compression socks can help prevent this., Keeping your blood flowing and your body engaged can prevent soreness, swelling, and discomfort. The key to these kinds of exercises is small, controlled movement done consistently over time. Even if you're only raising your toes, doing this for 10 - 20 repetitions several times over the course of your flight will help keep your body limber. Speaking of raising your toes...



Raise your toes while sitting. Keep your heels on the floor and slowly raise your toes as high as you can. Then lower your toes, and repeat this motion with your heels while keeping your toes on the floor. Do this 7 - 10 times with controlled, deliberate motion.

Raise and twist your legs. You may have better results with this exercise if you recline your chair as much as possible first. Then, raise your legs as much as you can and rotate your toes in a clockwise motion until you complete at least 6 rotations. Then repeat the motion going counterclockwise the same number of rotations.

Bring your knees to your chest. This engages both your abdominal muscles and your legs. Lean forward a little bit so your back is off your chair. After that, bring one knee as close to your chest as you can, using both hands to support it gently. Hold this pose for 15 to 20 seconds, then lower your leg and repeat the process with your other leg. Do this at least 3 times., Your schedule doesn't have to be set in stone, but by plotting out your plans for your flight time you can arrange activities to prevent boring gaps during your journey. You might plan on spending the first two hours of your trip getting situated and doing some light reading. At about the third hour of your flight, complimentary beverages, including alcohol, are usually offered. You may want to skip alcoholic drinks; the cabin will already be dry, alcohol can lead to dehydration, and alcohol can also hurt your quality of sleep.After that you might:



Consider taking a nap or getting as much sleep as possible at around the five hour mark. Natural sleep aids, like chamomile, Valerian root, and melatonin may help.By planning a nap toward the middle of your long flight, you break up your activities so you hopefully won't get bored of in-seat entertainment.
Think about a walk down the aisle at the eight hour mark. Even regular in-seat exercise isn't a substitute for stretching your legs. After your nap, a little past the halfway point of your flight, excuse yourself from your seat and take a stroll. This is also a good opportunity to visit the restroom and freshen up with your in-flight toiletry bag.
Enjoy your planned activities between hours eight and ten of your trip. Settle in for a good movie, read your book, do your puzzles -- occupy yourself with all the enjoyable things you've brought along for the flight.
Try to catch a little more rest at hour ten. Your quality of sleep on a long flight probably won't be as good or as long as what you're used to. If you feel sleepy, listen to your body, but following a relaxing movie, a good read, or some puzzle work, you might find yourself ready for another short nap.
Finish out the rest of your flight with planned activities. This is also a good chance for you to do your in-flight exercises. Doing your exercises now will prepare your body for de-planing, snagging luggage, and making your way to a hotel or wherever it is you're headed. You might also want to take another trip to the restroom an hour before you land so you feel refreshed when you reach your destination., Think about and make a list of activities you like to do in enclosed spaces, like your room, school, or office. Some common in-flight activities include reading, listening to music, watching movies, and doing homework/work. Don't forget any hobbies you might have that can be done in a seat, like drawing, knitting, playing chess, doing puzzles (like sudoku or crossword puzzles), folding origami, and so on.


You might also want to consider practicing meditation before you step on board your flight. Some people experience flight anxiety, and many people become uncomfortable during a long flight. Meditating on your flight can help calm you down and put your body in a relaxed state.
A long flight might also be a good time for you to try out a new activity, especially if you find that you normally don't have free time to try something new. If you've always thought about giving sudoku a shot but have never had a chance, your long plane ride might be just the place to focus on and try out a new activity like this!, Some long haul flights will be less crowded than others. Keep your eyes peeled when boarding and settling into your seat. If you notice some seats that look empty, call over a flight attendant and ask if you might move to those seats so you and the other passengers can have more room. Don't be shy when asking - in many cases, open seats are available on a first-come-first-serve basis., Even if it feels awkward introducing yourself to a stranger, remember that your seat-mates are likely feeling the same thing. Being on friendly terms with those sitting next to you can make it seem less of a bother when you need to exit your row to use the restroom or go for a walk.


To help making friends with those sitting around you, you might bring an extra snack to offer. Even if your seat-mate refuses, most people will appreciate the gesture of good will.
You might engage your seat-mates in a game, like chess, or ask for help with a difficult puzzle. You might say something like, ""Hi, my name's Tom, you wouldn't happen to know anything about famous people, would you? Thirteen down in this crossword has got me stumped.""

, Routine can help put you in the mood for slumber. Even though you'll be in an enclosed, unfamiliar space on your plane, heading to the bathroom to change into nightwear/pajamas could be just the thing to help you nod off. These lightweight garments can usually be packed in your in-flight bag without taking up too much room.You might also find it easier to fall asleep if you take your shoes off and give your toes some wiggle room. If you are uncomfortable putting your stockings down on the airplane floor, you can ask your flight attendant for an airline blanket and use this to rest your feet upon.
If you're traveling for business and are wearing a suit jacket or blazer, in many cases you can request a flight attendant hang your jacket up so it doesn't get wrinkled. This way, you can prevent your business clothes crisp and fresh while you rest., Although your space in-flight will be limited, there are still ways you can get comfortable when you're trying to drift off to sleep. If you have a window seat, you can pull the window shade down and rest your head on it. But even if you don't have a window seat, remember to recline your chair! Even a slightly backwards lean to your chair can improve your comfort levels.


If you don't have a pillow, a jacket or a scarf can do in a pinch. Fold or ball up an article of clothing to make a comfortable pillow for your head.
If you are trapped in a middle seat, attempt various positions to find what's most comfortable for you. You may find that leaning to the left or right in your reclined seat helps considerably. You might even be able to create a surface to lean against by wadding up extra clothing, like a sweatshirt.
Remember to buffer your lower body from discomfort. Sleeping while mostly upright can put unpleasant pressure on your lower back. Sitting on a pillow, even one of the U-shaped variety, can help relieve that pressure, give a slight lift to your legs, and add to your comfort., It's easy to get distracted from maintaining the charge of your electronics, especially if, for example, you're enjoying a good movie on your tablet or laptop. Keep your chargers handy and try to keep at least one device charging at all times. This way, you'll at least have one device with a charge when the batteries on your other electronics are low on power.


Depending on the kind of plugs used in your home country, you might also want to bring a power adapter for your electronics. To check whether or not you'll need a power adapter, you can check the specifications of your flight online to see what kind of outlets, if any, are available., If you have a book, a game, or a puzzle you're really enjoying, try not to finish it in one sitting. Take a break halfway through so you can enjoy it more later on in the flight when you'll likely be more restless and in need of something engaging. You might watch a movie, do in-flight exercises, or go do some work in between the activity you're enjoying.


Taking a break from an enjoyable activity will also prevent you from getting burned out on it. Even the most enjoyable things, if done for too long, can become tiresome., The dry air in the cabin can steal your moisture quicker than you realize. Dehydration can lead to dry mouth, headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, and can contribute to mental fog.Keep yourself well hydrated throughout the flight by drinking plenty of water.


To prevent dehydration, you also might want to avoid diuretics. Diuretics are substances that make you have to urinate more frequently, like coffee and alcohol., On many long flights, especially those over eight hours long, you'll likely end up sleeping or taking a nap. A bathroom kit is excellent for just these kinds of situations. This way, you don't have to feel like you have to worry about ""dragon breath"" after waking up.


In your bathroom kit, you'll probably want to at least include a toothbrush, travel sized toothpaste, deodorant, and hand sanitizer.
Many kinds of contact lenses can be uncomfortable when sleeping, or can dry out and leave your eyes itchy and blurry. A contact case and solution in your bathroom kit can save you from this! Be sure your solution bottles are within your airline's allowable limits.
The air in the cabin of most flights, especially long flights, can be very dry. Some travel sized lotion and lip balm can soothe your dry skin. Eye drops, too, can be a lifesaver after a nap or after your eyes are dried out from cabin air., A few hours of sleep, or better yet, a full eight hours, can cut your long haul flight down to a fraction of what it would otherwise be. Many people, however, have difficulty sleeping in airline seats or ignoring other passengers while trying to sleep. Try to anticipate things that might help you sleep better, like a sleeping mask to block light, a travel pillow, personal blanket, and ear plugs.


Some travelers swear by sleep aids to help with drifting off, and if you also plan on trying this approach with over-the-counter or doctor-proscribed sleep aids, you should give the medicine a test run before your flight. Sleep aids affect each person differently, and the last thing you want is to be caught wide-eyed and wakeful when all you want to do is nod off.You may also want to check the features offered on your flight. Many long flights offer amenities like pillows and blankets, though the quality of these may not be as good as what you bring from home. Still, if you find your carry-on luggage full to the brim, using an airline pillow instead can create more space for something fun!

, Even though long many flights usually provide meal-service, there's no guarantee you'll find the food appetizing or that the amount will be enough to satisfy your hunger for the entire flight. Pack some travel-snacks approved by your airline, like dried fruit, and protein bars. Avoid nuts due to potential allergy issues had by other passengers. You'll also want to bring games, media, and other items necessary for the activities you've brainstormed.


Prioritize snacks that you know from experience are kind to your digestion. An upset stomach on a long flight can ruin any enjoyment you might have had.Make sure you pack your chargers and potentially a power pack for charging your devices in flight. Even though many flights now have outlets for your electronic devices, if you plan on using a laptop/tablet, battery powered headphones, and your cell phone, you may find that you don't have enough outlets to charge them all halfway into your flight when your batteries start to die! A power pack can save you in this situation.Technology isn't always reliable, and the last thing you want is to spend a 12 hour flight watching an in-flight movie that you find boring. It's a good idea to bring at least one item that can't malfunction, like a book and/or some paper puzzles (sudoku, crosswords, etc.), along with some paper, a pencil, and a pen.

, You might be surprised by how the temperature in your cabin changes. At the beginning of your flight, you might feel relatively comfortable, but after getting comfortable and settling in to sleep, you might feel cold. Dress in layers so that you can ensure that you're comfortable no matter how the cabin temperature fluctuates. Prioritize loose fitting, comfortable clothing from your wardrobe.


Even if it isn't scarf season, a scarf can be a great asset on a long flight. Scarves take up relatively little space and can be carried around your neck, but when it's cold you can drape your scarf over your arms, legs, or wherever you find warms you best. Scarves can also be used as a pillow in a pinch."

Chew Gum.",How to Be Comfortable on a Long Plane Ride As a Teenager," You don't want to be stuck carrying around 50 lbs. of luggage especially if you are flying alone. An old trick to pack light is just plan to do laundry when you get there. If you can not stand laundry, then plan to wear a shirt two or three times, if it isn't dirty.;
, Stick to sweats and a T-shirt. This will make you very very comfortable. Also, wear tennis shoes, never heels. From walking around the airport, your feet will get sore. If you have glasses, wear them, but you can always bring contacts when you get to your destination. This can save you from dry eyes, and you can sleep in comfort.

, About $50 in cash for use on the plane and in the airport is appropriate. In the airport, you can buy snacks to take on the plane, and you can buy a large water bottle. Don't buy soda, because that can get you all jittery. If you want carbonated drinks, buy ginger ale instead. When you are at the airport, or buy one from the dollar store, get a bag of lollipops. Dumdums are good because they are small and don't have much sugar.. If you don't like lollipops, then bring some M&Ms or skittles. Sucking on sweets can reduce stress a little.
, Bring Kleenex, extra hair ties, a brush, a toothbrush and toothpaste, eye drops, face wash, Wet-Ones, deodorant, band-aids, and headache capsules.

, Even though most airlines provide them, ""washing"" them isn't on their high priority list.

, You can play games, watch movies, play music, do some homework, and whatever you want. Some airlines, if your flight is over the time requirement, offers internet access. If you don't have a laptop, bring an iPod or mp3 player, (iPods are better because you can play movies on them) and a DS or a Game Boy.

, If you are going for Christmas or another school holiday, bring all your homework so you can get it done before your vacation starts. Bring mechanical pencils, regular pencils break and they are a pain to sharpen. Doing homework can also be a great waste of time, and when you're done, a lot of people like to go to sleep after that.

, You don't want to be stuck in the middle of a row, not being able to do anything. My advice, take a row that is least filled, if possible. Get an aisle seat, if you want leg room, or a window seat, if you want to sleep. When you are seated, and don't like your seat, look for an empty row. Then, when the cabin door closes, go for that empty row you've been spotting.

, It's best if you go early instead of waiting until the last minute, and have to wait in line. After that, walk to the front of the cabin and then walk back to your seat. This will get your blood flowing.

, If you find someone that looks like your age, and they have no one sitting by them, ask them if you can sit down beside them and then introduce yourself. You may find yourself a new best friend.

, Some flights have a video screen that you can use to watch movies, t.v. shows, and play video games. Some airlines also let you request certain items like extra food, blankets, seats, and cards.

, Sometimes on a plane your ears can pop and it can get annoying. Chewing gum helps out. Doing this also freshens your breath.

Book a flight with power ports in every seat.,
Bring an adapter.,
Be prepared to wait.,
Bring smaller devices.,
Ask flight attendants for alternative charging locations.,
Conserve power.",How to Charge a Device on an Airplane1," Power ports are becoming more common in planes but they still are not standard. Many planes only include outlets near certain seats.When purchasing tickets, see if plugs are listed among the amenities available on the flight.


Some airlines, like Southwest and Alaska Air have no power ports.
Virgin America has plugs on every flight.
The accessibility of power ports on most other airlines varies with the model of the plane.;
, Many power plugs on flights are not adapted to accommodate typical device plugs. Many are adapted to Cigarette DC Power or EmPower DC Power. These are similar to what you find in a car and require the same type of adapter.


For Cigarette DC Adapters, look for an “Auto/Air” adapter.
For Empower DC Power, you might need an additional device that can be attached to a Cigarette DC Power adapter. Most ""Auto/Air"" adapters can easily be converted from Cigarette to Empower Adapters.The Empower DC adapter looks much like a Cigarette DC adapter. Whereas a Cigarette DC adapter has a circular shape with a number of very small inputs, the Empower DC adapter has a circular shape, with some small inputs and two larger ones near the top.
If you are flying internationally you should consider a universal device that includes an array of different adapters. These are more expensive, but international power plugs often are not compatible with U.S devices. A good, universal adapter will allow you to charge your devices both on the plane and abroad., It can be dangerous to charge during crucial moments of the flight, like take off, landing, and periods of turbulence. As of yet, there are no official regulations about when you can and cannot charge. However, many airlines have their own rules and flight attendants might tell you to unplug your devices at certain points in the flight.Often, the power ports will shut off automatically at the end of flight., Unfortunately, most on flight power ports work at a very low voltage. These will rarely be sufficient to charge larger devices, like laptops. Often the laptop’s demand for power will trip the power circuit, so that you do not get any power from it. Smaller devices are less likely to trip the circuit.


Sometimes if you remove the battery, the device will be able to run off the current from low voltage power plugs.Smaller devices like tablets, DVD Players, and cell phones are more likely to charge effectively with airplane power ports.

, Some planes might have open power plugs located away from normal seating areas. Don’t expect to be able to use these. It won’t hurt, however, to ask if anything is available.

, You won’t need to charge if you don’t use much power. See if your laptop has an energy efficient setting. Turn off unnecessary applications to reduce the consumption of power. Putting devices on airplane mode can also conserve energy.


These tricks will also allow you to charge your device faster."
"
Charge in advance.,
Charge at the airport.,
Purchase a power pack.,
Bring more than one device with you.",How to Charge a Device on an Airplane2," Obviously bringing pre-charged devices will make it easier to stay entertained during the flight. However, it might also be necessary for getting on the flight in the first place. Because of concerns that bombs could be hidden in electronic devices, some security will no longer allow you on the plane with a device that will not power up on its own.


So far, this rule is only being used for select international flights, but it is unclear how this rule will be applied in the future., Most airports have some power ports and many now have specialized charging stations. However, they are often very popular and you might be competing with a horde of other people to get access to the power port.


One good way to get around the scarcity of power ports is to bring your own power strip. These allow you to turn 1 power port into 5 or 6. That way you can charge several devices at once and even make some friends at the airport!

, Power packs can cost anywhere from $20-$100. Depending on the model, they might be able to charge several devices for as long as a week. The cheaper models, however, should be sufficient to keep your devices charged on even the longest flights., If you do this, when one device runs out of power you can switch to the other one. You can even charge one while using the other.

Sleep.,
Take a portable game player.,
Watch television on the screen overhead but if you are on a long flight they might have a television for every person, so use it and watch the films you have always wanted to watch.

,
Have a friend with you to talk with if you can.,
Take photographs.,
Write a story, poem or email about the feelings that the trip, its experiences or expectations, or your photographs evoke.

,
Make a list of all the sites you want to see, or why you are excited to see them at your holiday destination.,
It truly is childish, but try your best at an impression of your favorite character.",How to Amuse Yourself on a Plane," Always a good choice; take at least two books, depending on the scheduled length of your flight. Get books that are easy and fun to read, because you'll be stuck with them. But it is not recommended that you take your book about aircraft disasters or hijackings for obvious reasons!

, Take your iPod/MP3 player. There is always lots to do on them, and you can buy songs on iTunes (or similar) beforehand. All electronic equipment needs to be turned off for take-off and landing for safety and so you are fully alert. In flight, iPhones and other mobile phones should be set to ""in flight"" mode - if it doesn't have it, don't turn it on.

, Movies are a good choice because they last longer and are generally enjoyable.

, These are (unsurprisingly) fun, at least for a little while and help kill time, like this Dull swipe app. There are lots of games on iTunes besides what your iPod comes with. Also, you can play games while you listen to music. There are also (on long haul) games on the screen tucked away somewhere near you. If you have a PSP or DS, ensure the wireless function is turned off.

, These are also available and take a long time to finish. You can just sit back and relax and listen.

, Talk to your seatmates. Sometimes you meet great people. You can have long talks if you are from the same country or you have the same cultures.

, Take difficult ones. Time flies when you attempt to solve them.

, This is a great opportunity to catch up on that crocheting or knitting that you never get to do at home. Bring a dull needle that all airlines will accept, sharp ones will be taken away at security.

, Start that autobiography on yourself that you have been wanting to do for a while, or journal!

, Watching the scenery flow by 30,000 feet (9,144.0 m) below can be fascinating especially with the aid of the map on the back of the seat in front of you. Enjoy the different colors and textures, hills and valleys, structures, and roads. A road atlas can add to your enjoyment on domestic flights, but only if you've got a window seat.

, Some of us can, some can't. If you want to sleep during the flight, try to get a window seat. That way, you can rest your head on the window or side of your seat. It is a lot easier to sleep in First Class, but if you're in Economy, sleep on the little pillow they give to you.

, This is so you can enjoy your game while the time goes by. Make sure any wireless functions are turned off.

,, Most of these things can be done with others: sudoku, listening to music, etc.

, You can enjoy hours taking pictures of the Sahara, Caribbean islands, clouds, or sunsets.

,, Have fun!

, Surprisingly, this is quite amusing.

Reserve a good seat.,
If you plan on trying to sleep, be prepared.,
Take something to entertain yourself.,
Always have a couple of recent magazines with you.,
If possible, go with an airline that offers .A.V.O.D (Audio Video on Demand), which is a TV screen in front of your seat that lets you choose what you want to watch, play or listen to.,
Take your own headphones.,
Minimize your carry-on luggage.,
Take a toothbrush, lip balm and anything else that isn't a liquid or a gel, that you need to help freshen up before meeting your loved ones at the end of your long flight, or to make yourself feel better when you land.,
Consider taking your own food on board if you care about taste or health.,
Contact your airline in advance to find out if they still offer free meals and potentially request a special meal.,
Take some sweets or other snacks with you.,
Move around.,
Opt to sit near the back of the aircraft for long haul routes, if you don't mind the extra noise produced by the engines.,
Participate in the in-flight exercise video, should your flight provide one.,
Take steps to protect yourself from the dry air on board the plane.,
Don't look at the time during the flight.,
Find a way to sleep comfortably.",How to Be Comfortable on a Long Airplane Trip," Even within the same class and fare, some seats are far superior to others. Consider an aisle or exit row seat for leg room, or a window if you want to sleep. Try to avoid seats near the toilets/lavatories, as other passengers will be accessing these regularly. It is common on long-haul flights for there to be lines, and people walking to or from the toilets may bump or knock your seat. Also keep in mind that the noise and light that escapes when the door is opened may be disturbing, particularly when trying to sleep.


However, remember to never choose an exit row seat if you will have an infant or small child with you.;
, Take a travel pillow or head restraint, and try to avoid using the inflatable ones unless you know you will be comfortable.

, Usually, movies don't start for some time, and the built-in music/movie selection can be quite poor, so take an iPod (the night before you go away try to download some of the latest songs or movies as it will be more entertainment than the old movies you already have), iPhone, iPad, Game Boy, Nintendo D.S, or CD player. You could also take a new book that you like or portable game.

, Pick out some new magazines at the airport before you leave, it is a fun way to start your trip.

, It is very useful to help let time pass by.  But be careful - this can be VERY expensive!!

, The headphones, usually available on the plane (whether for purchase or for free) are usually of poor quality. Noise-canceling headphones and in-ear headphones are great if you have them, and can help block out engine noise.

, One backpack is fine for the plane, and it is easier to find a place in the overhead bins or under the seat for a small backpack than for a larger roller bag.

, If someone is meeting you there, and your neighbors in-flight, will be glad you did.

, On some airlines, plane food is quite poor. Check airlinemeals.net before and look through the reviews and decide if you should buy food before the flight.

, Many airlines offer vegetarian, Kosher, Halal and other ""special"" meals if you order up to two or three days in advance. And because the airlines have to specially prepare your meal, it is usually better than the standard food fare. Plus, passengers with special meal requests are almost always served first. If your airline doesn't offer a free meal, be sure to bring your own or buy one at the airport.

, Protein bars are particularly helpful if on a long-flight. Most airline meals tend to be low in protein and high in carbohydrates.

, This is especially important on longer flights, to prevent your body from aching due to poor circulation. Some airlines provide guidance on in-seat exercises you can do (such as circling ankles and stretching arms). The long mid-flight stretch on overnight flights is an excellent time to take a stroll up and down the aisle a few times. There is usually room to do some back stretches at the back of some of the cabins.

, Certain aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 series, have a large area behind the last row of seat in the back of the aircraft that give you plenty of space to stretch.


However, do not sit in the absolute rear of the plane. There will undoubtedly be noises and smells from people using the bathrooms and other areas in the plane's rear. Also, these seats might not recline.

, These are designed to help with body circulation and reduce fatigue. If your flight does not include such a video, you can still do your own stretches and exercises.

, The air in a plane is very dry and may dehydrate your system.



Drink plenty of water. Although you can request water from your flight attendants, it is a good idea to take plenty of water on board with you. You may either purchase bottled water once you pass security or bring an empty bottle with you to fill from a water fountain. Remember that you should never drink the water from airplane bathrooms; it may contain bacteria.
Use eye drops (eye drops may now be carried through security) whenever your eyes feel dry. If you are really uncomfortable, don't hesitate to inform cabin crew.
Consider saline nasal gel if your nostrils feel uncomfortable breathing dry air. Saline nasal gel, which can usually be found near the saline nasal wash at a drugstore, can help keep the inside of your nose moist and make breathing more comfortable. Apply in the restroom and wash your hands before and after. You can put it on a cotton swab and coat the inner 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of your nasal passages. It may seem gross, but it really works for preventing your nose from painfully drying out.
Take lip balm in a 3 oz or smaller container and use it to protect your lips from becoming painfully dry. Take a small container of hand lotion or cocoa butter if your skin dries easily.

, You can't do anything about it and the flight will feel a lot longer if you keep looking at the time. Don't check your watch regularly and avoid looking at the in-flight map showing the current position of the plane.

, If you brought a pillow, put it on the tray in front of you and rest on that. If you have a window seat, leaning against the wall or window can be much more comfortable than leaning back. Recline your seat as far as possible to make leaning back more comfortable."
"
Ask for a seat that you are comfortable with.,
Go to the bathroom before the flight takes off.,
Learn about the causes of turbulence.",How to Handle Airplane Turbulence1," Ask for a window seat if having a wall next to you will make you feel more secure. Keep in mind, however, that no one seat is safer than the others.The only seats you want to avoid are the emergency row seats, because if you are panicking, you may not be able to handle the responsibility that comes with sitting in that row. Sitting close to aircraft center of mass (close to the wing) may be more comfortable, as the aircraft pitches and yaws around this point. See How to Get a Good Seat on an Airplane.;
, Being in the bathroom when turbulence hits is quite dangerous, so go beforehand so that you decrease your chances of being stuck in the bathroom during turbulence. Try to avoid drinking diuretics like coffee and tea. If you are stuck in the toilets when turbulence strikes, use the provided handles to brace yourself.

, Understanding why something happens often makes it less frightening. Try searching for 'turbulence anxiety' on YouTube.

Anticipate your flying comfort when booking your flight.,
Arrive early and avoid many hassles.,
Become familiar with the security rules, baggage requirements, pet travel and anything else that will impact your trip.,
Pack supplies.,
Make yourself comfortable in the plane.,
Be prepared if you have kids.,
Practice acceptance.,
Anticipate the chance that things will go wrong.,
Be of service.,
If possible avoid traveling when you're sick and never travel if you're contagious.",How to Tolerate an Unpleasant Flight," Make your seat selection as soon as possible; an aisle seat is the most popular but you might find that a window seat is more suitable for sleeping. Many airlines with online booking will show the seat arrangements of different planes and will allow you to book them in advance.


Many airlines offer ""economy plus"" seats. They are often a relatively inexpensive add-on. Although they may only offer an extra 6 inches (15.2 cm) or so, for a long flight, it can make a difference.
If you want to stretch out and relax, you may want to avoid emergency rows or the front or back row because some seats on rows before an emergency row do not recline. Remember, if you are seated in an exit row, you must be willing and physically able to assist in an emergency. This is mandated by federal and international laws. This means that if you're traveling with children, you won't be able to use these seats.
If you have an overactive bladder, choose the first row before the bulkhead doors since it easy to get in and out and close to the lavatories. Also, please, for your sake and the sake of the people sharing your row, choose an aisle seat. Nobody likes to be climbed over so someone else can go to the bathroom.
When booking connections, take care with short connection times. Give yourself plenty of time to connect with flights, especially in larger airports where you have to catch internal transport to get to another part of the airport. Never underestimate how long this will take you, or you might miss your connection.
Also anticipate delays when you're booking. Trying to catch the last flight out can often leave you stranded overnight at the layover airport.;
, Arriving early will ensure that you make your flight and that you're not delayed by long queues or prevented from boarding by gate or baggage closures. Many airports are interesting enough places to roam around and pass time in, or you can take the opportunity to catch up on some reading while enjoying some food and beverages.


Expect airport prices. The cost of running stores and food outlets is higher in airports and that cost is passed on to you. It's not like you're there every day, so accept this reality for what it is.
Go through security at a good pace so that you don't feel rushed and flustered by the procedures. Security checks can upset some passengers due to long waits in line, having to undo all belongings, and remove articles of clothing, etc. Knowing that you have plenty of time to do this will ease your sense of panic and frustration.
Don't be afraid to let security attendants know if you're feeling faint or ill. They can assist you and would prefer your honesty over a mouthful of angry invective when you can't take a moment more of waiting or feeling crowded in.

, The security measures can try even the most patient travelers at times but understanding what's involved can minimize the stress. Don't make assumptions and don't assume your traveler friend has the right advice. If in doubt after reading the airline's or government websites (for example, the TSA website in the USA), call and ask any questions you have. If you have a special need, call ahead and let them know; it's always better to deal with it beforehand than in the airport when your plane is boarding.


Remember that rules may vary between different airlines or the policy may have changed since you last traveled.
Everyone knows the mantra about not joking about bombs or terrorism at the airport. Just don't. There are plenty of more amusing ways to use humor to defuse the tension without resorting to bomb jokes.
Read Know what you can and can't carry on board an aircraft for more details.
Read Prepare for a TSA body scan or pat down if you're traveling in the United States.

, Airlines are becoming more bare bones in what they provide you as a matter of competitiveness and price reductions and this can leave you feeling the flight is more than unpleasant. Expect this in advance and pack accordingly rather than being left there raging inside about the ""lack of service"".


You can develop nasal congestion while in the air. When extreme, the pressure can cause eardrum rupture when changing altitude. Chewing on gum & deep slow breathing can also help with ear pressure when ascending and descending.
Bring a jacket. You can't always be guaranteed to get a blanket and if you feel cold, it may be handy. Consider wearing pants, a shirt and carrying a light jacket for traveling in the summer. Add more layers if you're traveling in the winter. Pashminas are a great option too, as they're light, warm, and give excellent coverage when seated.
Have your own inflatable pillow if you know you'll need neck support. Don't rely on the availability of on-flight pillows - these tend to be reserved for long-haul flights only and even then, there may not be enough to go around. Consider also bringing an empty pillow case - you can stuff clothing in it to make a pillow, or you can cover provided pillows if you're germ-phobic.
Carry moisturizer as your skin may be dehydrated.
Bring small amounts of change in the currency of your origin/destination to pay for food and beverages; however, note that some airlines may not accept cash and instead only accept credit/debit cards while in flight.
Pack snacks. Snacks are important for a number of reasons - if you have a special diet (vegetarians, diabetics, etc.) and they've stuffed up the order (commonplace), then you can resort to your own snacks. If there are delays, you can munch on food rather than feeling as if you're starving. And if you have kids, snacks are a lifesaver for keeping them happy. Pack some of your favorite teas and brew your own on the flight. Chamomile promotes relaxation and helps to reduce stress. They will likely offer hot water at no charge, so you may even save some money.
Bring a water bottle. Fill it with water once you have gone through security. In countries where tap water is safe, use the bathrooms or drinking fountains on the secure side of the security process. Having water will allow you to sip throughout the flight and avoid dehydration or panic when your flight attendant can't bring you water as fast as you'd like.
Pack some gum or boiled sweets if you experience ear problems. Chewing or sucking can alleviate pain. If you suffer from severe pain, speak to your doctor in advance about what to do. Ginger gum is a great choice as ginger calms queasiness and nausea. With hard boiled sweets, suck one before take-off, and one when landing.
In addition, if you're an anxious flyer, speak to your doctor well in advance of flying to obtain the necessary medications that might help ease your flight experience.
Pack some ear plugs and eye shades. These are useful for sleeping, especially if your seat is behind the jet engines. And if you're really keen, bring some noise-canceling headsets if you want to hear the movies. Also bring a sleep-mask in case you're stuck in front of the movie screen and cannot tolerate the bright lights.
Consider bringing pain relief tablets if you're susceptible to headaches or digestive problems. Pack a few pain relievers, some sinus pills and a few Pepto-Bismol caplets at the very least. These can be stashed in your carry on or briefcase. When you need it, you really need it. A small headache can make a bad situation worse.
Bring things to do. Delays happen and if you're prepared, you can make the most of the time rather than fuming stuck inside a metal can. Bring reading material, crafts, puzzles, work, pen and paper, etc. to while away the time. Bring more than one thing to kill time and keep your mind occupied. Consider a mix of music, knitting (knitting needles are allowed but be careful about little scissors to cut your yarn with. They may be taken at security depending on the mood of the agent) or lap crafts, art, magazines, books or journaling. Music is also another excellent option to take your mind off flying and delays, as well as providing you an excuse to check out mentally if you're feeling unhappy with your fellow passengers behavior or noise. Be sure to charge it fully before traveling.
Bring your own treats. Unless you're in business or first class, the days of extra goodies are thin on the ground. Pamper yourself by buying some goodies ""to be opened on the plane only"". Puzzles, chocolate, new MP3 player, fuzzy warm socks, etc. are all nice treat ideas.
But don't over-pack your carry-on! One of the biggest delays - and irritations - in traveling is finding there's no room for your bag in the overhead bin. In these days of checked-luggage fees there's an incentive to overstuff and oversize carry-ons; but ask yourself if the hassle is worth saving $20 on a $500 flight. Besides, if you leave some space in your carry-ons, you have room to bring home souvenirs.

, Do what you can within reason, and while still being considerate of fellow passengers, to make yourself comfortable.


Loosen your shoes since your feet will swell due to the lower cabin pressure (approx 2700m ASL).
Have your reading materials and activities easily accessible, either in the pocket in front of you, or under the seat at your feet.

, Flying with kids is an art form that requires fantastic skills of organization, incredible forbearance at the varying levels of rudeness of fellow passengers, and the patience only a parent can muster to keep kids entertained and happy. Flying with kids is a topic in its own right but some things you can do to make the flight more tolerable include:


Have them use the bathroom before boarding if possible. Sure, they'll still need to go but you can at least buy a little time before they ask to go again.
Deal with health issues in advance. Explain to the kids that ear-popping can happen and that if it hurts, to let you know straight away. Talk to your doctor if there are known ear issues concerning your children to get advice and possible medication. Be aware that a fear of flying can take hold of a child who has to fly when his or her ears or head are clogged by sinus or ear infections. And a child who looks ill will require you to carry a medical certificate stating that he or she can fly without being contagious; for example, obvious signs of chicken pox. You can show the doctor's note to airline staff to reassure everyone.
Talk to them beforehand about how to behave on the flight. Ask them to think about other people on the flight and to understand that it's a small place for a lot of people to be seated together. Explain that yelling, bouncing, jumping, and running about are things that can upset other people and make them grumpy.
Involve them in making plans for the flight. If you can turn this into an adventurous time filled with puzzles, reading, game-playing, and imaginative pursuits, they'll be very excited and distracted for most of the flight. Try to match some of the games with things that relate to the plane travel itself, such as cloud-spotting, plane features or specs, and calculating distances traveled, etc. And bring paper, drawing things, and coloring books. Older kids can bring their electronic devices, pre-charged.
Have snacks ready. You or they may not like what is offered on the flight. And you can dole out snacks as they are needed rather than having to wait for the flight attendant. Bring sippy cups or bottles if needed. Verify with the airline what restrictions they have for bringing containers or jars of baby food and formula for smaller children. Call or research this several days before you leave so you have time to find suitable replacements. Each airline and country may have differing policies so investigate before you make plans that must be changed.

, Flying is not always going to be as breezy as the air the plane travels in. Confining a lot of people into a small space who carry their own emotional issues or exhaustion, reasons for flying, and worries about getting somewhere on time provides the backdrop for at least a few negative encounters. There are ways to deal with this, but the main one is to accept that flying can be trying, especially so when it's during busy times (such as holiday seasons), when it's long haul, and when there are a lot of people both in the airport and on the plane. This isn't even mentioning the many people who manage to just make the plane in time, or who are struggling with kids in tow.


Keep your sense of perspective. A lot of your fellow travelers are tired, as may you be too. And tired people are never as polite to one another as they'd be when they've had enough rest.
Remember that many, if not most, of your fellow travelers just want to be left alone to read, sleep, work, meditate, stare out the window, or whatever. Privacy is scarce on flights; just because you feel the urge to talk, doesn't mean your seatmate does.
Complaining about things that are out of your control might feel good initially but it does little to change them. And people sitting near someone complaining tend to feel a sense of increasing outrage proportionate to the amount of complaining; after all, it's bad enough knowing that a plane is delayed on the tarmac without having some wise guy confirming it as if he or she is deserving of royal treatment over everyone else sitting there patiently. Remember too that employees are finding it as frustrating as you; their schedules also get mucked around.
Babies cry and toddlers wriggle and cry. And their parents have perfectly legitimate reasons for traveling with their babies and toddlers, just as you have a perfectly legitimate reason for traveling too. Take earplugs or an MP3 player; being proactive is a lot better than being bothered.
Teenagers are exuberant. Again, that's life. You were probably that excited about flying once too. Either seek to engage them in conversation about how amazing their taste in baggage is, or stick your MP3 player on and grin at them.
Sometimes people eat things next to you that can freak you out. This calls for ""operation odor cover"". Always bring along a refresher towelette that is delightfully scented. Remove it from its packet and hold it against your nose until the offending smell has gone. Or get up and go for a walk around the plane, or shift to a spare seat. Find constructive ways out - even going to the bathroom and wetting some tissues with the soap and holding that against your nose is better than nothing!

, Pack enough in your carry-on to get you through a delay or your plane sitting on the ground. If the weather is bad, pick up some snacks in the airport and have them handy in case you're stuck on the tarmac for hours and they aren't offering food or beverage services.


Wear flat shoes. They are a lot more comfortable than high heels and choose ones that are easy to remove and slip back on. If something does go really, really wrong, and the plane crash lands, your high heels will be a liability whereas your flats can be worn safely without puncturing the emergency slide. Always look for the bright side in these things!
Avoid drinking too much alcohol on board or avoid it completely. You're responsible for your own actions, and that includes knowing when to stop imbibing. One to two glasses is more than enough at that elevation. In this way, you can avoid being a source of causing things to go wrong or being dehydrated. Instead, continuously sip fruit juices (not carbonated/aerated drinks).
Avoid smoking immediately before a long flight. Smoking causes dehydration, gives you a dry throat and enhances breathlessness.

, The more irritated you become about something, the better placed you are to deal with it. So, instead of allowing yourself to get horribly wound up about the crying baby, hop over to the harried mother and offer to walk the baby around a little, rocking it back to sleep. That really tired person who keeps using you as a pillow and drooling on you? Kindly shake them awake and point out where you saw three free seats where they can stretch out.


Even if you aren't good with kids, you can offer to give your magazine to a toddler to flip through. If you are good with kids and you see a struggling parent, you can offer to help. Offer to read a book or play a game.
Even being nice to a parent can reduce their stress levels which can be triggering the bad behavior in the children.

Smile. Smiling is contagious and creates solidarity between you and anyone seeking to help you. When things go wrong on board, wear a grin as it's getting sorted out. It ensures that flight attendants will perceive you as approachable and likeable. And if you're really lucky, you'll be rewarded with something like a bottle of wine for your forbearance.

, You won't be in the best mood if you're ill and the flight could make you feel worse. The chicken pox, mono, common cold and flu are contagious and you could contaminate other passengers. Remember that some sicknesses could cause life threatening complications to the elderly or very young.


Verify with your doctor if you could be contagious before traveling. If your doctor gives you permission to fly but you're still symptomatic, carry a medical note.
Many airlines can prevent an obviously sick person from boarding. Anthrax infection and many other lethal diseases present with flu like symptoms. Security measures could prevent a person with a cold or flu from flying.
Even if you are allowed on the first leg of the flight you could be stopped at a layover airport when you change planes. The objective of the airline is to protect the other passengers even if it means denying your access.

Listen to the pilot and flight attendants. If they tell you to return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt, whether through an announcement or by turning on the seatbelt light, listen to them immediately. This may sound like obvious advice, but many injuries caused by turbulence were the result of the passenger not listening to instructions, such as a woman who went to the bathroom while the seatbelt light was on and suffered a paralysis injury when the plane hit turbulencePut your seatbelt on even when not instructed to wear it. While pilots can usually anticipate turbulence, sometimes it's sudden, and sometimes it's severe. For example, 26 people were injured when a flight from Brazil to the US hit unexpected turbulence, but none of the people wearing seatbelts were hurt. It can be tempting to take off your seatbelt, especially on long flights when you want to be more comfortable. Consider just slightly loosening your seatbelt instead. No matter what, you want the seatbelt to keep you in your seat should severe turbulence strike suddenly.
The safest place for a child to be during turbulence is in their own seat, with an FAA-approved safety seat or harness restraint; sometimes the airline will provide it (ask beforehand) or you may need to bring your own., Injuries can result from objects being thrown around during turbulence. You might also want to dump any hot liquids into the motion sickness bag to prevent burns should it spill or splash during turbulence. Put your tray up so you don't bump into it.

,, Transport aircraft air conditioning systems are known to be very dry, causing the potential for easy dehydration which can result in headaches or nausea due to A/C systems alone.

,


Control your breathing. When you start to panic, you might hasten your breathing, or hold your breath, both of which will make you more anxious. Focus on taking slow, deep breaths.
Loosen your grip on the arm rests. Let your body go limp. Tension will only make things worse.
If you are panicked or scared, watch the Flight Attendant. If they are calm and relaxed, it is good indicator that everything is OK.
Use the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)

Meditate - Try to Ground and Center

Perform Self Hypnosis

,


Close your eyes and listen to music. Pay close attention to the lyrics. Try to create a music video in your head for whatever song you're listening to.
Read a book.
If you're traveling with someone, play hand games like Rocks, Paper, Scissors or Chopsticks

Count to 99 on Your Fingers
In flight magazines often include sudoku, crosswords and other puzzles that can help distract from turbulence. You can often borrow a pen from a flight attendant, especially if you explain it's to help distract from flying anxiety.
Remember, airplanes are frequently inspected for safety. As time passes, ordinary flight and (especially) turbulence take their toll, and eventually maintenance is required to repair the wear and tear on the airframe. Because this is normally an extremely slow process, it's generally easy to spot wear and tear that requires attention long before it becomes a hazard in flight.
Think of airplane turbulence as driving a vehicle on a bumpy road.

Though some airlines offer tiny flat pillows and itchy blankets, you may be better off taking your own. You can find sets of pillows and blankets that are surprisingly compact and which aren't a huge pain to carry. In a pinch, you can even buy them near the terminal, so you don't have to take them through security, though this will be more costly.


If you have your blanket and pillow, you won't have to worry about staying warm or getting a stiff neck.;
, These can help you keep your hands clean and clean up your tray table. You don't want to have a dirty or sticky tray table after your first meal, or it will be a pain for the duration of the flight. Having sanitary/anti-bacterial wipes on hand will also keep you from having to get up and wash your hands every time you eat something.

, Though some airlines provide these, especially for long flights, there are no guarantees. Having an eye mask will help you doze off and to rest your eyes. Though the lights in a plane will dim on an overnight flight, you may still want some extra protection for your eyes.

, These can also help you drown out the sounds on the plane when you try to rest. You may get stuck near a crying child or two people who talk incessantly, and you want to protect yourself against that just in case. Again, some planes may offer ear plugs, but it's best not to count on it. Noise-cancelling headphones, while a lot bigger than ear plugs, can really make the world around you feel silent, and bring you peace and tranquility.


Listening to music on any suitable personal device if you brought headphones for music, can also help you drown out the noise around you.

, Think comfort over international jet-setting model. Seriously, don't wear stiff, tight or itchy clothing – you'll soon regret it if you do. Wear loose clothing that is easily cleaned. Avoid synthetic materials that overheat and expensive labels which can draw unwanted attention. Avoid unnecessary clothing like jewelry, belts and boots that will slow you down through security checkpoints and are potential pickpocket attractants in some destinations. Remember that the fewer valuables you bring; the less you have to worry about. Here are some tips for clothes to bring to make your long flight more bearable:


Take clothes that will keep you warm in case the plane gets cold. Some flights can get pretty chilly, so make sure you take a fleece or sweater, a scarf, or maybe even a knit hat to keep you warm in case that happens.
Wear layers. Make sure you have a tank top or t-shirt under the long-sleeved shirt or sweater you're wearing. Planes can also get really hot around take off and landing, and you don't want to be stuck in a heavy shirt with nothing underneath.
Take warm socks. Socks can help keep your feet warm if you're wearing sandals, and they can also be a great substitute for shoes so your feet are comfortable on your flight.
Instead of stiff pants or jeans, wear leggings, sweatpants, or loose pants to keep your legs comfortable.
If you're getting off the plane and heading straight out to explore the city where you're staying, then take a change of clothes with you in your carry-on luggage.
Silk long underwear is lightweight, takes up no room, and is great if you are going to a colder climate and don't want to buy an entire wardrobe for it. Ditto for a black cashmere sweater.

, If you're the kind of person who needs to brush their teeth after every meal or if you just want to avoid that gross ""haven't-brushed-my-teeth-in-a-while"" feeling in your mouth, then you may be well served by taking a small toothbrush and toothpaste on the flight. Though it won't be super easy to brush your teeth in the tiny airplane bathroom, it's better than having a mossy mouth.


Note that the TSA association limits liquids, gels, and aerosols to 3.4oz. per container; and up to 1 quart for each hand carry luggage.

, You can also take some gum to make your breath fresher, if this is easier. This will not only refresh your breath, but you can also chew gum when the plane takes off and lands to avoid having your ears pop due to the rapid change in pressure.

, There are two approaches to this. One is to leave it all up to the airline (be sure to check what they offer first) and travel as light as possible. The other is to take your own entertainment items because you don't trust that the airline's offerings are adequate. Just be aware that there are weight restrictions and that the more things you take with you, the more things you have to worry about losing, breaking or having stolen. It also means less room in your bags for bringing back souvenirs and treats from wherever you're traveling to.


On the other hand, some items will be handy during the trip itself and not just on the plane (for example an MP3 Player or an eReader), so letting them do double duty is great.
The other thing to consider is that, if you want to pay for a movie or on-flight entertainment, it can be quite expensive. Though it's complimentary on some flights, you should look into the policy of the airline you're taking. You may be better off renting a movie on iTunes or Google Play and watching it on your Tablet or computer (though the volume may be a bit lower than it would be on the plane's movies) for 3-4 dollars a pop than paying 10 dollars or more to watch a movie on the plane. Also, if you select your movies in advance, you'll have more options to choose from.

, The things you might consider carrying on the plane include an MP3 Player for music and audio books, a laptop or Tablet for writing and reading (and surfing on your trip), a portable DVD player (although this will be quite bulky and your hotel rooms in many places have DVD players) or a portable gaming console such as a Nintendo 3DS or a PSVita. Each has pluses and minuses that you need to weigh up. If you're going on vacation, however, you may want to leave your laptop or other things that remind you of work at home.


Take your cell phone; you may need it on the trip and even if it cannot be used on the plane, it should be with you for safekeeping. Keep in mind that many newer planes have in-flight entertainment available.
And if you take a laptop or Tablet, make sure to have fully charged it before leaving. Depending on the length of the flight, you may wish to consider investing in a portable battery pack to keep all of your electronics fully charged if there are no power points available on the plane.

, If you haven't read that novel yet or caught up on the news, here's your chance. Don't forget that you can also stock up on the latest magazines in the airport before boarding the plane and if you manage to read them on the flight, you don't need to cart them with you off the flight! If you have an eReader, you might like to take it as it can store hundreds of novels or other reading material, including guidebook information for your destination. Here are some forms of reading material you can take:


Novels (take more than one in case your book gets boring)
Celebrity gossip magazines, such as Us Weekly

Reputable magazines, such as The New Yorker, The Economist, or TIME
The newspaper
Materials to read for school or work

If you like to write, you can also take writing material, such as a journal, a laptop, or an article you're preparing. This can be the perfect time to write.



, Whether you're traveling with friends or hoping to make friends with someone sitting next to you, taking along some games is a great way to keep yourself entertained. You can take dice, cards, or travel-sized versions of games like Sorry! or even magnetic chess or checkers. If you're traveling with someone, make sure it's a game that he or she would want to play in advance.


You can also take a notepad so you can play games like MASH or Hangman with another person.
You can also come prepared with some simple games that only require you to talk. For example, you can play ""Geography"": all you do is say the name of a country or city; after that, your partner has to say the name of a country or city that starts with the last letter of the country or city you said; then you have to do the same, and you go back and forth until one of you can't think of anything to say or repeats a country or city that was already said.
You can also take a book of Mad Libs to keep you and your friend or seat mate entertained.

, Another way to keep yourself entertained, especially if you're by yourself, is to take a book of crossword puzzles, Sudoku, or other word or number puzzles. This way, you can just dip into the puzzle whenever you want and feel the time flying by. Just one medium-level crossword could take two or more hours to complete, and you'll see the time whizzing by as you get to work.


You can also take a book of MENSA brain teasers, which will be a combination of word puzzles, number puzzles, and other tricky challenges.

, This is important if you want to use them to stay entertained during your long trip. Though you may get lucky and sit in an aisle that has an outlet, this isn't too likely. You should also be sure to put the charger in your carry-on bag! It's awfully easy to leave the charger at home and spoil your vacation with lamentations about leaving it behind. Ditto for international Sim card, phone cards or portable broadband USB connectors.


If you're really desperate to charge one of your electronic devices, one of the stewardesses may do this for you in the back of the plane, but don't count on it.
Many airlines today allow you to charge in flight. Look on seatguru.com and look up the different options available to you.

, Snacks do break up the monotony of the flight as well as helping stave off any unexpected hunger in between airline meals. If you're on a restricted diet or just want to snack without paying $5 for a tiny bag of Pop Chips or Chex Mix, then taking your own snacks is the way to go. This will also make it a bit easier for you to eat whenever you want, instead of waiting for the stewardesses to come around. Here are some snacks that won't spoil and will leave you feeling satiated while giving you a boost of energy:


Apples
Trail mix
Almonds, cashews, or pistachios
A granola bar (as long as it doesn't crumble too much)
Yogurt-covered raisins
Pretzels
Dried mango or bananas

, Airline travel is dehydrating, so stick to drinking water and plenty of it. Though you can't take a bottle of water past security, you can buy one near the terminal before you board your flight. You should also accept any chance you get to get a cup of water, because you don't know the next time the stewardess can come around. Of course, you can usually ask for water at the back of the plane or even by pushing the ""call"" button, but it's easier to simply accept the water when it comes your way.


Of course, while it's very important to drink water, you also don't want to be running to the bathroom every five minutes to pee, especially if you have a window seat and are worried about inconveniencing the people in your row. Find a balance between staying hydrated and not having your bladder feel full the whole time. Keep in mind that it's more important, though, to be hydrated with a full bladder than to be dehydrated and not have to pee.

, Eye drops help prevent your eyes from drying out in flight. Though they aren't mandatory, they really can help you if you experience the dry eyes that many people have during a flight. It can be pretty uncomfortable if you realize that your eyes are getting dry in the first hour of a ten-hour flight and there's nothing you can do about it.


Just make sure that your container of eye drops is small enough that you can take it on the plane and make it through security with it without a problem.

, According to the National Institutes of Health, there is a small risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on flights longer than four hours. Staying active will help prevent this from happening. You should try to walk up and down the aisles of the plane as much as you can, move, flex, and stretch your legs to keep your blood flowing, and wear clothing that is loose and comfortable. Here are some other things you can do:


Hydrate the day before the flight and during the flight
Wear compression stockings to keep your legs from swelling if you're at risk (talk to your doctor about risk factors)
Avoid alcohol the night before or during the flight because it will dehydrate you. The same goes for coffee, soft drinks, and chocolate.
Take baby aspirin the night before and the day of your flight if you don't have any problems with ulcers.Try to get an aisle seat so you can easily walk around the plane.

, Take anti-nausea medication, pain relief medication, sleep aids, or any of the regular medication that you take on the plane with you so you don't find yourself in need of medication in the middle of your flight. Make sure to take your regular medication as well as any medication you typically use for pain relief in case you get a headache, neck ache, or experience another pain. Make sure you Take ALL medications in its original packaging. You may need to show your prescription for some medications prior to some international flights.


If you're thinking of taking a sleep aid to help you sleep on an overnight flight, make sure you try it out in advance. You don't want to try it for the first time on your flight and then end up having a miserable experience on your flight and after you land.

, Obviously, you need to know the available flights for your destination and the price has to be ""right"". However, other things you should be considering when booking for a long haul flight is just how comfortable that airline will prove to be. Some airlines do offer more legroom than others on particular sectors and this is an important consideration the longer the flight gets; do some research and read the advertising promises, as well as checking out people's opinions in online travel and flight forums.


Check out what entertainment is offered by the airline. Many newer aircraft types offer individualized monitors in the back of the seat right in front of you, so that you don't have to crane your neck to try to see a wobbly old movie screen with someone else's head in front of it.
A lot of these individual entertainment centers now come with lots of movies, news, documentary, etc. choices, as well as radio, music and games that can be played using a handheld device that lifts out from the seat.

, Though somebody's got to be stuck in that middle seat, you should do what you can to get the seat you want. First, you should figure out which seat you prefer, the aisle or the window. The aisle may be the most comfortable for a long flight because you have a bit more room on the side facing the aisle and can easily get up and stretch your legs or use the restroom without inconveniencing people; however, some people like the window because it's easier to rest against it, and because it can be pleasant to look outside. Whatever you choose, here are some tips for picking your seat:


Most airlines allow you to choose your seat when you book your flight. Don't overlook this important aspect of booking the flight, even if you're in a rush.
If you didn't choose a seat online, try to choose it when you check in, or even at the gate of the flight. Though your flight might be full and you may not be able to switch your seat, it's worth trying.
You can try to sit toward the front of the plane so you get to board earlier and leave the plane earlier. The downside is that you may be further from the bathroom.
You should try to get a seat in an exit row, where you'll have more leg room.
Try to avoid seats in front of the exit row, however. Some of them do not recline!
You should also avoid the seats at the very back of the plane. Not only do the seats in the last row typically not recline, but they'll be right near the bathrooms, so the smell won't be as pleasant.
Choose the window seat if you can. It has been said that looking out the window during takeoff reduces dizziness.

, While it is cheaper to have a ""lap baby"" (an infant that has no seat and just sits in your lap throughout the flight), it's not as safe as having a child in his own seat (most airlines allow you to use a car carrier in-flight). Moreover, you're not likely to be permitted to have a baby on your lap for long haul flights that are international.

, If you're flying from San Francisco to Paris, an hour-long layover in Brussels may be tempting, but you should make sure to give yourself at least two, or even three hours between tight connections if you want to make sure you make the next flight. If you're traveling internationally, you may have to go through passport control and take other security measures that take up a lot of time, not to mention trying to find your terminal at the other end of an unfamiliar airport. If you want your flight to be stress free, try to pick a connection that will give you enough time to catch your second flight.

, If you can sleep your hours away, this can be a bonus as you'll arrive fresher and possibly overcome jet lag faster. Obviously, the drawback here is cost; although you can investigate the chances of upgrading using your air/frequent flier miles or points and perhaps even finding a sensational online deal for a business class trip. It can be worth it to do some deeper research into the options or to pay a little more for extra comfort – and you won't know unless you try!

, Most airlines offer a huge array of dietary preferences for international and long haul flights. However, you must book anything that is not the usual run-of-the-mill food choices and it's very wise to double check 24 hours before you're due to fly out, just to make sure the dietary preference you've ordered is properly recorded. It's really depressing to get on a long haul flight and realize you have no food to eat because they botched up the order! In addition, some airlines require you to request special meals at least 24 hours in advance; with Kosher meals, you might even need to request the special catering more than 48 hours in advance.

, Call the airline if you have any dietary, access (for example, a wheelchair or walker) or other issues needing to be double checked. It's probably best to do this 24 to 12 hours in advance of departure. Check that you have any needed medications and accompanying prescriptions. It's important to be prepared in the event that you have a health complication.


If you're prone to motion sickness, you can also take motion-sickness medication or even ginger tablets to help you feel well during your flight; though it's important to read the instructions on your medication, you should generally take motion sickness pills about two hours before your flight.

, Losing your favorite pocket knife to security because you packed it in the carry-on bag instead of the cargo bag isn't much fun. Moreover, there are many prohibited items which can easily be found by checking the airport or airline websites, or you can look at the site of the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) for worldwide information.


Be aware of baggage weight and size restrictions. Even more painful to your wallet than losing the pocket knife is the damage inflicted in fees for overweight bags! And if your carry-on bag is too big, you're stuffed, so get it right from the beginning. See How to avoid airline baggage fees for more information.

, Although you might convince yourself that you'll ""sleep on the plane"", this isn't always guaranteed as you might feel uncomfortable or the passengers two seats across from you might be particularly raucous. Besides which, starting a flight feeling tired can predispose you to catching any bugs on board. The long time in the enclosed plane environment can expose you to other people's colds, flus and other nasties that you're more likely to be able to fight off it you're in great shape and not too tired. It's particularly important that both parents and children get a good night's sleep before a long haul flight, to avoid nerves, tears and frustration.

, If you have an illness such as the tail-end of chicken pox or you're coughing a lot post a bad flu, have a dated doctor's certificate certifying that it's okay for you to fly (namely, that you're no longer contagious). You can be prevented from boarding if the boarding officials are concerned that you might be contagious. It's also important to get prescription notes or letters if you're carrying medications, to avoid drug charges in less understanding destinations. Read more about this in How to travel with prescription medications.

, This will help you to pack properly and will help you to wear the right things on the plane. It's very uncomfortable stepping off a plane from a cold environment into a humid one when you're still wearing the heavy woolen sweater Gran knitted you and you've forgotten to wear a short-sleeved t-shirt underneath! The same thing goes for entering a colder climate after being in a warmer one; always have a coat with you in case the airport you disembark at requires tarmac walking to reach the terminal; it's not much fun wearing a t-shirt and sandals when the snow is pelting down on you or a fierce wind is blowing.

, Check that everyone's passports are up to date. Many countries require at least 6 months validity to remain on the passport during the time of travel, so don't get caught out. Here are some other considerations to take when you get all of your documents in order:


Organize any visas needed before traveling. It is much easier to do this before you leave for another country than to be standing in line in a foreign airport endlessly worrying that they might not let you in.
Arrange for a mixture of foreign cash, traveler's checks and credit/debit cards for overseas travel. Talk to your bank to see what they offer in the way of exchange rates.

, It can be all too easy to forget these in the excitement of preparing for a trip, so check with your doctor early to see if you need any. And if you need to stock up on any medications you take, do so now by letting your doctor know how long you'll be away for. Don't rely on buying needed medication in a foreign country as you might strike all sorts of problems from lack of the medication to not being able to see a doctor.

, That includes your clothes, any medications you might need, plane tickets, passports and toiletries. It's sensible to create a list that helps keep you on track with what you should pack and that can be used for the entire trip to help ensure you've remembered all contents for your bag, as well as serving as a record of items if your bag gets lost or stolen.


Be sure to have left information with neighbors, friends and family about what to do in the event of an emergency with your property (house, car, etc.), your pets or any children you've left behind with relatives or, if they're old enough, in your house.

, A long haul flight usually presupposes that you'll be gone for a while and that you're less likely to take your car to the airport. However, do check out the long-term car storage price as it may be affordable and an option that works well for you, especially if you're concerned about the security of leaving your car at home while you're gone. Some airports offer good long-term parking rates. Otherwise, consider renting a car, using a shuttle service, hiring a taxi, or asking a neighbor or family member to drop you off at the airport. The latter option is especially nice because you get to have a farewell!

, If you're disabled or require special access help, it's a good idea to arrive as early as possible to secure the arrangements needed to help you board on time and in comfort. If you're worried about what to do before the plane leaves if you're too early, there is a lot to do at most modern airports and you can always get out one of your books, games, journal or other forms of entertainment!

Only perform this stretch if there is no one sitting next to you (or if the person next to you is a close friend or relative who doesn't mind), as this will cause you to extend your arm in front of them.

, In a confined space, contracting muscles can be an excellent form of exercise without moving too much.


Contract your abdominal or gluteal muscles. Hold them in place for a few seconds, then release. Repeat this as many times as you feel comfortable during your flight. This will help to strengthen and tone your muscles.
Contract your pubococcygeus (PC) muscles while sitting in a manner similar to Kegel exercises. These muscles stop the flow of urine, so the exercises help improve bladder control. For men, this exercise can help ameliorate erectile dysfunction and improve sexual performance. For women, try Kegel exercises while seated.

, This is a good opportunity to stretch and move while standing in line.


Stand with your feet slightly apart and your hands stretched out in front of you (if it's possible), or place your hands on your hip. Bend down at the knees and do a sit up. Come back to standing position. Repeat about 5 times. Doing this helps to flex the knees and gets blood flowing through the legs and hips.

Stretch. Stand with your feet together and bend down at the waist to touch your feet. This stretches and relieves back muscle tension.

, If the aisle is completely empty, stand in the aisle. Grasp armrests on either side of you. Tighten your abdominals and lift legs straight in front of you, using only abdominals and arms to lift legs. Do not jump. Repeat for sets of 10. Beginners, try smaller sets for this. It works quads, thighs, and abs all at once.

Register with the authorities.",How to Move to Norway1," Moving to Norway and working there is relatively straightforward for citizens of EU/EEA countries. You will not need to apply for a visa and will benefit from the free movement of labour across these European countries. Although you will not have to worry about meeting immigration requirements, you may still find it tricky to find a job straight away. This could be because of a language barrier, or a mismatch between your qualifications and those recognised in Norway.It’s a good idea to look for work before you make the move. If you have a job lined up it will make everything easier.
Search online for jobs in Norway, and search for jobs that you can do in English rather than Norwegian if you don’t speak the local language.If you work for an international company that does business in Norway, or has a branch there, think about the possibilities of transferring.;
, Given the difficulties of organising a place to live when you are not able to travel to visit houses or apartments, you will most likely find yourself renting somewhere short-term while you settle in. If you are staying in a holiday rental in the city you want to stay in, you will be able to look through local newspapers and visit local real estate agents.


In some instances the local authority may provide you with assistance, but social housing is generally reserved for those who are unable to get housing on their own.If you have a job lined up you should talk to your future employer and ask them to help you get set-up when you arrive.

, EU/EEA citizens are entitled to live, work, and study in Norway. If you intend to stay for more than three months, however, you will need to register with the local police service. If you are working in Norway, you will also need to obtain a tax card, which will provide you with a personal identification number and enable your taxes to be deducted from your earnings.


You can begin the registration process online. Visit the website of the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration (NDI): http://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/

Your identification number is an essential requirement of living and working in Norway, which will enable you to open a Norwegian bank account."

Search for a job.,
Apply for a residence permit.,
Travel to Norway.",How to Move to Norway2," The process of looking for work in Norway is essentially the same for citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA. You will still need to trawl through online listings and look for a job that you meet the requirements for. Language could be a significant barrier, but try typing “English” into the search bar on job websites to narrow down the search.If you are invited to interview for a position, but are not at that time living in Norway, ask for a Skype or telephone interview.
Be sure you check the validity of your qualifications in Norway before you apply for a position.
There is a long list of regulated professions in Norway, which require you to obtain authorisation or recognition of your qualifications.
Browse the list and find the details for each regulated profession online: http://www.nokut.no/en/Foreign-education/Other-recognition-systems/Authorisation/List-of-regulated-professions/


, If you are hoping to move to Norway from outside the EU/EEA, you will need to obtain a residence permit. In most instances, you should have secured a job before you apply for the permit. The type of residence permit you apply for will depend on your skills and experience, and the type of work you will be doing in Norway.


There are different permits, for example, for skilled workers, seasonal workers, self-employed people, and those who work for non-profit or humanitarian organisations.
You can start your application online on the NDI website: http://www.udi.no/en/want-to-apply/work-immigration/?nav-veiviser=12910

The instructions are in English, and you will be guided through the process.
You will be required to attend an appointment at a police station or Norwegian embassy to progress your application., If your application has been successful, and you have been awarded a residence permit, you can now travel to Norway to begin your new life there. When you arrive you will have to register at your local police station. Here you will receive your residence card along with any further information or guidance that you might require.


Normally you will book your appointment with the police through the online application portal used for your residence permit application.It is possible to appeal the decision, if your application for a residence permit was turned down.
You must register an appeal within three weeks of finding out you were unsuccessful."
"
Visit first.,
Research the language and culture.,
Be prepared for the weather.,
Consider the length of days and night.,
Understand the cost of living.",How to Move to Norway3," Depending on what part of the world you are moving from, Norway could be culturally and climatically very far removed from what you are used to. If you are moving from Northern Europe, the change will less dramatic than if you are moving from Central America or East Asia. The chances are that you have already visited and spent some time in Norway, if you have decided that you want to make the move over there.


If you haven’t actually been there, it’s sensible to try to book yourself a holiday and spent a couple of weeks travelling around the country.
Talk to people and try to get a feel for the culture and sensibilities of Norwegian people.

, One of the biggest adjustments and potential barriers to living in a new country can be the language. If you don’t speak Norwegian, you might have a tough time finding work and dealing with the administrative and bureaucratic processes of finding a place to live and register as a resident. Although English is widely spoken in Norway, it’s a good idea to try to learn some basic Norwegian before you go.


Once you are there be sure to commit enough time to learning the language.
Your experiences, relationships and opportunities will likely stay reasonably narrow if you can’t operate in the local language.

, One of the biggest shocks to new arrivals in Norway might be the weather. Parts of Norway are in the Arctic circle, so you should expect plenty of cold, wind and rain. The weather does vary depending on weather you live close to the coast or more inland. As a general rule, the coastal areas will have milder winters, but will experience more wind and rain throughout the year.The average winter temperature of Oslo is around -4 degrees Celsius, or 23 degree Fahrenheit. Winter snow and frosts can occur from October, all the way to April.
In the summer months you can expect milder temperatures, and even the occasional heat wave., Norway has very long days in summer that can cause problems to people who have not experienced this before. In the winter, however, the long days are replaced by long nights. The impact of this will depend where you are moving from, but it can cause problems.


In the summer in Oslo, it will generally not get any darker than twilight. The further north you go, the longer the days. If you go far enough north you will reach a point where the sun doesn’t set.
In winter, the daylight in Oslo can be as brief as six hours. In Tromsø, above the Arctic circle, the sun does not rise for six weeks., One of the potential problems with living in Norway, is the relatively high cost of living. Housing costs and eating out can be expensive, and there are relatively high levels of taxation. Be sure to spend some time thinking about housing and other essential costs, as well as how much money you can expect to earn."
"
Do not brag about yourself.,
Obey traffic laws.,
Don't ever honk the horn in a car if there is no emergency.,
Be advised that Norway is quite left-wing politically.,
Dress casually.,
Be prepared for strong opinions.,
Be prepared for egalitarian principles.,
Remember first names are okay in casual settings.,
Be on time.,
Respect personal space.,
Understand Norwegian social mores or customs.,
Keep your voice low and don't talk too much.,
Understand that Norwegian women tend to be very sexually and culturally liberated.,
It is also important to know that it extremely rude if men openly rest their eyes on the curves of a woman's body and then not redraw the look on the body when the woman notice.,
Speaking English will work in most situations.,
Remember tips are not mandatory.,
Use credit or debit cards.,
Avoid discussing religion.",How to Be Polite in Norway," Obviously it's allowed to tell about your own merits, but it's a fine line between telling and bragging. The latter is generally considered rude. Be especially careful when talking about money. When telling about your merits, try to be subtle, and don't exaggerate. However, it's perfectly OK to brag about others.;
, Norwegian traffic runs much more passively than in most other countries, even in Europe. Drivers are expected to stop at pedestrian crossings, and it is rude, dangerous and illegal not to. Always drive carefully, keep a good distance to the car in front, and be very cautious when passing by pedestrians. When overtaking bicycles, be sure you have at least two meters between you and the bike. Traffic fines are high, especially offenses for speeding and ignoring red lights (about 800 USD). Bribery of policemen is unheard of. The legal blood alcohol limit, is 0,02 percent.

, It's considered extremely rude, and could generate dangerous situations.

, Do not be afraid of bringing up the subject, but be prepared for a discussion if you strongly advocate a right-wing political opinion. (even that of the Republican party in the US.)

, Norwegians do. It is rare for people to dress up on regular week days, unless the occasion is special. This applies especially to men. Some businesses (like law firms) obviously have a dress code, but it is relatively rare in most others. This includes most offices. You will come a long way with a nice, regular sweater or t-shirt. Jeans will work in almost every situation.

, Norwegian news coverage includes large parts of the world, so don't be surprised if Norwegians have strong opinions on foreign countries politics. This applies especially to the US, and to a lesser degree the UK and other countries in Europe and Asia.

, Norwegians emphasize egalitarian principles heavily. Never treat people differently based on wealth or other factors. Be equally polite towards women as you would towards men, as well as children.

, Except for when doing business, it is perfectly OK to address people by first name only, even if you don't know them very well, especially if the circumstance is informal. It's unnecessary using titles such as Herr or Fru (Mr and Mrs).

, Punctuality is extremely important. If doing business, you should be minimum 5 minutes early.

, Do not invade people's personal space. The personal space in Norway is generally larger than most other places. Do not stand too close to others, even when queuing. A stretched arm's length is generally a good distance. Don't queue jump unless you politely ask first. Never express your own opinion unless the same opinion has already been expressed by the majority in the room, at least not until you get the hang of the social crowd. Norwegians tend to shy away from people who express opinions they disagree with.

, Keep in mind that Norwegians tend to be reserved and relatively introverted. This is not a sign of hostility, it's just the common practice. (When on a bus, most people would elect to sit down at an empty seat, rather than beside someone else.) Be prepared to take the initiative when creating relations, but be polite and discrete.

, It could be considered rude to talk excessively loud, especially in public. There are no need to whisper, just keep an eye on your volume if you tend to speak very loudly.

, In the summer time, many will dress very lightly. This is perfectly accepted, and not an invitation for men to sexually harass them. If you are from Europe or the US, you shouldn't experience any surprises., Of course, it's perfectly OK if you dress conservatively.

, Most Norwegians speak English exceptionally well, especially people in their 40's or younger. Some even speak a few words German. You might encounter difficulties if you want to talk to older people, though.

, While some travel guides advocates tipping, this is never an obligation in Norway. While some might do it if they have encountered extraordinary service, some never do. Very few Norwegian tip for just adequate service. Waiters at restaurants are paid relatively well, so there is no need. While some people accept that the taxi driver keeps the change, he is obliged to give you exact change back.

, In Norway, cash is not king. Many Norwegians pay exclusively with Debit or Credit Cards, and some enterprises even discourage paying by cash. ATMs are widespread. However, as a traveler, you are probably better off paying with cash anyway, as the fees for using your card abroad could be high.

, In Norway, religion is a personal matter. Therefore, it is a touchy subject. It is perfectly OK to discuss it on a general basis, but unless talking with a close friend, it is probably best to avoid discussing it on a personal level. Nevertheless, if you are going to bring the subject up anyway, be advised to do so discretely and be cautious advocating any strong or fundamentalist opinions. Many people would consider it rude to plainly ask them whether they consider themselves members of a particular religion. Never ever assume anything about someone's beliefs.

You must be a student. You can be either an undergraduate or graduate level student who has completed at least 1 year of study. You cannot take the internship beyond 12 months after your degree completion.
You must have between $3,000 and $4,000, depending upon if your internship is paid or unpaid, respectively.
Look on the BUNAC website's internship directory, or try to find 1 on your own. If you find an internship, then you should apply for a BUNAC sponsorship. They take applications on their site all year round. Once you secure a sponsorship, they will help you to get the appropriate visa and insurance.

, Go to your IAESTE national office to inquire about open exchanges. This program works similarly to the BUNAC program, except it is sponsored by the British Council.

, If you are from a country outside of the EEA, this Tier 2 visa is the best way for you to secure long-term work in the UK. Once you find a UK job from an international company or online, the employer must be able to prove that they could not find a local candidate.


To prove that they couldn't fill the job domestically, it must have been advertised for at least 28 days in the UK. The employer must prove that UK workers were given first opportunity to fill the job, but they were unable to find a suitable candidate within the country.
Alternatively, the job can be listed on the UK shortage occupation list. This list includes, but is not limited to, engineers, social workers, musicians, chief executives, biological scientists, chefs, nurses and physicists.

, There are a very limited number of applications granted for industry leaders, investors and other specialized workers. Apply for this visa within the specified deadlines at the UK Home Office website.


Each type of Tier 1 visa requires a different amount of personal funding. Entrepreneurs and investors are required to show proof of a set amount of money in their account.

, A limited number of visa applications are granted for people who want to register a UK branch or work for a broadcasting or newspaper company.

, Depending upon your nationality, you may be able to travel in the UK for 3 to 6 months. You may be required to show you have adequate funds in your account, return ticket and a place to stay.

Dial 00, the exit code that signals you're about to dial an international number.,
Dial 1, the US country code.,
Dial the 3-digit area code for the number you're calling in the United States.,
Dial the remaining 7 digits of the telephone number.",How to Call the United States From Denmark,"


Although 00 is the exit code for Denmark and most of Europe, other countries may require different exit codes. For example the United States, Canada and all other countries in the North American Numbering Plan use 011 as an exit code.
If you're traveling to Denmark and using a roaming international calling plan on your mobile phone, you must still dial the Denmark exit code to place an international call while in Denmark--no matter what your country of origin.;
,


The country code stays the same no matter where you're calling from. You'd dial 1 to call the United States from anywhere in the world.

,


You can't place your call without the area code. If you don't know the area code, visit nanpa.com/area_code_maps/ac_map_static.html and click on the appropriate state to pull up a map of its area codes.
United States mobile phones are usually assigned a 3-digit area code according to the area in which service was first activated. But mobile phone users can choose to keep their mobile number, including area code, when they relocate. So a mobile phone's area code isn't always representative of where the user lives.
If the 3-digit ""area code"" is 800, 888, 877 or 866, this doesn't signal anything about the location of the phone you're calling. Instead, it signifies that you're calling a toll-free number which could be routed anywhere in the United States, or even to another country.

,


All United States phone numbers--mobile and fixed--total 10 digits: the 3-digit area code and 7 following digits. There are never any leading zeroes to drop from United States area codes.

Find when they organize nights with discounts on drinks and take advantage of that.
, There are tens of free gigs in pubs around London every week; just search for them in ""Time Out London"". Do you like cinema? Do Orange Wednesdays! If you have a mobile phone from Orange, you can get 2 for 1 cinema tickets on Wednesdays. These are valid for any film and any cinema, but remember that cinemas are more expensive in Central London, especially Leicester Square., Avoid expensive restaurants in Central London. Visit the multi-ethnic neighborhoods in Greater London and enjoy the food there. Not only is it much cheaper (starting from 5 pounds for a full meal per person) but it is a lot more original. Be prepared for hot, exotic flavors!

, Consider renting a room in shared house, rather than renting your own flat. Maybe you could also move to a cheaper neighborhood. If you don’t want to live with strangers, why don’t you find a house to live with your friends? When you view a property, do not forget to negotiate the price with the landlord, as landlords are usually desperate to find tenants as soon as possible, although they will not say so! Try to reduce your utility bills. Replace your light bulbs with energy-saving ones and shop around to find the company that provides the cheapest broadband.

, Go shopping as frequently as you want. Go for a walk in Oxford Street. Visit Primark for clothes and shoes in really low prices. There are several other shops with good offers, too, especially at the end of a season. You just need to shop around a bit to find them.

, Go to Wilkinson’s for everything that you need around the house; both are very reasonable, as are Poundland and 99p shops. When it comes to food, go to supermarkets like Tesco and shop for special offers. It is also a great idea to shop locally. Try small foreign shops in your neighborhood, such as Indian shops, that sell food in bulk. Meat in halal shops is usually cheaper than at the butcher’s, although of equally good quality.

, If you want to save money and keep fit, follow the trend and buy a bike. Second-hand bikes are really inexpensive and can save you lots of money. Get the bus instead of the tube and buy a travelcard if you use it a lot. If you're a student, you get a discount. If you want to explore new places, see if you are entitled to a train travelcard. Use that to visit cities in the rest of England. Book tickets with Megabus, which has tickets for as little as 1 pound.

, If you like the arts, you will be surprised with the number of free exhibitions in London. Start with the British Museum and the National Gallery and take it from there. Take every opportunity to socialize; you will meet people from all over the world!

Hire out a car from Northern Ireland if you plan to drive around as opposed to one from the Republic of Ireland.","How to Make the Most out of Visiting Belfast, Northern Ireland"," This is unlike the Republic of Ireland where they use the Euro. For simplicity remember that Belfast uses the pound and Dublin uses the Euro;
, Winter starts in November through to February with daytime temperatures in single figures and nighttime figures can be as low as minus 3. We also get cold snaps when the temperature can drop to minus 8–10 °C (46–50 °F).


Spring lasts from March through to June and the temperatures are around 10–15 °C (50–59 °F),
Summer, well if you can call it that, last from July to September and typical temperatures for that are around 15–25 °C (59–77 °F). We do get the rare hot snap when temperatures can get up to 30 °C (86 °F). Yes we get periods of long lasting sunshine but they are rare.

Use cash.,
Use credit and debit cards.,
Use prepaid cards.,
Use traveller’s checks.",How to Exchange Money in the UK1," It is always a good idea to take some cash in the local currency with you when travelling. You will most likely need the cash to pay for transportation and food once you arrive at your destination.


Before traveling, convert your cash to the local currency. It is best to exchange your money at your own bank, first. Your bank will have lower exchange rates and fees when compared to other venues.;
, Using a credit card to exchange money can be one of the cheapest ways to spend money abroad, if done correctly. Save your money by obtaining a “travel friendly” credit or debit card. If you use your usual card abroad, you can get hit with four different types of fees: a foreign usage fee, a cash withdrawal fee, credit card interest, and flat fees. For example, your bank can charge you overseas usage fees from 2.75 to 3 percent of the amount charged to your card.Generally, though, credit and debit cards offer competitive exchange rates and are more secure than cash.Choose the best card for your trip by visiting your bank. Tell them that you will be traveling and that you would like to know if your current credit or debit card is “travel friendly” or not. If it isn’t, ask them about the cards they offer that are suited for travelling overseas.
You can also visit online comparison sites where you can get expert recommendations on which cards to use overseas.

, If you want to avoid incurring the fee charges accompanied with using a credit or debit card, think about getting a prepaid card. You can load prepaid cards in advance with cash before you travel. And, if you preload them when the exchange rate is good, you can save a lot of money. You can find prepaid cards that are designed especially for foreign travel.Choose from some popular prepaid cards: American Express GlobalTravel Card, VISA TravelMoney Card, MasterCard Prepaid Travel Card, Travelex Cash Passport Card.
Prepaid cards are not without their drawbacks, however. There are still fees that can apply depending on which card you get, such as an application fee, a withdrawal fee, an inactivity fee, or a monthly fee. Check the fine print of each prepaid card.

, Traveller’s checks are pre-printed checks with set amounts. You can use traveller’s checks to pay for things or exchange them for cash. They work very similarly to your regular banking checks. You cannot buy something that is worth more than the amount of the traveller’s check, however. You can visit a bank, a Post Office, a bureau de change, or a travel agent to purchase traveller’s checks.


One drawback of using traveller’s checks is that there are a limited number of places that will exchange them for cash. Therefore, you will have to do some searching if you want to exchange them.
Another drawback is that you pay fees when you buy the checks, and a commission when you use them.

"
"
Visit a bank or a building society.,
Go to a Post Office.,
Find a bureau de change or a travel agent.,
Use an ATM.",How to Exchange Money in the UK2," You can exchange your cash or withdrawal money from your credit or debit card at a bank or a building society. Building societies are very similar to banks. Some notable banks to exchange your money at in the UK are the Bank of England, Bank of Ireland, Citibank, Barclays, Halifax, Nationwide, HSBC, the Bank of Scotland, and the Allied Irish Bank.


Exchanging your money at a bank or a building society is one of the better ways to exchange money in terms of fewer and lower fees. However, some banks will not exchange your money if you are not a customer.
You will need identification such as your passport to exchange or withdrawal money.

, Post Offices will also exchange money for you. Post Offices are convenient places to exchange your money because there are a lot of locations. They are also open longer than your average bank. They typically open earlier and close later. Most Post Offices open at 7:30 a.m. and close at 10:30 p.m.With a Post Office, you can also order your money online. The office will have your money ready for you to pick up once you get there at the Travel Money counter. You just need to bring your passport and the credit card you used to buy the money with.

, A bureau de change or a local travel agent will also exchange your money for you. Always enquire about the fees, commissions, and exchanges rates when exchanging your money. Some places have more competitive exchange rates, fewer fees, and lower commissions than others.


The bureau de change at ferry ports or airports are some of the most expensive places to buy currency., You can also exchange your money at an ATM. Before leaving for your trip, make sure your ATM card is linked to the PLUS, Maestro, or Cirrus networks. These networks will enable you to exchange money almost anywhere. The PLUS network is associated with VISA, while the Maestro and Cirrus networks are associated with MasterCard. Make sure the ATM has these logos before exchanging money.Keep in mind that ATMs abroad, especially ones in Europe, do not accept ATM cards with PINs that are longer than four digits and PINS that are letters. If your PIN is longer than four digits and is composed of letters, contact your bank to have your PIN changed.While exchanging money at an ATM is convenient and can be cheaper, it can also be risky in terms of your information being safeguarded. Therefore, it is best to exchange your money at an ATM that is in a major bank.
Before traveling, check with your bank about international withdrawal fees. These fees can range from $1 to $6, or can be a set percentage of the total withdrawal."
"
Monitor the exchange rate.,
Sort your money before you leave.,
Notify your bank.",How to Exchange Money in the UK3," Many companies will sell you foreign currency, but you need to be aware of these companies' exchange rates. Some companies have higher exchange rates than others. Additionally, exchange rates are constantly changing. Check with your own bank first. Your own bank usually offers lower exchange rates to its customers.


You can monitor exchange rates by downloading apps on your phone or computer that specifically do this. For example, XE Currency is a free app that works for both Androids and iPhones. Currency and Currency+ are both free exchange rate apps that work on iPhones. Exchange Rates and Easy Currency Converter are both free exchange rate apps that work on Androids.
There are also exchange rate monitor services on the Internet that will alert you if a rate has changed through e-mail or other notifications.

, Before you leave, determine how much money you will need for your whole trip. Then, calculate how much pocket money you will need upon arriving for transportation, food, and other immediate expenses. Also, remember to factor in exchange rates and fees when calculating how much money you will need. Exchange your money at home before you leave abroad.It is always best to have a variety of payment options, i.e., cash, card, checks, because if you lose one, you will still have other ways to exchange your money.

, Before traveling, always notify your bank that you will be traveling to your destination. This will prevent the bank from putting a hold on your card for suspicious charges. Call your bank’s toll-free number and notify them about where and when you will be traveling.

Start your flat search 3 months before your move date, this will enable you to get a feel for the rental market and what you get for your money.,

Don't let a letting agent talk you into signing into a contract that you are not sure about, walk away, or at the least sleep on it.

Before dialing specific digits to connect you to your UK contact, you will need to dial the exit code specific to the country you are dialing out of.


There is no single exit code that works with every country. You will need to find out the specific exit code to use for your country. Note, however, that some countries do share exit codes with others.
The exit code is always dialed first. As such, the basic format to use is: EC-xx-xxxxxxxxxx, with “EC” standing for “exit code.”
Example: The exit for the United States is “011.” When dialing the UK from the US, you would begin by dialing 011-xx-xxxxxxxxxx.;
, The country code for the entire United Kingdom is ""44."" Dial this immediately after your exit code in order to direct the phone call to the UK.Note that this country code is shared by all countries within the UK.

There's more to the UK than London.",How to Adapt to British Culture," Many of the long established stereotypes are not relevant in the UK today. Don't assume that everyone is going to fall into the category of the beer swilling, rotten-toothed tea addict. Abandoning pre-conceived ideas of people and culture will allow you to be more open-minded and readily able to assimilate the culture you find yourself in.;
, The United Kingdom is comprised of different countries (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) and numerous different regions that all have their very own and very different traditions, dialect and even language. Understanding that culture in a highland village will not be the same as a southern English spa town will help you to avoid making mistakes and generalizations.

, The United States is not only a huge country but they are used to bigger cars, houses and spaces. Like many European nations, the UK does not have the luxury of space. Houses, apartments(flats), cars and appliances are all smaller than you are accustomed to, so become more familiar with smaller areas.

, The Public house is a very important part of British culture and nothing will immerse you in more than a good old fashioned pint of beer. Students, work colleagues, friends and family meet in the pub and it is used as a focal point of social contact.

, Adapt by blending into the crowd. Always apologize for bumping into someone, even if it was their fault, as it makes you out to be a kinder person. Respect people's personal space and always wait in line (called a queue in the UK).

, One of the most confusing aspects of British culture is humor. Bantering or ""taking the mick"" are all ways to describe making fun of someone but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Teasing someone is a common way to show affection. As one Briton put it, ""you never make fun of someone you don't like.""

, The British drive on the left side of the road. Be sure that you do so or the consequences can be ghastly. Also, the cars in the UK have the steering wheel on the right side, so you need get used to this as well. Be especially careful with your turns and remember that right turns in the U.K. cross opposite traffic in the same way that left turns do in the U.S. and other countries that drive on the right.

, The British use different words and pronounce words differently. Look around on the internet or buy books which have lots or help about the particular words which the British use.

, Many UK cities are ethnically diverse. Birmingham, Leicester and London, amongst other cities, all have large Asian populations. Polish influences are spreading around the country too. It's not all shepherd's pie and bangers and mash, have a curry, shop in a Polish Grocery Store, get a kebab or have a Chinese Takeaway. Manchester, London and Newcastle to name a few cities have great Chinatowns., History, antiquity and 'retro' are abundant in the UK. Many houses, public buildings, churches, cathedrals and commercial buildings in the UK are considerably older than anyone from the US will be used to.
, Although London is an excellent city and the most popular in the United Kingdom, there are many other cities filled with culture and wonder. Nottingham is a fantastic city to visit. It's certainly smaller than London, but you'll immediately find everything is much cheaper there, as it is in many places outside of London. Jay McGuinness from the popular British boy band The Wanted is from Nottingham. Also, despite its bad reputation, Birmingham is a great city, not so much round the outer areas but the city centre is full of shops with the amazing architecture, Chinatown and the canal. The lush green hillsides, dramatic moors, wide expansions of marsh land and stunning coastal countryside are defining features of the UK, and should be explored.

Know that there is no table service.,
Know the art of getting served.,
Things that will get you served slower than average are:


Shouting or whistling
Waving money
Leaning right over the bar
Being noticeably drunk (unless also attractive, in which case this may be a positive feature)
Being small
Being clearly a part of an enormous group and therefore about to try to buy seventeen drinks, a third of which you’ve forgotten already and another third of which you’re going to have to shout back to your friends to find out what they want
Sounding English (in Scotland)
Sounding Scottish (in England)
Sounding French (universal)

",How to Buy Drinks in Pubs in the United Kingdom1," You will never get table service in a pub for drinks. Well, let’s not say never. You will get table service in the occasional snooty London wine bar. Suffice to say that if you don’t look at the drinks menu and think, “Are these prices for bottles or glasses?” then you’re not getting table service. You’re also unlikely to find a drinks menu on your table––to find out which drinks they have, you generally need to go to the bar and look at the beer taps. They may also have some sort of board on the wall showing beer and wine. On the up side you will never be expected to tip for drinks. Once you’ve decided what you and your party want to drink, someone will have to go to the bar and buy the round.;
, Customers waiting at the bar are rarely served in the order in which they arrived. The most reliable method for being served promptly is to stand close to the bar (perhaps leaning gently on it, but not right over it) and smile as often as possible at a bartender of your choice. Things that will get you served faster than average are:


Being attractive, and of the opposite sex to the bar person
Being tall
Knowing the bar person

Fill out the remainder of the form.,
Send the form.,
Attend the citizenship ceremony.",How to Become a UK Citizen1," The UK government provides a copy of this form on their website. It is called Form AN, or Application for naturalisation as a British citizen. You can also request this form at many local government offices, such as a city or county council.


If the council offers a nationality checking service, you can pay a fee to have someone check your form for errors.;
, Indefinite leave, also called settlement, means there is no restriction on how long you can stay in the country. In order to receive citizenship, you must have spent at least the last 12 months under indefinite leave.You must also plan to continue living in the UK.


To see whether you can apply for indefinite leave, visit this interactive gov.uk web page. The requirements vary depending on your type of visa.
If you are a citizen of a country in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, you will need a permanent resident card or another document that proves permanent residence., To pass this requirement automatically, you must have entered the UK as a resident (or entered the UK armed forces) at least five years ago, and spent no more than 450 days of the past five years outside the country.The UK government will often overlook total absences up to 480 days.


Up to 730 days may be allowed if you have a family and home in the UK, your application meets all other requirements, and you have lived in the UK at least seven years.Up to 900 days may be allowed if you meet the same criteria but have lived in the UK at least eight years, or if the absences occurred due to you or your spouse or civil partner serving in the UK armed forces, or due to business travel for a UK job.

, Officially your time outside the country over the past 365 days should total no more than 90 days, but up to 100 days is usually not a problem. Up to 179 days may be allowed if:You have a family and home in the UK

and either meet every other requirement in the application.

or have a compelling reason for your absence (e.g. UK business travel, UK armed forces).
Exceptions for 180 days and above are rare, and require all three of the criteria above.

, You must be at least eighteen years old to apply for naturalised citizenship. You are also required to answer all the questions in section 3 of the application form, ""Good Character"". Note that these questions apply to events in any country, not just the UK, and include all civil and criminal penalties including minor traffic offenses. If you answer yes to any of these questions, describe the events in detail in the space at the end of the section, and on additional sheets if needed.Serious crimes or unresolved bankruptcy usually lead to a rejected application.


If you have court endorsements on your UK driving license, print a copy of your record and attach it to your application.
You do not need to describe family legal proceedings such as divorce. However, you must mention offences committed by your children, as well as any court orders against them.

, If you are over 65, you do not need to pass the life in the UK test, or prove your English proficiency. If you are under 65 but have a long-term physical or mental condition that prevents you from passing these tests, check the box on your application to claim exemption. Describe why in the ""Further Information"" section on page 22. Include a letter from a doctor with your application.Depression and other conditions that respond to treatment are usually not enough to claim exemption.
No other exemptions apply, even if you used one for your settlement application., This test has 24 multiple choice questions on UK traditions, history, law, and values. You must get 18 of these right in 45 minutes.To schedule the test for a £50 fee, visit this government website. After taking the test, wait in the building until you receive a graded copy of the test and a letter confirming that you passed. You'll need to attach this letter to your application. If you passed the test already as part of your application for settlement, you may attach the old letter instead of taking the test again.


The official study guide is called Life in the United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship.The photo ID you bring to the test must be the same one you use for your citizenship application. Write the exact name from your ID on the test. You will also need proof of your address.

, You can prove your English proficiency by passing an English test through the Home Office at level B1 CEFR or higher. Alternatively, contact UK NARIC to request the necessary documents to prove that your degree earned in English-taught courses meets this requirement. Finally, a passport from a country with majority English speakers will usually meet this requirement.If you plan to meet this requirement in Welsh or Gaelic instead, include a cover letter describing your proficiency in the language.

, As described on the form, one of these must be a British citizen. The other can be any nationality, but should have some professional standing, such as a civil servant position or a membership in a professional organization.Read the other requirements on the form carefully and find two people who qualify.

, This includes personal information, contact details, and employment information. Follow the instructions on the form to attach any applicable documents. All applicants should include a biometric residence permit or a waiver of the BRP; you should have one of these from your application of settlement.

, If you are in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, or most other countries, send the application to ""Department 1 / UKVI / The Capital / New Hall Place / Liverpool / L3 9PP"". If you are in a British overseas territory, send the application to the governor.Include a fee along with the form. For up-to-date information on how much the fee is, refer to this web page.

, You will typically receive a response within six months. If your application was accepted, the response will tell you who to contact to schedule the ceremony. You must attend a citizenship ceremony within 90 days to receive citizenship. At the ceremony, you will swear an oath of allegiance to the sovereign and pledge your loyalty to the UK."

Buy drinks in rounds.,
Do not try to pay anyone back for a round of drinks.,
Do not try to opt out of the system.,
Never offer to pay if someone else goes to the bar.",How to Buy Drinks in Pubs in the United Kingdom2," Brits always buy drinks in rounds. Even if they’re with people they don’t know, they will buy drinks in rounds. This system, whilst clearly open to abuse, has worked for several hundred years due to a tacit agreement by the entire population concerning certain rules. If drinking with Brits, you must adhere to these rules.

, Even if there is not a chance of you having another one that night, you shouldn’t feel guilty about not being able to get a round in. On most evenings, someone will end up slightly out of pocket. Perhaps you’ll be with the same people drinking every night; perhaps the guy who just bought two rounds in a row will be someone you never see again. The assumption is that over a lifetime these will balance out such that nobody really ends up out of pocket. Don’t feel bad about accepting drinks from strangers, and don’t feel bad about buying them.

, The only valid reason anyone may opt out of buying rounds is if they’re driving. Even then, they may be required to nominally take part in the system with an unwritten agreement that their round won’t come up as often as anyone else’s. If you’re intending only having one drink for reasons other than driving then you must still buy rounds for everyone else. This is your penalty for not drinking.

, Even if you can find a willing co-conspirator, this sort of behaviour is regarded as being out of order. No matter how rich you are, an important part of buying a round involves trying to remember the drinks everyone wanted, squeezing your way to the bar, shouting vainly at the barman, collecting your dripping-wet change, trying to squeeze in between the barflies to collect your drinks and then attempting to carry six beers back to the table via some ferrying system without crashing into anyone or spilling them.

Your partner's current UK passport, or a copy of every page of the passport (including blank ones), or his or her registration or naturalisation certificate proving citizenship.The marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate. If you have a different type of official partnership, or if you are part of a homosexual couple in a country that does not recognize your partnership, you may still meet these requirements. Contact the UK Visas and Immigration office for advice., To qualify for citizenship, you must have entered the UK at least three years ago, and lived here for most of the past three years. You are allowed 270 days of absence over this period, but up to 300 days may be overlooked.If you have a family and home in the UK, and your application meets all other requirements, this number may increase:Up to 450 days over the past three years if you have four years of residency, or up to 540 days if you have five years of residency. A compelling reason for absence (travel for UK armed forces or UK business) may replace the residency requirements.

, You do not need to meet this requirement if your spouse or civil partner works for the UK government, or in designated service.This includes service with certain groups not directly under the UK government, such as the British Red Cross, a member of the Council of Voluntary Welfare Work, or NATO., Apart from these differences, the application for citizenship is the same as for foreigners living in the UK. Fill out Form AN and attach any additional documents or extra information according to the instructions. If you have any questions, refer to the instructions above for foreigners living in the UK.

Know if you qualify as a child under 18.,
Contact UKVI for other situations.",How to Become a UK Citizen3," A British national can hold a UK passport but does not have the automatic right to live and work in the UK. There are quite a few laws that grant British nationality to citizens of current and former overseas British territories, and to people born in those territories who would otherwise be stateless. In some cases the spouse or child of a national may also be able to apply for nationality.If you're not sure whether you qualify for British nationality, contact the UK Visas and Immigration office.

, If you are a British national, you usually qualify to fill out a simpler citizenship application form. You can find these forms at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-visa-forms#citizenship. Choose a form based on your status:


B(OTA) if you have another citizenship.
B(OS) if you have no other citizenship.
S1, S2, or S3 if you are a stateless person. (See form instructions to find out which form applies to you.)
EM if you are a resident of Hong Kong and were a resident on 4 February 1997.
RS1 if you previously renounced UK citizenship.
UKM (mother) or UKF (father) if you had a British parent but do not have citizenship due to laws at the time of your birth.

, You can register as a citizen if you are below this age and qualify for one of these reasons:If one of your parents has or acquired indefinite leave since you were born, apply with form MN1.
If neither parent is a UK citizen or here on indefinite leave, but you lived in the UK from birth until the age of 10, apply with form T.
If at least one parent was a UK citizen at the time of your birth, or was here on indefinite leave, you are automatically a citizen. There is no need to apply.

, If none of the above instructions describe your situation, but you have some other connection to the UK, contact the UK Visas and Immigration Office. There are many corner cases that may make you a British national.The office of the Home Secretary also has the ability to grant citizenship to anyone under 18, so a compelling case may allow you to bypass the official requirements.Most people 18 or older must apply using the regular process for foreigners living in the UK (see above).

Wait for your certificate.,
Know how to use your new title.",How to Become a Lord1," You can legally purchase novelty titles for as low as £29.99 ($45.87), but these titles are essentially valid in name only and don't serve any practical benefit.


Under United Kingdom law, you're legally allowed to call yourself whatever you want as long as you aren't defrauding anyone or using the name change to evade some type of legal responsibility. In that sense, novelty titles are technically legal, even if they aren't ""real"" in the most traditional sense.
Instead of a title, you're actually purchasing a name change. You would not become ""Lord John Doe."" Instead, it would be more accurate to address yourself as ""Mr. Lord J. Doe.""Novelty titles do not grant you a seat in the House of Lords. Some are attached to small plots of land, but even these do not give you any land rights. The vast majority cannot be inherited by future generations, either.;
, There are plenty of companies that sell novelty titles, so spend some time looking at several of them before making a final decision.


Use your favorite Internet search engine to look for agencies and other companies selling novelty titles. Try to pull at least a half-dozen to a dozen options from your search results, then weed through these options carefully.
Pay special attention to three qualities when you compare companies: legitimacy and cost.
It may also be worthwhile to consider where your money goes. Some companies put the funds toward conservation work on specific estates, so in essence, you're making a donation and receiving the novelty title in return., Many companies offering novelty titles are legitimate and fairly priced for the service they provide, but beware of false companies or those claiming to offer more than legally possible.


If a company claims to offer legitimate titles that come with land rights or other formal benefits, you should automatically be suspicious.
Check the contact information. Companies that have a physical address and an actual phone number are more reliable than those with nothing but a Web presence.Look for reviews provided on external websites, but don't rely on reviews provided on the company website itself since these will likely be skewed in a favorable direction.

, Each company may claim to offer slightly different packages, and some companies even offer multiple package levels. Weigh the cost and benefits of each option before making your final decision.


Some companies may allow you to choose from several titles, including ""Lord,"" ""Baron,"" ""Duke,"" ""Earl,"" or ""Viscount."" None of these options offer any greater benefit than the others, though, so weigh these options based on preference alone.
Novelty titles usually sell for prices between £18.95 and £995 ($28.97 and $1521.29).
When looking at the cost between companies, those offering titles at the lowest cost may actually be best as long as the company itself is legitimate. Since no novelty title offers any practical benefit, spending a small fortune when buying one would be ill-advised.
Some novelty titles are connected to plots of land, but you need to read the fine print. In most cases, these titles only purchase plots that are 1 foot (30.5 cm) wide by 1 foot (30.5 cm) long, so you aren't getting much.

, Once you make your decision, notify the seller and obtain the correct form. Fill out the information completely and accurately, then turn the form back in and pay any associated fees.


In most cases, the application can be completed in 30 minutes or less, especially if you're choosing one of the lowest budget options. You'll need to provide contact information and some basic legal information about yourself, but most applications don't require much private or detailed information.

, The exact amount of wait time can vary by company, but in most cases, you should receive your novelty ""Certificate of Title"" by mail within several weeks.


Legitimate companies will review your application over the course of several days to verify that there are no legal restrictions preventing you from obtaining a novelty title. Since nearly any adult can purchase one, though, you shouldn't anticipate a rejection.
When your certificate arrives, it will likely seem more formal than it actually is. It should say something along the lines of ""Title Deed Poll,"" and your new, titled name will appear in the center of the paper.

, Since this title is little more than a name change, you are legally permitted to address yourself as a lord as long as you do not do so in a fraudulent manner. Using your title to defraud others can get you into some serious legal trouble, though.


You can add your new title to your passport, driver's license, bank account, credit card, and most other legal or formal accounts by filling out the appropriate paperwork for those documents. Effectively, though, you're only adding the title to those documents in the same way you'd change your given name on them.
Many sellers of novelty titles also claim that you can give your title during your everyday life in an attempt to get a little “extra” service, like the best restaurant reservations or better seats with an airline. You can technically do so without getting in trouble, but the key is in how you present yourself. Simply stating your new “title” and letting others react as they see fit is legal. Stating your “title,” making false claims of authority because of it, and demanding preferential treatment is illegal.

"
"
Know what to look for.,
Seek legal counsel.,
File the paperwork.,
Use your new title.",How to Become a Lord2," Some formal societies and other trustworthy agencies sell ""Lord of the Manor"" titles instead of novelty titles. Instead of purchasing a small plot of land, you'll purchase an entire estate attached to a specific title.Unlike novelty titles, purchasing an actual title as ""Lord of the Manor"" can offer some benefits, including fishing and mining rights. These titles are also slightly more prestigious than novelty titles, but the practice of buying titles is still looked down upon by most actual aristocrats.
There are multiple organizations and societies selling these titles, so it might be beneficial to shop around. If you want to play it safe, though, your best option is to check for available titles with The Manorial Society, one of the leading auctioneers of authentic British titles.
Legitimate titles usually start at approximately £5,000 ($7,641), but depending on the prestige of the title itself, you could end up paying up to six figures. One of the largest title sales in recent history cost £171,000 ($261,268).

, Before purchasing any title, it's a good idea to use a solicitor to validate the specific title you're interested in purchasing.


There are plenty of scams, especially if you choose to purchase this type of title from an unverified source. Moreover, title law can be complex, and it's easy to get scammed into a situation where you'll end up purchasing less than you intend. If you're not an expert in United Kingdom property law, legal counsel is strongly advised.

, If everything is legitimate and legal, you can purchase the title at the specified cost. You'll need to fill out some formal paperwork and pay the fee to the seller in the method they specify.


Since Lord of the Manor titles are more complex than novelty titles, you should expect to spend considerable time filling out much more paperwork. Among other documents, make sure that you register the estate with the United Kingdom Land Registry department.

, Once you've made the purchase and have your title deed in hand, you can formally use your new title on your accounts and other legal documents.


Note the proper form. When you're only a Lord of the Manor, you're not supposed to use the title ""Lord"" in front of your name. Instead, use it as a suffix (e.g. ""John Doe, Lord of the Manor of X,"" rather than ""Lord John Doe"").
These titles do not grant you membership into the House of Lords, but many of them can be passed down to future generations. As Lord of the Manor, you own a specific piece of property, and that property can be willed or transferred to others just as any other property could be.

"
"
Receive an appointment to the House of Lords.Members of the House of Lords receive their seat through official appointment.,
Marry into an inherited title.",How to Become a Lord3," There is no way to buy your way into this type of title.


The Prime Minister can nominate someone for a life peerage, and if the Queen agrees with this nomination, that person will receive a title on appointment. Those who receive this title usually receive it for exemplary service to the country, and the title cannot be inherited by future generations.
Law lords must be recommended by the Lord Chancellor, nominated by the Prime Minister, and appointed by the Queen. To become a lord in this manner, you'll need to become a judge in the court of appeals first. This title cannot be inherited by future generations, either.
Bishops and archbishops can also become Members of the House of Lords. There are 26 seats open for these religious officials, and when one retires, the newly opened seat is passed to the most senior bishop without a title.

, Lords with inherited titles do not become Members of the House of Lords, but receiving a title in this manner is more welcome among the aristocracy than purchasing your title as Lord of the Manor.


These titles are typically passed onto the eldest son in a family, but if the family has daughters and no sons, you could obtain the lordship title by marrying one of the daughters of the current entitled lord.

Define international development law.",How to Define International Development Law," When seeking to define a specific body of law, it is helpful to consider what that body of law aims to achieve. If you can understand what a particular area of the law is trying to accomplish—i.e., the purpose behind the law, or the reason it exists—it is easier to define that body of law in a way that differentiates it from others. In this way, you can arrive at a useful definition.;
, Many, including the United Nations, believe that the rule of law and international development law are closely related.That is, it is necessary to advance and encourage the rule of law around the world in order the achieve the sort of responsible global development international development law aims to achieve. The rule of law refers to upholding the following principles:That everyone—including the government, its officials, and private entities— is subject to and accountable under the same law.
That laws are published, stable, applied evenly, and fair to everyone.
That laws protect fundamental human rights.
That the process by which laws are enacted and enforced is fair and transparent.
That justice is delivered efficiently and fairly by an independent judiciary that has adequate resources and reflects the community of which it is a part.

, A key goal of international development law is to ensure that peoples of all nations—especially those recovering from extended conflict or despotic rule—have access to fair, efficient, and accountable legal institutions.In many cases, these nations do not have systems in place to promote the rule of law, and so this area of law seeks to remedy this through encouraging constitutional reform and the independence/integrity of judges.


This also includes promoting greater access to the political process, in addition to restoring lost confidence in existing institutions., All the institution building in the world is not worth much if people do not have access to the benefits these institutions provide. International development law also seeks to ensure that all people—especially those who have been traditionally disenfranchised like children or the poor—are able to take advantage of judicial institutions (such as courts) to protect their rights and dignity.One way this area of the law seeks to achieve this aim is by making people aware of the rights they possess., While economic development around the world is important, it is even more important given current environmental concerns that this development be achieved in a responsible, sustainable way. International development law seeks to protect natural resources, ensure everyone has access to water, address climate change, promote responsible agriculture and investment in clean energy, and preserve biodiversity so that nations develop in a way that does not further damage the environment., International development, by encouraging sustainable development coupled with the advancement of the rule of law, ultimately seeks to ensure the basic human rights of every person in the world are protected.This includes everything from the eradication of poverty and hunger, to promoting economic growth, to ensuring peoples of all nations have the right to determine their own destiny on the world stage.The three main goals of the United Nations are peace & security, human rights, and development.The goals of international development law encompass all of these.

, Before you can define what constitutes international development law, you must first try to define law itself, of which international development law is a species. This is a complicated task in its own right, as scholars and philosophers have debated whether law is a collection of binding rules on a particular group of people, a reflection of societal customs, a means of ensuring a particular group stays in power, or a set of rules handed down from a divine power.For our purposes, think about the analytical definition of law put forth by well-regarded legal professor Arthur Goodhart, that ""law"" can be defined as ""a body of rules recognized as binding within an organized society.""Think of law as the ""family"" in the hierarchy of biological classification. International law would be the ""genus,"" and international development law would be the ""species."", With the above in mind, it is also helpful when trying to define international development law to define international law. This can be defined as the body of law that nation-states, international organizations, and multinational corporations consider binding on them, along with the sanctions carried with it.However, it is important to note that an important element of international law—when it is applied to nation-states—is consent.


This means that, because international law recognizes that each nation-state is its own sovereign power (basically meaning that a nation-state is the sole authority for what happens within its territorial borders),each state must consent to the application of the principles of international law in order for them to be enforceable against that state.

, With all of the above in mind, we can now attempt to define international development law. It is not simply law concerned with international development. While this area of the law is constantly evolving and is not yet well-defined, consider the following definition: international development law is the species of international law that concerns itself with the international regulation and advancement of national development, in addition to the development and protection of shared global resources.A key part of this definition is the concept of ""national development."" As explored above, this involves the economic, political, environmental, social, and cultural development of a nation-state.
Older definitions refer to international development law as ""the law regulating the relations among sovereign but economically unequal states"" or ""the international law of the modern era of the development of mankind."""

Know how to eat.,
Know where you'll sleep.","How to Live with a Local Family in Barcelona, Spain"," It is important to know basic words such as hello ""hola"" (oh-lah), goodbye ""adiós"" (ah-dee-os), and thank you ""gràcies"" (groh-thee-es) in order for basic communication to take place. Speaking in English is always easier, but if you intend to live like a Barcelona local (called a Barcelonan or Barcelonian) you must speak Catalan, or at least Spanish, when possible.


Learning a bit of Catalan is always a good idea. Most people growing up in Barcelona were taught both Catalan and Spanish, and speaking at least some Catalan is a form of respect, showing you are attempting to assimilate to their culture. Catalan and Spanish are closely related, but still quite distinct. Some basic words are the same, such as hello ""hola"" (oh-lah), but others are different, such as goodbye ""adéu"" (ah-do) and thank you ""gràcies"" (groh-thee-es).

Spanish is spoken differently in Catalonia (and much of Spain) than in Latin America. They pronounce ""s"" and soft ""c"" (a ""c"" is soft when it comes before ""e"" or ""i"") as ""th"", as in ""gràcies"" above.;
, On top of taking short showers, make sure to keep the bathroom neat. Most families expect and appreciate cleanliness.

, Electric and water bills are expensive in this part of the world.


Remember to turn off lights when not using them. Some host families prefer that you unplug electronic devices when not using them, to guarantee that electricity is not being used.
Showering once a day is important to maintaining a respectful relationship with your host family. The same goes for shaving and brushing your teeth. Specifically for men, when you shave your face, make sure to plug the sink and fill it with water instead of running hot water the entire time you shave. When brushing your teeth, make sure to only turn the water on when you really need it. Do not run the water while brushing your teeth.
Washing your clothes is different as well, unless you use a laundromat. Dryers are not often used in Barcelona — clothes are washed and air dried to save water and electricity — and so doing laundry is a much longer process than it is in other countries. If doing laundry is not your favorite chore, it is worth paying for a laundromat and getting it done in a few hours, or you may find yourself without clothes for days at a time.
Try to reuse clothes, although it may seem unpalatable. It is worth having clothes to wear instead of waking up and realising you have nothing to wear.

, Eating in Spanish homestays can vary between houses, but in most homes you are provided two meals a day, breakfast and dinner. It is the host family's responsibility to cook meals for you, especially dinner. If you plan on not eating dinner at home, make sure to notify someone in the family at least a few hours prior to dinner.


Make sure to eat either a big lunch or various snacks, because breakfast is not a big meal, as in other countries, but usually consists of tea, coffee, and / or a small pastry. Meals usually consist of an appetizer, a main course, and then dessert. Be ready for a lot of olives, olive oil, and ham. Spaniards generally do not use butter when cooking, but prefer olive oil, which is much healthier.
Having a meal in Barcelona is much different than having a meal elsewhere. Meals are seen as social gatherings that may last for hours, and may include long walks and bar-hopping.
The daily rhythm is different in Spain. Dinner starts around 9 PM or later, and many do not go to sleep until well after 1 AM, due to the famous siesta, or midday nap, practised throughout Spain. Businesses are often closed during the siesta, so be prepared to adjust.

, Homestay families will give you a bedroom, usually consisting of a bed, dresser, and possibly more if you are lucky, such as a desk and a lamp or two. This is usually your living space, somewhat like a dormitory.


Make sure to keep your bedroom neat and tidy, as no one appreciates messy bedrooms.

Make the most of it.",How to Travel Around the World," This will be much cheaper than booking a dozen one-way flights. The two largest airline alliances are Star Alliance and Oneworld. The Star Alliance is the bigger alliance.


Star Alliance is based on how many miles you travel and they offer passes in 29,000, 34,000 or 39,000 miles increments. To put that in context, 29,000 miles (47,000 km) you will roughly get 3 continents (outside of the United States), 34,000 miles (55,000 km) will get you 4 continents and 39,000 will get you 5 or 6 continents. The more miles you do, the more destinations you can see and vice versa. Each pass allows up to 15 stopovers (a stopover is considered 24 hours in one destination) and you can get the ticket in first, business, or economy class. Star Alliance also requires passengers to start and end in the same country, though not necessarily in the same city. (There are also passes which are limited to geographic regions in the world.)Oneworld offers two different pass options: one that is segment based and the other that is mileage based. Global Explorer is Oneworld’s more conventional, mileage-based ticket. There are three levels – 26,000, 29,000 and 39,000 miles in economy class, as well as a 34,000 in business and first class. Just like the Star Alliance mileage-based RTWs, all miles are counted, including overland segments.Air travel is generally the most expensive way to travel. Use flight comparison websites like Travelsupermarket, Skyscanner and Kayak or flight brokers such as Travelocity, Expedia and Opodo. Pay close attention to restrictions. Many ""Around-the-World"" tickets mandate that you must always be travelling in the same direction, eg. L.A. to London to Moscow. You could not go L.A. to Paris to London. This takes significantly more preparation.

;
, If you have good credit, aren't afraid to use credit cards and have some savings, you can score thousands and thousands of miles to pay for your airfare.


There are tons of offers out there--most banks have some version of a credit card that has partnered up with an airline, such as the American Airlines Citi card.You have to spend a certain amount of money in a set period of time, but the rewards can be huge--tens of thousands of miles. You'll need around 120,000 to get an RTW ticket.

, For most of us, frequent flyer miles just aren't an option. It requires a lot of forethought and money. Luckily, there are plenty of cheap options -- and they're often more interesting, leading to more memorable experiences.



For train travel: In the US, you can travel by rail with Amtrak (if you booked in advance, it can fit any budget). For non-EU citizens in Europe, look into Eurail passes; for EU citizens, Interrail passes are a good bet. In Asia, the Trans-Siberian railway goes from Moscow to Beijing. There you can connect to Shanghai and onto Tokyo.

A Global Eurail pass is around $500 (€390) and will get you to 24 different countries.
Moscow to Beijing on the Siberian railway (with stops in Irkutsk and Ulaanbaatar) costs $2100 (€1635) for the no-frills, 16-day trip. For each extra person, the cost lowers.



For bus/coach: Greyhound is the line to travel in the US. The European equivalent is Eurolines -- where you can travel between 50 or so cities. And Megabus actually operates on both sides of the lake, only going intercity, though.

All Greyhound buses are equipped with air conditioning, an on-board restroom, reclining seats with headrests, footrests and tinted windows. In addition,buses make rest stops every few hours, and meal stops are scheduled as close to normal meal times as possible.Lille to London through Eurolines can be as little as $36 (€28) one-way. If you're only visiting a handful of cities, it can be a good alternative to Eurail. They also offer a free luggage allowance of two medium-sized bags.



For ship/ferry travel: Cruises can be a frugal option of you think about the money you're saving on accommodation and food. Some companies even offer operate transatlantic cruises; ferrying from New York to Hamburg, you can feel like you're on the Titanic!

, The last thing you want to do is to get stuck in Saigon getting yelled at by a man who tells you that you have to go back to Hong Kong. In certain countries, you might have to pay an exorbitant fee to get a visa immediately, but it's hands down best to know what paperwork you have to have.


The length of your stay and your citizenship are both important factors. For most Westerners, it's easy to assume you can go wherever you want. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Do your research well ahead of time--it can take weeks to get a visa approved. And if you're exiting and re-entering a country, know that process, too. You may need a different type of visa.

, Of course, if you have family and friends in the area, stay with them. But if they're all back home, hotels and hostels are the standard option. Some hostels are slightly fishy, so do your research beforehand.


Don't let the one bad hostel ruin the whole bunch. There are quite a few reputable chains and you don't have to go wandering up a dark alley to find one. Hostelling International makes finding one easy and just like booking a 4-star hotel. If you're willing to share accommodation with strangers, you can really get a bang out of your buck. And you might meet some fascinating people.

, Though it may seem too good to be true, couch surfing has a huge following and is a completely legit form of travel. Couchsurfing can set you up with people just like you all over the world.


If you're willing to stay a bit longer, consider woofing. You'll work on an organic farm for as little as a couple of weeks in exchange for a roof over your head and a some meals. You can build up your skills and get much more into the culture than if you stayed in a hotel, frequenting your mini bar.

, Even better than couch surfing, house sitting has entire networks now that let you stay in a place for free just to feed the cat. On many house sitting sites, for an initial fee, you can put up your listing (and don't forget to sell yourself) and meet people looking to leave their home in trustworthy hands.


Understandably, there are far more people looking to house sit than house sitters. When you sign up, do some research on creating a striking profile. Think of it as a job interview where you're in a pool of thousands of applicants (because you are). Set yourself apart from the herd in whatever way you can.

, Unless you have your own personal assistant laying down rose petals 4 paces ahead of you that can carry your 12-piece luggage set, you'll want to pack as lightly as possible. There will be a time (or two or three or four) when you have to carry it all around. It could be between checkout and check-in times for a few hours or it could end up being all day when your hotel reservation gets lost or your flight gets delayed.


In addition to a few basic sets of clothes, some reading material, some hygienic products, and small electronics, make sure to bring an international plug adapter. You'll be incredibly grateful when you're stuck in Phnom Penh with a dead computer needing to book the next leg of your trip.

, Based on where you are going, how long you will be there and whether the country is 1st, 2nd or 3rd world, you'll need a matching budget. There will always be unexpected expenses, so add a solid ""for emergency"" category.


Obviously, first world countries are the most expensive (Europe, Canada, USA, Japan). Second world countries are a bit harder to define, but are usually somewhat developed (Mexico, Eastern Europe, China, Egypt). Third world countries are the cheapest but most difficult places to travel (most of Africa, Bolivia, Peru, SE Asia).

, Going around the world can be as dangerous as you let it be. Take the appropriate precautions to avoid being taken advantage of.


Alert your bank. Some banks are highly security-oriented and will cancel your cards if it mistakes your overseas transaction as suspicious activity. To avoid this, call them before you leave to inform them of your exact itinerary, not just that you're traveling. It's also a good idea to call them when you get back.
Don't carry around your valuables in a bag that can get easily swept of your shoulder or cut without you noticing. Invest in a money belt or small purse that is worn close to your body. Keep your cash, credit cards, and passport in this.

, Making your own meals will dramatically cut costs, as opposed to eating out every meal. Europe doesn't have to be as expensive as they say it is.


Living like a local will be much more rewarding than traveling like a tourist. Go to local supermarkets, bakeries, and general stores to get a feel for the local flavor. Not only will you save money, but you'll get an experience you cannot get at home and see things you've not seen before.

, If you're on a shoestring budget, don't fret. You can still find things to do that are either very cheap or free. Most bigger cities have an arts or theatre scene that is so lively you'll have more options than you can manage!


Time Out, Trip Advisor, and similar travel sites have comprehensive listing of things to do and see for some of the bigger cities in the world. If you find yourself in one of these cities, check it out to get the most out of your trip.
Guidebooks can be great--but they can also be misleading. What happens when a popular guidebook lists a spot as a best kept secret that no one's going to? Everyone starts going to it. Do use it as a general guideline, but take everything with a grain of salt.
Ask around. Who knows better than the locals? If you're staying at a hotel or hostel, ask the staff. If you're couchsurfing, sometimes your host will volunteer to show you the ropes. And if you're worried about the language, keep your eyes peeled. Where do the people seem to be flocking to?

, For safety purposes, every few days find an Internet cafe and email your parents or friends, so they know where you are in case of an emergency.


It's not difficult to get a cheap phone if you're staying in an area for a reasonably significant amount of time. It may be as simple as switching out your sim card.
Only bring your computer if you're working or otherwise truly need it. Otherwise it will be cumbersome and you'll just worry about it being stolen.

, You're about to embark upon a journey that will be life changing. Let it. Meet new people, do things you didn't see yourself doing, and learn from it. This may be your one opportunity.


Go with the flow. If you run into a group of Colombians that are looking for a 6th to go skydiving, don't write it off. If 100 people are standing in line at a nearby comedy club, join them. Spontaneity can pay off with the best of them.
Skip the knife and fork and burgers. It may take a little voice inside you pushing you along, but cave to it. Venture from the backpacker area and find a cafe full of men smoking, drinking and playing some foreign card game and order that rack of live prawns that gets grilled in front of you. You'll leave not only with photos and souvenirs, but memories to last a lifetime.

Travel off season (both at origin and destination). Sometimes it is worth flying on a low cost carrier to a major hub, then purchasing the international segment separately.;
, Make sure you sign up for your carrier's frequent flyer scheme. This will offset future flight costs or pay for a treat after your visit.

, A rail connection exists from Paris to Madrid via Barcelona. It takes more time but may cost a bit less.

, These are often cheaper than hotels, and a number of them are located in the center of Madrid. Depending on major events going on in Madrid, you may need to book in advance to get a room or get a cheaper room. If you're on a very tight budget, consider couch surfing.

, Check your local rates before you leave. Some countries generally give better rates than others. For example. getting Euros in Russia is cheaper than getting rubles converted to Euros in Spain. The opposite is true for Australia, where you may be charged AU$8 to $12 for the transaction. If you can, avoid getting Euros converted at the airport, using the ATM to get Euros initially.

, The Madrid metro and bus system is both safe and efficient. A 10 trip ticket costs €12,20 and can be shared by the whole group. There is a €3 surcharge to take the metro from the airport that is on top of the 10 trip ticket. The ticket machines take credit cards if you do not have cash.

, They cost about €1,50 each way, and the buses have free wi-fi. Most places are reachable on foot from the city centre (la Plaza Mayor) if you have the time and inclination. Don´t take a taxi unless absolutely necessary. If you do need a taxi stop one in the street. They are available throughout the city.

, The Prado is one of the must-see museums in the city. Visit on Sundays and public holidays when entrance is free for the majority of people. Some museums have free nights, including the Prado which stays open late on Thursday and is free. Other museums are very cheap, including the Museo de Romanticismo which costs €3, less if you have a student ID card.

, Eat well at the hotel-provided breakfast buffet. For lunch choose a small bar offering the menú del día, a three-course meal for less than €10. The quality is always good, since the bars, like any restaurants, want repeat business. Many of these menus will be advertised on signboards outside the restaurant or in the window. Avoid eating in places like the Plaza Mayor, where there are tourist prices that cost much more than places off smaller side streets. If you enjoy seafood, it is worth trying in Madrid because the sea is close enough that you are eating fresh, not frozen, fish.

, Tapas are a snack between lunch and dinner. Many places have tapas menus, with local specialties like fried calamari, patatas bravas, croquetas and platters of Spanish meats.

, There are a number of places to buy them, though they will be cheaper outside the city center.

, Book tickets for football and basketball directly with the clubs themselves. It's not difficult and there are guides out there explaining how to do so. This will save you up to 200% against tout / scalper prices.

If things are tight, you may decide to delay your trip until you can save more money. Where you go, how you get there, where you stay may all rely on how much you have to spend.


Remember that in addition to any travel expenses, you still have to pay rent and bills at home. Make sure you have enough to cover these essentials before you spend money traveling.
Be savvy and cut out small, unnecessary purchases where you can. Eating in, avoiding ATM fees and skipping the $4 lattes are all quick, easy changes you can make to save extra cash for traveling.
If you can't afford to jet to a distant location but you're itching to explore, research where you can go that is within a day's drive of home. Search for national parks, weird roadside attractions, or even look at a travel guide for your area. If you don't have wheels you can rent a car or take a bus to get away for day.;
, If you are working, check how much vacation time you have saved up. Check your calendar for any important dates that might conflict with your travel plans--you might need to push your trip back a few days so you don't miss your grandpa's 100th birthday.


Don't forget to factor in travel time--if you only have a long weekend, it might be best to stick relatively close to home. You can determine the percentage of your vacation you will spend traveling by dividing the total number of hours you spend on the road by the total number of hours you plan to spend at your destination., Find out the high, low, and shoulder season for tourists at your destination by looking at their tourist bureau online.When you travel may also impact the cost of your ticket. If you're not choosy about dates, you can plan your trip around the lowest fares.


High season is when there are the biggest crowds, the best weather, attractions selling out, and the highest prices.
Low season usually means great deals, fewer tourists, the possibility of terrible weather, and the risk of some attractions being closed. You may also find that locals are a little more welcoming.
Shoulder season is considered the best time to travel. You get the best of both worlds--you will miss the crowds, snag the good deals, and still have good weather. Book right before or right after high season to take advantage of shoulder season. , Ask yourself what you'd like to get out of your time away. If you need a break from your hectic schedule, consider planning a relaxing beach vacation. If you are going crazy with boredom, look into an adventure vacation white-water rafting, zip lining, or rock climbing. Become one with nature by visiting a national park, or gain new perspective by visiting a country halfway across the globe.


Many travel websites will include inspiration and ideas for different types of trips: family, ecotourism, road trips, and more. Try a website like Triptuner that will give you suggestions based on your preferences.
Ask friends and family about places they've been. They may have some great recommendations and insights on what to do, where to stay, and what to eat.

, Do your best to estimate how much your entire trip will cost. Factor in travel expenses (plane or train tickets, gasoline if you're driving), hotels or hostels, travel insurance, passport or visa fees, transportation at your destination (taxis, buses, car rental), the average cost of a meal (or set the total amount you are allowed to spend on food each day). Be sure you leave yourself some cash to splurge on something special and something extra for emergencies.Research the cost of the activities that interest you--look up the admission fee to the Musée d'Orsay or the price of a ticket to a Broadway show. The more accurate you can be with costs, the better you can plan your trip.
Many cities offer some kind of tourism pass, which, for a flat fee, grants free or discounted entry into popular attractions like museums, tours, and historical sites.If your plans exceed your budget, you may need to make a few sacrifices. Stay at a hostel instead of a hotel or skip the four star restaurant. Being flexible will make it easier to stick to your budget.Don't forget to look up the money conversion rate if you're going abroad and work that into your budget.

, There are dozens of websites you can use to search for reasonable flights all over the world. Take the time to check multiple booking search engines, as they don't always feature the same deals. Try the airlines' direct websites, too. If you're not flying, you can book train and bus travel online, too.


Be sure you have plenty of time to switch planes if you have a layover in another city.
Studies have shown the best time to buy a ticket for a domestic flight is between 100-50 days (3.3-1.5 months) before to your departure date. Tickets for international flights are usually lowest between 171-50 days (5-1.5 months) before travel.If you're not sure how you want to get to your destination, a website like Rome2Rio will give you estimated cost and travel times for just about every mode of transportation.
Train travel is big in Europe, and websites like Seat61 can help you plan a route and look for deals.

, From hostels to luxury hotels, tree houses, campgrounds, and private apartment rentals, there are tons of options when it comes to deciding where to stay. Consider how you plan to use your accommodations. If you want to meet other travelers and don't mind sharing a bathroom, a hostel may be a good choice. If you want to sleep late and order room service in a fluffy robe, you probably want to find something upscale.


There are even ways to arrange for a free place to stay--sign up at couchsurfers.com to crash with someone local, or try WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) to exchange work for room and board.
Make reservations ahead of time. It may decrease the spontaneity of your trip, but it's no fun to arrive and find every hostel in town is booked for the night and you have nowhere to sleep.

, If you plan to visit multiple cities on your trip, try to determine how many days you will spend at each location. Decide which attractions are priorities and find out if you need tickets in advance. Don't be too strict, though. If you're stressing out because you're 15 minutes behind your itinerary schedule, you (and your travel companions) aren't going to have a very good time.Researching the transportation system will make it easier to plan and budget your time. Learn how the metro works before you visit Paris, or find out which train lines will take you to Pisa from Florence and how long the trip will take.Add the addresses and contact numbers of any hotels, car rental agencies, so you have them in one place and can reference them quickly.
Share your itinerary with your family, and include all your travel information. It's important someone knows where you are and how to reach you in case of an emergency.
Email your itinerary to yourself so it's easily accessible.

, Check the average weather at your destination for the time of year you are traveling. Many blogs and travel websites have compiled suggested packing lists, so if you search “what to pack for a week in Bali,” you should find lots of good recommendations.


Pack light. Pick basic clothes that coordinate so you can mix and match over the course of your trip.
If you are flying, remember the safety restrictions, including the 3-1-1 rule: each passenger can have one 1-gallon bag of liquids, gels, or creams, each in a 3.4oz container. Most drug stores sell travel-sized shampoos and moisturizers you can pack.
Make sure you pack any medications you take and that you have enough for your entire trip, plus a little extra.
Other must-haves: a light rain jacket, a back-up battery for your phone or other electronics, something to read or pass the time on flights and bus rides.
Consider the weather. It might be snowing outside, raining cats and dogs, windy, or it might be as hot as the desert sun. Well, it all depends on the weather, and so the type of weather is the type of weather activity you'll be doing.
Roll your clothes up when packing. Don't fold your clothes-roll them up! You'll have tons more space in your bag. To make things even easier, roll up each outfit into one big roll. That way, you can grab the whole thing at once, no search required.

, First things first--you aren't going abroad anywhere if you don't have a valid passport. The average processing time for a U.S. passport is 4-6 weeks and costs $110-$135. If you are applying for a new passport, you must submit your paperwork in person at a passport agency or approved facility (usually a post office), and some are by appointment only. Save yourself a lot of stress and get your passport in order before you do anything else.It is possible to expedite the process and get your passport sooner than 4-6 weeks (even as quickly as 24-hours in an emergency), but you will have to pay an extra fee.
If you are renewing your passport, you can skip the lines and submit by mail.
When you receive your passport, scan a copy and email it to yourself. You may also want to make a photocopy and keep it in your suitcase. These copies will be very helpful if your passport is lost or stolen while you're out of the country.
Keep your passport somewhere safe while you are traveling--a jacket with an inside pocket or a money belt that goes under your shirt can keep you from losing your passport or having it stolen.

, Some countries visitors to obtain a travel visa to enter the country. As with your passport, you should apply well in advance, as it could take days or weeks to process.


You may need arrange your hotel accommodations before applying for a visa and be asked to present the address and contact information when you apply.

, Tell your doctor where you are going and discuss which vaccines you will need. Some countries require proof of certain vaccinations to enter the country. Your doctor can give you an International Certificate of Vaccination, or Yellow Card, to provide as proof of inoculation.Vaccines can take several weeks to start working, or you may need multiple doses, so don't wait until the last minute. See your doctor 4-6 weeks before travel.You can also visit a travel clinic for vaccines--the staff specializes in travel medicine and will be well-versed in what precautions you should take while abroad., Even a few key phrases--""hello,"" ""thank you,"" ""excuse me,"" ""where is the bathroom?""--can go a long way. Often people will be more willing to help you if you make an effort to speak their language.


English is common as a second language in many countries, but you should never assume everyone will be fluent.

, Traveling somewhere unfamiliar can make you vulnerable, and the last thing you want to do is inadvertently offend the locals. Things that are perfectly acceptable at home may be frowned upon in your host country. Buy a travel guide or check out the forum on a travel website like Lonely Planet to get tips.


Pay attention to things like how locals typically dress (some countries are more modest than others and you may get unwanted attention by showing skin), if tipping is expected, and how much ""personal space"" is normal (you may find people stand and talk much closer than you're used to).
Check for travel warnings or alerts for the country you plan to visit. You may learn that certain areas are experiencing conflict or are considered unsafe to visit and decide to alter your plans.

, If your account shows sudden activity in another country, your card may be flagged for fraud. A quick phone call will keep your card from being declined or, in some cases, lost to an ATM machine that won't give it back.


Ask your bank if they have any international partners or branches you can visit. The fees for ATM withdraws in foreign countries are fairly high and can add up quickly.Using your ATM card for withdraws will almost always get you the best exchange rate. Just watch for those fees."

Search the Internet Archive.,
Look for sources on the US Library of Congress and US National Archives websites.,
Search credible online encyclopedias.,
Use precise search terms.",How to Do Research Into a Historical Figure1," The Internet Archive is an incredible resource that’s free and open to everyone. That makes it especially useful if you don’t have a membership to other online databases through a school or library. It includes historical documents from around the world, like books, letters, and other texts.In addition, you can find audio, video, software, archived webpages, digital images, and other cultural artifacts from recent history.;
, The Library of Congress has an enormous database of documents of all sorts: from books to newspapers, magazines, and photographs.The National Archives website offers a similarly dense collection of original documents, letters, photographs, and officials records, in addition to biographical information.Both are important sources of information on any major figure in American History.


If you’re living outside the U.S., you can search for the website of your nation’s archives for more information about what records and documents are available and how to access them.

, There are countless internet encyclopedias and databases organized by academic subject. You can track down a reliable encyclopedia by checking your local university library's website for links to online resources, or by going to a local library to see what's on hand in their reference section. If, for example, your teacher assigned you a historical name that you didn’t recognize, you could run a more general internet and archive search and find out key details. You can search a more specific encyclopedia once you know a little bit about who they were and what they did.


For example, there are particular encyclopedias that offer information on art and artists, different ones for philosophers, for political figures, and so on.Check out your local university library’s website for lists of reliable encyclopedias and databases organized by subject.You can also look at a university’s history department website for links to online resources that are useful for historical research, as well as for guidelines with more helpful tips about conducting research.If you’re a student, you will most likely have access to a wide variety of online databases and encyclopedia. If you’re not a student, you’ll still be able to access many open-access resources, and you’ll be able to find titles of sources that might be helpful.
Consult a librarian if you find a title that you can’t access but seems important for your research.

, When researching on the internet, it’s important to use specific and relevant keywords to narrow your search.If your historical figure is widely known, just putting their name into the search bar will likely return tens of thousands of results. Once you find out a little about your historical figure, combine their name with specific events or topics.For example, if you’re researching Pablo Picasso, a simple Google search will return far too many results, and many will be unreliable. Once you’ve learned even a little bit about him, you can use an online archive or art database to search for his most famous paintings.
Once you know the titles of some of his paintings, you can find out which museum collections they belong to, and find more information about the individual artwork and the artistic movements it represents at the museum’s website.
Each step in the process will help you refine your search terms, helping you track down better and better sources.
Be careful when using regular search engines or Wikipedia. Both can give you some basic information and can help you refine the search terms you use on more specialized databases. Looking at the sources referenced on Wikipedia pages can also be helpful, but neither regular search engines or Wikipedia on their own are reliable for serious scholarly research.

"
Think about who wrote your source and why.,
Look for and evaluate autobiographies or memoirs.,
Find sources that offer your historical figure’s perspective on world events.,
Get a hold of good secondary sources.",How to Do Research Into a Historical Figure2," As you accumulate sources, you'll probably find some written by your historical figure and others that were written about them. When evaluating someone’s own account of their life, think about how their words represent a particular ideology, politics, or the spirit of the historical era. Look for ways tone and descriptive choices represent your historical figure’s psychology.


For example, if you're researching Thomas Jefferson, pay attention to how his writings communicate which values he thought most important to establishing the United States. Pay attention to repeated words or phrases, and notice when he discusses people from his era and from farther back in the past. Take note of those people and ideas he discusses most favorably.
If you're evaluating something someone else wrote about your historical figure, ask what kind of argument the writer is trying to make. Are they celebrating the figure, is their tone negative, or is the account objective and balanced? Why did the author take the time to write the article or book you're reading?
Sometimes, what someone chooses not to include in a piece of writing is more revealing than what’s actually included. Familiarize yourself with your historical figure's timeline, and look for key events they didn't discuss in a memoir.

, As you begin to compile sources, organize them by topic and source category. One of your categories should be primary sources, which include documents written by your historical figure, government records, and published materials from the same time that your historical figure lived.Autobiographies and memoirs, which are what your historical person wrote about their own life, are important examples of primary sources.
You should absolutely read autobiographies and memoirs, but remember that they are first-person accounts. These can sometimes less reliable and less objective than biographies written by an outside observer or scholar about your historical figure.

, In addition to autobiographies and memoirs, primary sources include written observations, speeches, and other documents that offer a look into how your figure perceived their world. Look for diaries, journals, letters, articles, books, and similar sources. These will help you understand what the person you’re researching thought about other people, politics, economics, science, religion, and other ideologies and world events.Look to historical timelines in encyclopedias or textbooks to get an idea of important events that happened during your figure’s life or around the place where they lived.

, Finding secondary sources written by scholars who have studied the person you’re researching will help you put all the historical documents you tracked down into context. When looking for secondary sources, the word “authoritative” is a key search term. Look for the authoritative biography on your historical figure. Find the authoritative article or study on a particular historical event that involves the figure.If you've found a solid academic article about your historical figure, check its endnotes for a good, authoritative list of resources. Cross-checking to find which sources cite each other is an easy way to build up a list of books and articles that scholars find most valuable.
Remember to consider why the author has written the source. Find a key sentence, or thesis, that states what an article's argument is. Read and understand a book's introduction to see if the author has sketched their book's arguments.

Search newspapers for information about local or lesser-known figures.,
Ask a librarian for advice about gathering the best sources.,
Get in touch with a local scholar.,
Consider taking any relevant courses offered by your local college.",How to Do Research Into a Historical Figure3," Historical figures that are locally important and less-widely known might not return many usable results in global or national internet databases and archives. For local historical figures, newspaper and other local press can be your best source of information.


Your local library is typically the best place to look for newspaper archives for your city or state.
Many university libraries also have links to archived American periodicals, including major newspapers. These can be helpful when researching a specific event that might have involved your historical figure.Most libraries now offer easy-to-use searchable databases, but consult your local librarian if you need help tracking down an archival periodical.

, If you have any questions or run into any obstacles while conducting your research, you can consult your local librarian. A research librarian at your nearby library will help you narrow search terms, point you in the direction of the most relevant resources, and provide you with other valuable research tips.


Try saying, ""Hello, I'm doing some research on Pablo Picasso, and I was hoping you could show me how to search the library for an art history text book about modern art.""
Ask the librarian if they have knowledge about your historical figure or their historical era. Ask them, ""Would you happen to have any expertise or interest in Thomas Jefferson, or maybe you might know of someone on staff who does? If so, maybe you could help me go with the most authoritative sources?""
A local librarian might also be able to put you in touch with nearby scholars or historians with expertise on the figure you’re researching. Ask them if they have any contacts who are professors or teachers in the relevant field.

, Find out if a local professor, historian, or other scholar has any expertise on the figure you’re researching. If you’re really interested in the person you’re researching, you might find it valuable to have a conversation with someone who’s dedicated their life’s work to that person or a related topic. Local university department websites offer faculty listings that typically include professors’ specializations and interests. If you’ve done substantial research but want to dig deeper, consulting a local expert could be the way to go.


The department website will most likely list faculty emails, or a general email for the department. Write a quick email and say, ""Hi there, I've been conducting research on Pablo Picasso and saw that you teach a class at the university about him. I have some questions about some letters and journal entries he wrote, and am curious about how these personal experiences might have influenced his painting.
Ask in your email, ""I would so appreciate a conversation if you're available, and hope you might be able to point me in the direction of a good source on how his life events found their way into his art.""
Try to demonstrate that you've already done a little reading by asking specific questions about particular events or theories involving your historical figure.
Ask if it’s okay to visit during their office hours, if they might have time to answer some questions over a coffee, or if asking them questions via phone or email would be best.
Even though professors and other local experts can be busy, they’re generally eager to talk about the people or topics they’ve study. Whether you’re a student or not, they will most likely be excited to hear that someone has a deep interest in their area of specialty.

, Whether the nearest local institution is a community college or a university, it might offer some courses on the historical figure you’re researching. If historical research is of deep interest to you or a serious hobby, it could be fun and informative to take a class.


Check out course listings to see if any are dedicated to your specific figure. Enroll in individual courses for credit, or audit them if getting course credit isn’t important. Consult your local institution’s website for more specific information on admissions, enrollment, and auditing classes.
If there are no classes that focus on your historical person, then look for survey classes that deal with the figure’s time period or whatever relevant historical movements that involve them.
Getting in touch with the professor and asking them to sit in on a particular class session or two can help you save money and time.
For example, if you’re not interested in or don’t have time for an entire course on early twentieth-century art, but know there will be a couple lectures on Picasso, ask the professor teaching the course if it’s possible to sit in on the lecture. Get in touch with professors or students in your social network who might be knowledgeable about classes that deal with your area of research interest.

Remember that there is no ""right"" way to travel.",How to Travel Alone," Traveling alone offers you incredible freedom to do what you want to do. Don't spend the whole day on a weak Wi-fi signal trying to figure out what to see -- make a list in advance. The beauty of solo travel is that you aren't beholden to stick to your schedule, but you can have a wide range of options worth exploring if you aren't sure what to do next. Some good ways to find activities include:


Travel blogs or forums
TripAdvisor
LonelyPlanet
Recommendations from friends who have visited before
Guidebooks from your local bookstore.;
, Whether you're staying at 5-star hotels, hostels, or camping, look into your sleeping arrangements before leaving. When you're alone, especially if you're in a foreign country, the last thing you want is a campsite to be full or the hostel to be booked. If you're intent on figuring it out on the fly, jot down 2-3 potential places to stay each night, along with phone numbers, to make your life easier.


If you're looking to explore, aim for hostels or unique hotels with a bar and/or restaurant. You'll inevitably meet other travelers with recommendations and advice., This will make conversing with locals easier, and can clue you in to potential risks and hazards. If you can, pick up as much of the language as possible -- even making an effort to speak a native tongue makes a big difference. Some areas to focus on learning include:


Important cultural norms, including (in)appropriate gestures in public, titles and names, and religious or cultural customs.
Appropriate dress and attire for your gender.
Any safety or travel concerns you need to heed.

, You're going to need your wits about you when you land in a strange area and have to figure out what to do next. Make life much easier by only packing one light bag. You have enough to deal with without keeping track of luggage, and you do not want to be caught dealing with a lost bag by yourself. While the following list must adapt for your exact destination, it is a good starting point for solo travelers.


Light, layer-able clothes, like jackets, scarves, and long-sleeves. Switchable clothing, like zip-off pants, will help you stay extra light.
A waterproof jacket
Flashlight or headlamp.
A small first-aid kit.
Zip-top and garbage bags
Cash, with a credit card for emergencies
An emergency contact list with your own address.Deck of cards, book, set of pictures, or similar icebreaker with other travelers and locals.

, You need to let at least one person know where you'll be at all times. Set a time to get in touch as well, letting them know the easiest way to get to you in an emergency, as well as the day or days you will have the ability to check in with them.


Don't assume that your cell phone will work when traveling in a different country; it might not be compatible with the local network. If you need a phone abroad, consider purchasing a local prepaid mobile phone as a safety measure.

, You should also inform your bank and the US embassy, of your travel plans. You might be locked out of your funds if you do not.

, Make an electronic copy and a physical one, when possible. If something were to happen these copies will make it much easier to get replacements quickly. Email the electronic copies to yourself so that you can access them anywhere.Send an extra copy of everything to your friend or family member in charge of your itinerary.

, The less of value you carry on you, the better. This means taking off expensive watches or jewelry and limiting the amount of cash on you at any one time. There is no reason to be flashy or flaunt wealth. Depending on your destination, you'll probably look enough like a tourist as it is. Leave the valuables at home or at the hotel to take undue attention off of you.


If you are ever in a situation where someone wants your things, give them up. You can replace things and money, but it is difficult to read a dangerous situation safely when you're new in town. Just give it up and walk away., There is no need to draw attention to yourself when traveling. Blending in is not only safer, it will generally lead to a less ""touristy"" experience. Keep your head high and your posture upright. Print directions in advance so that you don't constantly need to whip a map or expensive phone out. The more you look like you're in control, the less of a target you become.


Don't wear headphones, especially if you're the only one with them in the street. They close you off to your surroundings and make you seem like a tourist
Plain, simple clothing is almost always your best bet to blend in.
A smile is perhaps your greatest weapon for disarming people and opening doors., Being a smart traveler may mean using a few creative lies. There is no reason, for example, to broadcast the fact that you're traveling alone. Instead, ask for directions by saying ""you're meeting a friend."" If someone asks you where you're staying at night, let them know that ""you aren't sure yet, you're just exploring."" Being a good traveler doesn't mean exposing yourself unnecessarily to danger. While there are always exceptions, in general:


Don't tell people where you're sleeping.
Don't tell people you're traveling alone.
Don't broadcast your status as a foreigner or traveler
Don't talk about your money or valuables, even obliquely.
Don't tell people where you will be the next few days., Of course, scam artists come in many shapes and sizes. That said, your odds of being hurt or robbed by a family, older citizen, or group of women is far lower than a random man on the street. If you're stuck and need directions or assistance, these are your best bets for help., Don't let the stress and excitement of travel remove your common sense. If something seems a little off--such as accommodations or an offer from a local--it probably is. That said, you should feel equally free to take a risk here and there if it feels right and looks safe. You are the best judge of your own safety -- if you feel safe, then you should feel free to explore. If not, say no and move on with your trip.

, Make sure that you call when you say you'll call, or email to let them know you're okay. If you write a travel blog, update it briefly even when you don't have time for a full post. There will be people back home worrying that you're hurt or in trouble if you drop off the face of the earth without warning.


In the rare worst-case scenario that something happens to you, time is of the essence. Have someone with a plan to help you if something goes wrong.

, Traveling is a whirlwind, and it is easy to get swept up in the excitement. Find a way to make your memories permanent by taking some time to write them down. Even jotting down a list of the things you did will help you remember the stories, events, and locations that made your trip memorable.


Many solo travelers find that writing a travel blog a great way to connect deeply with their vacation and keep friends and family back home in the loop.

, Walk to the big attraction instead of taking a taxi. Rent a bike and go exploring on the city streets. Take a trail that your fellow hostel mates are about to hike. Traveling alone gives you the freedom to explore now and make plans later. Get on the ground, then, and start exploring -- you'll never know who or what you'll find.


If you're the type that likes organization and firm plans, hop onto a tour group. Ask the hotel/hostel staff if they know any pre-planned walking routes or good tour companies.
The foods, people, and sights off of the beaten path are usually the most memorable. So get off the path and get on your own two feet., They can be fellow hostelers, a ranger at the campground, or the bartender at your nearest pub. A friendly smile and hello is usually all you need to start conversation. Most people are happy to give some guidance to a traveler on the road. Start with the staff at your hotel, asking them for recommendations or advice, and see where it leads you. You'll find no better guidebooks than the people who live and work in the place every day.


Being alone means it is easy to pick up and drop plans. Keep your ears open for events at your hostel or hotel, or any parties or group activities with other travelers.
A deck of cards is a great way to break the ice.

, Travel is perhaps the best time to expand your horizons, so don't cut yourself short by acting picky. Dive into a local dish you wouldn't otherwise order. Go see a local concert in a genre you've never heard before. Hike to the top of a mountain in your flip-flops. Whatever it is that interest you, even a little, is worth exploring. At the very least, it almost always ends in a great story., Bask in the freedom of solo traveling. Do what you want to do, see the people and sights you want to see, and keep moving. If you wake up one day and decide you want to read by the pool all afternoon instead of seeing the museums, do it. Traveling alone means the experiences are all yours, allowing you to find the ""right"" trip for you. So use the guidebooks as guides, not the law, and stay flexible. With the right attitude and willingness to experiment, your trip will turn out amazing."
"
Decide your transport.,
Find out where will you stay.,
Keep the costs down where possible.,
Decide what will you pack.,
Be safe.,
Travel with someone.,
Make use of properly organized tours.,
Be as inconspicuous as possible.,
Learn some of the language.,
Check the crime statistics for the area you're walking through, staying in, etc.",How to Travel Abroad Alone As a Teenager," Are you going by ship, plane, train or car? Cruise ships are one of the best ways to travel if you are alone, since you have a place to stay, entertainment, and each time the ship comes into a harbor, you can hop off and explore a new place. However, they're not the most adventurous way to to travel, and you may come to resent the confinement.


Cruise ships usually stay in a town/city for one day and then move on. If you want to really discover a place, try to join up with some trusted people from the cruise and not hang around the tour groups; that way you can discover more interesting things about the city.
Planes are a good option if you are traveling long distances in a short amount of time. However, if you have little experience with airports ,you may have a difficult time finding your gate. Be sure to do your research and don't pack too much. There is always a weight limit and it is enforced very strictly in many places.
Cars are convenient if you want to explore the country in depth, get to know the culture, go hiking and camping etc. However, car accidents in a foreign country are a very real possibility, so unless you've been driving for a few years and are not on a restricted license, this is not the best option. If you are driving on the opposite side of the ride from your normal side, do not lose your alertness; it is very easy to accidentally shift back into your usual driving mode and end up on the wrong side of the road, potentially having an accident.
Consider trains. You don't have to drive yourself, you get to see a lot of the countryside and the travel is usually very smooth. You might be able to book a sleeper cabin for longer journeys, but make sure the door can be locked. Trains are very expensive in some countries, near non-existent in others but very good value and everywhere in others; do your research first.;
, One of the most important things to do before you leave home is find a place to stay. Are you going to stay in hotels? Camp? Stay with family or friends? Do your research before deciding, it would be an incredibly bad move to, say, go camping in a crime filled country. Book your hotel, ask your friends, buy your tent, beforehand.


If staying with friends or family, pitch in an help out around the house. It's not a completely free deal.
If staying with people you don't know, be alert to feeling uncomfortable. It may have sounded like a good deal to stay with Uncle Bert's fifteenth cousin twice removed, only to find when you get there that this cousin is annoyed at your presence or is a little creepy. Always be prepared to act on your gut feeling; you can always say ""Thanks for the offer but something else came up with a friend since we last communicated and I won't be needing your help now but I really appreciate that you offered."" Really, it is not advised when traveling alone as a young person that you stay with anybody whom you don't know or hasn't been properly vetted.
Only go camping in countries and areas where it is absolutely safe to do so. If you know families go camping in a place, it's generally going to be okay. On the other hand, if it seems that only rather unusual characters are camping in a place, you see open drug usage, or there is a bad vibe, then it's not a good idea to camp there yourself; you don't know the local culture and it could be very unsafe.

, While you are young, sleeping in budget accommodation should be easier. You won't notice the lack of soft bedding, the minimal amenities or the empty mini-bar because you're not focused on the hotel room but on what is happening out there. Make the most of this time in your life and keep the accommodation costs low. You will not be in the room for much longer than sleeping!


Hostels are a good choice for young people, as you'll meet many other young people and may even decide to team up with people to do specific tours or trips. Always check the feedback on hostels online before deciding on one; if there are bad reports, look for another one.
Just be aware that cheaper isn't always better. For example, it may be safer at times to choose a pricier modern hotel in an uptown area over a dingy one––the lack of safety in terms of building soundness, people who frequent the hotel, the homeless milling outside, and so forth, can make a cheaper place an unsafe one to be in. This will depend on where you are traveling, as some countries, areas or regions have more problems than others.

, Again, intensive research is required. If you are going to a cold climate, pack warm clothes. The beach? Don't forget sunscreen, swimsuits, a towel etc. Take your credit card, phone, a flashlight, a medical aid box, and anything else you will need for the environment that you are going into. It varies. Don't forget a camera!


Always have a backup supply of cash. Although credit cards are great, cash and traveler's checks are important additional resources. Traveler's checks are useful because if they go missing, they can be reissued quickly and they are also good for places where credit cards are not accepted (there remain many such places in the world). Try to have a small pool of emergency cash in an account back at home that a family member can access and forward to you should anything dire happen.
Keep clothing to the necessary minimum. Wash your underwear regularly and dry it overnight. It really does not matter that you're wearing the same pants and jacket every day––you're on the move and the fashion police aren't following you. The less baggage you have to worry about, the more you can enjoy the journey.

, It's very dangerous to travel to unknown areas alone, especially when you are young. Being young is a form of vulnerability, even if you don't feel that way. Some people prey on the young because they know that the young are inexperienced, easily convinced and often overly trusting. It is very important to realize from the outset that while it's great to have your levels of energy and enthusiasm, this must be accompanied by a wisdom beyond your age because you must stay alert for all possibilities.


Stay in touch at all times. Always communicate with someone, making sure that someone knows exactly where you are at all times.
Constantly be on the lookout for potentially hazardous environments. Not every place is the same, just because you can wander downtown alone where you grew up, doesn't mean you can do that in a foreign city.

, It is preferable if you can travel with a friend. Using the ""buddy system"", you can watch each others' backs, present a united front to others and look like less of a target. It's not foolproof but two heads are often better than one when it comes to staying alert and being cautious.

, It is a really good idea to use planned tours if you are entirely alone. This will often be all-inclusive of accommodation, much of the food and touring a lot of the area on a bus or similar transportation. While it can feel a little restrictive because everything is directed, it is a safe way for a young person to see a lot quickly and not have to worry about where to stay, etc.


Consider booking a few of these tours in between getting around yourself. That way, you can combine both the directed travel and the more independent travel, using the planned tour time to learn what you can and backtrack independently if wished.

, Keep a low profile so that you can get on with your journeying without attracting unwanted attention.


Don't show copious amounts of cash, you could get robbed.
Don't wear flashy jewelry or clothing. Flashy items on the body can signal local thieves that you're a valuable target.
Use a standard, boring backpack or bags for your gear. The less attention drawn to what you're toting your stuff about in, the better.
Keep digital equipment usage discreet. There is no need to flaunt your smartphone, iPad and latest technology in a place where people are impoverished.
Be considerate of others when taking photographs. Not every person wants their soul captured as they go about their daily happenings. If there is a person you'd like to photograph, ask nicely first. Not asking could result in an angry outburst or other trouble.

, It's both a sign of respect that you've tried but might also help keep you safe by having a better understanding of signs and the things people are saying.

, Use your common sense and ask locals for advice, including the staff of any place you're staying at.

Be economical.,
Choose your destination.,
Prepare particular things.,
Book more than one hotel in each place you plan to go to, with 3 being ideal.,
Exchange money.,
Choose transportation.,
Be open-minded.",How to Travel Around China," Prepare for an economical and extensive travel. How you travel depends on your personality and how rich you are. If you are wealthy and only want a comfortable and brief tour around China, you only need a passport and a credit card, but you will only get the impression that China is nothing more than a collection of big cities. An economical and extensive travel is better for you to understand the unique culture and traditions. So stay away from luxurious hotels and metropolitan centers, prepare yourself for a little tougher and more memorable travel.;
, China is a vast country which is as large as the whole Europe, it is not possible to experience all the places at a time. Here are a few popular places for you to choose from:


For unique scenery: Tibet, Yunnan
For history and culture: Beijing, Xi'an (Great Wall, Forbidden city, etc.).
For Martial art show: Zhen zhou (Shao lin temple).

, Besides common things needed to be prepared for every trip, here are extra things that may come in handy when you are traveling.



a good guidebook. You can get most information from the internet, but they are not well organized, a guidebook can give you specific information about certain places. e.g. bus numbers, hotels nearby, approximate price range, etc. This is vital cause most of the time, you are on your own.

a US dollar saving account and sufficient cash. Ideally, you have a Chinese RMB account, but most of us don't. So prepare a US dollar account. US dollars can be exchanged for Chinese RMB at any banks or financial organizations.

a VPN(Virtual Private Network) installed on your laptop.You can not freely access major social networks like Facebook and Twitter in China, prepare one if you need to share your stories and upload your photos while you travel.

a good guide. If you speak good Chinese, don't bother. If you don't, don't worry, this is not vital, in most tourist attractions there are 'guide for rent' service, about 10~20 dollars per hour. And there are numerous volunteers willing to be your guides, free of charge. For other unspoiled and more beautiful deserted places where it is unlikely to find a guide on the site, it is a better idea to find and join a local club on the internet and contact them in advance, usually those enthusiasts speak good English and Chinese.

, It's quite casual to cancel others when you find one of them suitable. Make sure there is at least one English-speaking assistant by calling the hotel in advance. An English speaking hotel assistant will be much more helpful than you think. You don't need to choose a five star hotel to find someone speaks English. Most hotels in major cities are economical, with prices ranging from 30~50 dollars per night. Try to avoid staying in backpackers' hotels, they may be extremely cheap, like 10 dollars per night, but unlike backpackers' hotels in other countries, the chances of finding a English-speaking friend are low.

, As soon as you get out the custom, exchange for a certain amount of Chinese RMB for your first few days' use. You may exchange money in banks later, but it's more troublesome and the exchange rate is almost the same.

, The best way of traveling between cities is by high speed train. The number of the high speed train starts with G or D, e.g. G324. If you cannot find a high speed train to your next city, opt for planes.


When you travel in a city, take subway if you can. otherwise, take taxis, Ask the English-speaking assistant in your hotel to write down the Chinese names of the places on a small card and show it to the taxi driver. Don't take buses, the names of stops will confuse you.

, 90% of Chinese are warm-hearted and out-going, but 95% of people don't speak good English. When you notice that most Chinese don't like talking to you or even avoid eye contact, don't take it personally, it's just language difficulties. Try to speak with young people when you ask for directions or discuss your issues.

Seek insight into how people thought, felt and acted in the time when he was born in the 1880s.,

Consider his most major error, termed ""Halsey's Blunder"".,
Read up on his blunders, and discuss and think about how bold men/women are apt to make crucial mistakes due to their enormous responsibilities.,
Discuss this important historical figure in naval warfare and appreciate that it was on the deck of his flagship, the USS Missouri, on Sept 2, 1945, that Japan formally surrendered to end the War in The Pacific (of WWII).

Learn about such leaders and say, ""Farewell to this gallant man!"",
Remember his generation and salute the two modern missile ships named after him (as one replaced the other):
the USS Halsey, a Leahy-class guided missile cruiser, and the
USS Halsey, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer.

","How to Learn About William ""Bull"" Halsey, Jr."," For example, people from his era would have thought differently about how we fight wars than we do now.;
, Admiral Halsey graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1904., ""Bull"" studied medicine for one year at the United States Naval Academy, and admitted he learned little while there. Also, he enrolled in that university as his best friend was there, and earned several athletic honors., Awarded the Navy Cross for meritorious naval service, he earned the Navy Cross for distinguished service in WWI. During that time, he commanded the USS Shaw and specialized in torpedo boats and destroyers.

, Halsey never took the easy road to success. In the 1930s, before taking command of the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, he insisted on taking a more difficult and lengthy aviator course, and was the last one in the class to graduate as an aircraft pilot.

, For example: Vice Admiral Halsey was at sea during Pearl Harbor, commanding the USS Enterprise. It is said that he stated: ""Before we're through with 'em, the Japanese language will only be spoken in hell."" While such talk would be considered inappropriate today, it was not so in those days of war and revenge, after the massive bombing sneak attack by Japan at Pearl Harbor while the U.S. was still at peace with Japan.

, Research his victories, and their importance in winning WWII in the Pacific. He helped secure Guadalcanal for the Allies in a crucial victory, and was also instrumental in victories in the Solomon Islands, Rabaul, the Bismark Archipelago, Palaus, Leyte and Luzon. He was also involved in raids on Japanese bases, such as in Formosa, China and Vietnam.

, Admiral Halsey sailed to intercept a Japanese decoy fleet observed by U.S. spotter aircraft, and left the San Bernardino Strait unguarded where the Japanese main fleet attacked the US supply flight. From this, a small US escort aircraft carrier and three smaller ships were destroyed. While a heroic resistance by American sailors and aircraft pilots from several escort carriers prevented immense tragedy, an important Japanese fleet was able to escape when it might have been defeated soundly.

, Also consider how the truly ""greats"" get back on their feet and move on. For example, in another blunder, known as ""Halsey's Typhoon"", Admiral Halsey did not retreat from powerful Typhoon Cobra but turned his ships into the storm, and three destroyers sank with many other ships damaged. 800 men died. A Navy court found that he committed an error of judgment, but he was not sanctioned.

,, Some say that this humane treatment by victorious Allied forces was unprecedented in human history.

, who after he was promoted to Fleet Admiral on 12/1945, retired from active duty on 3/1947. He and his wife are buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

While there was once a fee implied to ride the ferry, it was eliminated in the late 1990s and there is currently no charge.;
, If you are traveling with children, keep a close eye on them as you prepare to board. The crowds can get unexpectedly large at peak times, and kids can easily become separated.

, A one-way trip on the ferry will typically take around 20-30 minutes, which offers plenty of time to relax your feet and savor the view. A few ideas for making the most of your ride include:



Grab your camera and step outside to enjoy the view. The ferry passes several landmarks and icons of New York City during the journey, including the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Brooklyn Bridge, and a variety of other ships and sailboats cruising the harbor.
Visit the ferry's concession stand and get something to eat. Your typical ballpark offerings are the menu, and can provide a quick lunch or refreshing drink while traveling between boroughs. Beer is the only alcoholic beverage served on the ferries.
Doze off. A pleasant boat ride across the harbor with the gentle breeze offers a great opportunity for a quick nap.
Strike up a conversation. New Yorkers are a melting pot of different cultures and people. Your friendly ""hello"" to the person sitting or standing next to you can go a long way meeting new people.

, Make sure to keep an eye on children here as well in the swarm of people.

Know if you want to bring someone.,
Pick the hotel you want to be in.,
Pick your room.,
Unpack your things.,
Make your bed as comfortable as possible.,
Use the services provided at the hotel.,
Order room/maid service.,
Do touristy things.,
Stay positive.",How to Survive in a Hotel," Sometimes, vacations are fun to go on with your friends and family and whatnot, but sometimes, taking another person can be too much and can make you lose your mind. Think about this. It's perfectly fine to travel alone, but it may also be fun to go with someone.


If you are going to take someone with you, make sure that this person is not a slob or a lazy person, or it may be difficult to bring them anywhere.






If you are going with someone, make sure you split the price of the hotel between you.





;
, Don't choose the first one you see. Do your research and look at a few hotels. Whichever looks the best, wins. Use these tips to help you pick your hotel:


Set your price range. You do want a decent hotel, but you also want something not over-the-top expensive. Consider how much you are willing to pay.






Look at the services provided. Practically every hotel has basic things in it; a pool, a game room, a sports court, or a restaurant. Decide on what you would like to see or use in your hotel, and go for it.






Consider the rating of the hotel. Five stars on one hotel is usually better than one star on a hotel. But then again, five stars on one hotel doesn't necessarily mean that the hotel with four stars is bad.







, Sometimes, people don't get to pick their room in a hotel, but sometimes they do. Do you want your room close to any particular place? Do you want your hotel room to have a view? Decide on how you would like your room (if you can), and don't be afraid to speak up about it.


Get extra hotel keys. When losing your keys, it can be a disaster.







, It can be easier to find your stuff if you unpack them. Even if you unpack them on the table, it can be easier and less stressful to have to dig through your suitcase to find lipstick. Here are some tips for packing and unpacking.


Before you leave, make sure you pack well. Know how long you are staying for and base it off that. Read How to Pack for a Trip for more information.






Do not unpack in the drawers they will usually give you at the hotel. There may be bed-bugs or other critters hiding in it, and you do not want to take bugs home.







, Sometimes, when you try to sleep at a hotel, it can be quite a challenge, because it's a new environment. Making your bed as comfortable as possible can help you drift to sleep faster and better.

, Whether they are the pool, the game room, the sports court, or the restaurant, try them out. They can help get things off your mind. Make sure they don't cost anything or something, and go for it!


Some other provided services that hotels have are the spa, the running track, a gym, etc. Look these up before you come.






Pack a bathing suit for the pool, even if you don't think you'll be going in.







, Room service is a necessity. Sometimes, it's even free. Let them come and clean up your room or bring you your food so that you have more time to relax or have fun and not worry about it.


Hide any money or valuable possessions just in case.







, Even if you are there for a business meeting, be sure to get out there and do something you haven't yet done before. Try something outside of the box. If you are going to Hershey Park, for example, do the rides and roller coasters, but also go check out the rest of Pennsylvania while you're there.


Don't forget your camera!







, If you happened to get a terrible hotel, stay positive. It can really change everything. Remember this: make the best of it, forget the rest of it.

"
"
Think about where you're going and how far away it is.,
Put together a check-list of things you know you'll need long before you ever leave.,
If you're going on a quick business trip, that list would be even shorter.,
Create a budget!,
Go to MapQuest and calculate fuel cost, and find some restaurants you can stop at.,
If you're bringing a pet, search for hotels that welcome them so you don't have to drive around looking for one when everyone's tired.

,
Another good idea is to find all the rest areas between you and your destination.,Bring Entertainment

",How to Take a Hassle Free Road Trip," Are you planning on stopping to eat/sleep? Are you bringing kids?;
, Days. A week, even. For example:

Toothbrush/Paste
Deodorant
Cell phone/Charger
Toiletries (i.e. 'feminine products', make-up, etc)






Clothes






Camera
Car games
Family-friendly CDs
Snacks/Water
Emergency Hotline Numbers

, Write the list down on a piece of paper and tape it to your mirror about a week before you leave. Everything you need will already be in your head.

, This way you won't have any unpleasant surprises down the road.

, Get their average prices. Figure out a round total and put that on your check-list. Now you have an idea of how much you'll spend along the way!

,, It's always a good idea to know where the nearest bathroom is.

Plan living arrangements.,
Discuss the budget.,
Pack smart.,
Plan activities ahead of time.,
Set ground rules ahead of time.",How to Stay Sane Traveling with Other Families1," With a family, it’s often best to do a vacation rental instead of a hotel room so that kids and adults can sleep comfortably and on different schedules.If you are traveling with one or more families, decide what arrangements would be best for everyone. You may want accommodations that include a kitchen and a washer/dryer. This can help keep expenses lower and provide some space when needed. Decide if it’s best for everyone to stay in one place or whether it’s better to get multiple arrangements.


Decide if the kids will sleep together and what sleeping and living arrangements make the most sense.;
, Prior to your travels, decide what kind of budget you need to live within and make sure it is compatible with other families. For example, if you want to stay in budget hotels but others want to stay in all-inclusive resorts, this may pose a problem. Decide on how you will eat out together: will each family have separate checks or will you take turns paying? How will you divide groceries and other necessities while traveling?Find a way so that everyone’s needs are fulfilled. If budgets differ significantly, consider staying in different accommodations or having days where families split up and do different activities.

, Think about all the things you can do without or share with other families. For example, instead of bringing three strollers for three babies, talk about bringing one or two strollers altogether and bringing a baby carrier instead. You may be able to rent child or baby items like strollers or bed items. You might buy items or have them mailed or delivered to you once you arrive.Minimizing your stuff means less risk of things getting lost.


Remember essential items important to you and your family, like a nightlight or a bedtime playlist for your kids. These small elements can help your child feel safe and comfortable.

, Agree on as much as you can prior to the trip. Having several people involved can make decision-making difficult, especially if it’s a decision you need to make right now. To avoid the pressure and potential disagreements, decide on major decisions ahead of time. Choose your lodging, food preparation, and activities well in advance to avoid feeling on-the-spot or in the middle of problems.Have everyone throw out ideas well in advance, then come together as a group to decide what to pursue.
Consider making lists of potential activities that are distributed to all the families in advance. Then the lists can be shortened later.

, Discuss ground rules with the other families ahead of time. For example, for the children, ground rules may have to do with behaviors that are expected and encouraged, as well as specific behaviors that will not be tolerated. This will also help minimize the appearance of taking sides or playing favorites. It introduces fairness and objectivity into a potentially conflictual situation. For adults, clear spending limits and clearly labeled blocks of unstructured time could also add to harmony.


The more clarity there is in the planning phase, the greater the likelihood of consensus. And add as much concreteness as possible in the form of lists, behaviors, etc. This will decrease the possibility of remembering differently.
Review these at the start of the trip to ensure everyone understands the rules.

"
"
Pack.,
Have a little backpack full of things you might find amusing, such as books, puzzles and portable video games.,
Make sure that the car is cleaned.,
Get comfortable.,
Play classic road trip games.,
Use your imagination.,
Listen to some of your favorite tunes.

,
Read a book.,
Get creative.,
Mess around.,
Get some shut-eye.",How to Survive a Long Road Trip," As well as the clothes, pack such things as toiletries, clothing, and medications.;
, Make some yummy snacks, and buy some water and drinks in bottles or cans. That will keep your hunger down when there isn't an exit coming up any time soon!


You may also want to pack an iPod, or a Zune, or other type of MP3 player for entertainment. You can also pack a portable DVD player or gaming system.

, Remove trash and old toys, books, wrappers, etc. Vacuum the seats. Put a blanket on the seat to make it comfy.

, Use the bathroom before you go. Adjust your pillow just right because you're going to be back there for a while. Make sure you've eaten. Take off your shoes and relax! Look out the window and see the beautiful scenery go pass.

, These are often fun and get your mind going. Here are a few of them:


License Plate Words: This is where you find a license plate with letters and try to think of abbreviations for the word. For example, the license plate is CESC686. ""CESC"" can stand for ""cows eat seven chickens"".
Another one is where you get a list of most states in the current time zone and try to find each state in that area, bonus point if it's out of time zone. Its easier with time zones because if you're on the west coast it will be pretty hard to find a car from upper Maine.

, Think of fun things, or look out the window and pretend someone and/or something is running. It can be just like a movie if you try hard enough.

,, Warning as this may lead to carsickness for some people. Bring some magazines and books. If you don't have many books at your house or don't have a library near you, you can get an app like iBooks or eBooks and you can read from there. Some of the books on iBooks are free.

, If you bring a notepad, you can write a story. Maybe if you're in the middle of Kansas you can draw the flat ground, and design a roller coaster or a water slide. Write a story that reflects your surroundings. It can pass time and gets your mind going.

, For example, you can play jokes, such as you can start crying and when someone asks what's wrong and say something like ""Someone invisible is chopping onions""! It gets very annoying but it's funny.

, If you're leaving in the morning, wake up 3 hours in advanced and do some things to tire you out. if you leave at 7:30 am, wake up at 4:30. Maybe you can pack your carry on and food, bike a mile, and clean the house. You will be super tired by the time you're on your way.

Plan travels around the kids’ schedule.,
Stop frequently.,
Prepare travel bags.,
Cope with the unexpected.",How to Stay Sane Traveling with Other Families2," If you’re driving, hit the road when their nap time begins, or start driving at night so the kids will be asleep. This can minimize car squabbles or upsets.If you’re flying, this can be a bit trickier. Make sure the kids are fed, slept well, and not in the middle of naptime.


Ask about the other kids’ schedules and needs and plan travel around all the kids as much as possible.

, If there are lots of kids, plan for lots of bathroom breaks, snack breaks, and moving around. Kids may start to get antsy or cranky if not given opportunities to stretch their legs. Plan to stop every few hours to accommodate these needs.You may want to divide the cars by children’s age group so that younger kids sit together and older kids sit together. This may minimize squabbles and make break times more predictable based on their needs.

, Create special travel bags for the trip that include snacks, extra clothes, something to drink, and activities for the kids. Bring fun, easy to eat snacks (that aren’t entirely messy), juice boxes and plenty of water, diapers, and anything else that may be necessary in the car. If children need medication, make sure it’s handy so you don’t have to go digging for it. Pack plenty of toys and make sure each child has several toys to choose from.Consider swapping the children’s toys so that your children play with the other children’s toys and vice versa. This is almost like getting new toys but is much simpler. Just make sure the children agree to this first.

, When lots of people are involved, it’s difficult to manage setbacks, delays, and unexpected events. Even when you plan months in advance, you can’t plan for road closures, car issues, or health problems. If you have several adults available, delegate responsibilities. Do your best to remain calm and take care of any needs.


For example, if a child is sick and needs immediate care, have one or two adults accompany the child and have everyone else continue with the plans.
Pack extra food and water in case of emergencies. You may want to pack blankets, too.

Resolve conflicts quickly.,
Find activities everyone will enjoy.,
Avoid over scheduling.,
Create sleeping rules.",How to Stay Sane Traveling with Other Families3," There will likely be times when you get annoyed, frustrated, or irritated while on your trip. When kids are present, they will likely have meltdowns, fights, or other behavior problems while traveling. One way to minimize conflict is to communicate clearly what expectations are in place and how to express oneself respectfully. Do your best to ease any tensions as quickly as they come up in order to avoid them growing into massive problems and ruining your trip.You can do a quick review of one or more of the ground rules that best apply to the situation.
Confront problems in a calm, solution-focused manner. For example, instead of saying, “Stop wiping your snot everywhere!” say, “Here’s a tissue if you’d like to wipe your nose.”
Let children know that whining is not tolerated. If you have a problem with another parent disciplining your child, let them know to get you if your child needs discipline., When traveling with other families, make sure you want to do similar activities. If one family wants to rest and relax while the other wants to do lots of activities and sight-seeing, this may cause problems or make kids feel left out. When planning activities, get a firm yes from those involved. Incompatibility in activities can cause tensions and disruptions on trips.If you differ greatly on activities you want to do, consider doing a few scheduled activities together and spending the rest of the time with your own family. For example, you may have one day devoted to taking the kids to the water park all together and another day to a sports game but spend time separately otherwise.

, In an effort to try to keep everyone happy or entertained, you may overbook your trip, which can lead to overtired children, exhausted adults, and plenty of grumpiness. If you plan a day at a theme park, expect a low-key day afterward. Plan activities based on children’s ages and what they can handle. A child who typically takes a nap may have a difficult time being out all day. Discuss these factors with the other families to keep scheduling appropriate.Make a tentative schedule and go over it all together. Make sure it works well for all members and make any accommodations necessary. Remember to shorten longer tentative lists.

, Put all the children who go to bed early together in one room or one part of the room. If children wake up early, let them know not to disturb others. Let early risers know what they can do in the morning; for instance, they may watch TV or make breakfast, but they are not allowed to wake up parents or other children.Consider putting all of the children in one room or divide up rooms by age or sleep schedule.

Plan time apart.,

Take some alone time.",How to Stay Sane Traveling with Other Families4," Whether this means staying in separate housing or spending a day or two on your own with your family, spending time apart can help break up any building tensions or discomforts that accumulate over time. If you dread spending every moment with someone else’s kids or spending all day and all night with other adults, have days where you can take time for yourself or just your own family. This can mean taking a hike together or going horseback riding together. You may want to have a beach day or craft day.

, If the adults want to check out a bar or other event or activity, step out a few at a time while the others stay with the kids, then switch off. Or, you can choose to take certain nights off to spend time with your partners separately while the other parents stay behind. Do whatever works best for you, but don’t feel like you have to spend all of your time with kids all day long., Being around lots of people can be draining, and it may be important for you to have some time to yourself in order to keep your sanity. Take some time early in the morning or late at night just for yourself. Read a book, have a cup of coffee or tea, or take a bath. If it’s difficult for you to be around lots of people for a long time, make sure you get that alone time in. It can help you reset and feel more calm in the midst of chaos.


Plan an early morning walk by yourself.
Consider attending a local yoga class or meditation class. You can also get a massage.

Schedule around the weather.,
Use your research to find the weather conditions in different areas of the country or world during the time you want to travel.,
Learn your airline's cancellation policy.,
Buy travel insurance for the vacation part of your trip.,
Research indoor activities at your destination.",How to Prevent Bad Weather from Ruining a Vacation," While you can't predict everything, there are steps you can take to maximize the likelihood of avoiding nasty storms or other wet weather. Have an idea of the typical climate your destination experiences, and what times of year the area is most prone to certain kinds of weather.


Hurricane season in the United States and the Caribbean lasts from June 1st through November 30th, with late summer and early fall presenting the highest risk. If traveling to tropical regions such as South Florida, the Bahamas, Eastern Mexico, etc. bear in mind that hurricanes can form quickly and are likely to strike these areas first, causing the most damage and biggest difficulties returning home before the storm makes landfall.
Vacationers traveling to the northern United States or regions in Europe or Russia during the winter season should use extra caution. Snowstorms, blizzards, and ice storms can cause serious travel impairments that can limit outdoor excursions and cancel flights by the hundreds.
While not as severely problematic as hurricanes or winter storms, thunderstorms, flooding, monsoons, etc. all plague different regions of the world throughout the year, some more frequently or regularly than others. Check online or with a travel agent who can offer more detailed information personalized for your destination.;
, Try selecting a place to travel that has suitable or stable weather conditions during your stay.

,


Book nonrefundable tickets only if your budget does not allow for a slightly more expensive refundable ticket. In the event that inclement weather cancels your flight, you will be both out of luck and out of the cost of your plane ticket.
Airline insurance typically covers the cost of lost tickets due to flights cancelled for ""Act of God"" events such as hurricanes and blizzards. Despite this, it isn't always the best option - insurance can be very expensive, depending on the coverage policy you choose, and not always necessarily worth it for travel to most destinations.
Don't get stuck at the airport. As soon as you get the news your flight is cancelled due to inclement weather, head immediately to the nearest ticket agent for your airline and try to reschedule on the next flight out. If this isn't possible, call the reservations number, but only as a last resort.

, This will help protect you in case of bad weather. Carefully read and understand the inclement weather clause of the policy before purchasing it.

, Do this before you leave when you have time to plan ahead. If rain or the like does start to impact your vacation, you'll already have activities to do and therefore minimize frustration and disappointment as much as possible.

Pay for an experience.",How to Use Travel Points for Holiday Gifts," Before you begin your holiday shopping, assess where you're at points-wise. Many people have racked up far more travel points than they realized. Check your profile online to see how many points you've gained over the past year. See how much of that can be redeemed for cash or spent shopping online and take this into account when budgeting for the holiday season.How you check your points varies depending on the precise points system you use. If you're unsure where to look for your points, call a customer service representative and ask.;
, Travel points can sometimes be used as payment. You do not necessarily need to redeem all your points for cash. Some major online retailers may partner with the company that gives out travel points, for example, and you may be able to cash in points for gift cards to some bigger companies. This can help you quickly redeem a few points for gifts.


For example, maybe you can spend your travel points at iTunes. You can cash in some points for an iTunes gift card for a family member this Christmas.

, Travel points can often be redeemed for cash. If you don't want to use your travel points shopping online, there may be a way to quickly convert them to money. You can use the points when out shopping for presents.You can usually click something that says ""redeem for cash"" and enter information regarding your bank or checking account. The travel points will then be changed to cash and transferred to your account.
Some travel points system may require you to have a specific number of points before you can convert your points to cash.

, This is a good idea if you have multiple points system. If you, for example, have credit card points in addition to travel points, try using a tracker such as evereward. These are third party sites that help alert you to deals and where you can and can't use your points when shopping online.Third party trackers can show you what rewards and coupons you can use at the check out when doing online shopping. You can cut down on a lot of money using these systems, as you can use multiple different types of rewards points in addition to coupons.
If you have more than one rewards points system, using a third party tracker could help you save quite a bit of money on holiday gifts.

, If you frequently shop online, many online retailers accept rewards points as payment. If you're using a major online retailer, like Amazon for example, you may be able to use your points at the checkout while ordering gifts for family members and friends. Always check to see if your travel points are accepted when doing online shopping over the Christmas season.Big shopping days such as Cyber Monday may mean more stores than usual are accepting points. You will also save money due to major discounts in addition to using your points to pay for a portion of your gifts.
It may be in your best interest to stock up on a lot of items when shopping online. Some stores offer free shipping if you spend a certain amount. If your travel points are already taking care of a chunk of the payment, see if any items you need are cheaper to simply purchase online. If spending an additional $10 will save you $40 on shipping fees, for example, it may be worth it to buy a small item you need as well.

, Many travel rewards points can be cashed in for gift cards. Gift cards can be a great item to get a friend or family member if you're unsure what they would want but know a store where they frequently shop. Try seeing what big companies allow you to trade travel points for gift cards this holiday season.If you're traveling this season, gift cards can be an easy gift as they're easier to transport. Think about opting for gift cards as presents if you have a long way to go to see loved ones.

, Many rewards points allow you to buy electronics with your points. As electronics can be pricey, paying for a chunk of the cost with travel points can save you a lot of money. If, for example, your son has really wanted a new game system, see if you can take care of at least part of the cost with your travel points., Many jewelry stores, or stores that sell other fashionable accessories, may accept travel points if you're shopping online. See if you can pay for, say, a watch or necklace with your travel points. If you want to buy someone a somewhat expensive accessory that's slightly out of your price range, travel points can help.If you prefer to look at items prior to purchase, try cashing in your points and then spending the money at a store.

, If you want to double up on your savings, keep your eyes open for holiday sales. You may be able to, say, pay for a chunk of an item with travel points and then get an additional 10% off on a sale day. If there are online retailers you use frequently, jot down when they're having sales. Try to use your points these days to increase your overall savings., Many travel rewards points systems allow you to transfer your points for free or discounted tickets. If someone does not need anymore physical items, try buying them tickets somewhere. The gift of a vacation may be much appreciated by a family member or friend.Make sure you have an idea of someone's schedule before buying them tickets. You don't want to buy them something they can't use.
If there's a big family event coming up, try buying a family member plane tickets to that event. For example, get your sister who lives in Texas plane tickets for the family reunion in California this year.

, Many travel rewards points have a system that allows you to transfer your points to a charity. Points are converted to cash and then donated. If someone does not want anything this year, consider using your points to donate to a charity in their name., Many points systems can be used to buy passes to places like amusement parks, spas, concerts, and events. These types of gifts can be very much appreciated by someone who does not want anymore material goods. If you have a family member who lives near Orlando, for example, see if you can cash in your points to get them a day pass to Disney World."

Choose a vacation that matches your personality.,
Select a destination that will have a small impact on your routine.,
Stay in contact with your support team.,
Decide whether you need reinforcements.",How to Vacation when You Have Depression1," Placing pressure on yourself to go on a vacation you think you’re “supposed” to go on will only add to the depression you’re feeling. Instead, select a destination that will allow you to get what you want out of the vacation. Going somewhere you can’t fully enjoy or a place that makes you feel inadequate will only make your depression worse.


For instance, if lying around doing nothing on a beach will make you feel even more tired and down, avoid doing so. If you think it is just what you need, however, go ahead and book this type of vacation. If adrenaline rushes are your thing, consider going hiking or to an amusement park, then choose something that will make you feel alive. Tailoring your vacation to match your personality and mood allows you to fully enjoy it and get what you need.You may not always have control over the events or destination of your vacation, such as if you are traveling with family. If this is the case, make sure you carve out some time for yourself, and talk to whoever is in charge of planning to see if you you can schedule something you really enjoy.
For instance, if your family is going on a beach vacation but that's not something you enjoy, you might say, ""Hey Dad, I just saw that the hotel offers snorkeling lessons. Can I sign up?"" Or, ""Mom, there's an amusement park 20 minutes from the hotel. Do you think you and I could go one day of our vacation?"";
, Those with depression have to be very careful when selecting where to go and for how long. Disrupting your life and routine dramatically may be too much for you, which can result in you feeling worse. Instead, choose a place that allows you to maintain yourself, but also create the vacation you desire.


Choosing a place with a different time zone may be too much for your body to handle. Jet lag can cause you to feel even more run down, which can defeat the purpose of your vacation. Instead, go somewhere that allows you to do what you need to feel good.
Additionally, going somewhere that is completely out of your comfort zone may be too overwhelming. For instance, if you live in the country and are used to quiet, going to a big city that is fast-paced and extremely populated may be too much for you to handle.If you can't avoid traveling to a different time zone, take steps to help you adjust and recalibrate your sleep cycle. You can try taking melatonin 30 minutes before you want to sleep, or take a bath using lavender oil, which can make you feel sleepy and relaxed. Try to get some sun during the day, as this can help reset your sleep/wake cycle., If you rely on others to help you during your struggles, you’ll need to have access to them whenever you need their support. This means you’ll have to plan your destination accordingly. Choose a location in which you can get in touch with your friends, family, and doctor whenever you need them the most.


For example, avoid choosing a place that has a drastically different time zone, or one in which they’ll be asleep when you’re awake. If you can’t get in touch with them, you may feel isolated and alone, which will only make you feel worse.
Ask your therapist if they are willing to do a phone or video session while you are gone.
You’ll need to have access to strong phone signals and the wifi if this is how you will contact your support team. Choosing a remote destination in the middle of nowhere may not be the best choice.Call ahead to the hotel where you will be staying and make sure they have internet accessibility and ask about the strength of their mobile phone signals.

, In addition to staying in touch with your therapist and support team at home, it may be wise to bring a loved one along for the trip. Invite those who bring you peace of mind, help you relax or make you laugh.


While it may seem like a depressed person needs to have a companion on vacation, many find that solitude helps them feel better. So, it's up to you whether you bring someone along or merely keep in touch with your support group back home.You know yourself better than anyone. Will it help to have your best bud dragging you out of bed each morning with excitement? Or would you rather plan your day as you please on a solo trip?

Get to know the camera quickly.,
Check the film is wound on.,
Hold the camera correctly.,
Use the flash if needed.,
Take the photo.,
Ask the owner if he or she is happy with the photo on a digital camera.,
Give the camera back.",How to Take a Photo for Strangers," You don't have long and you don't want to make it into an inquisition, so here is what to ask the camera's owner if he or she understands English:


Where do I click?






How do I zoom?






How do I focus? (This answer might not be needed and can be left till you think you need to know it.)





;
, Most people will have digital nowadays but if it is an older camera or one of the common disposables, you will need to know if they've remembered to wind it on. Just ask ""Has the film been wound on?"".

, If it has a strap, wind it around your wrist if you are standing precariously or on uneven land, so that you don't accidentally drop someone else's precious photo gear into a chasm or on hard rocks. It tends to happen when we're trying hard to get things right!

, If the light is very bright or very dull, or you are indoors, using the flash will often offset any light problems. Ask quickly if the flash goes off automatically or if you will need to adjust it.

,


Ask if there is anything special about the features behind or around the people being photographed that they want included. Try to oblige.






Rely on your own judgment as to whether a portrait view or a landscape view would look better; consider quickly how the scene and the people in the photo come together.






Use your fingers and voice to count down quickly from 3. This helps everyone get ready, even if the people being photographed do not speak English. It also makes it clear when they can stop posing.






Take two shots for good luck if it is digital camera as they can always wipe it. Be more careful with film cameras.







, If not, offer to take another one.

, If you would like them to take a photo of you and your fellow traveller(s), now is a perfect time to ask.

Ask for help from the professionals.,
Choose your travel companions wisely.,
Work on coping strategies with your therapist before you leave.,
Take your finances into consideration.,
Bring an adequate amount of medication with you.,
Plan ahead for problems.",How to Vacation when You Have Depression2," Planning a vacation is often stressful. With so many important details to take into consideration, you can feel completely overwhelmed trying to take care of them all. Instead of wearing yourself out, allow a professional to do the job for you. Hire a travel agent to take care of everything for you, and you’ll prevent being completely stressed out before you hit the road. For example, selecting a destination that is all-inclusive can be one way to use the help of professionals to your advantage. These locales generally include food, attractions, and lodging for one price, which means you won't have the added stress of arranging and paying for them separately. You can pretty much pack your bag and show up to enjoy the benefits.

, Since you are going on vacation, avoid asking any friends or family who add stress to your life. If you decide to invite someone such as a family member, friend, or partner make sure they are considerate of your need to spend some time alone and get plenty of rest. Avoid hanging with people who are heavy drinkers or late-night party-goers — these habits can worsen your mood.


Minimize added stress by making sure you have the same expectations for the trip. It can lead to tension if one person was planning to laze away the days while the other had a jam-packed itinerary of tours and attractions planned. Be on the same page with any travel companions to ensure that you enjoy your trip., Bringing a “toolkit” of positive, effective coping strategies will help you tackle vacation stress when it does arise. In the weeks before your vacation, work with your therapist on strategies to reduce stress or deal with symptoms of depression that may flare up on your trip.


You and your therapist might go over stress coping skills like deep breathing, meditation, or positive visualization.
Strategies to deal with depressive symptoms might include scheduling daily exercise on your vacation, ensuring you get sunlight every day, choosing healthy foods (like those containing omega-3's), and how to challenge negative thinking.Bring a journal with you and write in it daily, even for just a few minutes. Allow yourself to be totally honest and write anything you feel. Expressing yourself in this way can help manage depression., Vacations usually aren’t cheap, which is stressful in itself. To avoid bringing this black cloud of debt with you, get realistic about how much you can actually afford. If you can’t afford much, look into activities that are free or cost-effective.


For example, explore the sharing economy to find affordable places to stay and transportation. Additionally, select activities that are free, such as bike riding, hiking, or exploring a beach. You’ll find that you can still have a great time, without adding the stress of spending too much money., If you take medication to manage your depression, vacation is the time you may need it the most. Ensure you bring the amount you need, and a few extra just in case. Don’t assume that you will only need what you typically take, as the change in your surroundings may require more.


Get your refills before you hit the road. A pharmacy in a different area may not have the medication you need or your doctor may not be able to prescribe the medication in a different state. Taking care of everything before you go on vacation may prevent any additional stress., Lost luggage, bad weather, and/or car trouble are known to derail the most-anticipated vacations. Be sure to schedule in extra days for delayed travel due to transportation issues or nasty weather. Furthermore, pack one or two outfits plus your personal essentials in a carry-on bag so that you have the basics in case your luggage is lost.Talk to a travel agent or airline representative about other ways you can protect your vacation against any surprise incidents. It may even be wise to purchase travel insurance in the event you are forced to cancel at the last minute due to depression.

Avoid comparing yourself to others.,
Realize a vacation won’t “fix” you.,
Expect “bad” days.",How to Vacation when You Have Depression3," Many people with depression fall into the trap of comparing others’ vacations to theirs. You may look at the vacationers around you and wonder why you’re not enjoying yourself as much as they are. Placing pressure on yourself to enjoy what you think you should can make you feel worse. Instead, realize you probably aren’t seeing the bigger picture.


Vacations aren’t great for everyone all of the time. The family you see enjoying themselves on the beach may have just come back from having a huge fight. Or perhaps the kids just had a major meltdown that was extremely stressful. You’re likely having just as good of a time as they are, you just happen to see them during a good time., Unfortunately, depression doesn’t magically disappear when you go on vacation. In fact, sometimes it may make its presence known even more during this time. Letting go of that expectation and facing reality may make your vacation that much more enjoyable., Not every vacation day will be filled with feelings of happiness. You may have some days when the depression takes over, no matter how gorgeous the scenery is. Be gentle on yourself and realize that these moments are just a part of your life, and you will get through it.


One way to make the bad days a little better is to be open with those around you. Tell them, “I’m not feeling very well today, so I need a little space,” or whatever it is you require. Being honest with what is going on instead of trying to hide how you really feel will make it easier on yourself, and those around you."

Consider hiring a travel nurse to accompany you on your trip, if you have serious medical concerns. You can find travel nurse networks online.;
, In order to receive disabled accommodations and access, you must disclose your disability at least 48 hours ahead of time. Internet or email booking does not always include an option to disclose your disability.

, The doctor will be able to tell you if there are any unforeseen travel or medication risks. Request all the medication you require, plus a few days extra in case of delays.

, Give a copy to all travel companions, so that they know who to contact in case of emergencies.

Book airport transfers ahead of time.,
Arrive at the airport, bus depot or train depot well in advance.,
Ask flight attendants to store your assistive devices before takeoff.",How to Travel With a Disability2," Boarding a flight can be uncomfortable for many people with disabilities. Regaining access to a wheelchair can also take considerable time, so ensure you have long layovers, if you book them.

, Although these guidelines may differ in countries outside of North America, there are some concessions made for disabled passengers. The following are preparations you can make before or at the gate:


Keep a card or letter with you if you have any metal implements or prosthesis. You can request these cards from your surgeon after you have surgery. It is a good idea to keep it with you when traveling, in case you go through metal detectors during sightseeing as well as in the airport.
Keep all prescription and over-the-counter medication with you in your carry-on baggage. Keep all medications in their original packaging.
Declare all medically necessary liquid medications to the TSA officer. If they are over 3.4 oz., they should not be carried in a quart-sized plastic bag with other small liquids. If they are required to take essential medication, water and juice may be declared and carried through security after going through an additional screening process.
Make sure all frozen medications are frozen solid as you go through the security line. Slushy or liquid medications are subject to additional screening and limitations.

, Choose an aisle seat or a seat near the bathroom, if you need one. Always avoid sitting in an emergency exit row, since this seat requires that you be prepared to assist other passengers.

, You will need to order a taxi or mini-bus with disability access.

, Make sure you arrive at least 2 hours ahead of time for all international travel.

, Press the call button should you need them during flight. Ask that the attendant helps you to get access to your devices after the other passengers have disembarked.

Medications, assistive devices, money and specialized clothing and tools are first priority, while clothing that can be picked up in another state or country should be lower on the priority list.

, Jet lag or travel-caused exhaustion can trigger dizziness, balance issues, nausea and tiredness. Attempt to get on the time schedule of the place you are visiting, but allow yourself to rest until meal or bedtime.

, Make sure to keep them on you at all times. This information can help you if you experience theft or emergency.

, Wheelchairs have many moving parts and they can break down fairly easily. Bring your manual or read up on how to repair the chair before you leave.

, Many sightseeing tours require that you walk quickly and for long periods of time. Call tour operators ahead of time to see if they can offer a disabled-friendly tour or audio tour with a slower pace.

, It falls on the disabled traveler and their companion to be their own advocate. Try to visualize situations that may arise, in advance, so that you can determine how you will handle them.

Identify what sort of travel experience you want to have.,
Travel to quiet places.,
Stay at a retreat.",How to Travel the World As an Introvert1," Introverts are not a monolithic community. Some introverts enjoy socializing for several hours a day, while others prefer far less socialization. Some don’t mind crowds, while others would feel uncomfortable packed onto a subway tram like a sardine in a tin can. Be realistic with yourself and think about what sort of travel experience you want.If you want to avoid a lot of hustle and bustle, stay clear of big cities. Look instead for travel opportunities that revolve around enjoying natural wonders and the great outdoors.;
, When people think about traveling the world, they usually imagine lots of tourist destinations with bustling nightlife and lots of tourists. But as an introvert, you might be more comfortable traveling to more out-of-the-way locations, free of crowds and the noise that accompanies them. For instance, you might want to travel the Andes or the Appalaichan Trail. You might want to enjoy the quietude and natural beauty of a nation like South Africa or New Zealand. Look for nations or sites of historical and cultural significance that are off the beaten path.Americans are known as some of the most extroverted people in the world. America might not be the best choice for an introvert, unless you focus on enjoying the country’s parks and nature preserves.
Nations with generally more reserved and introverted cultures include the Nordic countries, Japan, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, and Switzerland., There are a variety of retreats, including yoga retreats, Buddhist and Christian monasteries, and other varieties of conscientious living retreats. Search online or use your guidebook to identify retreat opportunities in the areas you’re traveling."

Pack ahead of time.,
Gather carry-on items.,
Wear comfortable clothing.,
Eat a light meal.,
Set alarms.,
Leave early.",How to Travel when You Have an Anxiety Disorder1," Packing at the last minute can be a source of considerable stress that starts off your journey on the wrong foot. Have your bags ready to go the day before your trip.


You can also make a list of items to be packed before doing the actual packing or pack slowly over a few days rather than all at once. Separate things you’ll need to keep out between the time you pack and the time you leave like a toothbrush.;
, Any items that you’ll need to have on hand during the trip, such as your keys, wallet, phone, phone charger, and travel tickets, should be gathered ahead of time. Keep them in a single place, perhaps by the door, so you won’t have to wonder where things are as you’re leaving., For many forms of travel, you will be seated for long periods of time, typically in a confined space. Wearing restrictive clothing can make matters worse and increase your stress. This physical discomfort could trigger the effects of your anxiety disorder.Prioritize your comfort over looking good. Loose-fitting jeans, sweatpants, shorts, t-shirts and sweatshirts are all good options for a comfortable trip.
Consider the temperature when dressing. It may be hard to know ahead of time what the temperature in the vehicle might be like, so consider dressing for a warm temperature and taking a sweatshirt or blanket you can easily throw over yourself if it turns out to be cold.
If you are concerned with looking nice, you may want to bring a change of clothes in your carry-on luggage for once your trip is over.

, Travel anxiety could distract you from eating well before your flight, but traveling while hungry will amplify your anxiety.On the other hand, a large meal may leave you feeling bloated, tired, or even sick in a confined space. Eat a light meal before you leave so you’re comfortable.


Dehydration can exacerbate anxiety.Drink water beforehand and bring a bottle with you on your trip. If you are flying, you’ll need to buy the water at the airport past the security checkpoint.Sliced fruit, yogurt, baby carrots, celery, and nuts are great options to provide healthy energy for your trip. These foods are also relatively easy to take with you to eat during the trip.Avoid foods that might give you gas or bloating. These include dairy products, bran, legumes like beans or lentils, and cruciferous vegetables like asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, artichokes or onions. You should also avoid anything with a lot of grease, trans fat, or sugar., If you have an early trip, set your alarm as soon as possible so you don’t forget. You can also set an alarm for when you have to leave for the trip itself. Anxiety disorder can cause you to obsess about being on time so you don’t miss your flight. Therefore, knowing you have the alarm set could ease that anxiety.

, Leave for your trip early so you don’t add unnecessary anxiety when you hit traffic or other unexpected hindrances. If you get there early, you can spend a while sitting and relaxing to center yourself before you board your vehicle.

Travel by yourself.,
Travel with others.,
Travel slowly.,
Find a way to support yourself.",How to Travel the World As an Introvert2," Introverted people tend to desire more alone time than others do. If you travel with others, you’ll constantly be negotiating with them about where to go next and what to see and do. But if you travel alone, you’ll be able to satisfy your desire for minimal levels of communication while maximizing your freedom to go wherever the wind takes you. You might want to travel to internationally renowned sites like:the Great Wall of China
the Statue of Liberty
the Eiffel Tower
the Grand Canyon
the Appalachian Trail
Yellowstone National Park

, If you want to travel with a group (your family, schoolmates, etc.) be clear and firm about your desires. Remember, you’re introverted, but not shy or lacking in confidence. Ensure that the trip will be enjoyable for you as well as for them.Provide feedback about the itinerary. Schedule a mix of quiet places and more renowned, busy places.
Schedule downtime into your group's final itinerary so that you have time to relax apart from the others.
Ideally, you'll be able to travel with another group of introverts. That way, you’ll all be of a common mind about what sort of travel experience you want to have.

, Being an introvert is more than just a mode of socialization – it’s a way of thinking and feeling, too. Traveling the world as an introvert might inspire your to take your time when you travel to a new place. Traveling slowly and enjoying the points between destinations will allow you to satisfy your desire to really get a feel for a place, its people, and its lifeways.Take your time when traveling by, for instance, taking a more circuitous route instead of the fastest and most direct route.
Spend more time in-country to wherever it is you’re traveling.
Don’t overschedule your days. Plan on seeing one or two sights in a day, then leaving the rest of your day for spontaneous other adventures, journaling, or lounging about while mulling over what you’ve seen and heard on your travels., One of the best ways to travel the world as an introvert is to do so while working. Instead of being tied to a job where you have few or no opportunities to travel the world, get a job that enables you to do so. Many people are discouraged from traveling because they believe they will lose out on potential income. Traveling while working, though, guarantees that you have a constant source of income even while traveling.For instance, lots of introverts have great success as writers or photographers. Both of these occupations allow you to work more or less alone, and in any location you want to. News outlets, advertising departments, and other content producers might be interested in your work.

"

Use social media.,
Pretend you’re outgoing.,
Listen to others.,
Be yourself.,
Don’t feel bad about not wanting to socialize.",How to Travel the World As an Introvert3," Your family and friends back home will be dying to know all about your travels. Keep them in the loop by posting photos and writing updates about where you’ve been. Be candid in your impressions of your travels. Ask them about life back home so that you can stay connected to the people who know you best.If you’re not keen on social media, you could always use email or snail mail. Everyone loves getting postcards from exotic places.
Staying connected with your core group of friends and family back home can stave off loneliness when you’re out traveling the world.

, Even the most introverted introvert eventually hankers for some conversation. If you get lonely and starved for human contact, you can always “fake it ‘til you make it.” Plus, traveling should be a time to try new things and branch out. You might find that you’re glad you moved out of your comfort zone – even briefly – and chatted up a local or a fellow traveler when you normally might not.Nobody knows you while you’re traveling, so you can pretend to be more outgoing than you are – the people you meet will just chalk it up to you being a weird foreigner if your act doesn’t convince.When dining out, talk to waitstaff about what locals do for fun in the area. Explain that you’re from out of town.
Look up local events like concerts and public lectures that might prove good opportunities to meet others.

, When you’re traveling the world, you’re bound to meet all sorts of people no matter how introverted you are. In your hostel or tour group, you’ll meet others like you who have their own interesting adventures behind them. You can easily strike up a conversation that requires little effort on your part by asking these fellow travelers to regale you with their escapades. For example, when you’re settled into your bus to take you from Thailand to Laos, ask the person next to you, “So, how did you like Thailand?” or “What was your favorite thing about Thailand?”Interacting with people in this way can help you meet your personal quota of socialization for a given period.

, Don’t make a big effort to change yourself or pretend to be outgoing if you really aren’t. You should feel totally comfortable sitting alone on a train or boat, booking a single room, and dining by yourself.Be honest when analyzing who you are as a person.
Don’t pressure yourself into traveling if you don’t want to.
Accept yourself by saying to yourself, “The world is full of many different types of people. My introverted nature is not hurting anyone, so I feel comfortable being myself.”
It’s okay to make yourself available for conversation, but know when you’ve had enough interaction for the time being.

, You should never feel guilty just because you are not outgoing. Don’t let anyone make you feel about traveling the world as an introvert. For instance, if someone asks why you’re traveling by yourself, just say, “Well, I’m kind of an introvert.”If you meet people who want to do something with you, don’t let social expectations and pressure dictate your response. Instead, be honest – whether that means accepting the invitation or declining it.
If you decline an invitation and the person wants to know why you don’t want to hang out, just say, “I’m a bit tired” or “I’d prefer to spend the day alone.”
Instead of feeling ashamed or embarrassed for not wanting to socialize, switch your frame so that you feel embarrassed for the person trying so desperately to get you to socialize with them.
Some people will have a hard time understanding that you don’t want to socialize. Just stand your ground and don’t let them get to you."
"
Join a tour.,
Practice speaking the local language.,
Look for others like you.,
Check into a shared lodging arrangement.",How to Travel the World As an Introvert4," Most big cities, museums, and sites of cultural and historical significance offer tours. Tours might give you some inside information that could enrich your experience of a place without forcing you to respond or engage in communication with the other folks on the tour.Conduct careful research on any tour company you contract with to ensure you get the best value for your money.
Avoid tours of first-timers and families that might have their kids in tow.
If you’re active, you might enjoy a canoe or bicycle tour. These tours often attract other introverts who just want to take advantage of the luggage-porting services the tour company provides.

, As an introvert, you might be doubly reluctant to engage in speaking a foreign language. If you have a bit of practice before arrive, though, you’ll gain the confidence you need to communicate when practicing with others in foreign language classes or in real-life situations.Get a detailed dictionary and self-learning language book in order to better understand how to read and write the language. The best books will also come with an MP3 download code or CD so that you can practice hearing and speaking the language. If they don’t, get an audio series that teaches the language and repeat the phrases you hear.
There are many online resources to learn the language you’re interested in. For instance, check out DuoLingo or Lang-8, which can help you learn through games, videos, and chat rooms.
You probably don’t need to really learn the local language unless you’re planning on staying in a particular country for some time. However, a few crucial phrases like “Where is ___?” and “How much does it cost?” could come in handy.

, During your conversations with other travelers, you might have the good fortune to chance upon other introverts. If the person on the bus next to you also has their nose tucked into a book and has their noise-canceling headphones on, nudge them gently and ask, “What are you reading?” Strike up a conversation about where they’re headed and explore the possibility of staying in contact with them when you both arrive at wherever it is you’re headed.Introverts tend to enjoy learning and educating themselves. Look for classes that are being offered in the area to meet other introverts.If you’re in one country for a while, you might be able to meet others through classes in the local language.
Sites like Meetup.com are also great for finding people in the area who share your interests.

, If you find that you’re tired of being alone for a bit and want some human contact, check into a hostel or an Airbnb house. These arrangements will put you in direct contact with other people who you can connect with to make a few outings and adventures together.Ask your fellow guests or hosts about local attractions. Ask, for instance, “What can I do for fun around here?” or “What is worth seeing in this area?”
You can also talk to your hosts about areas where you can find a great meal. Ask them, “Do you know of any good locations to dine in this area?”
If you’re planning an extended stay and need help with the local language, ask motel clerks or heads of households where you’re staying for a few useful phrases and tips.

Wake up early.,
Invent a project for yourself.,
Order room service.,
Bring a book.,
Pack a pair of headphones.,
Enjoy the experience.",How to Travel the World As an Introvert5," If you’re traveling with a long-term tour service that takes you through an entire country or region, you might want more unstructured time to yourself than the tour schedule provides. Waking up an hour or so early can help you recover your needed alone time. Use the time to read, write, or reflect on your travels., If you’re feeling lonely or isolated, look for ways to focus your energy and attention in a positive way. For instance, go out of your way to visit weirdly themed restaurants, or try to take pictures of all the statues you can in a given city. These projects can help you put off creeping feelings of isolation that might crop up on the road.You could also make a list of all the restaurants of a given type in the major cities you visit. For instance, maybe you want to visit all the pizza joints in Shanghai, or all the vegan diners in Philadelphia.
Alternately, you could aim to journal for at least 20 minutes every night about your experience that day.

, If you’re staying in a hotel that offers room service, take advantage of it. You’ll have to pay a bit extra, but in return you’ll get to spend your mealtimes in the privacy of your own room. You can use the time to correspond with friends back home, write in your journal, or update your blog., If you’re on a long ride and don’t want to talk to others or look out the window the whole time, a book is a great way to pass the time. Pack a few books and look for places to exchange them for others when you’re done.Most major cities will have at least a few bookstores with English-language books. Check your guidebook for such stores.
You might also have luck looking for books in the common area of the hostel you’re staying at. Many hostels have a community bookshelf where you can trade a book of your own in exchange for another.
You can also, of course, read your book at night before bed and when you’re dining out.
Remember, when you’re reading, you’re never really alone.

, A quality set of noise-canceling headphones is essential for any introvert’s luggage. That way, you won’t have to listen to crying children or the irritating music that sometimes gets piped in on long train rides. Plus, when you have your headphones on, the likelihood that anyone will bother you drops dramatically.If you’re cramped for space in your luggage, a pair of high-end earbuds will do in a pinch.
When used in combination with a book, you’re even less likely to attract people trying to interact with you., Extroverts might see travel as unenjoyable or unsuccessful if they haven’t ended their trip with a bunch of friends that they didn’t have before traveling the world. But introverts can see travel for what it really is – and experience and a set of memories that are bigger than themselves. As an introvert, you should stay in the moment and do what you do best by not putting yourself at the center of the action."

Plan activities.,
Practice deep breathing.,
Take a travel companion.,
Bring pillows and blankets.,
Maintain a routine.,
Be prepared for panic attacks.",How to Travel when You Have an Anxiety Disorder2," One of the best ways to deal with travel anxiety is to simply take your mind off it.Have some work, school, or recreational activities planned so that you’re distracted from whatever is making you anxious about the trip.


Practicing art or writing is a great way to distract yourself from your anxiety during a trip. Bring along a loose-leaf journal with plenty of paper. Try sketching or writing a creative story.
Crossword puzzles, Sudoku, and other games are popular options for passing time during travel.
Taking along a laptop or portable gaming device will greatly expand your options. Have some games or tasks you can complete available offline in case Wi-Fi isn’t available for your trip.

, If you feel an anxiety attack coming on during your trip, try deep breathing. It is a great way to calm your nerves and take your mind off your anxieties. Better yet, you can do it anytime, anywhere.Open your month and gently sigh to let the air out of your lungs. Let your upper body and shoulder muscles relax as you do. It may help to close your eyes.
Keep your mouth closed and slowly inhale through your nose until your lungs are full. Try to pause for a second or two once they are full.
Open your mouth slightly and slowly exhale until your lungs are empty. Repeat several times until you feel like your nerves are under control.

, Traveling with someone will help ease your anxiety. Try to think of topics of conversation ahead of time so you can start talking whenever you feel the anxiety come on.If you don’t have a companion, try making conversation with the person next to you.
Have a trusted friend or loved one you can call while stressing if you feel an anxiety attack coming on.

, Making yourself comfortable will go a long way to lessening your anxiety and calming yourself during an acute episode. It may be difficult to sleep while experiencing travel anxiety but just making yourself comfortable can ease your tensions. Bring along a plush blanket and small pillow that you can use while seated upright.You may want to bring along a sleep blindfold and earplugs as well.

, People with anxiety disorders often comfort themselves with a predictable routine. Travel can throw this routine off but you can still try to replicate it as much as possible during your trip.


Consider things like when you eat, when you wake up and go to sleep.

, If you’re in an unfamiliar place, research local doctors ahead of time so you can react quickly. Prepare traveling companions by explaining your condition so they can help. You can also plan to contact a friend back home via video messaging or phone if you find them comforting. Make sure you have any other resources that you would typically have for dealing with an attack at home.Don’t be afraid to ask for help from locals or other passengers if you’re experiencing the symptoms of a panic attack, especially if it’s as simple as needing someone to talk to.

Purchase melatonin.,
Ask your doctor about benzodiazepines.,
Avoid alcohol.",How to Travel when You Have an Anxiety Disorder3," Melatonin is an over-the-counter medication that replicates a natural hormone in your brain. Its primary use is as a sleep aid but is also effective for controlling anxiety and high blood pressure and is often used for travel anxiety specifically.It can be found at any pharmacy.


If you have diabetes, clinical depression, hemophilia or any other clotting disorder, chronically low blood pressure, epilepsy, or have recently received a blood or organ transplant, do not take melatonin. Speak to your doctor about alternatives., Benzodiazepines refer to a broad range of prescription medications that are designed to treat anxiety. You will need to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder by your doctor or therapist before you can get a prescription.Diazepam, known by the brand name Vallium, Alprazolam, known by the brand name Xanax, Lorazepam, and Clonazepam are commonly prescribed for anxiety. Tell your doctor you’re specifically looking for something to cope with travel anxiety., Many people with travel anxiety drink alcohol before or during their trip to ease their stress. This is a mistake as alcohol tends to make anxiety worse, especially as it wears off. If you do drink, do so lightly or you can become sick.You absolutely cannot drink alcohol if you are also taking anxiety medications for the trip. This can cause serious health problems."

If they're nice, they'll provide you a place room-and-board free, but be careful, there may be other prices (work for them in exchange for stay, sleep in small quarters, you get the picture). If they are good friends they'll do all of these things cost-free.;
, Do all the things you'd do, or at least plan to do all the things you'd do, if you were a tourist in the city as well as the things you'd do as a local. Finding great reviews is easy, just gravitate towards the people who you think would give you worthy advice on sites like yelp.com, nytimes.com, or independent reviews.

, Nothing beats wandering for getting the feel for the city; a place like New York is very diverse, and you'll get your fair share of cross-cultural immersion if you're in a place like Chinatown or Spanish Harlem--but those are only a few of the places offering multi-cultural eats, scenes, and businesses. Explore. In the words of a friend I went abroad with years ago, ""somos conquistadors,"" we are conquistadors. Take steps, make moves, and explore.

, You never know who you're going to run into. Don't let anyone think you aren't a gold star.

, That means doing things like the dishes, sweeping, walking the dog, and helping even when you don't see a direct benefit to yourself. Or, if you have it, leaving chunks of cash around. You never know how far an act of kindness, especially in the limited square footage of NYC, can go in keeping roommate relations civil, fluid, and productive. So much of the process is an act of symbiosis; you give while I take, you rest while I work; we both work and contribute. It's a beautiful thing, so don't let it go sour.

, Speak out if you need fewer parties, want to go hang out, need more of your own friends over, etc. It's better to let it out then keep it in.

, Move into a new place; hopefully by step 7 you've adjusted well-enough and quickly enough to know the kinds of neighborhoods you'd enjoy living in or around, and try to indicate to your roommate, family, and friends nearby, who might be able to have your back, where you'll be staying. You may need them to cosign for you in your first place.

, Be wary of people trying to scam you into putting first and last months rent down, especially if you have no ownership rights to the place. If you do eventually get to own, then watch out, it's loan time.

, Be cool. Insecurity is unattractive.

, You'll be glad you did.

Learn the actual process of getting clean.,
Get ready to dry off.,
Wring out the washcloth as much as possible.,
Now do the same thing for each section of your body.,
Finish the drying.,
Learn the benefits.",How to Travel With a Tiny Towel," FIRST UNDERSTAND that bathing to get clean does three things - soap removes dirt and oil from the surface of your skin, hot water leading to your sweating opens pores and removes oil from them, and scrubbing removes dead skin. Without doing all three you're not as clean as you could be. Taking a really hot bath, scrubbing with a washcloth and using soap in the process is the best combination. Getting into the water fast, soaping up with your hands or even a washcloth, rinsing, jumping out again and then using a towel to scrub dry is essentially loosening the dead skin cells and oil so they can be scrubbed off and accumulated in the towel that begins to stink within a week.;
, If you do it effectively, when you're done with cleaning, everything is scrubbed off, and you're soaking wet with drops of water all over. You probably have two pieces of cloth. A wet washcloth and a big bulky towel. All you need is to get the water off your skin. Why do you need the bulk of the towel?

, use it to dry off your hair. Wring it out again and you'll have a whole lot of new water dropping off. Do this again, and it will repeat. The key is that even a damp wrung out washcloth will soak up additional moisture off your skin or hair.

, Section your body into these parts, Hair, head and neck, shoulders, left arm, right arm, back, front of body, left leg, right leg, left foot, right foot, groin and buttocks. After each section wring out the washcloth as strongly as possible. You'll be amazed at how much water this removes from your body.

, When you're done with this, all you need is another dry washcloth to get the last faint moisture off that hasn't air dried yet.


What you end up with is one damp washcloth, one slightly damp washcloth and a dry skin.







, One extra benefit is that, while at home or traveling, the thorough cleaning process described above plus the judicious use of the first washcloth will almost eliminate the collection of dead skin cells and oil that normally accumulate on a towel (or second washcloth). The result of this is that the normal decaying skin cells don't begin to stink within a week like they used to. Since you're using a clean towel to dry final dampness only off very clean skin, you can easily go weeks between laundry sessions. Since you're always using soap on the first washcloth it remains clean throughout the long ordeal between laundries.

One of you can handle creating packing lists. The other can start contacting hotels and looking into entertainment options. If you are the only adult travelling, then create a to-do list of all items to complete pre-trip.In this early planning phase, you may want to visit the Family Travel Association website. This free site provides tips and guidance for how to safely travel with an extended family.;
, It is best to start off slowly when travelling as a family. If possible, create a list of all of the destinations that you are interested in and visit the easiest ones first. This usually means going to locations where they speak the same language as you and your family. You may also want to prioritize the comfort of your children, which can eliminate some nature-based trips.If you are taking a trip that focuses on a hobby, such as surfing, just make sure that the location offers age-appropriate options for your children as well., Think about what your kids like and dislike, what they enjoy and what they avoid. Pay attention to their personalities as well. If your child is more shy and reserved, then a trip that pushes their boundaries too much could backfire. If your child loves learning new languages, then going outside your native language could work well., If you will travel with a baby, then look into a quality baby carrier, sling, or backpack. You may also want to get a lightweight collapsible stroller. For safety, you may also want a good car seat to use on the airplane and in cars as well. A fabric high chair and collapsible crib are other items you can consider.Be aware that some car rental agencies can offer car seats, but the quality and condition of these seats can vary widely. Make sure to get more details before travelling., Go the CDC or NHS website for an updated list of suggested vaccines. The recommendations and requirements will vary according to your country of destination. Make sure to check these lists well in advance, as it can take months to get all of the required vaccines in some situations.If you are in a rush, you may want to consider going to a travel clinic in your area. It is also generally a good idea to get the vaccinations listed in both the required and recommended categories.Make sure to carry copies of the official vaccination records for all of your children when travelling. This will help you to avoid any issues with entry or exit into your destination and origin countries., As you start to consider your trip, take a look at your passports. It is a good idea to travel with passports that are valid for at least three months after your return. You may also need passports for all of your children, including infants, so check the age restrictions for your origin and destination countries. If you need new passports, make sure to apply for these months in advance.Make sure to carry paper copies of your family’s passports with you. It is also a good idea to scan your passports or other identifying documents and attach them to an email to yourself prior to leaving.Child kidnapping is a significant world problem and many countries will restrict the movement of families without the correct documentation. Get a notarized letter with both parents' signatures showing that you are okay to travel with your children for the dates of the trip., You will naturally move slower when you travel as a family, so to lessen the burden on your back and to keep yourself moving, minimize the number and weight of your bags. Forego the heavy strollers and opt for the light collapsible ones. Plan to do laundry on the trip. Don’t pack duplicate clothing items unless absolutely necessary.It can be tempting to add a number of items in the period right before you walk out the door. Resist this urge by creating a final packing list and following it carefully.Pack your carry-on bags with enough clothing for a few days in case your other luggage gets lost. This is especially important when it comes to kid-friendly necessities, such as diapers."

, For example, back-slapping and touching a child's head can be extremely offensive in some cultures. Even shaking hands can be offensive. Try reading a ""Culture Shock"" series book of the specific country while planning the trip.

, Do your research and brace yourself.

, Check the news media and U.S. State Department for any warnings regarding that country.

, For instance, Japan and Sweden should be safe for lone women travelers while taking normal precautions. Women should NEVER travel alone to Africa and the Middle East. There is a long list of countries deemed safe and unsafe for women. Do your research and use common sense.

, This will help choose the proper clothing for maximum comfort. (i.e. If you are hiking in the rainforest in rainy season, bring hiking shoes and rain gear)

, A ""Lonely Planet"" travel book or similar should be read beforehand and taken along as a guide.

,, Passports and Visas will take up to months to process.

, You will be happy to have it when you land tired and disoriented in a foreign airport. Most major U.S. banks sell all types of foreign currency, except for embargoed currency.

Stock up on gluten-free snacks prior to your road trip.,
Bring packaged snacks in a disposable shopping bag for train rides.,
Find out the policy for bringing foods onto aircraft.,
Contact commercial cruise-lines and find out if they can accommodate gluten-sensitive individuals.,
Consider purchasing dining cards from gluten free organizations that offer them to gluten sensitive individuals.",How to Travel Gluten Free," This will allow you to go shopping upon arrival and purchase gluten-free foods that you can store and prepare yourself while staying in the hotel. Plan simple dishes that do not require too much preparation, as both the cooking utensils and the space available to cook is probably very limited. If a small kitchen is not available, request a room with a microwave and a mini refrigerator.

, Because of the nature of this type of establishment, the owners are more likely to be willing and able to accommodate your dietary needs than a hotel staff would be. Most bed and breakfasts are familiar with the issues people with dietary restrictions face. Because so many individuals now suffer from gluten sensitivities, chances are you will not be the first guest that has requested special dining options.


Contact bed and breakfasts in the area and inquire about gluten-free dining. Even if they have never had a request in the past, they may be willing to accommodate your needs if you explain which foods are off limits and which foods are safe for you to consume. Just make sure you explain the severity of your condition and the importance of avoiding gluten altogether.







, If you will be staying at their home, they will likely be planning out their meals with you prior to your arrival. It is important that they know that you cannot consume gluten-containing foods.


Provide them with a brief description of what gluten sensitivity is and how it will affect your body if you consume gluten-containing foods. Provide a detailed food list that explains what foods are acceptable and what foods are off limits. This will allow them to properly stock their refrigerator and pantry with food for you to eat during your stay.






Consider having your food delivered to their home prior to your arrival. Many grocery stores now have online ordering options. Some stores deliver the food right to the home, while others will have an employee do the shopping for you and prepare it for pick-up. Do not assume it will be better to just wait until you arrive and do the shopping yourself.







, This step is important to do several days prior to departing for your trip. Knowing, in advance, whether or not specific restaurants can accommodate your request can prevent disappointment later on.


Ask to speak with the head chef directly, or the manager if the chef is unavailable. Most hostesses who answer the phone will not be trained in food preparation, and may provide false information about the way gluten sensitivities are handled at their establishment.






When you speak with the chef, find out how familiar he is with gluten sensitivities and if the restaurant currently has any gluten-free options on its menu. If not, ask how the chef accommodates diners with gluten-allergies upon request. See if he is able to alter any of the current meals to fit the needs people with gluten sensitivities. Some restaurants that do not have gluten-free meals listed on the regular menu will have gluten-free options available for when the need arises.







, A road trip offers the greatest chance to accommodate a traveller with a gluten sensitivity; being able to bring your own food and stop at convenience stores along the way can prove invaluable during travel.


Pack a small cooler filled with fresh fruits and vegetables, cheese and gluten-free sandwiches when traveling by car. Gluten-free crackers, cookies and other packaged snacks can be tossed into a reusable grocery bag, which can be refilled prior to the return ride home.







, Alternatively, consider purchasing a small, disposable cooler in which to store perishable foods, since you will not have the convenience of storing reusable bags or coolers in your car after you have arrived at your destination.

, Contact airlines directly and inquire about in-flight gluten-free food options. Though most airlines do not accommodate gluten sensitivities, they may carry foods that are gluten free. Alternatively, consider bringing your own food onboard, although in this case, consider that some airlines place restrictions on the amount of food that can be carried onboard, so it’s important to determine if, with prior approval, you would be able to carry on more than the normal limits.

, A few currently offer gluten-free menu options on their regular menu. Some will ask you to notify them in advance with the dates of your trip, and will prepare a special menu for you that contains only gluten-free meals.

, These cards provide a brief explanation of gluten sensitivity and explain the seriousness of the condition. They also list which foods are acceptable and which must be avoided. It includes hidden sources of gluten such as seasonings and flavored salts. Presenting the card to your server could eliminate the need for a lengthy explanation of your condition and your need to make special meal requests. This is an invaluable tool should you find yourself at a restaurant that you didn’t initially plan on visiting during your trip.

, Make a deal with your children that they will stow away all technology once you reach your destination. In exchange, agree to buy them a few cool travel items, such as kid-friendly binoculars or a butterfly catcher., Weeks before you start your trip, purchase a language CD or DVD and begin working with your children to learn a few phrases in the local language. Start with things like “hello” and “my name is” and go from there. Of course, don’t push them too hard to learn or they may resent the trip as a result., If you take a tour, make sure to find a guide that is open to customizing a trip to suit the needs of children.

, Improve a vehicle’s off-roading capability with aftermarket upgrades.



Off-road tires. They are more expensive than your regular tires. The price of mud tires usually start at $100. This is the most basic upgrade that a budding off-roader can start with. These type of tires have deeper treads and offer excellent traction to withstand different off-roading conditions.

Fender flares. This accessory prevents mud and rocks from getting in the wheel well.

Body armors. These include heavy duty, off-road front and rear bumpers, which offer greater protection than stock bumpers, while skid plates serve as an undercarriage shield to prevent damage from ground contact.

Lift kits. This gives a rig an added ground clearance, increases wheel well clearance, to allow use of large tires, and also adds space between wheel axles.

Roof racks. They are often purchased to load objects that can be used while going on an off-roading adventure or other types of sport equipment such as kayaks, canoes and surf boards. It also gives a rig a rugged look.

Rock sliders. It protect the sills and side of the vehicle from rocks, logs and other objects encountered on the trail.

Nerf bars. This exterior upgrade allows passengers to easily get in and out of the vehicle, particularly those outfitted with lift kits.

,



Winches and tow straps. These are essential, especially during the times that a rig is stuck in deep mud and in need of extraction or towing.
Extra long rope, steel cable or nylon straps to aid the winch or the towing vehicle if you are stuck in an odd angle or having difficulty with traction.

Try a different route.Take a different way to work to change up scenery and possibly avoid traffic.,
Get a good night’s sleep.,
Take a daily omega-3 supplement.,
Prepare yourself mentally for what is ahead.",How to Reduce the Stress of Your Commute," Changing your environment by creating something that is pleasing to your ears may help you to find your ride to be less stressful and more pleasant. It may actually even make you look forward to your commute. Since watching television and looking at your phone while driving are extremely dangerous, listening to something while driving can help entertain you, and keep your mood elevated.


For instance, listening to a comedy podcast or an audiobook can make driving fun, particularly if you only allow yourself to listen to them during your commute. Finding music that relaxes you is also beneficial. You may even want to listen to a motivational speaker or an audio meditation guide to keep you from getting stressed.;
, The scents of peppermint and cinnamon have been shown to reduce stress, and may be helpful on your commute. Peppermint can lower feelings of anxiety by 20 percent, and peppermint and cinnamon together can reduce feelings of frustration by 25 percent.Also, the scents can make the ride seem like it is shorter.


To reap their benefits, use peppermint and cinnamon essential oils in diffusers. Many work by simply inserting them into your car’s lighter., When you’re not moving and are sitting in traffic, practicing yoga is a great way to de-stress. However, only perform these moves when you are stuck in gridlock and not actually driving. Performing them while you are driving can put yourself and others in danger.


Start with seated mountain pose, which is essentially sitting up tall, relaxing your shoulders, and breathing in and out slowly. You can also hug your steering wheel to relieve stress and tension in your back, neck, and shoulders. Gently pushing and leaning your neck from side to side can also provide a nice and relaxing stretch., Take advantage of this time you have to unplug and practice mindfulness. Turn the radio off and commit to leaving your cell phone alone. That way, you can enjoy the silence, and perhaps unexpected peace, your commute can offer.


Spending this time tech-free can not only make your commute more pleasant, but it may benefit your mental and physical health. Finding time in which you are distraction-free is priceless, and your commute may be just the opportunity you are looking for.Try mindful, deep breathing as you drive. Breathe in slowly through your nose for about 4 counts. Hold the breath for a few counts. Then, release the air through your mouth for 8 counts. Repeat as needed. When you find yourself becoming negative due to the actions of other drivers or the frustration of your commute, use this technique to find relaxation.
If you take a train or subway to work, check to see if there are any ""quiet"" cars. Some trains and subways have cars where no cell phones, tablets, mp3 players, or even talking are allowed. This might be a nice way for you to unplug and relax during your commute.

, Not only is carpooling good for the environment and your wallet, but it can also make your commute more enjoyable. Additionally, spending this time with others can be emotionally gratifying and reduce stress. Carpooling can create real friendships and reduce anxiety, as you know you are all in this situation together.


Find people to carpool with by sending out an email to your colleagues asking if anyone would like to participate. If you can’t find any takers, search for people in your area on websites like Rideshare.org. However, you must take safety precautions when riding with strangers., Allow someone else to take the wheel on your way to work. Not having to deal with traffic and other drivers on the road may be what you need to keep the peace. You can use this time to read a book, meditate, or get caught up on your “to-do list.”If late trains and crowds contribute to your stress, practice deep breathing or think about what you are grateful for during these anxious occasions.

, Although you may believe that taking back roads to get to work is less stressful and safer than highways, this may be incorrect. In fact, highways are often the better choice as there are fewer points of conflict. For instance, you don’t have to worry about catching the light or keeping an eye out for people coming out of parking lots and other roads.


Check a driving app for a new route, and you may find that your commute can become enjoyable.

, Not getting enough sleep can make drivers feel restless, anxious, irritable, and unfocused. The combination of these feelings and being low on energy can make your commute even more stressful.In addition, consider exercising before you go, if physical activity gives you a boost. In addition to helping with your mood, sleeping enough and getting exercise can increase your mental alertness which may prevent you from getting into an accident.

, According to a recent study, taking a daily omega-3 supplement can decrease your anxiety levels by 20 percent.Although taking the oil may not remove the stressful commute, it can possibly reduce the amount of stress you feel because of it.


As an added bonus, the supplement can help prevent damages that are caused by air pollution, such as eye irritation and respiratory issues, which can also negatively affect driving., Make peace with what you are sure to experience on your way to work. You likely know that you are going to be stuck in traffic, so rather than becoming upset when you encounter it, just accept that it is going to happen.


Doing so can make you become less stressed when you are in the thick of it. Also, give yourself plenty of time to get there, so that you don’t feel rushed and become even more anxious.You can help yourself accept the reality of your commute by repeating a mantra like “I love my job, and the commute is a part of it” or “I will have a wonderful day today no matter what happens while I’m driving.”
Another option is to stop by the break room before or after your commute to decompress. Take a moment to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea, or look at some pictures of your family and friends to help improve your mood.

Examine the listing in detail.,
Read through the financial agreement carefully.,
Get a tour of the property before you make a move.,
Read reviews left by other renters.,
Pay attention to odd behavior.,
Look up the person you’re talking to.,
Contact the property owner directly.,
Take your time choosing a rental.,
Don’t be fooled by fancy photography.,
Be wary of suspiciously low prices.,
Pay with a credit card.,
Work with a real estate agent.",How to Spot Red Flags in Vacation Rental Contracts," Whenever you come across a place that you like the look of, start taking notes about the particulars, such as the full address, description, included amenities and price point. Compare what you read with what you see in the pictures and use your best judgment deciding whether a given property looks to be worth what’s being asked for it.The absence of important information, like check-in/ check-out dates or cancellation policies, should be regarded as a warning.One common tactic employed by scammers is to request an upfront security deposit on a property that doesn’t even exist, or isn’t actually up for rent. Plug the address into Google Maps and place a quick call to the property owner to make sure this isn’t the case.;
, Keep an eye out for hidden costs, unexplained fees or strange clauses. Everything should be laid out in clear, unambiguous terms, with exact figures given. Your best defense is to go through the agreement with a fine-toothed comb before signing your name to anything.An honest owner or agent will never ask for the full payment in advance.
Unscrupulous agents who are out to make a buck may sometimes cloak a contract in unintelligible legal-sounding language to purposely confuse renters.

, If possible, arrange a walkthrough of the property you intend to rent. That way, you’ll be able to make sure everything is as it purports to be. Even if the listing proves accurate, taking a walkthrough may help you discover that the property in question doesn’t meet your personal standards after all. There is no substitute for inspecting the property firsthand.If you’re unable to tour the property yourself, send a friend or agent from the area in your place.
Don’t be taken in by lessors who promise to show you the property only after you’ve paid a fee., Remember that when it comes to gathering information, the internet is your friend. Assuming you’re booking through a reputable property website, or a rental app like Airbnb or HomeAway, take a look at the comments left by previous occupants and see what kind of things they had to say about the property. Someone else may have had a bad experience with the listing or agent and posted about it for the benefit of future renters.User ratings should be one of the primary things you consider when choosing a rental property.

, Leasing agents will ordinarily be friendly and enthusiastic when it comes to helping you lock down the perfect vacation spot. If the individual you’re communicating with seems unusually terse or dodgy, they may not have your best interest at heart. Get a feel for your contact by asking them questions that require specific answers and observing how they react to negotiation attempts.Some blatant warning signs include unwillingness to meet in person or talk over the phone, providing vague details about the property or responding sporadically to email correspondence.Trust your instincts. If you feel like something is amiss, don’t agree to anything.

, When you lease a vacation rental, the person that you deal with more often than not won’t be the actual property owner. Run a search for your contact’s professional credentials, including any licenses, accreditations and distinctions. If nothing comes up, you could be dealing with a fraud.You should be able to find more information about a person than just a basic phone number or email address.
It never hurts to check that the name on a property’s lease matches that on file in public record., Even if you weren't referred to them initially, getting in touch with the owner themselves can clear up frustrating issues and obstacles relating to dubious offers and give you some peace of mind. In many cases, an owner will be none the wiser when a scheming agent is attempting to profit by cheating renters. Since the owner has nothing to gain by ripping you off, this is the best way to go if you have any misgivings about the details of a particular listing.The property owner is always just a phone call away. They’ll be more than happy to facilitate the rental process and put your mind at ease.
Hesitancy on the part of a leasing agent for you to contact the owner could indicate that they’re up to something that they don’t want found out.

, Committing to a complicated rental agreement shouldn’t be done overnight. A bona fide real estate representative won’t mind the wait—they know that there will be other interested parties. Scammers and opportunists, however, may try to pressure you into sealing the deal right away in order to ensure that they can pocket the proceeds before you have a chance to figure out what’s really going on.Beware of time-sensitive negotiations or claims that a property won’t be available for much longer.

, You may like the look of an open-air veranda or a yard full of lush palm trees, but if there are no photos of the rest of the property, you could be setting yourself up for trouble. Credible listings will always provide clear, comprehensive snapshots of the rental, including bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and major appliances. Incomplete or low-quality photos may be hiding something.Anyone can doctor an image and post it online. One or two alluring pictures may are not enough to go on.
Have the owner or agent show you the entire property using a live video platform such as Skype or Facetime to avoid signing your name to a rental that’s been intentionally misrepresented., When it comes to lavish rental properties, you tend to get what you pay for. This means that if the price of a listing seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for rentals that are competitively priced with other properties in the area to verify that you’re getting the real deal. Otherwise, there’s no way to know what you’re actually buying.Stay away from discounted properties and “dream offers”. A legitimate leasing agent will always ask for what the rental is worth.

, Never, under any circumstances, fork over a security deposit or rental expenses in cash. Scammers prefer cash because it’s instantaneous, untraceable and can’t be canceled or voided. With a credit card, you stand to recover your money if it’s stolen or misused, while you have no such guarantee with cash payments.Other forms of payment, such as wire transfer or money order, are equally suspect.

Make the most of your trip.",How to Prepare for a Trip to the United States," While you might think you can visit New York City in the morning and hop over to Los Angeles for dinner, the truth is that America is a vast country with two coastlines separated by thousands of miles. Modern air travel has significantly shortened the length of time it takes to get from one city to another on the opposite side of the country, but very few major metropolises are within reasonable walking (or even driving) distance of one another.
, One of the most unique aspects of America is how many people of various backgrounds are living together as a unified society. Learn about the different types of people you'll encounter, and respect their differences., Yes, crime is unfortunately something to deal with (worse in some places and much less of an issue in others), but odds are extremely slim you'll run into any problems if you know what you're doing and just use common sense. Also, any political assumptions you may have could be off base from reality; the majority of people are honest, tolerant and accepting of all kinds of values., Unlike countries with essentially one climate year-round, the USA is home to cities with every kind of weather, from frigid and snowy to humid and tropical. Unless you are traveling to multiple states during your visit, you will probably have to deal with only slightly varying weather conditions and temperatures on a day to day basis, but if not then you will need to bring appropriate clothing., Some cities, like New York, have public transportation options that'll allow you to get around without a car. However, in other places, like Los Angeles or smaller, rural areas, it's harder to use public transportation to get everywhere you need to go. Depending on where you call home, you might not be used to this.

Many cities fall in between these two extremes, in that you might be able to use public transportation for some of your travel plans but not all of them. Plan accordingly, depending on where you're visiting.
Consider using ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft if you just need a lift by car a few times during your stay. If you'll need to use a car more often, it might be better to rent one.

, Foreign visitors from Western countries (e.g. France or Australia) will notice only some cultural differences, but most infrastructure and public services will feel familiar. However, visitors from countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Latin America, etc. may find some things wildly different from what they are used to back home. To feel most comfortable, study a guidebook of your destination and cultural tips before you leave home, or even better to stick with your American host(s) for direction., With so much to explore and experience, the USA is an excellent destination for business or pleasure; and for the most part foreign visitors will be pleasantly surprised."

Define the itinerary.,
Be realistic.,
Have First Aid training.,
Take the traffic tolls into consideration and learn when there are times to avoid certain roads, such as during peak hour traffic, during vacation seasons, during festivals or religious events, etc.

,
Have good traffic knowledge.,
Get an international driver's license.,
Get visas, passports, vaccinations, etc.,
Decide on what car to use.,
Consider where a car can go.,
Plan your accommodations.",How to Travel the World by Car," You will need to draw up an itinerary dependent on roads. Since roads criss-cross much of the world it shouldn't be too hard to begin with but keep in mind the following challenges:


War-torn countries are never recommended; indeed, you may not even get into some of them.

Roads in developing countries and outlying regions of developed countries can be very poorly maintained, some may look like roads but are mere tracks, etc.
Some roads are non-existent between countries, overseas, etc., so you will need contingency plans such as boat travel with the car, or collecting another car after a boat or plane flight.
Roads are weather-dependent. You can't drive on roads that have been iced over, washed out or flooded. This means taking the seasons into account.;
, Unless you're a millionaire or a person of few needs, you won't be traveling the entire world by car in one fell swoop. In fact, you'd be lucky to be to achieve that in a lifetime even as a multi-billionaire. You will need to plan for a lot of time to achieve your goal and in all reality, you should select only certain specific trips that will take you to places in the world that really matter to you. When traveling by car, the world is a very big place.

, People die on the roads in large numbers every year and the road toll in developing countries is way too high. If you are involved in an accident, a little First Aid training might save your life or that of a passenger or others involved.

,, Every country has its own traffic rules; even some regions have specific variations. Take time to learn about the rules online or write specific embassies for traffic codes of the countries that you want to drive in.

, It is also important to be aware that in some places, this is not considered sufficient and you might need to get some other form of permit to allow driving in the country or area. Make sure you take note of all expiry dates, etc.

, Make sure to get all the clearances needed as normal for travel. If taking your own car, you will also need to be aware of issues concerning registration. For example, while you can drive a European country registered car through Europe, this might change when you go into surrounding regions.

, You will need to think through carefully how to find the right transportation, as it will depend on many things.



Rental cars might prove easier to find/change at borders etc.
Your own car might not be permitted properly when you cross borders
You might lose either car in an accident or by theft - can you afford the costs and delay involved in either?

, Some places in the world are now car-free or restrict the use of cars. These include heritage areas, sand dunes, areas where residents live (resident-only cars), etc.

, Everywhere you go, your accommodations will need to be able to cope with housing your car as well. This can be problematic sometimes in built-up areas or areas of high auto theft. Things you can do to help include:


Always park in well-lit areas.
Always lock the car..
Always hide valuables out of sight or take them with you
Park in pay parks that are undercover.
Ask the accommodations what parking deals they offer.
Consider staying somewhere that is not near the sites you want to see, but is better for your car-parking needs and traveling by public transportation to the sites.

Prepare a packing list ahead of time.,
Pack well in advance, and travel light.,
Consider booking through a travel agent.",How to Slow Down As a Busy Traveler1," Packing your bags can be one of the most frantic and stressful aspects of travel–not to mention one that’s often left until the last minute. To slow down this aspect of your traveling, create a packing list months in advance of your trip. Write down travel necessities (clothes, passport, computer) first, and add new items to the list when they come to mind.Don’t throw away your list after you return from your trip. A well-made travel list can serve you for years, since you’ll typically take the same items with you from one trip to the next.
Consider laminating your packing list and placing it in your suitcase or backpack, so you won’t have to search for it each time you’re planning a new trip.;
, To slow down the speed of your travel preparation and to avoid stress, start packing in advance. Although some items—such as clothes and toiletries—may need to be packed the day before you leave, others can be set aside weeks in advance. This will allow you to pack more slowly, and decrease travel-associated stress.As a busy traveler, it’s also important that you travel light. This will help you move with less stress through busy airports, security lines, and bus terminals. Packing light will also help you focus on the places you’re traveling to see, as you won’t be weighed down by several heavy bags.
Only focus on bringing the essentials; you can always pick up incidental objects on your trip.

, Especially if you’re planning a long trip—or several short trips—with multiple destinations, hotel stays, rental cars, and other logistics, plan to talk with a travel agent. Although the profession may seem outdated, an agent can put together all of these bookings for you, so that you’re not searching through countless travel websites on your own time. For long, complex trips, working with a travel agent could also save you money. Your travel agent may be able to find lucrative deals that you wouldn’t have access to, or may know ways to package flight, hotel, and rental car purchases together to decrease the cost.

Check out more than one source.,
Search for the hotel.,
Click next to the stars, where it says ""X number of Google reviews"" and you will be taken directly to the hotel's Google Places page, where you can read the reviews.,
Check the local Chamber of Commerce site for the city the hotel is in.

,
Understand that a bad review might just be sour grapes.,
Use several sources rather than just one.,
If you do find bad reviews, check to see if the owner or some other representative of the hotel has taken the time and effort to respond to them.,
Although the number of reviews can be a good indication the quality of the hotel, keep in mind that a small lodge or inn gets fewer guests then a gigantic hotel chain, and therefore will logically get fewer reviews.

,
You can register a free account with any of the sites listed above, as well as lots of other sites.",How to Use Online Hotel Review Sites," Although you should view the review section of a hotel's website, that is never enough. Of course, you should visit the hotel's testimonial page, because you can get a feel for any positive features listed, but if there are any negatives about the hotel, you will almost never find them on the hotel's own site.;
, If you Google the name of the hotel, you will surely be presented with some of the review sites. The Google Places page should be easy to find in the results. It can be identified by the ""pushpin"" icon that will be next to it. If it has stars next to it, it means that the hotel has been reviewed on that page. It may also say the number of Google reviews the hotel has. If there are a lot of reviews, you can generally get a better impression of hotel.

,


Besides Google, several other review sites are listed in the resource box at the bottom of this article. To check if the hotel you are looking for is listed with them, use the search boxes on their pages.

,, Look to see if the complaint is supported by other reviews. If a hotel has many four and five-star reviews, and one one-star review, it may be because some goofball or disgruntled employee or competitor has a chip on their shoulder. Treat such situations with a grain of salt. Don't let one bad apple spoil what might be a great vacation choice for you. (You should be aware that it is possibly illegal, and certainly a violation of Internet policies, for a competing establishment to trash a business on review sites.)


If there are many negative reviews and only a few good ones, on the other hand, you should definitely be skeptical of the establishment.

, Relying solely on Google reviews would be a mistake. Use them, but make sure they're not your only resource. Make sure you check out other online hotel review sites, as well.

, If the owner of the hotel has an account with the site, s/he can respond to reviews See if the response is thoughtful and courteous. This may give you a feel for how the hotel does business.

,, You can then leave your own opinion of venues that you have experience with in a review post.

Let the hotel front desk staff do some of the work.,
Schedule in “required” extra time for delays.,
Plan to do fewer activities.",How to Slow Down As a Busy Traveler2," A large part of the headache of fast-paced travel comes from the plethora of details that can consume your time and generate stress. Rather than micro-managing each detail yourself, seek assistance from the front-desk staff or hotel concierge. For example, ask the front desk of your hotel to make you a dinner reservation, call you a cab, or put together an outline of a travel plan for a day.Especially if you’re traveling with children, you’ll need to rely on others around you to make your trip less stressful and busy. Ask the front desk staff for restaurant recommendations, and recommendations of local activities that are fun for children.

, As a busy traveler, you’ll often have a tight schedule to keep: flight times, bus schedules, and train timetables may be your first priority. However, delays are an unfortunate but inevitable part of travel. Slow down your travel schedule by allowing extra time around all plane, bus, and train travel, and you’ll find yourself feeling less busy and enjoying your travel time more.By accepting that delays are a part of travel, you can save yourself stress and worry. You can also pan to be productive during your delays—call ahead to alert the hotel that you’ll be arriving late, or if you have a longer delay, walk around a local neighborhood to absorb the culture.

, This may seem like an intuitive step, but it’s one that many busy travelers forget. Rather than filling your time when you’re traveling with a dozen plans, which will leave you feeling rushed and drained, simplify your trip and only do the three or four activities that you’re most excited about. For example, if a city is known for its world-class art museum but you’d rather spend the day exploring a local forest, don’t feel obliged to do both. Stick with the forest.
Filling your time with fewer activities—but ones that are more interesting, pleasurable, and meaningful to you as an individual—will help you slow down your travel pace. This will allow you to savor and enjoy each activity more.

Slow down your method of travel by staying on the ground.,
Take a local approach and travel somewhere nearby.,
Take an affordable cruise.",How to Slow Down As a Busy Traveler3," If you’re used to traveling primarily by plane—a fast-paced, high-stress mode of travel—look into alternate options. For example, a road trip is a great way to see local attractions and parts of a country or region that you haven’t visited before. A road trip also allows you to slow down and travel at your own leisurely pace.If you’ve never traveled by train, it can be an excellent way to slow down the pace of your travel and have more local-color experiences while traveling. Train travel moves at a leisurely pace, and you won’t have to worry about catching connecting flights or navigating unfamiliar—and stressful—airports., You can also slow down the busy pace of your travel by focusing on in-depth exploration of a single local city, town, or region, rather than traveling across the country or world. Treating your own local environment like a travel destination will allow you to absorb local color that you haven’t noticed before, and you’ll be able to avoid the stressful tourist traps that draw inexperienced travelers in new cities and countries.As long as you’re traveling locally, you can try eating locally too. If there’s a farmer’s market open in the area, do your shopping there; you’ll doubtlessly be surprised by the varieties of local food that you’ve never sampled before.
You don’t have to stay in your own house to explore a local area. Look into local AirBnBs, traditional Bed and Breakfasts, and “mom and pop”-type hotel: say, within 30 miles of where you live.

, A cruise offers many conveniences that will help you keep your travel slow paced and not too stressful. The cruise ship will offer you a “home base” to start your daily explorations from, so you won’t have to worry about rushing from hotel to hotel, or from AirBnB to AirBnB. Cruise ships tend to travel at a moderate pace, giving their customers plenty of time to explore local cities and sites. The cruise will also confine you to a single region, which is beneficial to a slow-paced, low-stress travel plan.To book a cruise, first check large travel websites, including Expedia and Priceline. You can also book cruises directly through the websites of large providers, such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruise.
If you travel with several family members or friends, the cruise line may offer you a group discount. Cruises can be surprisingly inexpensive, especially if booked for the off season.

Almost all other nationalities can travel in and out Iran freely without need to be part of a tour.

Use Domestic Flights.,
Utilise Public Trains.,
Take a Bus.,
Hire Private Transport.",How to Travel Around Russia," The vast distances between many major destinations in Russia means taking domestic flights is often a necessity when traversing different regions of Russia, unless you have considerable amounts of time to spare


There are over 1,200 airports throughout Russia, so chances are wherever you want to go, it’s at least partly reachable by plane!
Aeroflot and S7 (Siberian Airlines) are the biggest domestic airlines.
Other domestic flyers are Russia Airlines, Utair and Transaero.;
, The Trans-Siberian Railway in the most famous long distance rail journey in Russia but with over 85,000 kilometers (53,000 mi) of railway lines criss-crossing the country.


Train travel is an inexpensive and often breathtakingly beautiful way to reach countless awesome destinations within Russia.
The network is run by Russian Railways, and its English language website (http://eng.rzd.ru) includes timetables and a network map.
Buying tickets is best done at the station. English is rarely spoken, but if you simply let them know your intended destination (a map in Russian can be a big help), purchasing tickets rarely poses any difficulties.

, Most tourists prefer the relative speed and reliability of Russia’s long distance trains, but buses can be a fun and interesting way to travel between smaller towns. In some regions, such as much of central and northern Siberia, bus travel may be the only public transport option you have.


Most cities have a main intercity bus sta¬tion with timetables posted up outside.
Tickets are sold either in advance at the station, or once you get on the bus.

, Many transport companies in Russia’s major cities can organise a private vehicle and driver to take you to most destinations within Russia, giving you the freedom to pick and choose exactly when and where you go.


This can be an extremely expensive endeavour, with long distances to cover, fuel costs and meal and accommodation expenses for your driver to weigh up.
A more affordable option is to book a trip with a tour company, offering private transportation within a tour group.

"
Figure out your arrival and departure dates.,
Start looking into accommodations.,
Secure your transportation.,
Decide where you want to ski or snowboard.,
Start booking your lift tickets early to save on expensive rates at the window.,
Get to Utah and enjoy your trip.

",How to Take a Ski Trip in Utah," Airline ticket fares can vary greatly depending on when you leave. Plan to book your tickets as far ahead of time as possible. Once you know the dates you will be in Utah, it will be easier to plan for everything else like hotel accommodations, lift tickets, etc.;
, Include your lodging costs in your budget after the airfare. With a little google-mapping, it is often possible to find a remote city or town that is close to the ski resorts you want to go to, but offers very cheap rates due to being the middle of nowhere.


For example, you might be able to locate a suitable motel offering rates of around $50 a night in Beaver, Utah, which is only 1 hour from Brian Head and 30 minutes from Eagle Point Ski resorts.
Keep in mind that lodging costs will vary from area to area. For example, it will be difficult to find cheap lodging in Park City, no matter where you look, because it's a notoriously expensive tourist area.

, Your transportation needs will vary depending on where you want to ski or snowboard and where you are staying.The cheapest mountain transportation options are offered by Utah's Transit Authority (UTA).


If you are staying in Salt Lake City or at the base of the Cottonwoods, there are public transportation options to get from the city to ski resorts in Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons (Brighton, Solitude, Snowbird and Alta). Check the UTA Ski bus schedule to plan ahead: http://www.rideuta.com/mc/?page=RidingUTA-SkiService

As with airfare, rental car arrangements should be booked as far ahead of time as possible. Don't be afraid to negotiate over the phone. Most rental car agencies do not have fixed prices for their vehicles, so it is often possible to get a cheaper rate with a little negotiation. Tell them that you're not able to afford to spend more than a set amount, and they might reduce the rental. Definitely worth it to negotiate and try your luck!

, Do you have your heart set on visiting the legendary Alta ski resort? Are you looking for a snowboard-friendly resort with lots of terrain parks? Determine what you like best about your skiing/riding experience and then figure out what mountains you want to visit during your trip based on these preferences. Every mountain has different things to offer, but it's useful to make a shortlist of some mountains that will help you to plan accordingly. This following list is not inclusive, but will get you started:


Alta - This is a skier's only mountain! All the skiers swear that this mountain has some of the best terrain they have ever skied.
Brighton - Located in Big Cottonwood Canyon, this mountain is one of the most snowboard-friendly mountains you will find. Of course, skiers are welcome too. Snowboarders will find special joy in the vast array of terrain parks available at this resort. Truly a local's mountain, Brighton offers great terrain and good deals on beginner packages if you are new to the sport.
Solitude - Located a few minutes south of Brighton, you will find some of the same awesome terrain at this mountain. However, don't expect to find much for terrain parks here. It is highly recommended that you're sure to hit the Summit lift before the end of your day. It is not to be missed.
Sundance - Sundance is one of the smaller ski resorts in Utah, but the offerings are anything but. You can find some of the cheapest lift tickets at this resort (as low as $30 a day on liftopia).
Park City Mountain Resort - If you're looking for a posh place to ski or ride, then Park City is the resort you want to visit. PCMR has more lifts than you can ever possibly ride in one day, including a lift that will drop you off right in the heart of downtown Park City (it's called the ""Town"" lift). PCMR offers nice scenic runs, but the lift tickets here are some of the most expensive out there.
Wolf Creek Mountain - Are you looking for a truly small, mom and pop mountain? Then Wolf Creek has what you're looking for. With a lodge that will time warp you straight back to 1993, Wolf Creek offers some seriously cheap lift tickets and amenities, at the sacrifice of only offering 2 or 3 lifts and limited terrain. This is a great place to go if you are or have a beginner with you though.

, The website www.liftopia.com has been a dollar-saver for skiers and snowboarders everywhere. With a little advanced planning, you can save yourself up to 80% off resort lift ticket prices by using their site and paying for your tickets ahead of time. The only catch is that you have to commit to being at the resort on the day that you purchase tickets for, however, this shouldn't be an issue with some planning and can actually help you make sure you're getting the most out of where you want to ski or snowboard in Utah.

Determine how much it will cost.,
Make sure that you tell your loved ones where and when you are travelling, and leave them with a copy of your itinerary so that they will know where you are at all times.,
Double check your flight time, and read over your itinerary so that you know where you are supposed to be and when.",How to Travel to Istanbul," First, you will need to decide how you plan on getting to Istanbul. For most people, this will mean taking an airplane. There are many great websites that allow you check for flights and compare prices, that way you can save on the price of your ticket and have more money to spend in the city!


Use the internet and explore anything you need to know about Istanbul such as Maps, Currency, Hotels, Restaurant, and more. While you are researching the fundamentals about Istanbul you should also have a look at what the city has to offer in terms of entertainment and tourism.
After you have finished researching the city, make a list of the things that you really want to do in Istanbul when you get there, and then come up with a timetable for your activities. This is known as an itinerary. An itinerary can help you plan and organize all of the things that you would like to do on your trip so that you can make the most of your time. Just make sure to budget a little bit of extra time in between your scheduled activities to allow for traffic.
Know how much it will cost to travel to Istanbul, and how much money you will need to spend on the various activities that you listed in the previous steps. Airplane tickets, accommodation, food, transportation in and around the city--all of these things add up quickly so you will need to come up with a budget for yourself. Don't forget that many museums and art galleries charge a small fee so depending on what you would like to see while in Istanbul, you many need to factor these fees into your budget. Add up the amount that you believe you will spend while in the city and even a little extra, just in case. If you already have enough money to cover the total that you have calculated, then you are ready to go!
Try to learn a bit of the language beforehand to make sure that you understand at least a few key words and phrases, and if you can, bring a language book with you so that you can make yourself understood when you need to.;
, Check in with them often to let them know that you are okay. And send pictures! Everyone loves getting pictures of beautiful foreign places like Istanbul.


Make a list of all the things that you want to bring with you, and tick off each item once you have packed it up.
If you are travelling with companions, make sure that they have enough money to cover their own expenses. It would be a good idea to discuss your budget with them, and vice versa. That way, everyone is on the same page where money is concerned, and no one in the group is left out of all the fun activities that you have planned.

,


Make sure you go to sleep earlier the night before your flight, and set an alarm early. For international flights, you have to be at the airport 2-3 hours before your flight takes off so make sure that you factor this time in.
Make sure your travel companions wake up too! That way no one misses the flight.

Never share detailed information about your travels on social media.,
Be conscious of the information you inadvertently share through social media.,
Safeguard your email.,
Use safe apps.",How to Safely Share Your Travel Itinerary1," One of the biggest mistakes people make when they go on vacation is to share the details of their travel itinerary on Facebook or other social media websites. By doing this, you are making your travel itinerary available to a huge number of people.


Avoid announcements like “We will be in Europe from August 7th to August 14th!” Such an announcement could open you up to a home robbery.
Don’t post play-by-play accounts of your trip on social media websites like Twitter. For instance, “We’re in Istanbul for two days, and will arrive in Ankara on Sunday morning!”
If you absolutely must share your travel plans, try to be as general as possible while still conveying your plans. For instance, post a status that says: “We are so excited to visit North Dakota later this month!”;
, You may, without knowing it, share information on social media simply by posting. As a result, you need to be aware of information that popular websites like Facebook may include in your posts -- even if the posts don't convey information themselves.


Websites like Facebook often put location stamps on your posts. For instance, you may post something simple like ""Just had a great dinner"" but Facebook will mark it as posted from Mumbai.
Take steps to limit who can see your posts on social media. Websites like Facebook and Myspace allow you to limit who can see your posts -- limit it to your friends. In addition, consider removing any friends or contacts who you do not trust.
The easiest way to safeguard yourself while on a trip is to avoid sharing any information about it at all until you get home., Another important thing to consider is checking the security of your email service and the devices you use to read your email. In short, make sure to avoid storing or sharing your itinerary via email that is insecure.


Make sure your password is relatively difficult. Avoid using birthdays, first names, names of pets, or similarly easy passwords. Try to use a capital letter, a number, and a symbol in your password.
Put passwords on your smart phones and portable devices. This way, if someone gets their hands on your smart phone, they won’t be able to access your email and itinerary.
When traveling, be careful of accessing your itinerary through a computer or device that you do not own., There are a variety of useful apps that you can use to safely share your travel itinerary. These apps will store your itinerary and allow other, approved users, to access it when they need to. Most of them are free. Try:

Making a detailed plan for your daily travel that includes transportation, accommodations, fun activities, and places to rest can ease the day and may minimize the risk of an arthritis flare up.


Write as detailed a daily plan as possible. This can ensure that you have access to every place you would like without exacerbating your arthritis.

This can prevent pain, unwanted visits to a doctor, or even immobility because of broken equipment.Bring gear to repair any devices you need such as a wheelchair or cane.
Pack extra supplies of hot and cold therapy to relieve or prevent discomfort and stiffness. A comfy travel pillow may also ease discomfort during flights or train trips.Take extra medication with you. It could be difficult to get a prescription from a doctor who doesn’t know you. This can also ensure you have medication if you lose any of your supply.Check if your insurance covers travel. If not, buy travel insurance that covers potential medical expenses while you’re away., Before you leave, confirm any reservations and special amenities you arranged. This can ensure that everything runs smoothly between your home and final destination.Contact transportation, hotels, restaurants, and tours 24-48 hours in advance to ensure they are prepared for your arrival., Movement is a great way to prevent stiffness and pain. Taking the time to explore your destination at leisurely pace can help you enjoy your trip without the discomfort of arthritis.Be sure to allow yourself to rest at regular intervals so that you don’t get tired or inflame your arthritis.


Don’t schedule too many activities. Instead of packing a day full of tours or museums, see one or two things that you don’t want to miss.
Allow ample time in between activities as well as time to rest. For example, if you are in Paris, consider taking time to sit in the Tuileries Gardens between visiting the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. People watching can be just as fun as running from site to site.

, Many people with arthritis follow diets to decrease inflammation.In some cases, traveling can keep you from following your diet because there aren’t a lot of options available. By selecting your foods carefully and taking snacks with you, you may be able to minimize any inflammation from your arthritis.Drink plenty of fresh and clean water throughout the day.

Try foods such as fresh fish, fruits and vegetables cleaned in fresh water, beans, and nuts.Avoid processed foods as much as possible.

, You may encounter a problem such as lack of working elevators or difficult walking terrain while traveling. Develop a backup plan if you recognize your original plans don’t work out. Ask local authorities or your accommodations about sites that may be easier for you to see. This can ensure you have a good time without making your arthritis worse.Consider activities that are close to one another. For instance, if you are in Paris and there are lines to visit the Louvre, sit in the Tuileries gardens and enjoy some people watching.

Consider whether you want to vacation in the mountains near you or in mountains in another place.,
Consider what the mountains offer.,
Choose your time of the summer season.,
Pack the gear you'll need.,
Be wildlife aware.,
Be mountain aware.,
Stay in one place for a few days if possible.,
Meet the locals.,
Relax a lot.,
Take photos.",How to Spend Summer Vacation in the Mountains," You might even want to travel interstate or overseas, depending on your budget.


How much time do you have for traveling? If you don't have much, choosing a mountain range that is close by makes more sense (if there are any nearby).;
, If you're after specific activities, this will narrow down the options for which mountains you choose. Some mountain areas are quite developed, offering hiking trails, chalets, interesting towns, etc., while other mountain regions are wild and have little development. What do you want from your visit? Some options include:


Simply soaking up the scenery. In which, case, look for a hotel known for its scenic mountain views. Often it will be of a resort style, offering activities on the site, such as spas, fine dining and sports such as golfing or tennis.
Hiking trails, rock- or mountain-climbing, parachuting, hunting, wildlife spotting, etc. Some places will have better infrastructure for this than others but you can easily check this by looking online.
Visiting a national park or heritage/conservation area in a mountain region. This can include wildlife watching, sleeping in camps or huts, stargazing, seeing natural features and landmarks, etc.
A field trip. Maybe you're keen to study the wildlife, find specimens of alpine plant growth, check for signs of climate change by observing the glaciers, etc. Take along a notebook and start observing!
Water sports. Many mountain regions have fantastic lakes with a lot of water sport opportunities, along with cabins or similar self-contained stay arrangements.

, Early and later summer are likely to be less crowded than the mid-summer time. If you're heading somewhere that is really popular, you'll need to find out whether bookings are essential, so that you don't miss out. Even campgrounds fill fast when it's a good season and some have booking requirements.

, Bear in mind that even though it is summer, mountain weather can change without warning and can become very cold, very quickly. This means being prepared at all times for cold weather, even when you're out for a ""short"" walk. Carry a rain jacket and windproof top in your backpack, just in case. Other things you'll probably need include:


Clothing for the place you're staying at. If it's a tent, just comfortable things are fine but if it's a resort, you'll need formal dinner clothing as well as your outdoor stuff for the daytime.
Hiking boots, sandals, shoes, etc.
Camping gear if camping.
All of your sports equipment unless you plan to hire any. Find out before you leave home whether it's possible to hire the things you'd rather leave behind.
Insurance for your car, for you and your family, and for the accommodation arrangements you've already paid for.
The usual gadgets you like to have with you. Maps are also useful, both in digital and paper form; you can't be guaranteed of getting good reception in the mountains.
Compass, if you're heading into the back country. GPS can also be helpful, along with emergency locators if you get lost.

, Some mountain ranges will contain wildlife, depending on which country and which mountain range you're in. If you're not sure, ask the locals before venturing out. Stay alert and take what you need to protect yourself, such as bear spray in bear country and knowledge of how to respond to any threat tailored to the animals you're likely to meet.

, Mountain regions are wild, rugged and hazardous. It is part of their charm and attraction. Here are some of the things it pays to be aware of:


Although it's summer, an avalanche may be possible in some mountain regions. If there is snow, there is a possibility, so always know how to take care, how to avoid avalanche areas and what to do if one does happen.
Windy roads and narrow roads, rock falls over roads. Each of these presents its own set of hazards. It is important to heed road signs and road closures. Do not go through closed roads for any reason; they have been closed for your safety. If you see a rockfall, report it to the authorities. And on windy roads or narrow roads, drive slowly and carefully; give other drivers plenty of space and the benefit of the doubt.
Rivers and lakes. As beautiful as these water bodies are, they can also be very dangerous. A raging, swollen river can carry you away instantly if you cross it at the wrong time or fall in, while cold and deep lakes can claim an unsuspecting swimmer or boater. Treat water with care––cross rivers responsibly, always wear a life jacket when undertaking water sports and water activities and do not camp in dry creek or river beds.
Getting lost. Losing your way is possible when you go into the back country. Get sufficient information before setting out, let people know where you're headed and for how long, and when to expect you back. Take appropriate precautions to ensure your safety if you do get lost, such as having emergency beacon locators with you. Remember––your cell phone, no matter how smart, is next to useless when you're in the back country.

, That way, you will grow to enjoy the majestic skyline and some of the mountains will be seared in your memory, friends for life.

, Talk to people who live and work in the mountain area and learn what their lives are like. You might even make new friends out there, making it worth returning the following summer!


If you're in a national park or similar, find out what talks and gatherings the rangers have organized. You can meet a lot of wonderful people who share your passion at such events.

, Mountain air is good for you and while it's great to exercise in it, it's also lovely to just chill out and kick back. Take along some good books, your art kit or some nice music and allow yourself time to commune with mother nature in the mountains.

, With a digital camera, everyone can take great mountain images. If you're a really serious photographer, you can take panoramic shots and maybe even climb and get some more unique shots where most people can't be bothered going. Also check out the possibilities for taking photos of the wildlife, the plant life and sunrise and sunset over the mountains.

Bring comfortable bedding.,
Pack comforting items to help you fall asleep.,
Include coverings for your car windows.",How to Sleep in Your Car on a Road Trip1," Whether you’re parking for the night or taking a couple hours’ snooze break while your friend drives, you’ll need to make up for the car’s environment. While not impossible to sleep in cars as-is, it can be uncomfortable. You’ll probably bring a bit more if you plan to sleep overnight and not just during the drive.Must-haves are pillows and blankets, or a sleeping bag if you are traveling through regions with cold temperatures. Don’t rely for on your car’s heating absolutely when you plan to sleep overnight.
Make sure you bring enough bedding to accommodate your passengers, especially if they are children. If you are taking a road trip with another person and plan on taking turns driving, you could bring one set of pillows and blankets to save on room space inside the car.
Be sure to pack these items inside the car and not in the trunk or on the roof. You may get sleepy earlier than you anticipated, and it’s helpful not to have to leave the car when conditions outside aren’t great.;
, A lot of people have difficulty sleeping in locations other than their beds. Bring soothing items you use regularly to relax in order to make you feel more comfortable in your car.For example, if you enjoy reading before bed, bring a book and book light so you can read before falling asleep.
Music is helpful here, but don’t rely on your car stereo. Bring an mp3 player and headphones so that you can still relax to music with the car off before you go to sleep.
If you’re especially worried about your ability to fall asleep in the car, consult a pharmacist about over-the-counter sleep aids. Note, however, that you’ll be limited from driving once having taken one until you’ve had at least several hours’ rest.

, For those who are hoping to catch some sleep while a friend drives, you’ll want something to keep the sun from your eyes. Those who are burdened with an overnight stay will need coverings to ensure their privacy.


Towels and t-shirts that you’re bringing anyway are a great help here. Provided the t-shirts are large enough, either of these can be used as efficient window covers.
Bring along some clothespins or tape to attach the covers. If you’ve forgotten, you can simply close the doors on the cover you’re using with it slightly above the door frame; it will hang, caught between the door and the car.
Bring a hat and sunglasses if you plan on sleeping during daylight hours. Wearing a hat and sunglasses while you sleep will protect your face from any sun still getting in, and may also help you sleep better while providing additional privacy.

Pay attention to parking.",How to Travel by Car with an Infant," Safety should be your top priority. It is absolutely crucial to purchase a car seat designed for your infant’s age and size. There are three basic models on the market: rear-facing infant-only car seats designed for babies under 35 pounds, infant-toddler combination seats that can be rear-facing for babies under 45 pounds and then turned around to face forward for toddlers, and booster seats made to position children over four years old for optimal seatbelt usage. If you have an infant, choose an appropriate seat.


If possible, buy a car seat before your baby is born. If you travel by car, you’ll need it to take your infant home from the hospital or birth center. And the sooner you familiarize yourself with the seat – and the manual, which you should read carefully – the easier it will be to use when the time comes.
If your family has two cars, consider purchasing a separate car seat for each. The added expense may be worth it: it will save you time in the future and prevent the rushed installation mistakes that sometimes occur when you hurry to move a car seat from one vehicle to another.;
, Car seats should be installed in the back seat of your car, and, if possible, in the middle seat. Double check the instructions in the user manual to be sure that you are installing the seat correctly. Make sure all belts and latches are secure. For infants, the seat should be rear-facing – this position is the safest for babies.


In many locations, you can go to a police or fire station (or sometimes other places) to have a professional check the installation of your car seat for safety. Check online for options in your area. One good site, which will let you search for locations in your zip code, (if applicable) is: http://www.safercar.gov/cpsApp/cps/index.htm.

, Car seat laws vary from state to state and country to country, so always check to make sure that your infant has safe, appropriate equipment.

, If you plan to drive a significant distance, take your car to the dealership or a mechanic before your trip. It’s better to find out about a problem before you leave than to run into unexpected car trouble in the middle of your trip. If necessary, repair or replace anything as needed.


Don’t neglect the heat and air conditioning. You’ll want to make sure that you can keep your car at a comfortable temperature for your baby.

, You don’t want your baby staring into direct sunlight, so buy sun shades to mount on the car windows. When you drive, you can watch to make sure that your baby’s face and eyes are shielded from the sun.

, Make sure there are no sharp objects in the vicinity of your infant’s car seat, whether the infant could reach them or not. If you brake suddenly, turn sharply, or get into an accident, these objects could be dangerous. Cover any metal objects in your baby’s reach, as they could heat up in the sun and burn your baby.

, It can be convenient to buy a portable mirror and set it up so that you can see your baby clearly from the front seat of the car. You’ll be able to check on your infant more easily, and he or she will also be able to see you.

, A few brightly colored removable images might keep your baby occupied during the trip. Just take care not to choose anything so large that it interferes with your ability to see. Safety is most important.

, If you will be traveling at night, consider bringing a source of soft light so that your baby doesn’t get scared. Choose a light that is not so bright as to interfere with your driving.

, Starting your trip with a full tank of fuel will save you an additional stop. In addition, you’ll expose your infant to fewer fumes from fuel evaporation.

, Always take more than you think you’ll need, as you don’t want to wind up stuck without diapers halfway through your trip.


Wet wipes are handy for more than just diaper changes: you can use them for quick hand washes and to cool and refresh your infant’s face.

, If your infant takes a bottle, take extras: your trip may take longer than planned, and you may not have an easy way to wash them. Make sure you have enough formula if that’s what your infant drinks. If your baby has started solid foods, take those supplies as well.

, If you are breastfeeding, you will need to eat regularly and drink plenty of water to keep yourself hydrated and fuel your milk production. Even if you are not breastfeeding, though, you’ll want to stay nourished and hydrated; this will make you a safer driver and keep you in a better mood.

, A baby blanket can be very handy on the road: you can use it to support your infant’s head in the car seat, to cover your infant while he or she is sleeping, and as an extra layer if your infant gets chilly. Towels are great for makeshift diaper changing surfaces; simply lay one down on the seat of the car to change your baby’s diaper (waterproof and/or disposable changing pads also work well for this purpose). You can also use the towels to wipe up any spit up or clean your baby off if he or she somehow gets dirty.


Don’t leave a blanket in your baby’s car seat if you cannot see your baby at all times. It’s important to be sure it does not fall over your baby’s face.

, Your baby may spill food, spit up, or otherwise make a mess, so it’s best to have a change of clothes for each of you.

, Keep a few garbage bags handy for diapers, trash, and food scraps. You’ll need somewhere to put it all until you get to a place to dispose of it.

, A few soft toys may keep your baby occupied for part of the trip. Activity bars made to attach above the car seat are a great investment for younger babies. You can also take music – something you know your baby likes, or something likely to help your baby fall asleep.


Don’t give your baby any hard toys; these can be dangerous when driving.

, Make sure you have phone numbers for your pediatrician and for emergency services stored in your phone and/or written down. You probably won’t need them, but just in case your baby gets sick or an emergency arises, it’s nice to have them.

, Make sure your car has a standard first aid kit. In addition, take a thermometer, temperature lowering medications, rash creams, and any other medications your baby might need.

, If you will be taking a very long trip, check in with your baby’s pediatrician first. He or she can check your baby’s health and give you tips for traveling.

, If you do not travel by car often, you may need to get your baby used to being in the car seat. Put your baby in the seat a few times before you go, and let him or her play and/or take a short nap there. This will reduce the likelihood of your baby protesting the car seat when you get on the road.

, Your baby’s health is important, but so is yours – make sure that you are healthy and feeling well before you leave, especially if you will be the only one driving.

, Remember that you will have to stop frequently to feed, change, and comfort your baby. If a trip usually takes you six hours, plan for at least eight or nine hours with a baby on board.


If delays become significant, and your trip is a long one, you may want to check in for the night at a roadside hotel. This will give you a chance to rest and recharge before tackling the rest of your journey.

, If it’s at all possible, try to have another adult with you on the trip. Having someone to keep you company and help entertain the baby will make the trip more enjoyable, and having someone to share the driving will make it less exhausting.

, Some parents find their car trips go more smoothly if they plan to leave at night or at naptime. This way, your baby may sleep for a significant portion of the journey.


Every baby is different, and you’ll have to think about what your baby will tolerate best. If you think it will be better to leave when your baby is usually awake and happy, you can try that too.

, Depending on the weather conditions, you’ll want to dress your baby in at least a few layers so that he or she does not get too warm or too cold. A onesie and socks can serve as the base layer, and you can add clothing as necessary., Take care of your baby’s basic needs before you start driving. If your baby is warm, dry, and fed, he or she will be more likely to tolerate the drive. Moreover, you’ll be able to get a good start and drive for awhile without having to stop prematurely.

, You and your baby will both do better if you stop to rest every few hours. Time these rests so that you can feed your baby and try not to disrupt his or her schedule.


When you stop briefly to feed your baby, be sure you allow enough time for burping. This will help ensure that your baby does not develop an upset stomach during the ride.
Even if your baby seems to be doing well, it’s good to stop periodically and get out of the car. Fresh air and a change of pace are good for both of you. Besides, it’s not good for your baby to sit constrained in a car seat for extended periods of time – especially if he or she is a newborn. Consider, especially, making unplanned stops if you see a park or another place that would be good for a walk.

, If your baby starts to get cranky, try singing. You do not have to be a good singer; your baby does not care. Your voice will be calming, and it’s a good way to let your baby know that you are there.

, Do not give your baby a bottle or any other food while the car is in motion, as your baby may choke, swallow too much air, or vomit. If your baby needs to eat, stop the car., Stop the car first if you need to take your baby out of the seat. It is unsafe (and illegal) to have your baby unbuckled while the car is moving.

, Make sure you park so that you have enough room to open the back doors of the car, and try to park so that the baby is on the side of the road away from moving vehicles."

Only tell people you trust.,
Provide limited, necessary, information to people who work for you.,
Inform your employer, if necessary.",How to Safely Share Your Travel Itinerary2," Perhaps the most important thing when it comes to communicating your travel plans is to only share them with people you trust. By limiting the pool of people who know about your itinerary, you’ll limit associated risk.


Provide your itinerary to your immediate family.
Provide your itinerary to any trusted friends who may be taking care of things for you, like watering plants or caring for your dogs., Chances are, depending on how long you’re traveling, you may need to provide information about your travels to people who provide you with certain services. This is true if you have a regular cleaning person, lawn service, or a dog walking service. Remember to:


Only provide specific, needed, information to people who clean your house or care for your lawn. Under no circumstances should you tell them you’ll be gone for a week or two.
If you regularly employee a dog walker, babysitter, or someone who provides a similar service, simply let them know that you won’t need their services for a certain amount of time. For instance, tell your dog walker: “We won’t need you to walk Cooper next week.”

, You should also provide a basic itinerary to your employer. This is especially true if you’re in a profession in which people might need to get in touch with you at a moment’s notice.


If your job requires, provide detailed contact information for your trip. In many circumstances, this will require that you share your itinerary with your employer.
If you’re a lawyer, in medicine, or work in the finance industry, your employer or coworkers may need to contact you under various circumstances.
Try to plan to see if you’ll be able to be contacted while on your trip. If not, make arrangements to get a cell phone or satellite phone where you are going."
"
Avoid sharing with strangers.,
Secure your travel documents.,
Use caution when sharing your itinerary with taxi drivers, hotel staff, and others.",How to Safely Share Your Travel Itinerary3," You need to be conscious of who you talk to and share details about your trip as you travel. This is important, as depending on where you travel, there may be people who dedicate themselves to taking advantage of unknowing travelers.


Never share details of your trip with someone you just met.
If for some reason you deem it appropriate to open up to a stranger, share the bare minimum information you need to. For instance, if you are on a train or a plane and a passenger next to you inquires where you are going, feel free to answer them generally, but don’t give them many details. Say something like “We’re visiting Canada for a couple of days.”, Make sure your travel documents are in a secure place at all times while you travel. If your documents – including your itinerary – are not safe, you may open yourself up to robbery, identity theft, or other problems.


Store your itinerary, identification, and other documents on your person but separate from your wallet or purse. It may be a good idea to wear a fanny pack or other personal storage device for documents you do not access often.
You may also want to consider storing your travel documents in a safe or lockbox at your hotel.
If you need to keep an itinerary in your wallet or on you, only keep a partial itinerary. This way, if you lose it or your wallet, no one will know your plans for your whole trip., It might seem like a reasonable thing to provide people who are helping you with your trip (while on your trip) with the details of your itinerary. However, depending on where you are visiting, and the people you encounter, you should exercise caution.


Refer to any travel warnings issues by your national government. For the United States, the State Department will issue travel warnings for countries where you should be extra careful.
Someone who seems like a friendly and helpful person – like a cab driver – might be looking for an opportunity to take advantage of naïve tourists.
It never hurts to be paranoid, just try to avoid being rude to people."

Conduct an online search.,
Purchase a travel guidebook.,
Speak to people who have visited your destinations.",How to Spend a Year Travelling2," Read about every location you plan to visit, focusing on information related to your travel goals. For example, if your goal is to study Spanish for a year in 5 or 6 countries in South America, gather information about the language schools. If you intend to travel and work abroad, investigate work authorizations and tax laws.

, Try to bring along a guidebook for every destination you plan to visit, in case you do not have Internet access or other ways of accessing information while away.

, Friends, relatives and colleagues are sometimes the best sources for travel information. Ask them about any travel risks and the names of their favorite hotels, restaurants and activities.

Include costs related to preparing for your trip. Immunizations, special supplies, clothing, visa fees and medications are other expenses to include.

, Whether you are traveling by plane, train or boat, making transportation and hotel reservations in advance generally lowers costs and secures your travel plans.

, Food poisoning, altitude sickness, insect bites and seasickness are a few of the challenges that some travelers experience. Investigate these factors in advance and prepare by getting immunized and bringing along necessary medications.

, Investigate these requirements at least 6 months in advance to ensure that you have everything you need before departure.


Make copies of all travel documents. Leave them behind with a trusted family member or friend in the event that the originals are lost or stolen.

, Your current health insurance policy might offer coverage for travel; however, you typically must purchase additional coverage for long-term travel.

, If you must pay rent, mortgage, utilities or other expenses while you are gone, make arrangements to pay these on time. Automatic withdrawals from your bank account, bill paying services or reliable relatives who can mail your payments are a few options.

, You might direct all of your mail to a relative, ask the post office to hold your mail, or hire a mail forwarding service that tracks your location and forwards your mail.

"
Assume the position.,
Let the driver know.,
Accept what sleep you can get.",How to Sleep in Your Car on a Road Trip2," Sleeping while the car is moving is never simple, as you have to keep your seatbelt on and sleep in a seated position. There’s no one right way to do this, and it may take you a while to get situated and comfortable.


Take a reclinable seat, if possible. Many front passenger seats will allow you to recline the back fully. Provided no one is sitting behind you, this is the best way to duplicate a flat sleeping area.
Rest your head on your pillow against the window. If you’re unable to use a reclining seat, the next best thing for hanging your head is to use the window.

, The enemy of the road trip nap is the unruly driver. Shakes, bumps and hard turns can ruin your sleeping experience and leave you restless. Be sure the driver knows of your intention to get some shut-eye so they can drive accordingly.


Remind them that you’ll be doing the same in their situation if you plan on switching roles later on. This way they’re more open to match thoughtfulness with thoughtfulness.
Also check with the driver before covering any windows to block out the light. The driver may very well need those to check blind spots and the rest of the road. Sunglasses and a hat are a little more handy here.
Keep the music under control. You don’t want to be jarred awake by heavy metal after an hour only because you forgot to take the mp3 player off of shuffle.

, Even when you’ve planned, prepped, and done every you could’ve to ensure a long sleep, the unavoidable bump or uncontrollable car horn will inevitably interrupt you. Keep a positive attitude even when drowsy and cranky, and know that you hope your driving companions will do the same.


Bring along a sleeping mask to cover your eyes for sudden wakefulness. If something jolts you awake, you won’t be disoriented and jarred by sudden sun or streetlight. The mask will keep your eyes in darkness allowing you to drift back to sleep shortly."
"
Choose a safe location in which to park your car.,
Turn the car off.,
Crack your windows or sunroof for ventilation.,
Find a comfortable sleeping position.,
Follow a morning routine after waking.",How to Sleep in Your Car on a Road Trip3," A safe location should be away from traffic and stores entrances, in a spot that allows for extended or overnight parking. Some locations have strict rules in place and prohibit overnight parking, so you may become towed or fined if you park in these locations.


Whether or not sleeping in your car will get you a ticket is totally dependent on where you are. Check local and state regulations whenever traveling. Never sleep on the side of the road or highway.
Park at a designated rest stop, or 24-hour parking lot. Many interstates and highways have overnight rest stops you can park at and sleep in overnight while on road trips. This is really the best option to avoid interruption either by the public or by law enforcement.
Find a 24-hour store. Walmart is the big name in this category. Some locations have explicit rules against over-nighters, however, so check online or in the store before you shut eyes for the night.Park somewhere reasonably well-lit. Though it might seem counter-intuitive to trying to sleep, it’s best for your safety to park in a lot with plenty of light.

, Leave the keys out of the ignition. There is the possibility of breaking the law if you fall asleep with your keys in the ignition; you may be considered ""in operation"" of your car while asleep. Keep your doors locked and your keys in your pocket.


If you're traveling in very cold temperatures, you may need to wake up periodically to run the car for warmth. Be sure to stay awake while the car is running.

, By allowing air to enter or circulate throughout the inside of the car, you will sleep more comfortably and avoid waking up feeling hot and sticky, or with condensation on the windows.


If you end up somewhere relatively populated or crowded, this might not be the best idea. The noise level might be too much to bear with cracked windows. You’d also like to avoid anyone looking in on you.
This is also not necessary or even advisable if you’re traveling in very cold temperatures.

, Luckily when the car isn’t in motion you’ll have a variety of options. Hopefully you won’t have anyone to share the car with for optimal space. Depending on the type of car you have, you might end up in several different positions.Ideally you’ll have a hatchback or some other type of car which opens into the trunk from the back seat. If you can put the back seat down and open up trunk space for your legs, this will be the best way to stretch out.
When driving a pick-up truck, clear space in the bed of the truck (appropriately named here) to sleep in. You'll want to consider a tarp over the bed to keep out insects.
If you're on the shorter side, an empty back seat can make for a usable bed. You'll most likely need to curl your legs for the night so if you're prone to move while you sleep this might end up uncomfortable.
At the very least sleep in a fully reclined seat. Being able to lie down at least partially mimics the usual environment of sleeping in a bed.

, This practice will help you wake up feeling fresh and more comfortable, especially if you have a full day of driving ahead of you. Sleeping in a car can sometimes make you feel especially dirty or cramped, so take the time to stretch and clean up.


If you were fortunate enough to stop at a rest stop, take the time to have a shower and brush your teeth at their facilities.
Keep some bottled water handy for the exclusive use of these morning ablutions. When you’re stuck with nothing else, it’ll come in handy to wash your face or brush your teeth.

Know everything about the destination.,
Keep track with multiple tracking tools.,
Pack according to your needs.",How to Prepare Yourself for a Solo Trip," Everyone has a fixed route they take every day to work, and back home. Everything is counted and calculated. Try to get off the bus (or other public transport that you use) a couple of stops before your usual stop, and walk home for the remaining distance. This will not only give a chance to take a glimpse of your wider neighborhood, which you might have missed exploring all these years, but you will also get an idea about how much you can comfortably cover on foot.

, Weekends are your days off, offering you the time to relax, chill out with friends, watch movies, spend time with family; all understood! But why not take a short trip one coming weekend, and travel to a nearby city to spend a day alone. Give yourself time to explore the city, observe the people there, get to know the the streets, and do whatever else you think you need to know about that place, focusing especially on the things you never bothered to learn about earlier., If your trip destination is into the hills, this is one of the best ways to kick-start your preparations. Take a day off from your routine, get your backpack ready (snack, water bottles, medication box, etc.), and leave for the nearest hill for a day’s hike. This will serve as a kind of simulation training., Eating out all by yourself can get really sad for some, that’s understood! But since you will be heading for a solo trip, you may have to face this situation during your trip. Go out and indulge in one or other of the activities that you generally do with friends or family. Watch a movie in the theatre, have a fine gourmet meal, attend a fair; get used to doing things without someone accompanying you., So you approached the girl or guy you were infatuated with, and things turned out…. well, let's say, not so good! Don’t let your college experiences haunt you for your entire life. Try to approach people to see if you can initiate some conversation. Now, asking the direction for the nearest restaurant isn’t going to offend anyone, would it?, While on your journey, there will be times when you will have to share the space with other travelers. So if you have been in the habit of having your own room, own bed, own shower; well, that’s going to go for a toss here. Make a stay over at one of your friends’ places and see how you take the sharing concept. Get used to it!, Just dropping at the decided destination without doing a thorough study about the place is always a bad idea, especially when you are travelling alone. It is always beneficial to know a thing or two about the city or the country you are planning to take a trip to. This will help you filter the spots you would want to see, once you are there, and will save time.
, Always keep a paper map when travelling alone; this is the best way to know the routes and directions. Of course, the Google maps on your phone will come handy too, but having a variety of navigating tools makes the journey smoother, especially when you've forgotten to charge your phone or the internet access is non-existent. Moreover, asking the locals for the directions is always an option too!, While on a trip, always try to travel as light as possible. Your backpack must only have the essentials you are likely to need during your sojourn. Medical supplies, food and other general stuff are usually easily available in any city you visit; if you are travelling into the wilderness of forests or mountains, then you'll need to be more careful and carry more with you. A little bit of research about the destination, thus, comes in handy for this purpose too."

Search for vacation payment services using the terms ""travel layaway"" or ""vacation layaway."",
Choose a financially stable company.,
Pick your layaway package or destination carefully.,
Compare the fees.,
Read the contract carefully.,
Pay an initial deposit.,
Start paying 6 months to 1 year in advance.,
Ask for a contact number for a billing representative.,
Research and purchase travel insurance.",How to Pay Monthly on a Vacation1," The layaway plan now extends to student travel, vacation rentals, cruises and packages. You will get a better idea of the market before committing to a company.;
, Read reviews and do your research to be sure the company you want to book a trip with is strong enough to make it through the next few years. Travel is a volatile market and you can lose your layaway payments if the company goes bankrupt.


The Fair Credit Billing Act protects people who have purchased travel tickets or packages on a credit card, if the company goes bankrupt. This protection does not extend to payment plans.
Popular layaway websites are eLayaway.com and Lay-Away.com. Disney is also a big proponent of helping families to save through a layaway plan.

, Not all vacations are good candidates for layaway plans. The following are good monthly payment plan guidelines:


Don't choose a layaway plan for trips abroad. Currency fluctuates every year. You may end up paying much more, if the local currency decreases in value. If you feel like you are getting a good deal because you have invested early and the local currency rises in value, you may be billed for a ""currency surcharge.""
Choose layaway options to reserve hard-to-book locations. If you want to get a low-cost stay at an expensive ski resort, a local vacation rental may offer the ability to put 20 percent down and pay monthly. They get the security of booking their rental far in advance, and you have the security of a guaranteed price.
Book monthly payment plans with tour companies. The nature of most tour companies is to take a deposit, bill monthly and require the remaining balance 45 days before departure. Ask about their payment plans and whether you can pay online.
Disney's ""Magic Your Way"" vacation packages offer a very flexible payment plan. It is geared toward families who want to visit their theme parks. You can make monthly payments or occasional payments, as long as you pay everything 45 days in advance.

, Almost all layaway plans come with fees, because they are offering an extra account processing service. Pay attention to booking fees, agent fees, cancellation fees and percentages.


For example, a vacation rental may offer layaway for a $25 fee. This is a reasonable fee because you are getting peace of mind by booking early. Websites like eLayaway.com may charge a 2 percent fee plus other charges for the service. This can add up to a few hundred dollars.

, Before signing, you should feel comfortable that there is the ability to reschedule or get some of your money back, if you cannot take the vacation. Layaway vacations are planned well in advance, and life or money situations can change during that time.

, These can range from 10 to 50 percent.

, Starting payments less than 6 months before travel may mean you only make 2 to 3 payments before the final payment deadline. You may not know your own schedule if you start payments over a year in advance.

, Creating a payment plan can leave you exposed to human error. Check your statements carefully, and call someone immediately if you see a problem.

, Choose a plan that offers coverage in case of cancellation. Ask if the service you are using will be covered before signing up.

Check mileages -- in the United States, places can be hundreds of miles apart in reality but look quite close on the map. Think about how long you can realistically drive per day.


It’s often fun to get or buy a map and physically work out your route from that. If you’d rather do it online, Google Maps or MapQuest are good tools: https://maps.google.com/ or http://www.mapquest.com/

Don’t set yourself up for exhaustion and failure by planning a trip in which you’re in the car for 10 hours a day six days in a row -- that’s not fun at all.;
, Make a note of some of the places you’ll eat along the way. For some great suggestions, go to roadfood.com or websites like yelp.com where locals can weigh in on the best food in their areas. Try to stick to a loose meal schedule so you’re not ravenous and looking for food along a stretch of road with nothing. When in doubt, you can always get a good variety of foods at grocery stores. If you have particular diet (vegan, gluten-free, etc.) grocery stores are often going to be your best choices., If you are going to be staying in one place for a few days, it might make sense to rent an apartment and cook for part of your time there. You will end up saving a lot of money on food, and can even prepare food for the next leg of driving.

, It’s fun to drive aimlessly sometimes and just find a hotel for the night, but it’s often hard to find the best lodging at the cheapest price if you don’t plan ahead. Sometimes you also get stuck going much farther than you had hoped because you can’t find lodging, or the lodging you find is not at all what you wanted. You certainly don’t need to plan every stop for every night of your trip -- think about planning one or two nights ahead if you like to keep things loose.If you’re going to camp, it’s essential that you make reservations, especially in summer at popular campgrounds. Some places fill up months in advance.

, Make sure your car, van, or recreational vehicle is in working order. Get it inspected shortly before your trip to ensure everything is in proper order and functioning appropriately. Make an appointment at your auto repair shop at least two weeks before you are due to leave -- sometimes there are more issues with your car than you realize and your mechanic will need more time to get your vehicle ready., Check the weather forecast for the places you'll be visiting -- it might be much different than where you are and you need to be prepared. Pack clothing you can layer and pieces that can easily be worn together. Jeans, shorts, and t-shirts are typical road trip choices, since they are casual and comfortable for riding long distances in the car.

, Having food for snacks or if you can't find a meal when you need it is essential for any road trip. Some popular road trip food choices are:Jerky
Chips
Crackers and peanut butter
Trail mix
Popcorn
Veggie or fruit chips

, Snacks like yogurt or dips need to be refrigerated (and go well with your other snack foods). And a cooler is the best way to make sure you always have access to cold beverages. Make sure to replenish your ice supply every morning to keep your food and drinks from sitting in a pool of warm water.

of gas, it’s going to be easy to rack up reward and points and money off. Make sure you choose a gas card that’s going to be the most useful depending on your region -- check which gas stations are most common where you are going., Pack them together and place in the trunk before you get the rest of your gear in. Keep in mind, however, that they will need to be accessible at all times. You will typically want to include the following basics:Motor oil
Radiator fluid
Roadside emergency kit with flares, jumper cables, and flashlight
Fire extinguisher
Nonperishable food
Drinking water
Blankets
First aid kit

, Make sure you also have a tire iron so that you can change your tire if necessary.Keep it stowed in the trunk in case you'll need it if you get a flat miles from a service station.

, Be sure you can change a tire if you need to. Also know how to check the oil and fluid levels. If you’re travelling through extreme weather or deserted stretches of road (or both), it’s good to check fluid levels before you set out.For oil, lift the hood and pull out the dipstick and wipe with a rag (if you’re not sure where this is, check your owner’s manual). The stick shows the level of oil currently in your vehicle. If you’re lower than the area indicated with crosshatches, add a quart of oil.
For radiator fluid, check the transparent tank under the hood. If your fluid does not fall between the two lines indicated, add more radiator fluid.

, Sometimes you end up eating or wanting to stay a place that is cash-only, and you need to be prepared. If you're planning to be in a fairly remote area, chances are that there will be few ATMs, making cash even more necessary. Credit cards might be vital if you end up getting an unplanned car repair -- you need to be ready if you have to make any emergency purchases.

, The American Automobile Association (AAA) is the most famous and widespread of these, but there are many other local and regional groups that are worth checking out. For a road trip, you would want a service that would include long-distance towing to a garage in case you break down far from service. These help services also are good resources for maps, trip planning, and even discounts on lodging."

, It sounds obvious but sometimes it is not always possible when traveling. Find substitutes if you can't use these; a book, a bag, a plastic container, a read newspaper, can all be spread across your lap to catch any spills.

, Many spills happen because we are not being attentive.

, Moving vehicles inevitably go over bumps and that is when you can spill food and drink. Alternately, eat something that isn't messy, like chips, or cookies.

, If you're creating a meal of your supermarket food, try to find a place to eat at rather than eating over your lap. That way, there will be less likelihood of spills.

, Anything that is sloppy, saucy, runny, oily, etc. has the potential to spill and leave bad stains. Try to avoid eating these sorts of foods unless you are seated at a table and there is no motion involved.

, Keep this just for eating over; all spills can land on it, you can wash it out at a faucet, and wring it dry in minutes. You can even wear it over your chest if needed!

, Clothing that cleans easily is best for travel. Ask your local travel wear store for advice.

Turn errands into games you can play with your children.,
Use drive-through services when available.,
Reward your children when the errands have been completed.",How to Run Errands With Children," If you have infants or toddlers, you will most likely need to bring a diaper bag that contains certain needs.


Pack a bag with diapers, baby wipes, changing mat or blanket, juice boxes or sippy cups, snacks, and other items as needed for your infants or toddlers.
Bring games or toys to keep your toddlers and older children occupied during your errands.;
, This will help you with mapping out a driving route and may result in a shorter outing.


Schedule appointments at places near other errands on your list. For example, if your errands include getting a haircut and an oil change, visit a shopping center that contains both a hair salon and oil change service station. You may be able to get your hair cut at the same time the oil is being changed on your automobile.
Order the errands on your itinerary according to driving routes. This will reduce the time you spend driving between each location to complete errands. For example, if your home is located in a centralized part of your city and you must drive several miles both north and south to complete your errands. Complete all your errands north first, before traveling south to complete the remainder of your errands.

, This will help keep your children positive about the experience, which may influence them to behave nicely and follow your directions.


Say positive phrases such as ""Hooray!"" or ""I'm excited to run errands!"" when you explain to your children that you need to run errands.
Explain to your children how they can help you with the errands. For example, if you need to deposit money into an ATM, tell your children that you will allow them to place the envelope into the ATM slot.

, This will keep your children occupied and excited about the errands that need to be completed. For example, if you are waiting in the lobby of a dentist's office or at a pharmacy, ask your children to point out as many items they can see that are blue.


If you are shopping at retail stores, give certain non-breakable items to your children to hold onto, which will make them feel as if they are contributing to the errand and helping you out.

, This will prevent you from having to remove your children from their car seats or go inside the store to perform errands that can be done from your car. For example, pick up your prescriptions from drive-through pharmacies or use the drive-through ATM at your bank.

, This will reinforce positive behavior and may excite your children for the next time you need to run errands.


Buy your children an inexpensive toy or take them out for dessert after you have finished running errands to show your appreciation for their behavior and cooperation.

Look for live bed bugs or for their skin sheddings. Also, check for brown or red stains that could be blood or fecal matter left by bed bugs after feeding.
When flying or traveling by rental car, taxi, bus or train, examine your seat. If you find evidence of bed bugs, ask to move to another seat if you are on an airplane, bus or train. Ask for another car if you are renting a vehicle.
In your hotel room, place your luggage on a luggage rack that you inspect for bed bugs first. If a luggage rack is not available, store your luggage on a hard, light colored surface such as the bathroom floor or in the bathtub so you can see bed bugs if they appear.
Bed bugs do not come out in daylight, so keep the room dark and use a flashlight to check the bed. Pull back the bed sheets and examine the seams of the mattresses and pillows. Look for shedded skins, droppings, blood stains and live bugs on sheets, comforters, pillow cases, etc.
Lift the mattress to check the box spring.
Lift the box spring and check underneath it.
Check the top of the frame and underneath.
Search behind the headboard. Look for any cracks where bed bugs may hide.
You should also check the curtains, any other upholstered furniture in the room such as a couch or chair, as well cracks in the walls, and pictures frames.
If you discover bed bugs, ask for another room. If another room cannot be provided, relocate to a hotel that you researched during your trip planning.
Before checking out of your hotel, check the room once again for signs of bed bugs. Check all of your luggage and clothes for bed bugs.

,


Unpack your luggage outside of the house or load your clothes directly into the washing machine.
Wash all of the clothes from your luggage immediately, including those you did not wear.
Vacuum out all luggage and bags, including the seams, crevices and compartments.
Seal luggage in bags and store them in an outside storage or garage or in a closet separate from your clothes inside your residence.
Best way to avoid bugs getting in your home is by keeping your luggage along with items in hot sun outdoor. Ensure that all cloth bags and liner is well exposed to heat and sunlight.
Never forget to write review on hotels in case you have noticed bugs.
Always look for bite marks on your body that might give you clue on this matter, although it can be from mosquito bite if you are visiting tropical regions.
always carry creams and medicine in case you get bitten by bedbug.

Resume anything that you turned off when you left.,

Water your plants and garden, indoors and out.
",How to Resume Your Normal Routine when Returning from a Trip," If at all possible, give yourself a day or two at home to catch up before returning to work or school. If it's not possible, even an evening or afternoon of good rest will help.
, If your travel took you out of your timezone, especially by a difference of more than a few hours, start changing your schedule gradually even before you leave. You can use a similar approach to lessen the shock of the first early morning if you prefer to sleep later on your days off., Don't neglect to sleep just because you were traveling. Sleep on the airplane, bus, or train if you can. If you drive to and from your destination, trade off with another driver, and schedule adequate rest stops.,

Don't unpack your toiletries kit. Instead, refresh anything you consume (toothpaste, razor blades, shampoo), and put the whole toiletries kit away for easier packing next time.
Stop at a laundromat. If your trip left you with an entire family's worth of dirty laundry to do all at once, consider using a laundromat and doing many loads at the same time. You can also use a laundromat to wash larger items (such as sleeping bags) and you can even stop on the way home to avoid bringing very dirty items back into your home at all.

, Toss transit schedules, receipts, boarding passes, and any other items you will no longer need now that you're home.

If you need to submit receipts for reimbursement, if you need proof of your trip for citizenship, visa or immigration purposes, or if you can deduct your trip expenses from your taxes, collect and scan the relevant documents. Don't wait too long to submit expense reports.

,, Did you leave behind a pocket knife, or local membership cards? Take a moment now to replace these items., If you have travel-specific items, such as a backpacking towel, clean those too, and store them in or near the suitcase, so they'll be at hand next time., Your sleep schedule may have shifted from its usual (whether from jet lag or sleeping late) and you have probably had things stack up while you were away. Don't try to take on a huge backlog on a day when you are tired and have no momentum. Instead, do basic tasks according to what you feel you can usefully accomplish and work up to your usual pace on subsequent days.

If you have the option, come back to a shorter than usual week, starting on Tuesday or Wednesday.

, You need not unpack and catch up on all your missed correspondence on your first day back. Instead, tackle anything that can't wait (such as unpacking wet clothes and paying bills that arrived in your absence) and work through the remainder gradually, as your time and energy permit., If you plan ahead a bit, you can leave yourself at least a few key items in the pantry or freezer, at least enough to get yourself through a meal or two before you have to go out shopping., If you asked to have your newspaper or mail held, you may need to contact the relevant organizations to restart them.

Notify family, neighbors, and anyone who helped take care of your home or work while you were away that you are home safely.
If you had pets in the kennel or staying with others, welcome them home.
Recharge your mobile device(s) and reset any settings you changed for traveling.

Choose a destination.,
Collect your friends.,
Meet up.,
Work on the details.,
Book transport.,
Choose things you want to see and do there.,
Pack as a group.",How to Plan a Trip With Friends," The first step is to work out where you want to go. Going abroad will cost more but be a more exciting experience. Don't go abroad if this is the very first trip you have helped to organise. Going to a different place in your own country can also be fun and will be cheaper.;
, Work out how many people you will be able to plan the trip for. If you want to travel abroad it's probably best to plan it for a smaller group of people; otherwise aim for at most about 15 people to avoid too much stress and keep lodging arrangements easy. Find out how much interest there is from people to go on the trip and then work out your maximum and invite people who you think will enjoy themselves and who you get on well with.

, Everyone will have their own idea of what they want the trip to be like so meet up, maybe at a local cafe or restaurant, and share your ideas and concerns. The organisation should be shared to a certain extent - rather than just one person organising everything. If it's a big group maybe just have a small number of people (4 or 5) doing the majority of the organisation and just have them to this get-together. One person will naturally be the leader (probably the person who's idea this was). Don't try to overpower them; if they are natural leaders, then they are best for the job. Keep a notebook to jot down ideas as they are mentioned. Write down things to do, how money should be spent, accommodation, and budget. Once you've all shared ideas you'll have a much better idea of how to start organising the trip.

, Start with the two most important things: accommodation and travel. Once you have those two things sorted the rest should start to form around it.


Look for accommodation near to the place you want to visit. If it is a low budget trip camping or youth hostels are probably the best idea. When you are searching for a place to stay, read reviews and ratings.
Check that the location works with your transportation. If you want to go camping in South England and you will be traveling by train and will then have to travel everywhere by foot, then don't stay in the middle of the countryside If you have a car, you can stay much further from the town centre. Once you have found an ideal place, make sure everyone is happy to stay there and that they haven't found a better place and BOOK YOUR STAY! Book it as soon as possible because leaving it too late is going to make things harder because you'll have to find another place to stay.
Avoid the awkwardness of payments between friends and family by using technology. There's a variety of new tools on the market to help you and your friends split payments for both the vacation rental and other events. You can use PayByGroup which is designed for vacation rentals or use alternatives like PayPal to make the process easier.

, Once you have accommodation, you'll know the dates of your stay and will be able to book transport, e.g. coach, bus, train, airplane, etc. Booking transport well in advanced lowers the cost dramatically so it's really worth booking as soon as you find something ideal. Remember to coordinate with your companions.

, When you are on your trip it will be more relaxed if you have a good idea of what kind of things you want to do. Research the area on the internet and talk to your friends about which activities to book. Don't book these things before the accommodation and travel. Match the activities to your budget. People won't be so happy if you book a load of things which they can't afford.


Don't expect everyone to want to do the same things. For example - You could let a few of the group go off and try surfing while you go shopping then you could meet on the beach at an arranged time.
Get a few ideas of what's in the area before sharing the idea of the holiday in the first place.

, Work out the supplies your whole group will need. Chances are that you'll already have most things if you ask everyone who's going. That is, if you need several 4-person tents, ask all 15 people on the trip if they have any and you may get them all without any money spent.

,


Addresses can be obtained through Internet searches, phone book ads or by calling the place you are planning to visit.
Similar searches can be performed for specific hotels, restaurants and so on. Make sure that the address is spelled correctly to ensure that the car navigation system can find the destination.

,


Before leaving your driveway, type in the address of your final destination. Make sure the volume is at a level easily heard by drivers and passengers before starting on the vacation.

,


Although the navigation system will provide audio directions, having prior knowledge as to where you are going is also helpful. Read upcoming directions as provided by the navigation system when stopping for gasoline, bathroom breaks or other detours.

,


In some cases it is not necessary to have the address of the place you are visiting.
For example, if you are not traveling to a specific place, and instead are simply trying to find the closest gasoline station, you search through ""landmarks"" on the car navigation system and then enter ""gas stations.""
Similarly, if you are trying to get to Disney World, simply choose ""landmarks"" and then enter ""Disney World"" into the navigation system. As there is only one Disney World per continent, your car navigation system should have no difficulty finding this destination.

, If everyone is contributing equally, then everyone should have a say in the decisions. If one person is treating the other person or people to the trip, it makes sense, though, that that person would have a greater weight in the decision making process.

, Make sure that you can agree on a destination. If not, start making a pros and cons list for potential areas and come to a decision based on mutual agreement after discussion.

, One person may want to relax and catch up on sleep while lounging at the pool or on the beach. Another person may want to enjoy the nightlife of the area and party every evening. And yet another person may have interest in catching all of the sights or pursuing adventure activities like biking, parasailing or rock climbing.


Calculate how many usable days you have on the trip, and then think realistically how many hours per day you plan to be awake and up for activities. Plan your trip itinerary based on the timing available in the duration of the trip.
Write a list of activities that the both of you or the group of you want to see or do while on the trip. Follow-up by ranking the items on the list on a 1 to 3 scale, with 1 being items that you are giving the highest ranking and most importance to.

, If both of you are agreeable to certain activities then pencil those in and work the rest of the trip's timing around them.


Determine if all of the activities you have planned have to be done together. Think about timing that would allow one person to enjoy one activity while the other person goes off for a few hours to do his activity separately. For example, the wife might lounge at the pool while the husband does a guided fishing trip. Agreeing to spend a few hours apart to get in what you really want to do on a trip is one form of compromise that works better than forcing someone to do something on a trip that he does not want to do.

, Figure out if you can work the items into your schedule by compromising on time. You get ""X"" number of hours at the museum together (or whatever activity it is that you want to do) if you agree to spend that same amount of time doing what the other person would ideally like to do. The compromise here being that you both get to do what you want, and you make plans to do it together.

Calculate your budget.,
Decide where you want to go.,
Decide how long your trip will be and when you want to go.",How to Plan a Vacation by Train1," The ages of the people traveling with you will determine the type of train vacation and the budget level.


For example, if you are traveling with seniors, you may want to ensure that they have couchettes for easy sleeping and relaxing. These are more expensive than first or second class train seats. If you have small children, you may want to minimize the number of train legs you book, to lessen their discomfort about unfamiliar territory.;
, In many ways, your budget will determine your destination. Decide what you are willing to spend per person, and then research possible destinations that fall into that budget.


One way to determine the overall cost of a train trip and to see if it falls into your budget, is to research tours with all the amenities already accounted. These trips may be more expensive than the cost of booking travel for a few people with train specials; however, you will get an idea about the budget range of Europe, Japan, the United States and other countries. Try vacationsbyrail.com and amtrakvacations.com/to look at pre-made train tours.

, After you have researched prospective areas, choose the countries you want to visit. The number of countries you visit will determine the cost and the type of rail pass you will need.

, The longer you travel, the more expensive the trip will be. Traveling during peak times, like the summer or the early winter in hot areas may mean more expensive ticket prices.


If you plan to do a lot of train travel in a short amount of time, you may want to book a shorter vacation. Constant train travel can be exhausting. If you plan to take a train to an area and stay there for a while, you may be able to book a longer overall trip.

If you are planning on visiting 1 to 3 towns, buying separate tickets may be more cost effective than buying a railway pass.
Book a train pass with 1 provider, if you plan on staying in 1 country. Look at Amtrak, BritRail, BahnCard and other individual country passes.

You can opt to pay a bit more for a single room, if you are not interested in sharing your sleeping space with strangers.
B&B’s are a great place to meet locals who can give you amazing dining and travel tips. The owners are usually very eager to share information about the local culture and B&Bs often feel more homey than a large hotel.

, Don’t be afraid to meet people and talk to strangers. While you are traveling on your own, you will find that it is actually quite easy to meet people. Strike up a conversation with anyone who looks friendly. One way to meet people is by offering to take someone's picture. Then you can begin a conversation from there.Alternatively, you could head to a local bar and strike up a conversation with the bartender or other patrons. You could say something like “I hear California Sushi has the best sushi in town. Is that true?” Locals will be eager to give you their opinion.Another way to meet people when you are traveling in a large city, is to ask people where they are from. Most people, even those living in the city, have likely migrated there for work. This can often lead to fun and interesting conversations.

, There are a growing number of social media-based apps that can connect travelers. These can be a great way to easily meet like-minded individuals while traveling. Try out some of these sites:


Meetup is a site where you can meet up with a group of people for a variety of different events including photography walks, happy hour, picnics etc.
Leaplocal will connect you with local guides who can show you around.
Couchsurfing is a way to find accommodations by staying with a local. This is a great way to meet new people.

, You can also fight the feelings of isolation by keeping in touch with your family and friends back home. For example, schedule a Skype call periodically throughout your trip. You can also post pictures from your trip onto social media sites, such as Facebook or Instagram. This will allow your friends and family to comment and engage with you, while you are traveling.Keeping in touch is also a good safety precaution. This allows your friends and family to know where you are throughout your trip.

Sit at the bar.,
Have things to do while you eat.,
Eat with locals.",How to Plan Activities for Solo Travel3," Dining alone can feel uncomfortable, but it doesn’t have to. Try sitting at a lunch counter or bar. This way you will be seated next to strangers and you can easily try and strike up a conversation. You can also talk with the bartender or other servers as they are working. This is a great way to meet people and sit in a restaurant without feeling lonely., Another thing you can do while dining alone is bring something to occupy your mind. For example, if you are out for lunch or breakfast you could try reading a newspaper or doing a crossword while you eat.Alternatively, you could bring a notebook to dinner with you. Write down notes about your day or some of the food you are eating.
You could also try reading a novel while you wait for your meal to arrive.

, If you go to a restaurant during a busy time as a solo traveler, you may get seated with other singles or at a larger group table. This is a great way to meet local people and engage in conversation while dining. You could also try frequenting the same restaurant. This way the staff will get to know you and you will become comfortable chatting with them."

Trust your instincts.,
Be aware of your surroundings.,
Keep money and important documentation safe.",How to Plan Activities for Solo Travel4," The best way to stay safe while traveling alone is by trusting your instincts. If you find yourself in a situation and you feel uncomfortable, you should try to remove yourself immediately from that environment. For example, maybe you find the hostel owner overly pushy or intrusive. Trust your instincts and find other accommodations. Although you may have to spend a bit more money, it is better to be safe., When traveling by yourself, you do not have a friend to look out for you. As a result, you will need to pay particular attention to your surroundings at all times. Keep your belongings close to you while traveling and never leave them unattended. Avoid looking at your phone while traveling through public spaces. Instead, you should look up periodically to assess your surroundings.

, Do not carry all of your money around with you. Instead, you should separate your cash into different bags. That way if something gets stolen, you will not lose all of your money at once. You should also always carry your passport with you, or place it in a locked safe.


Take photocopies of your passport and any other important travel documents. That way you will have a backup copy available if anything should happen.

, It is suggested you bring along your own containers. Bottles with wide openings, your lunch box, or some old empty tubs of cream cheese and such are good. If you don't, however, have any such on hand, then try looking for them. Empty bottles of mineral water are great to use., Fill them to their full capacity so that the shells don't have space to bang around and break. If that doesn't work for you, then stuff in some cotton, socks, a handkerchief, or basically just anything that fills space and is soft., You can roll them in socks, or fold them in shirts other items. Thicker things like sweatshirts are great.

Put them in the pockets or roll them into socks to make sure they don't fall out when you unpack.
The more fragile or breakable shells should always be wrapped in clothes.

, Be sure to place them in the middle of the suitcase, not the top, bottom or edges. Chances are your suitcase will be stacked one upon the other and that's not good for your shells., Happy holiday!"

One of the most popular rainforest destinations is Costa Rica and Brazil because of its variety of tours and hotels, but there are numerous other countries with rainforest in Central America, South America, Africa, Oceania, and Southeast Asia.;
, Hotels, rental cars, and flights are all available at major ‘travel’ sites, like Expedia or Travelocity. If you search for hotels in your destination country you should be able to find some pretty exotic ones.

, Think about the different types of tours, going to the beach, visiting museums, and sightseeing in towns.

For phrase books check out Berlitz. Also, for overachievers try CDs to immerse yourself in the language.

, Traveler’s checks are no longer widely accepted. Try to get cash but also get a debit card to use at ATMs to get cash there and to use in stores where they are accepted. Don’t wait until the airport to exchange currency because exchange rates tend to be higher.

, Plan for hot, humid weather, and of course, rain. Also, make sure to take into account bugs. Mosquito netting is definitely a must. Check off your list as you go, making sure you don’t miss anything. Make another copy of the list to check off when you come backs so you don’t leave anything.

, Better safe than sorry.

, This means that the embassy or consulate will know where you are and can assist you in the event of an emergency. Also think about travel registration, which will allow the State Department or other relevant agency to help you if an emergency arises., International airports are larger and harder to navigate then local ones., In the rainforest, do not dispose of your garbage in bushes, rivers or anywhere else in the forest.

, Many organizations will waive processing fees for their members. You may also order traveler's checks online or by telephone from large financiers such as American Express or MasterCard.

, Keep in mind that small- denomination checks will grant you more control as to where and how you exchange them for currency in your destination country. Processing fees are charged per every $100 obtained in the U.S.

,, You will need to remit payment in full for your traveler's checks at the time of purchase.

, You will want to store the checks and their receipts in separate locations when traveling. If the checks are lost or stolen, you will need to provide evidence of payment for them (in the form of serial-numbered receipts) in order to be reimbursed.

Know what you're looking for.,
Pick your target group.,
Flirt with several guys.,
Apply the usual pickup rules.,
Suggest fun activities you and your target guy can do together.,
Make it crystal clear that you're interested in him.,
Once you've bagged your man, be clear about your post-vacation expectations.",How to Meet Men on Vacation," Do you want a one-night stand? A casual encounter? Or a long-term romance? If you're looking for something long-term, a vacation probably isn't your best bet, since most of the guys you meet will probably be returning to different parts of the country or the world after you part ways.;
, Depending on your chosen getaway location, there can be numerous groups from which to select the man you want to snag. You might find a possible match in your tour group, lounging on the beach, sipping a pina colada by the pool, or even (if you're feeling confident) among the locals. Try choosing a group with which you're most likely to identify: for instance, if you enjoy modern art, take a tour of the local museum and use your common interest to strike up a conversation with one of your fellow tourists.

, Now isn't the time to home in on one guy, at least not at first. Because you have a limited time frame, and because there are so many possible complications to striking up a quick relationship while on vacation, homing in on one guy too soon will significantly lower your chances of finding someone available and interested.

, Dress well, attend to your personal hygiene (yes, hotel showers are gross, but so are you when you haven't washed in days), be friendly, and flirt. Remember that both you and your target guy are in a new setting, so your confidence levels are likely to be lower than usual. If you can still manage to appear confident (your physical appearance is a HUGE factor in projecting a confident image), you're likely to impress your target guy with your woman-of-the-world status.

, A vacation is the perfect setting for having fun adventures with a perfect stranger. Since your target guy, like you, is there to have fun, he's unlikely to say no when you suggest trying a new restaurant, taking a guided tour, or heading to the beach together. If he's interested in you, he may even let you compare schedules with him and find activities you can participate in together.

, Now isn't the time to be coy or standoffish. You're in an extremely limited time frame, so make the best use of every second. Tell him you're interested in him to his face if you have to, or just get him alone and (if you sense he is interested too) initiate a quick kiss. Alcohol is the great catalyst of sudden romances, and tourist locations (luckily) seem to serve more of the good stuff than they do water. Don't be afraid to drink with your target guy, but of course don't take it too far. A good rule of thumb: when you can no longer walk a line in heels (assuming you can walk a line in heels while sober), put the bottle down.

, Are you hoping to keep in touch? Or perhaps visit each other occasionally? Or is the physical distance separating you simply too great a challenge? Open communication, as always, is an asset.

Provide a final copy proof.",How to Make a Travel Brochure," If you are a professional working for a travel company, your destination of choice will be the one you work for. If you are a student, and are creating a pretend travel brochure, you will want to pick out a desirable, exotic, and interesting location.


A professional should already know what destination he/she is representing, or attempting to advertise for. Use this step to get to know the key features of your location: mountains, lakes, cabins, museums, parks, etc. Write each of these key features down on a piece of paper for use later on.
If you are a student, find some place exciting to advertise for. Some great examples are Mexico, Hawaii, Myrtle Beach South Carolina, the beaches of Florida, or Australia to name a few. Research the location you choose (using online search engines, encyclopedias, library books, etc.) and find out key features about the location. Write each of these down on a piece of paper for use later on.
The lists for both students and professionals should be extra long at the beginning. It is better to create a long list to start, and then cross off items later on.;
, These include, but are not limited to, restaurants, shops, bathrooms, movie theaters, etc. It is important that your potential client knows what the amenities are, and where they are located at your destination.


Travel around the site by yourself and write down what and where the particular amenity is.
If you are far away from where you are advertising for, look for maps online that might help you locate particular amenities. Sites like Google Maps point out exactly what and where each of these is.
After you have created a detailed list of the amenities, put a star next to the items you think are most important (bathrooms generally are a top priority). Make sure to note whether these amenities provide accommodations such as whether they are handicap accessible., If you live with, or near, persons whom live there, talk to them. Get their opinions/first hand accounts of what the destination is like.


Visit peoples' homes and ask them to give their opinion. Remember to bring a pencil and paper to write down exactly what they say. You can also bring a voice recorder if you do not write very fast.
If the destination is strictly for vacation (non-residential) try calling people whom have vacationed there in the past. As with the previous step, write down exactly what they have to say about their experience.
Students who do not have direct contact with persons whom live, or have vacationed there, should look online. Find internet sites that link you with local hotels, restaurants, etc. in the area of your destination. Look for reviews that have to do with the destination(Mexico, Hawaii, etc.) rather than a particular place of accommodation. Write down what they have to say., For every destination, you will need to figure out what demographic group will be most interested. This will not only help you highlight particular accommodations, but also create a brochure that is visually stimulating to your targeted demographic group.


Use your list of key features and amenities to pick a target audience. Here are some key examples which will help:

Vacation spots with lots of bathrooms, and restaurants available are great for an older demographic audience.
Destinations which are primarily vacation spots (non-residential) usually target a younger audience, or newlywed couples on their honeymoon.
Vacation spots which have hotels furnished with wifi and cable are great to bring your kids too.
Destinations which have large rooms are great for business types, looking to conduct work from far away.


This is not an all encompassing list, but it will give you an idea about what to look for, and how to pick the right demographic audience. Something you might think is minor (boardwalk for example) might make all the difference in the world for a particular clientele.

, This is the most important step of all. You need to make a reasonable profit, but you also do not want to scare away potential visitors. If you are a professional, the price of the trip will probably already be determined.


Take into account the previous four steps, and in particular the target demographic group. Set a standard price to each of the amenities, and add them all up. Set a standard price for all of the key features of the destination and add them all up. Finally, add the price of the amenities and destination hot-spots together.
Adjust the vacation cost according to who the audience is. Younger clientele, and families will most likely be looking for a cheaper vacation. Older clientele, and business types will have more money to spend. Generally speaking, vacations for a family of four should run between $1000 and $2000. Go higher or lower as you see fit.]

, Before you begin to publish a final copy, you will want to practice writing exactly what you want to say in the brochure. This is a great time to check spelling, grammar, and punctuation.


First you want to create a story. Just like a good novel pulls in a reader, the client wants to feel as if he or she is going on an adventure. In paragraph form (full sentences) write a convincing argument for why the vacation spot is the best place to visit.
After you have written down your argument, go back and check for edits. More importantly, cross out extraneous information, keep what is critical, and add in to places that need a more exciting, or convincing argument.
This argument can then be split apart into different sections of your brochure. You might have to tailor the sentences to exist as a stand-alone argument in the different sections, but this will give you a good head start. It is important that the writer knows exactly why each of the individual pieces are critical, and how they come together to convince the clientele.

, The brochure should be legible, and easy to follow. There should be an overall flow to the brochure, and not feel discombobulated.Your heading/title should appear in bold lettering, underlined, and be large enough to read from far away. If someone is sitting in a doctors office, or at a coffee shop, they should be able to see the title clearly, at the top of the brochure.
Each of the subheadings/section headings should also be in bold, and underlined. They should be a slightly smaller font size than the title. They should all also all be the same font. If one subtitle is in Times New Roman, keep them all Times New Roman. This creates a nice flow to your brochure, and does not bog down the viewer in trying to comprehend the brochure.

, Simple tag lines like ""Mexican Vacation"" or ""Hawaiian Vacation"" are going to bore the potential vacationers and not draw them in to read the rest of the brochure. You need to use descriptive adjectives, possibly even verbs, to entice the viewer.Write down some adjectives you know that are not typically used, such as adventurous, pulsating, mind-boggling, fanciful, breathtaking, etc. Put these words first in your title, so that the readers eyes, reading left to right, will catch that key word.
Then make sure to include the location in the title. If you advertising for a Hawaiian vacation, do not leave out the word Hawaii. Put the location right after the adjective.
Following the name of the place, you can finish the title with simply ""vacation"" or a synonym. End the title in an exclamation point, so that it appears that the person selling the vacation is just as excited as the potential clientele.
Bold the lettering, and underline the title. Example: Adventurous Mount Everest Vacation!


, This sentence should appear on the first flap the reader opens up to. Think of this sentence as a thesis statement of a paper.


You want to make clear the argument for this vacation right up front. The reader is not going to look around the rest of the brochure, if he or she is not convinced at the very beginning.
This would be a great time to simply list off a few of the accommodations/hot spots. For example: An all-encompassing Hawaiian vacation that includes beautiful scenery, top-of-the-line hotels, and all the food you can eat!

, Your brochure is going to be about half visuals, and half written words. So for each section of the brochure, you will only use a few sentences (3-4) to explain each distinct aspect of the vacation.


You will want to include, at the bare minimum, the following sections: restaurants, hotels, scenery(appearance of the vacation spot), and shops. These are four of the most basic things people need to know about before they go on the vacation. In total, you should have around six to eight sections.
Make sure that what you are saying is necessary, succinct, and convincing. Consider what image you are using and make sure that the words match up. Feel free to highlight, italicize, or bold certain words or phrases.
This would also be a great time to add in those accommodations, such as handicap accessible, free continental breakfast, bike/walking trails, etc.

, Earlier you gathered and wrote down the personal experiences of people whom have previously been on vacation there. This is a great time to not only include a summary of what they said, but include block quotes.


To include block quotes in your brochure, start by indenting. Then add a quotation mark, and write in your quote. Finish by adding another quotation mark.
You will want to include only the most sensitive, valuable information. Do not include bad experiences, as this might turn off the clientele.
If you want to take out a sentence in the middle of a paragraph, simply highlight and delete. Then, in between the remaining sentences, add ... (three periods in a row). This will allow you to shorten the quote, keep what is necessary, and highlight what is most important., This is not an all encompassing section. There is no need to create a chart, showing them all the options. However, you should give them a ballpark figure as to how much the vacation should cost.Include, in your 3-4 sentence price section, some simple terms, such as: Prices as low as $1000 for a family of four! or, Prices start at $1500, and include great discounts if you purchase by phone!
Mention the different offers/deals vacationers can get through your particular company. Usually there are family discounts, senior discounts, children discounts, etc.
This section should appear on the inside of the pamphlet, to the far right (at the end). You do not want to start the brochure by introducing price. Nor do you want to put the price on the back of the brochure, as the clientele will probably look there first and never look inside.

, This is critical because the brochure will not be enough. After the price section, or on the back of the brochure, include a section that links email addresses, web page addresses, phone numbers, and a mailing address.


This should be done as a series of bulleted points, or dashes. Do not write this information in paragraph form, as it will all run together.
Check a second and third time that the information is up to date and correct. Look at the bottom of webpages to see when the last time the page was updated. Call the numbers you are listing on the brochure and see who picks up the phone. The information you are presenting needs to be accurate., These photos will help you tell the story you want to tell. The clientele should be excited and intrigued by what they see in the brochure.


Examples: A smiling visitor hugging a dolphin at a sea life attraction, or a woman relaxing with a massage in an open-air spa that overlooks the tropical sunset.
Make sure the photos are in color, and have a high-quality resolution. Do not use stock photos which generally look fake, and off-putting. Use real life images, or photos you have taken yourself at the location.
People enjoy seeing others having fun, so try to include photos of people enjoying themselves at your destination rather than showing an empty hotel room or deserted beach. This will invite readers to project themselves into the photo., Each vacation will have a different feel/tone. You will want to convey whether your destination is relaxing, exciting, or somewhere in between.


To convey a relaxed feeling appropriate for a spa, use muted pastel tones. Children's destinations are best marketed with bright, bold colors. Historical site brochures can be given an ""antique"" feeling with sepia and earth tones.
For each panel of the brochure, use the same color. If there are different colors for each panel, it can become distracting and gaudy.

, While you never want to distract the viewer too much, these three things can help in the aid of the story you are trying to tell.


Use a thin border to contain each of the panels in your brochure. A thick border can become distracting. The border should be a color that is a slightly darker/lighter shade of the tone that you use for the rest of the brochure.
If you want to highlight key points of your story, use bullet points or asterisks. Generally, 3-4 is the range you want to stay in. Try to highlight things that are not written about in the sentences.
Designs can also help, such as stars, rainbows, arrows, etc. Add these where and when you see fit. Once more, do not overuse these, and bog down the viewer in the visuals. The clientele should want to read more, not necessarily look more.

, The 3-4 sentence sections should match what the visuals are saying. Example: If you are talking about restaurants in your section, use a picture of a restaurant.

, If you are a student, a standard folded piece of paper will work just fine. However, professionals should look at printing brochures at facilities that specialize in printing.


Tell the printing company that you want the brochures printed on high-quality paper. Cheap, flimsy paper can easily be torn, ripped, or water-damaged. Thick, coated paper provides resistance to accidents, and can be carried around mush easier.If you wind up using your home or business printer, just make sure to use thick, heavy paper. The settings of your printer should be set to the highest pixel quality so that your pictures come out clean and crisp.

, Make sure the printing company has not dramatically changed/altered the layout or design of the brochure. For both professionals and students, this is a great time to go back and spell/grammar check one more time.

, Most cities have classes for all kinds of subjects. These classes can give you the chance to interact both with your fellow students and your teacher. Depending on the subject you choose, your class might be a nice blend of travelers and locals.Some of these classes may be one-time events, such as a cooking class to make a particular dish. Others may require longer-term commitment, and they may only be options for travelers staying for several weeks or months in one city.
Try a language class if you want to improve your ability to navigate around the city. This might mean that you’ll meet more fellow travelers or folks living abroad rather than locals.

Be confident.,
Learn a few phrases in the native language.,

Remember that most people are perfectly happy to have conversations with travelers.

Probably not!

, Put a smile on your face and get excited about this opportunity to broaden your horizons. If you look like you’re enthusiastic about meeting new people, strangers will respond to your openness and excitement.

It consumes a lot of time..'Nirshinghadev' is worshipped here. If you stay in RK beach, you have come back, and then go to Rushikonda beach, and you can stay there for few hours. Don't think of taking bath in sea, as it is very dangerous. You can enjoy water sports there, it takes Rs. 250 per 3 persons. Take your lunch, then go to Kailasagiri (you can take share Auto to reach kailashgiri).

Reach the station before 6 p.m (train will be given at around 6 p.m, and it will start at around 7 a.m).

Remember.",How to Have the Best Vacation of Your Life," Do you want to explore? Relax? See a completely different place? There are many different places that you can go to. Some people don't feel comfortable when traveling to places that are too far and different. On the other hand, going somewhere that's too close might make you feel like you're taking a stroll in the neighbourhood.;
, Once you choose your vacation spot, you can start with your planning. Don't book a hotel room or a flight too early, because there might be some last minute deals. Use the internet or get some travel brochures to see what the local attractions are, as well. Some places could be dangerous and unwelcoming; make sure to read reviews of places you want to go to and stay in. If you have the choice to choose who you want to go with, think carefully. It has to be someone you like and don't have many fights with. The person you travel with greatly affects your travelling experience. Try to think of things that might ruin the experience (i.e. addictions, different travelling style, etc.)

, This is important, because sometimes those two can ruin an entire vacation. If you've had a bad experience with a certain airline, don't make the same mistake again. As for the flight, don't let any of it get to you. If it's a really bad experience, you can just say that it's technically not a part of the vacation. Find a good hotel that isn't too expensive and is located near many attractions. The hotel might have some flaws, but if it isn't something unbearable, then let it slide.

, There are things that have to be taken care of - just like every other vacation. Don't get it wrong this time; finish things early. If you know that you're always late to the airport, then try to leave the house an hour or two earlier. Also, make sure you have your passport and visa with you if you're going to a different country. Don't leave things for the last minute and pack your suitcase early.

, Learn about the place, as there might be some important things that you don't know about. Use Wikipedia and search engines to learn about the local customs. Read about appropriate clothing, tipping, laws, weather, and more. Check the forecast to see what the weather will be like and if the area you will be in might have natural disasters or conflicts that might arise soon. If the place you're going to isn't anything like where you live, make sure to see pictures and videos of the place to avoid culture shock.

, You don't need to bring your entire house with you. Pack things that you know you'll need. If you know you can't live without your mp3 player, than don't hesitate to take it. Packing isn't just about personal toiletries and clothes; it's important to bring things that you'll enjoy as well. Put the items that you use often in your backpack so you'll have easier access to them. Remember to bring extra batteries and all the equipment necessary to make them work throughout the vacation. If you're going on a plane, make sure that you don't put any sharp or dangerous items in your bag (i.e. scissors, swiss knife, toy gun, etc). Don't bring a really expensive or unique-looking suitcase, they have a higher chance of getting stolen or opened. Don't pack the things that you might wear. Bring the sort of clothes that you wear now, otherwise, you'll be stuck with a whole lot of clothes that you won't be able/want to wear.

, These days, there are many things that we need to carry around. It could be cellphones, laptops, digital cameras, and much more. Never let those expensive belongings be out of your sight. Keep them locked in a safe or hidden in a good place. When you're on the street, tie your camera on your wrist so it won't get stolen or keep it in your backpack. Don't leave your luggage and/or backpack unattended, even if you're going for a second. If you're travelling with someone else (who you trust), tell them to watch it while you're gone.

, As much as want to have the perfect vacation, we know that the world usually won't cooperate with us. Don't let the small things irk you and ruin your mood, just accept that they happen and move on. Try to see yourself as you are now; don't try to change and become perfect. You need to accept yourself right now instead of imagining yourself as someone you currently aren't and/or will never be. You won't be automatically happy/attractive/perfect the second your vacation starts. If you know that you're not the sort of person that can get up early and walk all day long, then don't expect yourself to be.

, It's important to plan, but it's just as important to try something new and unexpected. It could be something as big as deciding to bungee jump or something small like trying out some of the exotic cuisine. Either way, you'll have something interesting to do and tell your friends once you do it. Don't be afraid that you might ruin something or be off-schedule. Give yourself some time to do whatever you want and have fun doing it. Don't be afraid to do something you liked doing back at home, either. It will make you feel more comfortable and give you a sense of familiarity. If you find yourself disliking a place you go to, don't hesitate to leave. Try to go to all sorts of different places, not just tourist traps.

, Sometimes we don't realize how happy and carefree we really were until we no longer feel it. Recognize those moments and appreciate them; don't let any of your desires or worries get in the way. Try not to reflect or think too much about how it's been so far or give the vacation a grade before it's really over. Don't give yourself too much time to think about what happened, but give yourself enough to know what to do and where to go. You can take pictures and record videos, but remember to turn them off once in a while. Let yourself be in the present instead of taking pictures of a moment you weren't in for the future.

, There are some places that people know they'll never go back to. Some won't come back to keep the memories unique, some understand that they won't be the same, and others just know that they want to keep on going and discovering new and exciting places. Whatever you choose to do, remember this vacation and learn from it. You might just look back at it one day and realize how lucky you were to have experienced it.

Set aside your days and times.,
Use digital booking.,

Visit in the off season.,
Use Disney’s Fast Pass.,
Make Magic bands work for you.,
Use digital maps of the park and Disney apps.",How to Plan a Trip to Disneyland," When you are working on a detailed plan for your time at Disneyland, choose which rides you absolutely must go on. Because lines are largely digital affairs nowadays, getting on your favorite rides can be done literally months in advance. Choose which rides you are most excited to go on and book those first.The same can be said of food: reservations may be booked at restaurants a full six months ahead of time, so be sure you plan your “must see” food spots, as well.;
, You may want to avoid the rides in the most popular times of day, so check in with the park to determine the busiest times. Although there will be some variation based on season and visitor volume, identifying which times are the busiest and which are more relaxed will provide you with a more enjoyable Disney experience.

, Make sure you have figured out how you are going to arrive at the park. If you are staying at a Disney hotel, shuttles will take you. If you are camping or staying outside of the Disney bubble, you may need to rent a vehicle or use public transportation.Bear in mind that Disney traffic is heavy and intense. If you are driving yourself, prepare for a dizzying traffic experience.
There are shuttles leading to and from the park, including shuttles to the airport.
There are also in-park travel options, including travel between parks.

, Single-day tickets are the most expensive (per day) tickets to come by, while the cost per day decreases drastically for each day you add after 3 days. If you are able to make your trip a bit longer, you will see more savings.Although tickets are cheaper for longer visits, Disney resort booking is not. If you are trying to save on your budget, consider a longer park ticket, but staying in a hotel outside of the park.

, Rather than making a lot of phone calls or purchasing tickets and booking hotels once you arrive, always book your itinerary online before you go. Tickets go quickly, as do hotel rooms and packages. For the best possible rates and deals, you must book online.Most Disney experts suggest booking a minimum of six months in advance, if not longer. This will get you the best prices, and will ensure you are able to visit all of your preferred locations.

, Bundles and deals are not only for the budget-minded, as they take a lot of planning and guesswork out of the equation. While you will not have as much freedom to choose the types of tickets you buy or the duration of your stay, you can essentially have the work of choosing parks, dining, and boarding made for you.Bundles can also be useful for people on a budget. Some authorized third-party retailers offer both bundles and discounted tickets and hotel stays.

, Weekends and holidays are the busiest times, as you might expect, but certain months and times of the week are busy, too. When planning your trip, you might want to consider visiting in the off season: January through March and again from September through November. Although there are some spots in each of these periods that get busy (spring break and Halloween, for example), visiting during this time will yield the best results for a more relaxed vacation.Although these times are less busy, it is important to note that “less busy” and “completely dead” are not the same thing. You will still find lines and massive amounts of people, even in the off season.

, Fast Pass is a system that allows you to hold your place in line digitally. The system now allows park goers to “stand” in line 30 days in advance (60 days if you have a park-owned hotel reservation). While it is not available for all rides, using Fast Pass to mark your place in popular attractions and even dining areas allows you to enjoy your park experience without the stress of standing in lines for hours on end.The system is particularly useful if you have children who are anxious to move around, as standing in line is no longer necessary.

, Magic Bands allow parkgoers to enter their hotel rooms, pay for some amenities, and mark their spots using the Fast Pass system all without so much as the touch of a button. A Magic Band is an electronic bracelet, and is particularly useful for young children who might not be able to handle money or electronic devices well.Some users have reported difficulty with Magic Bands due to electronic malfunction, but these issues seem to be uncommon.

, Instead of trying to cling to a paper map or keep track of all of the tips and tricks to navigate Disneyland, make your smartphone work for you by keeping a digital map of the park on hand, and taking advantage of Disney and Disneyland apps designed to make your stay easier.Not all apps are Disney licensed or approved. Although downloading an app with tips that is not Disney sanctioned is likely to work out just fine, make sure any ticket or Fast Pass apps are legitimate before you use them.
If you do use your smartphone for much of your trip, remember to bring a backup charger or battery.

,
Know when you can't go.",How to Have the Perfect Day at Dreamworld," Work out in advance what rides you wish to ride and what attractions you wish to see. If you plan on going during the peak season then extra planning should go into your day to reduce the amount of time you spend queuing.;
, Based on your intended stay, pre-purchase the tickets you have decided on. If you plan to purchase ‘Early Entry’ tickets and a Q4U device, then you should do so well in advance of your visit. Having pre purchased tickets will allow you to use the Express Gate at the theme park’s entrance and avoid a possible long wait in the queue. You can pre purchase tickets at no extra cost online. You have to purchase them in Australian dollars. You can use your credit card.

, This will give you time to make sure you don’t leave anything behind on the day. Checklist should include suitable footwear, clothing, camera, hat, sunscreen and any other items you consider necessary.

, Dreamworld is a big theme park so plan on doing a fair amount of walking if you want to get the most out of your visit. Getting a good night’s sleep before your visit will put you in a better physical and mental state to fully enjoy the experience.

, To avoid a last minute rush and panic make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get ready. If you are going to the park for the first time, allow plenty of time to catch the right bus, or if you plan to drive, give yourself plenty of time to navigate to the theme park. Being rushed and in a hurry will result in you getting flustered and will not get your visit off on the right track. Giving yourself time in the morning will allow you to double check your luggage you intend taking to the park.

, If you want to squeeze the maximum value out of your day, consider pre purchasing an ‘Early Entry’ pass. For just ten dollars more per ticket you will be able to enter the park one hour earlier than usual visitors. During peak periods this may be well worth it as you can grab a few rides before the masses arrive.

, One way to avoid queuing is to pre purchase a Q4U device. Having a Q4U means you can reserve a place in the queue, then go and do something else and return at the time your Q4U has reserved and jump straight onto the ride. The cost of a Q4U is about $30 extra for a family of four and can be used on eight bookable rides.

, If you plan on spending the full day at the park and even into the evening don’t be in a hurry to follow the crowds. Most visitors depart the park around three to three thirty pm so after this time wait times are considerably less.

, Despite being very safe, Dreamworld is a big theme park covering a large area. In the bustling crowds and excitement of the day it is very easy for kids to race off to the next attraction or ride. Lay down the ground rules if you are travelling with children and have a ‘lost plan’ in the event that somebody gets lost. This could be to simply make your way to a certain place or ride to meet up again.

, Many of the food outlets can become just as crowded as the rides during busy days.

, And wear a hat in direct sunlight.

, If there is a show that you’d really like to see then get to the location about fifteen minutes before the show starts. Especially on peak days. This will secure the best views.

,, Are you high enough? Many of the more frightening rides have height restrictions, so to avoid ‘on the day’ disappointment when a child learns they cannot ride the ride they want to ride, check in advance as to what rides have height restrictions and what they are and whether your child will be affected. If a child is not the required height then they don’t get on the ride. It’s a simple as that.

, If you plan to combine your visit to Dreamworld with a visit to the adjacent Whitewater World park then consider purchasing a ‘World Pass’. A World Pass will enable you to travel freely between the two theme parks through an interconnected central gate. Although Dreamworld prohibits bringing food into the park, it is ok to do so at Whitewater World. This means that if you have a World Pass, you can bring your lunch etc, eat it in Whitewater World then visit Dreamworld.

, Imagine ten thousand vehicles trying to leave anywhere at the same time and you’ll get the picture. Alternatively, Surfside buses run a regular service and the quickest service to Coomera train station and the Gold Coast.

, Put your trash in the bins provided.

,, Dreamworld is open every day except Xmas day and Anzac day morning (April 25th).

Being able to talk to someone about your plans and brainstorm ideas will make the planning process easier.;
, Make the most of your experience in Australia by researching cities, festivals, historic sites, beaches, national parks, and transportation times and options in advance. Look-up major holidays, festivals, and celebrations for different regions or cities in Australia. Research the weather for the time of year in which you plan to visit Australia.


Canberra is the capital of Australia and location of Parliament and the Central Government. Australia includes 6 states (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia), each with their own capital, and 10 territories (Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Australian Antarctic Territory, Christmas Island, Cocos Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Jervis Bay Territory, and Heard and McDonald Islands).Major Australian cities and their locations include: Sydney (New South Wales), Melbourne (Victoria), Brisbane (Queensland), Adelaide (South Australia), Perth (Western Australia), Darwin (the Northern Territory), and Hobart (Tasmania).
Australia is divided into six climate zones characterized by differences in average seasonal temperatures, rainfall, humidity, and vegetation: tropical (north), equatorial (far north), subtropical (east coast), desert (southern coast and most of the center), grassland (surrounding desert in the center), and temperate (southeast and southwest coasts).Purchase or check out from a library a guide book of Australia. General guide books include Lonely Planet's Australia and East Coast Australia; the Rough Guide to Australia offers personal and candid accounts of experiences in Australia and is recommended for experienced travelers; and Insight Guide Australia includes information on Australian history, culture, and customs., Compile a bucket list with 5 or 6 things you really want to do or see, and use this as a starting point for planning your trip. Remember to be realistic when planning and stick to your budget - Australia is a big place and might take over a day to travel between major cities or destinations.


Most of the major tourist destinations, such as the Great Barrier Reef, and largest cities, including Brisbane, Melbourne, Sidney, and Canberra, are in the eastern part of the country along the coast.Australia is home to 19 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Great Barrier Reef, Sidney Opera House, and Ayers Rock in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.Australia was first settled by the ancestors of modern Aborigines over 40,000 years ago. Australian Aboriginal culture is incredibly diverse. In the 18th century, over 1 million Aboriginal people occupied Australia, organized into 300 clans and speaking over 250 languages.Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory is one of the best sites to visit Aboriginal art and culture sites.The National Gallery in Canberra showcases 13 galleries devoted to Aboriginal art.History buffs can learn about Australia's history as a penal colony for Great Britain at Fremantly Prison near Perth.The Historic Port of Echuca on the banks of the Murray River in Victoria offers living history related to 19th century life, trade, and shipbuilding in southwest Australia.Australia is home to some of the best beaches in the world, such as the Twelve Apostles beach in Victoria,You can also swim with rays at Dolphin Bay in South Australia, take a break from Sydney at Bronte Beach, or visit Aireys lighthouse at Eastern View beach in Victoria.You can also rent a car and leisurely stop at beaches and destinations along Victoria's Great Ocean Road.Wildlife and nature buffs can experience Australia's unique flora and fauna by catching a glimpse of crocodiles in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory,searching for wombats and platypus in southeast Australia,or swim with whale sharks in Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia.For wine and food aficionados, South Australia is home to Australia's world famous wine region.You can tour wineries throughout the Yarra Valley, located a short drive from Melbourne., Under-budgeting is one of the biggest mistakes a traveler can make.Additionally, budget airfare or ""all-inclusive"" packages might look like great deals, but can contain additional or hidden costs (e.g. luggage, meals) that can quickly add up. When making a budget, it is important to consider the following:Air travel: airfare, check baggage fee, airport parking (per day), and airport transfers.
Transportation: travel within Australia (airfare, buses, trains), car rental, gas, and public transportation.
Accommodation and meals: hotel or hostel (per person per night), breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and tips.
Sightseeing, tour and entrance fees, souvenirs and shopping, and entertainment.
Other expenses such as travel insurance, passports, visa, currency exchange fees, and luggage.
A good rule of thumb is to add $25 to $50 per person per day for miscellaneous travel expenses.

, An itinerary will serve as a guide when making travel plans. Once you've completed your research and put together a budget, make a list of everything you want to do and see. Make sure you account for travel time between places. Look up prices of attractions. Create a timeline based on how long you will be in the country and plot each day's destinations on a map.An ideal Australian vacation would last between two and two-and-a-half weeks, and include sites in Sidney and Melbourne, as well as excursions to Uluru (Ayers Rock) and the Great Barrier Reef, and a trip along the Great Ocean Road.You can start by downloading a travel planning app, such as Tripit.com or NileGuide.com.Be realistic and do not cram in too much into a single day. Schedule down time during the day, make sure you get 8 hours of sleep per night, and give yourself enough time to travel between places.
Make an itinerary that is flexible. Being able to make adjustments will help you deal with any unexpected travel delays.

, You need a passport when travelling to a different country.If you are a United States citizen, applying for and receiving a passport can take 4 to 6 weeks, unless you pay an additional fee to expedite the process.You can apply for a passport by downloading and printing the form (form DS-11 if this is your first passport, form DS-82 for passport renewal) from the U.S. Department of State's website, filling it out, and either mailing it in (renewals only) or dropping it off at a designated U.S. passport acceptance facility.


To find an authorized passport acceptance facility, go to travel.state.gov and click on ""U.S. Passport"". Under the ""Your U.S. Passport"" tab in the upper left corner, click on ""Where to Apply"". This will bring you to a page that lets you search for authorized facilities by state, city, or zip code.
When applying for a passport, you will need: proof of U.S. citizenship such as your birth certificate, previous U.S. passport, certificate of naturalization, or consular proof of birth abroad (original documents only, photocopies will not be accepted); photo identification (valid driver's license, valid government ID, valid military ID, or undamaged U.S. passport issued in the past 15 years); and two copies of a 2x2 inch color photo taken within the past 6 months, printed on photo-quality paper, and which meet additional requirements outlined on the travel.state.gov website.Passport fees must be paid at the time of application. You can pay using personal checks, money, or cash.Basic fees include $110 for an adult passport book, and a $25 processing charge. Additional fees include $60 for expedited service, $14.85 for overnight delivery, and $30 for an adult passport card.

, In addition to a passport, Australia requires American tourists, students, business persons, etc. to obtain a visa to enter and remain in the country for any length of time. Visa requirements and fees differ by country, and frequently change. Whether you are planning a trip to Australia or anywhere else in the world from the United States, it is important to check the American's Traveling Abroad page of the U.S. State Department Website for country specific information.U.S. citizens with a valid passport can apply for and purchase an Electronic Travel Authority, or ETA, online for $20.An ETA allows you to enter and leave Australia at anytime during a 12 month period and remain in the country for no longer than 3 months at a time.Most ETAs take less than 12 hours to process.Certain individuals are ineligible for an ETA, including those who have tested positive for tuberculosis or been convicted of a crime and served a 12-month or longer sentence are ineligible.HIV/AIDS positive visitors may also encounter certain restrictions or be required to undergo a medical exam prior to entering Australia., Start searching for plane tickets several months in advance. You can compare prices from multiple airline carriers using a website such as kayak.com or cheaptickets.com. During non-peak seasons, expect a plane ticket from the U.S. to Australia to cost around $1500 (includes taxes and fees). If you prefer to fly a specific airline, it is best to book tickets directly through them either by phone or online.


Keep your travel dates flexible to take advantage of reduced airfares. In general, flights are cheaper midweek (Tuesday or Wednesday) or on Saturdays.Flights are usually 10% to 20% cheaper during the off-season, which in Australia is between early May to early June, and late July to late September.Because of its size, the best way to travel within Australia is by airplane. Australia has several domestic airlines that offer regular, affordable flights between its major cities.Major domestic carriers include: Jetstar, Qantas Domestic, Rex, Virgin Australia, and Tiger Airways., Plane tickets can be booked online, by phone, or through a travel agency. Once you know your travel dates, go ahead and book your plane tickets. If possible, make seat reservations at the time of booking, especially if you are travelling with other people, or prefer a window or aisle seat.


Most plane tickets are non-refundable once purchased. It is always a good idea to purchase insurance in case you need to cancel or reschedule your trip. Plans are usually offered for an additional fee at the time of purchase.
Read through all ticket information, including possible additional fees for luggage, seat location, meals, etc.

, Having a place to stay that is safe, convenient, and affordable will reduce stress and offer you peace of mind when travelling. You can also read reviews and compare hotel or hostel prices on online. Sites such as tripadvisor.com or lonelyplanet.com offer user reviews of accommodations. Hotels and hostels can usually be booked online, via email, by phone, or through a travel agency.


Booking in advance is especially important if you are planning to travel to a city during a major festival, or during peak travel seasons.
Print out and bring any receipts with you, as well as the credit card you used to make the booking. In case the hotel loses your booking or overbooks for that night, you have proof of your reservation and can demand a refund or alternative accommodations.

, Third party travel insurance, such as that offered through Access America or Travel Guard International, is indispensable when traveling to a foreign country such as Australia.Insurance not only protects you in the case of trip cancellation or disruption, but also reimburse for lost, damaged, or stolen luggage, and help cover medical costs or evacuation in case of an emergency or natural disaster. Prices vary based on where you are traveling and how long you will be in the country. Compare quotes and coverage before purchasing a policy, and make sure you read the fine print.


Before purchasing travel insurance from a third party, check and see if you current medical or life insurance policies will cover you when outside the U.S.

, Other things to consider booking well in advance include tickets for shows or attractions, reserving a spot on a tour, or planned excursions offered through a travel agency or organization.


If you plan on eating out at a popular restaurant, try calling or emailing to make reservations in advanced.
Make arrangements for things back home, such as childcare, pet sitting, or house sitting, at least one month in advance.

, You want to pack efficiently, but not too lightly that you run out of clothes halfway through your trip or forget important documents or medication. Before you begin, make a list, dividing things into the following categories: important documents, clothing and accessories, personal items and hygiene, prescriptions and first-aid, electronic gadgets, and miscellaneous.Gather everything together and lay it on your bed or floor. Start with clothing items and pack according to average weather conditions in Australia for the time of year (and region) you will be visiting. Coordinate outfits based on where you will be and what you plan on doing: hiking excursions, restaurants and museums, nightlife, beaches, etc. Select items that are versatile, especially clothing that can easily be ""dressed up or down"" depending on the situation.


Maximize space by rolling items such as shirts, skirts, pants, and shorts or folding clothes together.Save space in your suitcase by purchasing toiletries (e.g. soap, shampoo, conditioner, sunscreen, bug spray, etc.) in Australia. Discard these items at the end of your trip.
Purchase durable luggage, especially if you will be traveling a lot within the country. Cheap luggage cannot withstand the wear and tear of international travel, and you might be stuck needing to buy a new suitcase in Australia.

, Australia experiences four seasons throughout the country - winter, spring, summer, and fall - as well as a tropical wet season in the north.Seasons in Australia occur at different times of year than in the United States. You will want to bring an umbrella and light clothes during the summer wet season (December to March), but pack for a variety of weather conditions during the other times of year. The seasons and what type of weather to expect include:Summer (December to February) ranges from hot and humid in the north, hot and dry in the center and much of the east and west coasts, and mild/warm in the south. Average temperatures range from 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit to the north, center, and west, and are cooler (70 to 90 degrees) to the south and east.Many sporting events and outdoor festivals in east and southwest Australia occur during the summer months.
Winters (June to August) are mild to the north, but cold throughout the rest of the country. Average winter temperatures range from around 26.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the southwest to 75 degrees in the far north. Skiing and snowboarding is popular this time of year in Victoria.Spring (September to November) and Fall (March to May) are transition seasons, and the weather can be highly variable. However, the dry season from May to October is the best time to experience clear skies in the tropical regions of northern Australia., Avoid having items confiscated or having to pay tariffs or taxes by reviewing Australian customs laws and restrictions regarding declaring items, paying duties, and prohibited goods.You are required to fill out an Import Declaration form for goods you are bringing into and leaving in the country worth more than 1,000 AUD. You are required to pay duty and taxes on goods such as tobacco or alcohol regardless of their value. Examples of restricted or prohibited imports include: firearms, endangered animal and plant species, certain dog breeds, laser pointers, electric fly-swatters or mosquito bats, pornographic material, and certain antibiotics., In order to contact hotels, people, or restaurants while in Australia, or call friends and family back home without racking-up a huge cellphone bill, it is smart to purchase an international phone plan or phone card in advance. If you have a smartphone, services such as Skype mobile or Google Voice allow you make international or domestic calls for a small fee (often around several cents per minute) as long as you have an internet connection. If you can easily remove and exchange the sim card from your phone, consider purchasing a prepaid sim card once you arrive in Australia.


In emergency situations, most American cell phones work in Australia. Contact you cell phone service provider prior to leaving to ask about international plans or costs and fees associated with calls outside of the U.S. or Canada.
Be aware of time differences when attempting to call family or friends back home. Australia is divided into three separate time zones.The East Coast of the U.S. is 13 hours behind Western Australia and 16 hours behind New South Wales and Sidney. Add three hours for places on the West Coast of the U.S.

, You do not want to leave an important document behind - this can cause travel delays or even impact your ability to enter the country. Also, store important documents such as passport, visa, cash, and credit cards in a secure location (such as a neck wallet or money belt) and bring it with you on the plane. Never pack important documents in your checked luggage in case your luggage is delayed, lost, or damaged.


Examples of important or necessary documents for traveling to Australia include: passport, visas, credit card you used to book hotels or airfare, credit and ATM cards, cash (USD and AUD), E-tickets, hotel information and reservations, driver's license, guidebooks, and prescription drug information.Make copies of all important documents and keep them together in a folder in your checked luggage (take the originals with you on your carry-on).

, Your carry on should include important and necessary documents, a change of clothes, and other essentials such as travel-size toothpaste and other toiletries.These will come in handy in the even your flight is delayed or your luggage is lost. Check the airline in which you booked tickets through for carry-on allowance (size, number, weight). Most airlines allow a small carry-on piece and a personal item such as a purse or briefcase.Attach a luggage tag to any carry-on items.


Check airport and airline restrictions on carry-on items, such as liquids and gels, or items such as pocket knives or nail clippers.Flights to Australia

, Give yourself plenty of time to make it to the airport, check your luggage, and go through security. For international flights, it is recommended you show-up at least 2 to 3 hours before your flight leaves.

Go!",How to Plan a Trip," When people think to themselves, ""I want to take a trip,"" usually they have a place in mind. Where's yours? Try to make it as specific as possible. ""London"" is a lot easier to plan than ""England.""


Research it online and discuss it with your fellow travelers. Websites are a great place to browse travel photos, journals and videos posted by real people sharing their experiences. For example, before going on a trip to Japan, do a quick search -- you'll get all kinds of stories and advice from people who recently visited Japan. Each trip offers you connected experiences from real people so that you can get a better picture of the place you want to go.
Keep in mind weather and climatic conditions, merits and demerits of the place, types of recreation (beaches, culture, shopping), and facilities (transport, eating out, etc). What clothes are suitable? How removed from civilization will you be? What does your destination require?

, This will be determined by a number of things, but mostly your schedule. How much time can you feasibly take off work? In addition to your constraints, consider more global factors:


Do you want to go during the off-season or while tourism is booming? The off-season will offer discounts, but it will also mean closed doors and reduced availability.
When it comes to weather, do you want to deal with winter or the rainy season? How about when it's hot and muggy?
And then there's ticket prices – if you're flying, when is it the cheapest to fly?

, Planning too far ahead may backfire, because vacations hardly ever go as planned. Plan for spontaneity, but keep hints from travel guides in mind. Mark places to visit and things to do. How many days do you have? You should keep the overall schedule in mind – you do not want to end up too tired (or alternatively, bored).


Make a list. Write down the places you want to visit, including restaurants, museums, malls, and other places of interest. This will help give you ideas and prevent being completely lost when you arrive and do not know what to do.
Include how you're going to get around. Does your itinerary involve cab rides? Using the subway? Trekking on foot? If you are taking public transportation, make sure you know how that's done wherever you're going.

, The largest immediate savings in planning your trip would be to use an online travel website to research, plan and book your travel adventures vs. going to a local travel agent where you live. Travel Agents simply must charge booking fees, or they could not stay in business. Not only does a travel website pass savings to you in low overhead, they are able to rapidly check hundreds of options within a few seconds.


Companies that help you in the actual ""planning"" phase of your trip, would be like Gap Travel Adventures, Get A Trip.com, the Automobile Club of Southern California Travels Division (and their counterparts in each of the 50 States), and the American Express Corporation, whereas the giant travel conglomerates, such as Expedia, Travelocity ,Orbitz.com and Priceline (the 4 largest travel vendors in ""gross profits"" within the United States), aim at the end booking process.
The five things you can do to help yourself and your budget (that you don't need a travel agent for) are the following: 1) Book your flight and hotels at the same time, not separately 2) Be willing to fly mid-week and off-hours 3) Be willing to fly or land at a neighboring airport within 30 miles (48 km) of each other 4) Pay an all-inclusive price when possible, so that meals and gratuities are included, and 5) The actual season you travel – i will differ the rates by 30-40%., Are you going to be bathing in champagne in the claw-foot tubs of a five-star hotel? Or are you going to be roughing it in hostels with a stub of bread in your pocket? A large part of how much a vacation costs is what you decide to spend. Take an hour or two to figure out how much your trip would cost you and your companions. This should include airfare or gasoline costs.


Always add some wiggle room, overestimating rather than underestimating. There are always costs you don't foresee or things you want to do that you haven't accounted for.
If the trip is more than you are willing to spend, make cuts where you can. If it ultimately means cutting the trip short, so be it.

, Let's say you figure your trip will cost $1,500, including airfare. It's six months away. That means you have to save $250 a month for the next six months in order to meet the costs of your trip. Here are a few ideas where you can start saving:


Ditch that daily sugary latte. If you get a $4 coffee drink three times a week, that's $12 a week, and about $50 a month. That's $300 in six months right there.
Eat from home more. Restaurants are great, but they're expensive. If you cook at home, you can save money not only because it's cheaper, but because you'll have leftovers that can last you days.
Quit the luxuries for a while. That last drink on Saturday night? Pass. A movie next week? Nope. Heck, cable? Who needs it when you have Netflix? Take a look at what little things are fun, but that you could live without.

, If you plan ahead, you can save on prices by doing your research and searching around for deals, either for flights or for accommodation. Search online for things to do and travel tips to and around the destination you're visiting. In your learning, you'll know what to search for when looking for deals – like museum passes, hotel discounts, transportation deals, etc. And when you find those deals, nab 'em.


It is said that you should book airfare around two months out for the best deals – this is that happy place where airlines start discounting their trips to sell tickets, but haven't yet jacked prices up because they're last-minute.If you're going somewhere that speaks a different language, take the time to brush up on the basics. You'll be glad you did, and the people you interact with will be, too.

, Many credit cards nowadays are associated with major airlines. They offer bonus miles for signing up in addition to miles for every dollar spent (most have a minimum per month, however). You can use it to pay for everything, raking up miles along the way. Just make sure you have the money to pay it off.


Many airlines also pair with major retailers, like Target, Amazon, and Apple.If you buy from those stores, you get miles. What's not to like? You're shopping there anyway – you might as well get a free flight for it.

, Once you're exactly sure of where you want to go and when you want to go where, where you want to stay and how you want to get around, make your reservations. For flights, again, book around two months out. And don't wait till the last minute for your hotels either – you don't want them to be booked or almost-booked (because then prices skyrocket).


And anything else for that matter, too. Many attractions have ticket sales online where you can skip the lines and go right in. Sure, the idea of waiting in line right now doesn't sound so bad, but for three minutes of work right now you can not waste hours of your vacation standing in a line with strangers wishing past you would've had better sense.

, While you may not want to pay premium rates for something that might not happen, you should nonetheless have some protection in case you could not travel during the time your tickets are booked for. The average one week vacation will cost you in insurance needs approximately $75 dollars. This is not a lot of money considering the security it buys you.


Only you know if you are one of these people that changes their mind often, or often does re-scheduling – or if you are one of these people that will fly out in a hurricane, no matter what!

, Some countries require a visa to enter and exit the country. Does where you're going require one? If so, do this as soon as possible. If something is to come up and you don't have one, kiss your trip goodbye. Barring countries that take monetary bribes, they will tell you to turn around and get a flight back home if you don't have one.


Keep your passport, travel documents, visas, and similar items in a safe pouch. You may want to make copies, too, and keep them in a safe place. It will make it so much easier to replace anything that you lost.

, For starters, notify a friend or family about your leaving. If possible, leave them a contact number or address. If anything goes wrong, you'll be able to hear about it. And if anything should go wrong on your end, they'll be able to take care of business back home.


If applicable, put vacation notices on your e-mail, and remember to set your answering machine. Those messages will just have to wait until you get back.

, Buy film, or keep digital camera batteries on hand. Do you have the right plug-in adapter for wherever you're going? How about gear for the weather? A guidebook? A language book? What will make your trip go off without a hitch?


Traveling in a car? Make sure to get lots of foodstuffs, water, and things to do. A CD on tape about a road trip or your specific destination will be great to get you in the mood. Consider ""On the Road,"" "" Lost in My Own Backyard,"" ""A Walk Through the Woods,"" or ""Washington Schlepped Here,"" amongst others. Good music is a must, too., No one has ever said to themselves while on vacation, ""I'm so glad I practically packed my entire closet."" Leave space for shopping and buying souvenirs. Moreover, traveling with lots of luggage restricts your movement and causes discomfort – you'll be moving around a lot, and it'll only be cumbersome. Only pack the necessities.


Stick to basic pieces and a couple pairs of shoes – it's really all you need in terms of clothes regardless of how long your trip is. A few basic shirts and a few basic pants, shorts, or a skirt will do the job. You can then mix and match as necessary.
Roll your clothes when packing. This will save you a ton of room and mean you can buy that authentic-looking tiki torch when the mood strikes.

, Itinerary? Check. Passport and documents? Check. Reservations for practically everything? Check. Now all that's left to do is get going and enjoy yourself. This is the easy part. Now it's time to relax.


Don't be tempted to take work or home problems with you – then all this planning will be for naught, making it feel like you're still mentally back home. Leave that laptop and your phone off – now is all about exploring and going on an adventure.

Check out the local library.,
Camp in your backyard.,
Complete a family project.",How to Plan a Spring Break Staycation2," National parks are a wonderful part of any country that are not appreciated enough. Locate the closest national park to you and visit one for the day with your family. Many national parks have a nominal fee, but you can look up free entrance days. When you visit the park, first go to the Ranger Station to pick up Junior Ranger Kit, which requires children to complete a number activities to earn a badge.You can purchase Passport to National Parks and collect stamps at each park you visit.
If you don’t live near a national park, visit any park that is in your area.

, Amusement parks or great for the whole family to have a good time. You don’t need to live near Disney World to enjoy an amusement park experience.

Depending on the time of year, temporary amusement parks may pass through your town for a weekend or month.Amusement parks include water parks, theme parks, and zoos.
If you live in the United States, this list tells you what amusement parks are in your state: http://www.themeparkcity.com/USA_index.htm


, A love for libraries is a wonderful thing to instill in a child from an early age. Libraries are great for the whole family because there are books available for every age and reading level. Often, libraries will host events, even during spring break and summer vacations. Visit your local library or check out their website to see about what kind of events they might be holding.Usually, there are events for kids, teens, and adults.

, Enjoy the outdoors by camping in your backyard. If you don’t have enough space to camp in your backyard, set up a camping area in your living room. Set up a tent and sleeping bags. If you’re outside, build a fire. Make s’mores (on the fire or stove) and set out snacks and drinks. Take turns telling ghost stories.Put on a movie if you’re camping out in your living room.

, Spend your spring break staycation being productive and bonding as a family. Spend the week together improving your home. For example, paint every person’s room in the house together. Or, spend the week building a tree house together."

Encourage your children to draw pictures and make masks.Craft with your children for a family experience.

, From your backyard to the local park, there are plenty of things to do outside. If you are staying home, provide your children with things to do for a fun day spent playing outside. Give them balls to play a soccer or baseball game, set out a sprinkler if its warm enough, and go for a bike ride.Make sure to put on sunscreen and drink plenty of water.

, A movie marathon is great for days with bad weather. Set out blankets, pillows, and bean bags. Plan a menu of theatre food like popcorn, pizza, hot dogs, and nachos.

Get a travel money card.Travel money cards look just like a credit or debit card.,
Buy tickets at least two months in advance.,
Become familiar with the Brazilian culture.Researching where you're traveling to is important so you know what to expect before arriving.,
Pack light.,
Figure out a communication plan.",How to Plan a Trip to Brazil," This can either be an obvious answer, such as with a friend or relative who lives in Brazil or it may take a little bit of time to figure out. If you don't know anyone there that you can stay with you can figure out if you want to stay at a hotel, in a hostel, or even couch surf.


Several travel sites are available online to help you compare options and plan accommodations.;
, Go to your post office to get an application. You may have to make an appointment if you want them to take your picture. You will need a minimum of 2 passport-size photos, a birth certificate, and another form of identification. If you already have a passport, be sure it has at least 6 months left before it expires. This is an important step for anyone traveling to another country.

, If you are a U.S or Canadian citizen you need to apply for a Visa. If not, you may not need one.

, To apply for a Brazilian visa you will need a passport, an application form, a passport type photo, a copy of your driver's license, a copy of travel itinerary, and a US Postal Service money order. Fees will vary according to the nationality of the passport holder. Depending on how long you are staying you may have additional requirements, such as explanations, and bank statements.

, When traveling, you need to exchange your currency to the currency of the country you are traveling to. You can do this through currency exchange counters inside the airport both in the country of departure and arrival or some banks and outside firms will do this too.


Keep in mind that it costs a fee to exchange currency .

, They allow you to preload money from your bank account on to the card. Since there is no overdraft facility, you cannot run up a debt on them. This allows you to budget exactly for the amount of money you want to spend while away.


Prepaid cards are typically linked to the Mastercard or Visa network and are protected, like bank cards, by a chip and pin system.
Unlike bank cards, they are not connected to your bank account or credit card account.
If lost or stolen, fraudsters cannot get access to your money beyond that loaded on the card.

, It's important to plan in advance, because prices go up when it's closer to the departure date.

, You don't want to offend people upon your arrival if you're not used to their way of life, such as their customs and manners. Brazil is widely known for their beaches, food, and music. Fun activities include dune buggy rides, hang gliding, sand boarding, surfing, and so much more.

, Depending on what time of the year you are traveling to Brazil, it is a good idea to research what the weather is going to be like and how much you're allowed to bring through the airport. It's smart to pack as light as possible, because you never know what you'll be bringing back from your trip too.

, Since you will be in another country, it may be difficult to communicate with your friends and family back at home. Consider calling your phone company and requesting temporary international calling. There are many resources that can help you keep in touch such as apps or Skype as well.

The larger the group you’re biking with, and the longer the trip, the earlier you’ll need to start. You’ll need to begin researching costs, locations, and equipment as soon as possible.For example, if you’re planning to take a medium-length trip (5–11 days), you should start planning a year in advance. If you’ll be taking a mountain biking trip that lasts a full month, start planning at least 18 months in advance.;
, Even before you determine the location of your mountain biking trip, you need to figure out who will be coming with. Since you’re planning the trip, you can act as group leader and talk to friends, family members, and other mountain bikers in the community. Get hard commitments from as many of your friends and other participants as soon as you can.There may also be a local mountain biking club that you could talk into joining your trip. If this is your first time planning a biking trip, consider tagging along on one of the local club’s trips before your orchestrate your own.

, There’s also a financial reason to get the number of participants sorted quickly: you’ll be able to approximate how much the trip will cost. Mountain biking trips are not cheap, especially if you’re planning to travel out of your state or country, or if you’ll be paying for accommodations along the trail.


More participants means that costs can be split among more people. Figure out early who will pay what amount for transportation, hotels (if applicable), and any other up-front expenses.

, You’ll want to be in good shape for the biking trip, so start physically training well in advance. Do this by taking evening or weekend bike rides along local trails and paths. If you can find trails in your area that are similar in elevation or incline to the trails you’ll be riding on your trip, train on those trails. If you need to, you can even use a stationary or road bike to help train. Any type of training will be beneficial, and cross training is certainly better than not training.Make sure that you train on the bike that you’re going to ride. Since you’ll likely be on the bike for dozens or hundreds of miles, make sure that you’re familiar with it and comfortable in the seat. Do not buy a fancy new bike right before the trip.

, You can confirm that your bike is in good condition and ready to ride by checking A, B, and C: A for air, B for brakes and bolts, and C for controls and chain. These are the parts of your bike most subject to wear and tear, and need to be in good condition before any long ride.If you spot any serious problems with the bike, take it to a cycling shop for professional maintenance.


Check the air in your tires by hooking up a pressure gauge. If the tire pressure is lower than recommended in the manufacturer’s handbook (usually 90–110 psi), inflate to the proper psi.
Check the bike’s brakes by making sure that the brake pads press firmly on the side walls of your tires, and confirm that the brake pads are not won down past a safe level. Check the bolts by going over your bike with a multi-tool and tightening all visible bolts, especially those on the handlebar, seat and seatpost, and pedals.
Check the controls by confirming that gearshifts properly cycle through the gears. The chain should pass smoothly through the rear derailleur in all gears. If it hitches or skips, you may need to use a chain took to loosen a stiff chain link.

, The type of trail and terrain you want to ride on will have a substantial impact on the location you choose for your trip. Each type of train brings unique views, challenges, and experiences. Once you’ve selected a general type of terrain you’d like to ride, you can start looking into specific trails and locations.Common types include:


Long downhills, like in the Rocky Mountains in the American west and parts of Canada.
Slick flat rocks and sandy trails in the desert, like in Utah and much of the American southwest.
Durational alpine trails, like in western Canada, the Rockies, or the American northeast.

, Websites devoted to helping plan mountain biking trips can be invaluable resources: look into a site like SingleTracks, which offers a ranking of the most popular biking-destination trails in the United States. This and other sites which provide extensive trail information will inform you of the length of the trail and its difficulty.SingleTracks will also provide information regarding the nearest major city to the start of the trail, which allows you to plan a starting point for your biking trip.
It’s important to thoroughly research the region and trails you’re considering, especially if they’re in a state or country outside of your own.

, The weather at various biking-trip locations can have a large impact on the safety and status of trails. For example, weather on a trail like the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (through much of the American west) can be treacherous in winter, so it’s best do to the trip in spring or summer.Conversely, if you’re planning a trip to a hot, arid region such as Moab (in Utah), biking in spring or fall will help you to avoid temperatures above 100°F (38°C).
Keep in mind that elevation can have a dramatic effect on weather as well, especially in the northern Rocky Mountains (think Colorado through British Columbia). During the winter, sunny skies can quickly turn to rain or even snow.

, You’re bound to get at least one flat tire on your biking trip, and will need to be able to repair it right on the side of the trail. Make sure you know your tire size (e.g. 26 inch, 29 inch), and buy the corresponding size of spare tubes.Even if you don’t end up needing both tubes for yourself, one of your fellow riders may not have come prepared. You can lend them your second spare tube, if needed.

, Riding along long-duration trails, especially ones with sharp rocks or narrow gaps to ride through, can be rough on tires. You’re likely going to get at least one or two ruptures during the course of a lengthy bike trip, and will need patches to fix up your spare tubes. Both spare tire tubes and patch kits are basically useless without a pump to re-inflate the tires after switching the tubes or patching a hole.You’ll want to find a pump that’s lightweight and doesn’t take up much space, so it will fit easily in your backpack.
Spare tubes, patches, and air pumps should all be available at your local bike-supply or outdoor-supply retailer.

, These are both biking-trip necessities: a multi tool will allow you to do trail-side adjustments to parts of your bike, including the chain, spokes, and frame. Make sure you find a tool which has fold-out tools including regular and Philips screwdrivers and several sizes of Allen key. A tire lever, as the name suggests, allows you to pop the tire off of the wheel frame so that you can replace the interior tube and patch the tire when needed.These items should also be available at your local bike shop or outdoor retailer. If you’re buying the majority of this gear for the first time, speak to a member of the stales staff who can recommend high-quality biking brands.

, Although you may not end up needing these two supplies on your bike trip (especially if it’s relatively short), it’s still wise to be prepared. Chain lube can be used to re-lubricate your chain and keep it circulating smoothly if you encounter water (rain or streams) or dusty conditions on your ride. Although you’re unlikely to have problems you’re your shocks while riding, a shock pump will be handy if you need to fix a slow leak.The sales staff at your local bike shop or outdoor retailer will be able to provide further recommendations about bike equipment that you’ll need, depending on the location and duration of your trip.

Perhaps you are fed up with the rigors and routines of workaday life, and you just want to go somewhere else. Keep perspective. If you want to plot out the whole trip in advance, then you'll need to do a bit of booking and organizing to make everything run smoothly. If you just want to hit the road for a few days and see where you wind up, then you don't need to plan much at all., Do you have one destination, or several destinations, or no destination? Look at a map, and mark all of the places that you want to visit. Calculate the distances and travel times between these points. Chart out an ""optimal route"" that touches upon all of the places that you want to see.


If time is a constraint, you may not be able to see everything that you want. Rank your priorities, and decide whether any destinations take you too far out of the way.
Think about the balance of your trip. Do you want to spend most of your time rambling through wild, outdoor spaces, or do you want to see the cities along the way? How much time do you want to spend outside of the car?
Try using a road trip planning app or website to chart your course.These services can help you decide how far to drive each day, which roads to take, and how to optimally hit all of your destination points.Some of these sites will even help you book hotels and other accommodations!

, A road trip might last a day, a week, a month, or even longer. The only limits are the length of the road and the strength of your obligations back home. The longest road trips can be hugely ambitious or lushly open-ended – and they may not even have a set ""destination"" in mind. Try to fit the road trip into a ""free"" or unscheduled block of time: a vacation from school, a break from work; any time when you don't have any serious, conflicting commitments.


Consider the basic logistics. Ensure that you have enough money to take this trip. Check that you can get the time off of work. Make sure that everyone who's going on the trip can get this time free.
The more time you set aside, the more you'll able to meander along the way. You can take ten hours to drive straight there, or you can take ten days of detours and spontaneous adventures. The style of trip depends upon the purpose of the trip.

, You may have an easier time driving through certain parts of the world during specific times of the year. For instance, you might not want to drive through the desert in the heat of summer, and you might think twice before winding through high mountains in the midst of winter. If your final destination is far away, you might have the option of a northern or southern route. Check the weather beforehand, and make yourself aware of any storms or other obstacles., Keep everyone's expectations on the same page. You don't need to do all of the planning yourself! You should all be comfortable with the balance of spontaneity and scheduling, and you should all agree on where you're going. If you don't establish this from the start, you may wind up arguing in the car. You may even damage friendships.

, If you are road-tripping with a group of friends, consider asking everyone to split the cost of the gas. If you plan to pay for all of it yourself, make sure that you've set aside enough money to reach your destination. Consider that fuel is the one absolutely essential piece of the road trip budget: it literally makes the road trip possible. Make sure that you'll have consistent access to gas stations along your way – and if not, consider bringing along a few extra gallons of fuel to extend your reach.

, If you are on a budget, consider preparing meals before you leave, buying a lot of snacks, or bringing along a bulk of nutritious and easy-to-prepare food items. Feel free to buy food along the way, but make sure that you build this into the budget. If your road trip is more about adventure than comfort: don't be afraid to get creative!


Be aware that eating out for the whole trip is often not the healthiest choice – nor the most cost-effective. It can, however, be convenient if you don't want to deal with the logistics of food prep.

, The longer the road trip, the more important this step is. Make sure that your car is in solid working condition, that you are up to date on your insurance and documentation, and that you are ready to make repairs if something does go wrong. Consider bringing your vehicle to a trustworthy mechanic (or a mechanical friend) for a preparatory check-up.

, If you're happy to spend hours or days in the car simply talking, listening to the radio, and watching the scenery, then you don't need to bring much. Consider bringing a few good CDs, or buying an auxiliary jack to play music from your phone or MP3 device. If you will be a passenger for part of the trip, bring something to occupy yourself when the conversation dies down: a book, a journal, a game, or a puzzle. Keep in mind, however, that you'll be driving through a new and exciting part of the world. The people, the setting, and the spirit of adventure may provide all of the stimulation that you need!


If you will be traveling with children, they may need some sort of entertainment to stay engaged in the car. Bring a book, a sketchbook, a game, a movie-watching device – but don't let them miss out on the entire experience!

, If you are traveling with friends, you will likely share most of the big necessities: food, gas, and lodging. Try using a cost-sharing appto log how much money each person has spent on communal goods. Many of these apps will even divide up the sums at the end of the trip so that you know exactly how much everyone owes everyone else. If you don't want to use an app to track spending, you can record the money by hand and calculate the split-up yourself.

, If you're driving into another country, then everyone in the car will need a passport. For certain countries, you may need a Visa. Make sure that you have your license, your registration, and any relevant car insurance documentation. Bring a map. Consider printing out several copies of your itinerary and reservation information for safekeeping.

, This choice depends largely upon price, comfort, and convenience. You might book a hotel or motel every night; camp out beside the road; Couchsurf, AirBnB, or crash with friends; or even sleep in your car. You can book all of your lodgings in advance, or you can plan on the fly, figuring out where you will sleep as you speed toward the night's destination. It can be liberating to not have to worry about where you're sleeping – but it can also be liberating to not know where you will sleep next!, If you're trying to get somewhere very quickly, you can switch off driving so that the car never stops. Sleep in shifts, in the backseat or the passenger seat, and make sure that there is always a well-rested driver at the wheel! If nothing else, consider doing this for part of your trip so that you can spend more time driving through an area that you really want to see.


Try sleeping outdoors! If you're traveling in a warm clime, or during the summer, you can bring along a tent or a sleeping bag and sprawl out beneath the stars. Research state parks, national parks and forests, and other campgrounds along the way.

, Decide where you'd like to stop driving for the night, and run a web search for hotels in that area. If you've planned out your itinerary in advance, consider booking rooms before you even start the trip so that you don't need to worry about securing lodging at the last minute. Be aware, however, that this will make your road trip less flexible. You will need to hustle to your next destination, each night, and you may find that this limits the spontaneous joys and surprises of the road trip experience.


Look into hostels along the way. If you are visiting an unfamiliar city, staying in a hostel can be a great way to meet other travelers and plop yourself directly into the action.
Trying using AirBnB and other short-term house rental services. This can be a relatively cheap way to stay in the midst of the action, but in a place that's homier than a hotel.

, The best road trips can be those ruled by spontaneity: journeys undertaken with an open mind, a restless spirit, and an air of joyous possibility. The time and budgetary constraints of your trip may not allow you to do this. Consider, however, that you don't need to chart out absolutely everything ahead of time.


Some people are more comfortable with uncertainty than others. If you feel comfortable leaving your sleeping arrangements flexible, then you don't need to book all of your lodgings in advance.

Start out with the right expectations.,
Plan to double the amount of time you would otherwise need without kids.To travel with kids means that you’ll need to adjust the time you’ll need for traveling and visiting.,
Consider ground rules or clear guidelines.,
Try to stay in places a few nights at a time rather than continuously moving on.,
If possible, travel with kids during the late afternoon or during the night.,
Prepare some games and activities to entertained the kids while in the car.,
Choose one or more of the following games to enhance the learning fun:


A mini/travel white board and dry-erase felt pens
Some empty sheets of paper and printed coloring pages and a holder paper clipboard
Counting games, including times tables, subtraction and addition and the like
Storytelling.,
Try some of the following games to get the creative fun happening:


Play ""Storytelling"" or just involve everybody (except the driver) in telling/inventing the story.,
If you're bringing along electronic devices, try the following:


Photography on the Move: If you trust the kids with it, give your preschooler your phone or (small) camera and let them take pictures of what you are traveling by.",How to Plan a Road Trip with Kids," Time flows in a different way when traveling with kids. You will notice that they will give a different meaning to words like “hurry”, ”right now” and “later”. Since time, for them, seems to stretch endlessly, with no break in the monotony, they will feel doubly constricted by the road trip than when feeling bored at home. They will also see absolutely no point in responding straight away to any commands or wishes that you impose on them––since it feels like forever, they'll assume they have forever to comply. Have a little compassion for their perspective––while you can tolerate the distance and lack of breaks, the children find this very novel and rather difficult.;
, In many cases, you won’t be able to move as quickly or visit as many “tourist” sites you’d like to. In other words, be prepared:


To spend quite some time in parks and playgrounds;
To have longer stops while traveling;
And to be accepting of the fact that you won’t be listening to your favorite music or reading your books as much as you’d like.

, At the end of the day, you are the parent and there is a good reason for the road trip. It is okay to expect good behavior regardless of the distance and the reason for traveling. Once children learn that you are not going to tolerate mucking about and making things more challenging that they need to be, and that traveling isn't so bad after all, they'll start learning ways to manage and might even discover that their imagination is limitless. On the other hand, if you pander to every squeal and stop every time the child cries bored, you are creating a backseat driver who knows how to pull all of your strings. Set up expectations from the outset about what is fair in terms of breaks, noise, food time, distance, etc., then ask the children to respect that and do not give in to whining. In fact, the more you ignore whining, the better.

, Allowing the children to have a few nights in one place can be more enjoyable for them than a different room every single night. Moving around during family holidays can be stressful even when everything goes smoothly. When you travel with kids, every time you move there is some packing and unpacking needed and everybody needs to adjust to the new place. On a family vacation with young children, try to stay at least three nights in one place. Where this is not possible, try alternating between long and short stays, so as to avoid the feeling that you’re always on the run.


Teach kids to start packing as young as possible. They can be responsible for a favorite toy to begin with, up to the entire contents of their own bag when they're tweens and teens.

, The best time of the day differs, depending on both the kids' needs and your needs, but generally this time is either during the standard sleeping time for the children, or during the time when they’re in a good mood and most likely to be cooperative. However, if you’re traveling with children across a wide range of different ages, forget about the perfect timing. Chances are they won’t be synchronized anyway and it's better to touch teach everyone how to ""go with the flow"".

, Select a range of activities and games for the kids, as they may get bored with similar activities. Choose age appropriate travel games for your children and, as much as possible, get them to make the choices and be responsible for the entertainment as soon as they're old enough. Do not teach children who are old enough to work this out for themselves that you're chief entertainment officer––make it clear that this is everyone's role! Some ideas to help you and your kids out include:

, This can help the development of love of reading and writing as well as enjoying a good tale.

, Start a story and when it reaches a dramatic point, have someone else continue.
Play ""Scavenger hunt"". Have a list of things that need to be found during the trip and have everyone in the car (except the driver) look for them. The nice thing is that, with a bit of imagination, you can adapt this game to your traveling style and the interests of your children.
Play ""Do as I’m doing"". Invite your kids to imitate you by doing funny things with your face, hands and arms. For example, try patting your nose or rubbing your belly three times, then see if your kids can do the same number of actions. Or create a sequence — nose touch, chin pat, cheek blow — and invite your kids to follow along. Then copy each child as she or he creates her or his own (never mind the funny looks from fellow passengers). You can also play the “head shoulders knees and toes” song.
Mark the Miles: Before starting out on a long travel with kids, make a kids travel game. Hang little numbered tickets above each child’s car seat, one for every hour of the trip. This way they will be able to understand the concept of time and avoid questions like “Are we there yet?”. They will love pulling down the ticket when you ask for ‘Tickets, please!’, and if you want to- every time they hand over the ticket- you can reward their patience with some treats.
Give a challenge: Put some treats into paper bags labeled with an activity––like finding a specific landmark or license plate––that the kids must do before opening the bag.
Make some noise: Why not throw a party in the car? Play freeze dance by blasting the car stereo for a minute while everyone wriggles and boogies in their seat (except the driver!). When the music stops, freeze in place for a while and then start again. As a bonus, the family will burn off some energy. (This may be too distracting for the driver; if so, do not use this suggestion.)
Make everything a surprise: Wrap everything in recycled newspapers or magazines, so that every new toy you hand over is a surprise. It does not matter if they have played with the toy before, unwrapping something is always exciting for a kid.
Ask Who am I?: This is a great travel activity for kids because it requires no gear beyond an active mind. To play a kid-friendly version, think of a simple category, like “fruits”, “animals”, “family”, then pick something you want to be and offer three clues to your identity. For instance, “I’m orange, I’m hard, and rabbits love me. Who am I?” A carrot, of course. You can also pretend to be a member of the family and offer clues like “I’m tall, I’m older than…., and I wear glasses.”
Play with clear tape: Sure, this seems silly, but kids love it. If you’re worried about what they will stick it to, talk to them beforehand if there’s anything you don’t want stuck! The kids can color a little tape with black marker or pen and make a mustache or a beard, adding to their upper lip or chin. Or they can tape long strips across the whole back seat from window to window. They can even tape close some empty plastic container. Just give the kids their own roll of tape to do whatever they want with.
Play with paper clips: Another super simple object that kids old enough to handle small objects safely will love to play with during family travel. They can make chains, necklaces, or open them up to make more structures. They can make a paper clips chain from one side of the car to the other, attaching them to the hand rails, and then hanging their toys from it. There are many fun things they’ll be able to do with paper clips.

,
Save your songs: Kids love to sing, and if you give them a smart phone or mike, they will love to tape their songs and play them back. Pus you’ll have some great (original) music for your family travel.
Let them guide you: Give your preschooler a (spare) GPS or similar device and let her guide you. She or he will be very happy to play such a vital role in the trip, and she or he will get to practice her or his orientation skills. Make sure that from time to time you ask your child “Are we going on the right way?” or “What do we need to do now?”
Tablets and smartphones: These are great to have with you. Make sure you have some movies the kids like and some fun and educational apps, and use them in emergency situations. If you have YouTube on a phone, you can watch the videos offline (if applicable), too.

Keep your itinerary under control.,
Set realistic goals for yourself on vacation.,
Eat healthy foods during your vacation.Many people use vacations as an excuse to eat whatever they want and this can lead to weight gain, which might lead to some negative emotions when you return home and step on the scale.,
Sleep as much as possible.,
Schedule in plenty of time to just relax.",How to Plan a Mental Health Vacation1," Sometimes the goals that you set for yourself on vacation can stress you out and cause you to enjoy the trip less. This may include things like punishing itineraries where you try to see and do more than is realistic in one day. To minimize this stress, make sure that you do not overload your itinerary.


For example, you might set a goal to do one of the activities on your list each day, such as visit a world famous museum or take a trip to a local landmark. However, planning to do four or five of the things on your list in one day may be overwhelming, which could make the activities much less enjoyable.;
, You may end up stressing yourself out during your vacation if you start making plans to change your lifestyle dramatically. For example, if you try to set a goal of running five miles every morning or losing 20 pounds in two weeks, then you may find it hard to enjoy yourself.To decrease your stress and avoid feeling defeated after your vacation, make sure that you set realistic goals for yourself and allow yourself some wiggle room as well.
For example, you might set a goal to eat a serving of vegetables with every meal while you are on vacation or to get 30 minutes of exercise every day, such as walking or riding a bike.
However, be willing to give yourself a break if you slip. If you have an off day, try saying something like, “Oh well! I am on vacation!”
Setting a goal to just sit or lie down and relax for 15 to 30 minutes per day is also a great goal.

, Therefore, it might be a good idea to limit yourself to one indulgence per day and try to eat healthy for most of your meals on vacation.


For example, you might decide to try a beignet for breakfast while visiting New Orleans, or enjoy a gelato for dessert while visiting Italy. You can enjoy these indulgences as long as you balance out these things with some healthy choices.
However, remember that you are on vacation, so it is okay if you slip now and then. Try not to stress over how many calories you are consuming at every meal.

, One of the great things about a vacation is that you do not have to worry about being up at a certain time every day. You can sleep until you wake up if you want to. Take advantage of this while you are on vacation and get as much sleep as possible. This will help you to feel more rejuvenated and relaxed.


You might even allow yourself to take an afternoon nap each day during your vacation to get caught up on your sleep.

, To ensure that you feel rested when you return from your vacation, make sure that you set aside lots of time to just relax while you are away. Try to schedule in some relaxing activities during your vacation, such as:


Taking a yoga class.
Getting a massage or facial.
Swimming or relaxing in a hot tub.

Treat planning the trip as part of the vacation.Planning a vacation can offer many of the same benefits of taking the vacation.,
Allow yourself to daydream about the trip.,
Plan ahead to decrease your workload after you return.",How to Plan a Mental Health Vacation2," Planning the trip can relax you, take your mind off of daily stressors, and help you find something to look forward to.


It does not matter if you won’t be able to actually take the vacation for a while. Planning a vacation can be an enjoyable experience.
Try setting aside a few hours one evening to plan your dream vacation, or even just to plan a short weekend getaway that you hope to take in the next few weeks.

, You may start to experience some of the mental health benefits of your trip in the days and weeks leading up to it. You may find that you are daydreaming about the trip and feeling more relaxed than usual. This is called a pre-vacation high.Try to make the most of your pre-vacation high by allowing yourself to daydream about the trip and get into vacation mode a day or two before you head off on your trip. This will maximize the mental health benefits of your trip.

, One of the things that can decrease the mental health benefits of a vacation is a heavy workload upon returning home. To avoid a sudden and dramatic rise in stress when you get back, try to find ways to decrease your workload when you return.For example, you might complete a few projects before you take off for your trip, or avoid scheduling anything too stressful for the first few days after you get back.

Explore exotic locations.,
Look into resorts.,
Consider a weekend getaway to a nearby location.,
Enjoy a staycation.,
Take a 15 minute vacation.",How to Plan a Mental Health Vacation3," Getting away to an exotic location might provide the most benefit to your mental health because it will allow you to gain a new perspective and experience new things. If you have a dream vacation, then now might be the time to plan and take it. For example, maybe you have always wanted to visit Paris, or you dream about spending a week on the beach in Jamaica. Whatever your dream vacation is, start looking into how you might take it.


Identify activities you’d like to do ahead of time. Identifying what you want to do while visiting your dream vacation spot and creating an itinerary can help to reduce stress while you are there.Try looking into all-inclusive packages from travel agencies or on sites like Groupon. Sometimes booking these kinds of trips can save you money on expenses like airfare, food, and lodging.
Shop around for airfares to your dream vacation spot. Some sites even allow you to set up alerts to let you know when the price has dropped.

, Resorts can offer you a stress-free vacation plan, which might be beneficial to your mental health if you are overwhelmed by the thought of planning a vacation. Many resorts are all-inclusive, so you do not have to worry about finding places to eat, activities to do, or hotel rooms. Everything is there in one location.


Try looking into some special interest resorts. For example, some resorts focus on helping you relax and rejuvenate, while others might offer a program to help you lose weight and change poor eating habits.
Keep in mind that all-inclusive resorts can be quite expensive. Look for resorts that are within your price range to minimize the stress of the vacation.
If decide to stay at a resort, then you may want to plan at least one activity outside of the resort, preferably something you have never done before. This will help to maximize the mental health benefits of your vacation by forming some new connections in your brain., If you can’t take much time off of work and you don’t want to spend too much money, then you might look into a weekend getaway somewhere closer to home. You can spend a night or two in a nearby city or get away to a rural location if you want to escape the fast pace of city life. Vacationing close to home can offer you some of the same mental health benefits of going somewhere far away. You can see and do new things while getting a break from your normal routine.


Look into nearby cities you have never explored before to find out what attractions they have. They might have some interesting museums, landmarks, or restaurants that you can check out. If you enjoy sports, then look into sporting events that are happening the weekend you plan on visiting.
Check out nearby campsites if you want to escape to nature for the weekend. If you have your own camping gear, then you might reserve a campsite for the weekend at a national forest. Or, if you prefer to sleep indoors while you are enjoying nature, then you could book a cabin for the weekend or even rent an RV.

, If you cannot leave town and you don’t have much money to spend on a vacation, then you can always plan a staycation. This is when you explore your own area as if you are a tourist visiting and enjoy time at home doing things that you rarely get to enjoy, such as a favorite hobby or lounging on the sofa. A major benefit of this type of vacation is that it will cost you little to nothing and you don’t have to worry about packing or traveling far away.For example, you could take a walking tour of the downtown area of your city, take a sunset cruise on a local lake or river, attend a local fair or festival, or visit the local historical society. Take your camera along and take some pictures to help you play the part of someone visiting the area on vacation.
You can make staying home more like a hotel as well. Try putting out some “amenities” for yourself, such as a fuzzy robe and slippers, a candy bar, and some special toiletries. Take a luxurious bath and allow yourself to just lounge and enjoy yourself at home for the day. Watch movies, read a book, or listen to music.

, If you cannot spare any time for a weekend staycation, then you might consider taking a 15 minute mini-vacation. There are lots of different ways that you can get into a vacation mindset without getting behind on your personal and professional obligations. Some options include:Spending your lunch break outside. Try going outside for your lunch break on a nice weather day and just enjoy the time. Go for a walk through a scenic part of town or find a picnic bench to sit and enjoy your lunch.
Sipping an umbrella drink in your backyard. If you have very little time to spare, then you might consider taking 15 minutes in the evening to head outside with a lawn chair and a cocktail (or mocktail) and sip the drink while enjoying your surroundings.

Meditating or doing some yoga. If you need to relax and take a break from your daily stressors, then doing 15 minutes of yoga or meditation can also help. Or, you can even just sit quietly, close your eyes and breathe deeply for 15 minutes.
Try taking a 15 minute vacation every day. Set aside 15 minutes that is just for you and use it to do nothing but relax.

Identify what you want to take a break from.,
List what you want to do on your vacation.,
Identify how much time you can take.,
Look at your budget for the vacation.",How to Plan a Mental Health Vacation4," Vacations can provide many different benefits, from reducing work stress to offering a chance to connect with loved ones.You probably have some specific things that you would like a vacation from, such as work, household chores, or even certain people. Think about the things you would like to have a break from and try to identify what type of vacation would give you the best break from these stressors.


For example, you might decide that you need to take a full week off of work to get a break from your professional obligations. Or, you might decide that a weekend getaway will be enough to refresh you from housework burnout. Or, perhaps you would benefit from a solo day trip to reconnect with yourself and get away from your personal obligations.

, Sometimes identifying the things that you would most like to do on your vacation is a good way to start planning it and reduce the stress of making the trip at the same time.There are some special destinations that you need to go to experience certain things, but you may be able to engage in other activities anywhere you go.


For example, if you want to sit on a beach and relax, then you will need to find a beach location. However, if you want to get a massage during your vacation, then you can go just about anywhere.
Or, if it has always been your dream to be a yogi, then taking a vacation at a resort that offers lots of different yoga classes may be helpful. If you have always wanted to be a chef, then taking a cooking class during your vacation might be a good option.

, Time can also limit your mental health vacation choices, especially since most people do not take all of their vacation days and some people are afraid to take them because they think they might lose their jobs.Therefore, many people do not get nearly enough time off. Consider your situation and identify what is realistic and healthy for you.


For example, if you do not have any vacation time saved up from work, then you may need to stick with a weekend getaway. However, if you have several vacation days available, then you can take these all at once and leave the country for a week if you choose to do so.
Think realistically about how much time you are willing and able to take for your mental health vacation.

, Some vacations can be quite cost effective, while others can be incredibly expensive. Much of this depends on where you want to go and how long you want to spend there. Before you start planning your mental health vacation, identify how much money you have available for the trip.


For example, if you have $2,000 available for a vacation, then you can probably afford to take an international trip as long as you get a good deal on airfare and lodging and watch your spending. However, if you only have $200 to spend, then one or two nights out of town at a budget hotel is a more realistic vacation plan.

Get a map.",How to Plan a Stress Free Road Trip1," This is an important part of organising a trip. You should have a well oriented plan for your trip. Note down places you want to visit.


It's better to make a list of 4 to 5 places for a distance below 500 miles.
If you are planning for a distance between 500 miles and 1000 miles then you should list out around 15 places.
If the trip is for a distance above 1000 miles, you should add a destination for every 100 miles.;
, You should prepare a detailed budget for your trip. Estimate the cost of needs individually. Don’t be so lavish and try to get your stuffs at a very low cost by considering a minimum quality.


Always carry money more than your need. Try to keep half of your money in some online wallets or in your ATM.

, Also, check online regarding those destination and their tourist attractions.


Check availability of hotels and refreshments.

Use General Delivery mail service if you are able to stick to a pre-planned itinerary.,
Purchase a membership at a mail forwarding service, such as that offered by Escapees, a camping and RV club dedicated to fulfilling the needs of full-time RVers.,
Consider getting your mail on the road via worldwide couriers, like UPS or FedEx.,
Ask a friend or family member to collect and hold your mail, then have them send it to you when you know your itinerary.",How to Get Mail on the Road," General Delivery (also known as ""Poste Restante"" in Europe) is a worldwide service offered by post offices to deliver mail to itinerant individuals who have no permanent address. To get mail on the road with General Delivery, have your mail addressed with your first and last name, care of ""General Delivery"" (or Poste Restante), c/o the post office address. Once it arrives, the postmaster will hold your mail for at least 30 days. In America this service is free but in other countries fees might be assessed.;
, For a fee, Escapees mail service will give you a Texas address to use for mail delivery. They will hold all mail that comes to you at that address until you call to have it sent to you somewhere. You can use General Delivery service for delivery, a private residence, hotel, campground or anywhere with an address. Other mail forwarding services exist in places such as UPS Stores and business service stores that offer photocopying, passports and other administrative services of this nature.

, This can be expensive, but it's faster than most mail solutions and it's available worldwide. You'll need to know the address of the UPS or FedEx store where you want your mail. To save money, have as much mail as possible delivered in one envelope to this location. Once it arrives, they will hold your package of mail until you pick it up. The advantage to using these companies is they are open later than the post office and oftentimes on weekends.

, Again, you can utilize General Delivery service when choosing this option.

Create an itinerary for your group.,
Go!",How to Plan a Group Trip Abroad," Sure, people love to think about traveling around the world, but make sure you don't start planning until the basics are decided upon and everyone has committed. It doesn't have to be exact. For example, you might decide in January that your family -- including 14 adults and nine children -- is available to reunite somewhere in Europe for 5-6 days either the week of June 11 or July 27. This is enough to move on to step 2.;
, Whether you have 8, 15 or 100 people joining you on your trip, you'll need one person or one team to take on the majority of the planning. Other group members can and should be included on most of the decisions -- where to go, what activities to do -- but you don't want seven people making 20 different dinner reservations. The larger the group, the more important this step is.

, Who is going, and what are their budgets for this trip? Uncle Moneybags might want to spend at least $6000 for a week, your parents were thinking $4000 and your newlywed cousin was anticipating $1500. Stick as close to the low end of budgets as possible to accommodate everyone. In this case, we might suggest a $2500 budget, and ask the newlyweds if they'd either like to drive the rental cars or become the ringleaders for a discount, and perhaps Moneybags could pick up a group dinner or pay for the rental cars. One other thing you could do is to pool money for 'fixed' costs only. This would mean you would collect a certain amount of money divided equally by everyone for things like accommodation and transport. However other individual expenses like food, shopping and activities costs should be paid at the individual level.

, While this sounds relatively easy, this is one of the most difficult steps. Twenty people aren't necessarily going to want to go to the same place or do the same things. Listen to what everyone wants, and ask lots of probing questions. While your group might want to go to places as different as New Zealand, South Africa or the Caribbean, you'll see they're all looking for an active vacation near the ocean. You might end up choosing a location based on activities or proximity rather than destination.

, You finally have your location, participants and budget. Where do you stay? What will you do? Buy a guidebook or look through the internet for ideas. It sounds expensive, but renting a villa in Europe or large home in the Caribbean or South America is often cheaper than renting hotel rooms, especially if you take into account cooking at home.

, Once you've researched the area and found accommodation your group likes well enough, book it. You now have the dates set in stone and members of your group can book their flights and transportation as far in advance as possible. Make sure everyone has their passports up to date and gets all of their visas and shots.

, Check in with your group: Do folks want to hang out at the pool and talk about old times, or do they want to bungee jump or go on safari? Try to find the median level of interest and plan accordingly. Perhaps relaxing on the beach can be broken up by an eight-hour day hike around a volcano or samba lessons and a trip to the discotheque. With more than one rental car or by learning the local public transportation, groups can split up on occasion.

, Even with a group of friends or family members, an itinerary can be invaluable. Add everyone's cell phone numbers or local contact information, arrival times, and a loose schedule of daily activities, restaurant reservation times, etc.

, All of this pre-planning will have paid off once you arrive at your villa in Tuscany, your eco-resort in Costa Rica, or at your spa in Hungary. Your group can enjoy time together instead of figuring out where to go, when and how. If possible, designate new ringleaders for the trip itself so the planners can relax.

Research about where you plan to travel.,
If you are visiting a place where the citizens speak a different language than you, learn a few words and phrases:


Where may I find the bathroom?,
Pay special attention to typical weather in the area you plan to visit.,
Create an itinerary for your trip.,
Once you arrive at your destination, explore the area.,
Immerse yourself in the culture.,
Try something new.,
Be respectful of another's culture.,
Enjoy your time while travelling!",How to Get More Out of Travelling," Look at many different resources: the internet, books, friends, teachers, co-workers, etc. Become somewhat knowledgeable with where you will be travelling to. Find information about typical behaviors, dress, lingo, etc. of the culture you plan to visit.;
,
Where can I find (shop, restaurant, etc.)?
Hello, Goodbye, and Thank You.

, This will help with how you should pack. When the time gets closer to your date of travel, check current weather forecasts (which can be found online) so you pack accordingly.

, A 3-ring binder is very helpful. Include copies of your flight information and boarding passes (if applicable), what hotels you will stay at, places to eat in the area, where you will be visiting, different tours of the area, etc. The more organized your information, the easier and calmer your trip will be, instead of scrambling for information.

, Drive around and locate shopping malls, restaurants, and interesting tourist spots. If you are staying in a hotel, walk around and locate elevators and stairs, concierge, the pool, and other interesting areas.

, Go to both tourist-y areas, and areas where the locals go. Take a sight-seeing tour with a tour group, visit museums, go to shopping centers where the locals go, eat where the locals enjoy their food. Of course, it is okay to visit tourist-y destinations as well.

, Eat a new meal you have never tried. Do an activity you have never done, but always wanted to do. Be daring, but also be safe. If you are not sure what something is, ask. Don't be afraid to try something, because you just may like it. And if you don't? Well, at least you tried it!

, If you don't like something, do not be insulting, such as saying ""that's not how we do it in (your own culture or country), so you guys are doing it wrong."" Think of how you would like to be treated if a foreigner came to your own country for the first time.

, Take multiple pictures of your journeys to keep as memories.

New Zealanders also love cricket, soccer, basketball, and rugby. Gather a group of your friends together to play one of these sports. If you have a good time, you should make it a weekly event., Bungee jumping, biscuiting, sea fishing, whitebait fishing, whale watching, skiing, going to hot pools, and pig hunting are just some of the activities teens can enjoy in New Zealand.

You can follow some of the more well known routes or you can go to somewhere only the locals know about. Try camping as well, and hone your skills in fire making, camp cooking and sleeping under the stars.


There are many amazing places to hike and camp in New Zealand, but here are some suggestions: the Abel Tasman National Coast Track, Tongariro National Park, Mount Cook National Park, and the Abbey Caves.Never tramp alone. Always go with at least one other person and preferably in a group. Always let people know when you leave, where you're going and when you expect to be back.
Hypothermia is a real issue when tramping. Don't get caught out overnight without adequate warmth. Even if you're going on a short day tramp, always have a thermal (polyprop), rain jacket and a warm jacket just in case.
Have plenty of water and trail mix to keep you well hydrated and energized.

, Perhaps you haven't been to Rotorua or Dunedin yet? Or maybe you'd like to take the train across the North Island or catch a train across the South Island? Plan for some expeditions that show you more of your country.


Plane fares are reasonable between major cities and towns. You might want to consider buses for the less major hubs though, as the flights will be a lot more expensive.

Cook dinner for family and friends.,
Watch TV made in New Zealand.,
Play games.,
Take up a creative hobby.,
Learn a new language: The world is your oyster when you know how to speak other languages.,
Grow an edible garden.,
Plan to travel.",How to Have Fun As a Teenager in New Zealand2," Dinner is the largest meal in New Zealand, and family and friends will come together to enjoy the meal you’ve prepared. Try a curry, a stir fry, or a classic New Zealand barbecue.Spend all day preparing a big meal, and invite lots of people to come together and eat. Try your hand at whitebait fritters, pavlova or make fruit salad featuring kiwi fruit and feijoa.

, If it’s raining outside, you might not have the option to go to one of New Zealand’s beautiful natural places. Many TV shows on New Zealand TV might be imported from other countries, but you can also find programming from native New Zealanders. Some favorites are “Shortland Street” and “Home and Away.”Look for local comedy. Kiwi comedy is second to none, in the opinion of some, and cultivating your own sense of self-deprecating humor can come in handy for the rest of your life.
Look for local current affairs programs. Keep up-to-date with what's happening in your neck of the woods and hopefully worldwide too.
Watch Maori TV. If you don't already speak Te Reo, learn some by watching good Maori TV shows. The Maori channel also shows some good English language films that.

, Play games, such as board games or video games. Ask your friends for suggestions, or go to online gaming forums and check out what other people are suggesting. You can play games on your cell phone, too.


In the New Zealand iTunes, there will be a list of the top free and paid apps. This will give you a good idea of what's popular right now and some of those apps are made by Kiwis!

, There are plenty of cool things you might like to try, even if you don't have the skills yet. Here are just a few ideas to get you started:


Draw or paint. There are lots of different ways to learn to draw or paint. From Bob Ross videos on YouTube to books on drawing from you local library, artwork is a great way to be creative and develop your skills. Go to a nearby art store and buy supplies, and then find something you want to depict.

Make jewellery: This can be a fun way to learn a new skill and make plenty of gifts for your whanau (family). You could also try to sew clothes: Make a whole new wardrobe by learning to sew and then tinkering around with the sewing machine and your favorite fabrics, try denim, wool mix fabrics, cotton, whatever you like.
Weave flax. You can make all sorts of amazing things from flax, from baskets and clothes to toys and jewellery. Make sure you only pick flax that's not tapu. Flax weaving is a tradition that is special to New Zealand’s history and culture., There are many to choose from and lots of online language resources (and the library). If you haven’t tried learning Maori, give it a shot either with traditional language learning methods or by asking someone you know to teach you a few words. If you have a specific place you want to travel, start learning that language.

, New Zealand's climate lends itself to all-year growing in most zones (except where it snows for part of winter). By growing your own food, you'll save money, learn a lot about delicious vegetables, fruits and edible flowers and you'll please your mum and dad no end. Ask your friends or neighbors to join in and help. If you don't have space for a garden, get involved in a community garden.


Make your own compost and mulch.
Consider adding a few chickens to the backyard. Check with the council that it's okay to do this though and don't get a rooster in the city!

, If you feel like you want to leave New Zealand for a little while, start budgeting for a trip abroad. Make goals for places you want to go, how much money you would need to get there, and how you are going to acquire that money. You might want to travel somewhere close, like Fiji or Australia, or perhaps you have always wanted to go to Europe.


In New Zealand, entrepreneurial thinking is king, so being budget-wise is a good skill to learn early on.
If you want to do the famous Kiwi OE, “overseas experience,” you'll need good budgeting skills to achieve this successfully.

Wrap the strap around a hard-sided piece of luggage.,
Make sure the strap crosses the zipper of a soft-sided piece of luggage.,
Strap multiple pieces of luggage together.,
Secure any remaining length of strap.",How to Use a Luggage Strap1," One use for luggage straps is to keep luggage from accidentally popping open at some point during transit. Hard-sided luggage usually has locks or clasps that can occasionally be damaged if they are thrown around.


For hard sided luggage that has some sort of clasp on the top, wrap the strap around the luggage so that it keeps the luggage closed. Place the buckle in the middle of the front or back side. Cinch the strap tight against the luggage, but not so much that it bends the luggage.
The strap should be at a right angle to the opening of the bag.;
, Soft-sided luggage that is packed tightly can occasionally burst at the seams. A strap will help keep the luggage closed if it bursts its seams.Pull it tight enough that if the zipper comes open, the strap will keep the bag closed tightly.

, Stand your largest piece of luggage upright with handle extended. Set the next largest piece on top leaning against the handle. Wrap the strap under the bottom and around both pieces, going through the middle of a handle with two posts, or just to the edge of a handle with one post.Buckle the strap on the front middle of the lower piece of luggage. Cinch it tightly enough that the top piece does not move around, but not so tight that either piece of luggage bends under the pressure.
You’ll want to try your best to make it so that the handle will still shut, as it will not be able to stay extended during transit.

, Once the strap is secured around the luggage, there may be some of the strap that is loose. To avoid this loose cloth getting caught on something in transit, wrap it around the portion that’s flat against the luggage and tie it in place.


Most luggage straps are adjustable to different lengths, so when you have it set for a smaller piece of luggage than the maximum, you’re likely to have some extra.

"
"
Select an eye-catching color.,
Pay attention to the type of buckle.,
Choose a locking strap for added security.",How to Use a Luggage Strap2," It can be fairly easy to get your luggage mixed up with someone else’s, so a luggage strap is a great way to differentiate your luggage from all of the others. If you can choose a strap of bright pink or green, or with a multicolored pattern, it will give your luggage the pop it needs to be more recognizable.If you are traveling as a family and you have similar luggage, it can also be an easy way to identify whose is whose.

, Most luggage straps have the type of buckle on which you pinch the sides to release it. This is probably the easiest type of release to choose. It’s good to test the buckle out to make sure it is easy to open, but not so easy that it will open if it is jostled.


Some straps may come with a buckle that is similar to a belt, which would require you to weave the strap itself through a metal or plastic clasp. This type is not recommended as it will take you longer to secure around your luggage.

, Luggage straps help hold your luggage closed, but they can also provide protection against theft. Some straps come with a 3-digit combination that must be selected before the clasp opens. This can be a deterrent for potential thieves who would consider getting into your bag.While the security aspect is great, some people do advise against locking straps because they say it can pose a hold up with TSA who may wish to check your luggage and would be unable to.
It’s possible to purchase TSA approved luggage locks. These locks are made so that a master key, which TSA agents have, can unlock the lock. You can purchase these locks at most airports and travel accessory stores.
To make things easier, it is probably best to write down the combination and keep it somewhere you can get to it easily. You don’t want to be stuck somewhere without the ability to get into your luggage.

Take a ferry from Italy to Greece.,
Fly from Italy to Greece.,
Take the train from Italy to Greece.,
Drive from Italy to Greece.",How to Get from Italy to Greece," If you’re on the eastern coast of Italy and you want to go to Greece, the first thing you’d probably think of is taking a ferry. Ports in Italy that are departure points for Greece are Bari, Brindisi, Ancona, and Venice – but your choices don’t end there.


There are a few different ports in Greece that you can sail to, and a few different ferry companies you can pick as well. Here’s an outline of the options (ferry company names are listed after the Greek destinations):The prices for ferries are going to vary widely depending on your departure and arrival points, the duration of the trip, the kind of ticket you buy (deck only, seat only, dorm bed, or cabin), as well as the company you choose, so you’ll need to think about your own travel budget (not to mention your comfort level) in order to pick the ferry that’s right for you.
Some ferry companies offer an option called “Camping on Board,” especially on the longer ferry trips, which is designed for people traveling with a camper or motorhome (and only available during better weather, usually April-October). This option lets you use the ship’s showers, bathrooms, and electricity for free – it just means that you’re staying in your camper during the trip, rather than taking a seat on the ship upstairs.
Now, as for how fast these ferry trips are, remember what I said about them being for travelers with time to spare? Even the company called “Superfast” has to deal with the fact that they’re boats, not jet planes, so you’re still talking about a potentially long ferry journey. The Brindisi-Corfu trip can run between 5-15 hours, and the quickest Ancona-Patras trip could take 21 hours long (and that’s on the “Superfast” ferry).>> 
The options for taking ferries from Italy to Greece are quite complicated, so your best bet is probably to compare schedules and rates at this Greek ferry booking site – you can plug in your specific travel itinerary, dates and needs, and the system tells you what your ticket options are.
Those travelers with lots of time to travel are the ones more likely to think that a 21-hour ferry trip from Italy to Greece is a good option for a little under €100 for a dorm bed on board. Anyone with less vacation time to spare, and especially anyone near a major Italian airport, will likely find that flying is still the best option.
Ferries from Brindisi to Greece:>> to Igoumenitsa, Patras, & Corfu – Agoudimos, or Endeavor>> to Cephalonia/Kefalonia – Endeavor
Ferries from Bari to Greece:>> to Igoumenitsa & Patras – Superfast, Agoudimos, or Ventouris>> to Corfu – Ventouris, or Super fast
Ferries from Ancona to Greece:>> to Igoumenitsa & Patras – Superfast, Anek, or Minoan
Ferries from Venice to Greece:>> to Igoumenitsa, Patras, & Corfu – Anek, or Minoan;
, The quickest (and sometimes cheapest) option for getting from Italy to Greece is going to be to fly. This is especially true if you’re close to a relatively major Italian airport, but even some of Italy’s smaller airports will have regular flights to Greece because the two countries are so close.A few of the points in Greece you might be flying to, and what Italian airports have flights to them, are listed below.


Flights to Athens from – Bologna, Milan Malpensa, Naples, Rome Fiumicino, Verona
Flights to Mykonos from – Milan Malpensa, Rome Fiumicino, Verona
Flights to Crete from – Milan Malpensa
Flights to Rhodes from – Milan Malpensa, Rome Fiumicino
Flights to Santorini from – Milan Malpensa
Flights to Thessaloniki from – Milan Malpensa

, Taking a train from Italy to Greece would mean riding a train through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and then – finally – into Greece. And really, once you get to Greece, the usefulness of that country’s rail system (or lack thereof) will likely mean that you’re taking buses or ferries to the places you want to go. In other words, unless your trip involves stopping along the way on a leisurely journey through each of the countries between the Italian and Greek borders, don’t take the train. one step here and then click ""Add Step""

, Just as taking the train from Italy to Greece requires several border crossings, so does driving. What driving to Greece from Italy also demands that the train does not, however, is your attention. This is a time-consuming trip, and one that’s going to add many miles to your car’s odometer.Driving from Rome to Athens is a journey of roughly 2,400 kilometers (1,500 mi), and if you were to drive straight through it’d still take you about 24 hours to make the trip.


And, according to Michelin’s online route calculations, it’d also cost you more than €300 in tolls and gasoline (as of this writing). From Venice to Athens is roughly 1,870 kilometers (1,160 mi), a 20-hour trip, and costs more than €220.
If you’re on an open-ended road trip and you’re planning to stop along the way wherever the mood strikes you (which sounds excellent), the better option is probably either to fly (and rent a car in Greece if you like) or take a ferry (upon which you can take your car).

",How to Travel Light," The bag should be lightweight and easy to carry. It is helpful to have a bag that can be carried as a backpack, or as a shoulder bag depending on the circumstances. However, backpacks tend to be easier on your shoulders and back when you expect to be walking with your bag for any significant amount of time. It is also handy if it has wheels (but these have their pros and cons, which we'll address at the end of this article). It is quite common to have to walk long distances, climb stairs and have to do many things at once, all while you have your bag with you.

, Check the weather report, so that you know what type of clothing to bring with you. For example, if the weather is going to be warm, then there is no need to bring a heavy jacket. If it is going to be sunny, then bring a hat, etc.

, This does not have to be monochromatic or boring. Rather, it suggests a minimalist approach to fashion. One skirt and a single pair of trousers can be matched with a t-shirt, a fancy blouse or a tank top to make six different outfits--plenty of clothes for a week journey. You can get fancy with a scarf, bandanna, hat or other uniquely ""you"" wardrobe piece. Also, be sure you have appropriate clothing for area you are visiting, and for holy sites if necessary. If done right, you might be able to get away with one load of laundry rather than 'darks' and 'lights'.

, This is so that you can get through at least half of your journey's time without doing laundry, up to 5 days time. After that, you will have to do laundry anyway. This also goes for socks, if you will be wearing those daily. And, bring laundry supplies, if you are planning on doing laundry. (Note: just put enough dry detergent in a resealable plastic bag for as many loads as you plan to do--don't bring the whole box.). Alternatively, if you are not moving much you can pack 3 days worth and regularly sink-wash them, allowing about a day for them to dry.


Clothing, another alternative : 3-4 sets of clothes, including the one you are wearing, is more than enough. Do your laundry once every 2 days. If you wait too long, you will end up having to do a huge load of laundry, which is quite a discouraging prospect after a long tiring day out sightseeing. Some people do their laundry every day since the effort is minimal for just 1 change of clothing.

, Bring at least two pairs of shoes that you can walk in comfortably. In the event that one pair gets wet, or your feet hurt unexpectedly, you will be incredibly grateful that you have that extra pair of shoes. You can wear one and carry the other. I also suggest bringing a fun or fancy pair of shoes, in case you want to go someplace like a club, a fancy dinner, or the opera. You never know who you may meet!


Shoes, another alternative: Instead of 2 pairs of shoes (as above), wear just 1 pair of waterproof, dark hiking shoes. Short of a river crossing by foot, they won't get wet, they are incredibly durable, and are extremely comfortable. Best of all, you won't be carrying an extra kilo of weight and sacrificing the big space taken up by another pair of shoes in your luggage. If you really want to travel extra light, extra shoes are not the way to go. This goes for most things (except clothes) when traveling light: bring 1 really good quality item that will not fail you, and save the space/weight of spare items.

, Put items inside of other items, like those Russian nesting dolls. Roll clothes into small rolls to reduce wrinkling. Make a proper usage of the space you have, and try being creative about it!

, Pack your dry toiletries in the same bag, and your liquid and gel toiletries in another same bag. If you are going to be flying, then your liquid and gel toiletries must fit into a 1 quart/liter-size clear resealable plastic bag, and none of the bottles can be more than 3 oz.

, If you have special supplies or equipment that you need to have with you, invest in high quality travel versions that fit into a smaller bag. Another alternative is to have these items sent ahead of you to your hotel or home stay where you can meet them later. This sometimes takes a bit of planning, but it is much easier than carting items around with you.

, Keep your hand lotion, water, sunglasses, ear plugs, snacks, lipstick (or chapstick), toothbrush, floss, hairbrush/comb, a change of underwear, pen, sticky notes, and any special medicines and necessary items you need in the top of your bag or in a separate hand bag, because you never know what may happen when you travel. Do not carry all your valuables in this bag (e.g., camera, computer, jewelry, etc.). If its stolen, you won't lose all your valuables at once.

, Keep your ID, money, credit cards, in a security pouch. Keep some small currency in your pocket for little purchases (rather than pulling out everything each time). Carry photocopies of your ID, visas, and credit cards with you but in a separate compartment from the real ones (the idea being that if you lose one, you still have the other). Copies can also be scanned and kept on a USB thumb drive (possibly encrypted). Consider 'buddy packing' where your travel partner keeps your important photocopies and you keep theirs.

, You should consider if you want your bag or suitcase to have wheels or not. They take up lots of precious packing space and add weigh to your bag. But they are also useful at maneuvering through airports and making loads feel lighter.


Be aware that, in most cities, luggage with wheels are of limited use due to the large numbers of stairways, uneven roads, sidewalk/pavements/curbs, and cobblestone streets (in Europe), etc. They can also get in the way when you are taking public transportation.
If you decide to take a trip out into the countryside, wheels are pretty much useless, because of the terrain.
An alternative is to get a lightweight, strong backpack, and ditch the wheels completely. Since you will be traveling light anyway, you will probably not miss the wheels but will appreciate the freedom of walking in any terrain, as long as you can carry the weight.

Done.

",How to Use Less Space when Packing Your Suitcase," Follow a packing list to keep you focused and to avoid adding anything that isn't needed on your trip. This will help to keep down weight and ensure more space.
, Choose several quality basics (jacket, pants, suit skirt, dress, jeans) for your travel wardrobe. Match these with some interchangeable items, such as t-shirts, lightweight skirts, shirts, cardigan, etc. Try to keep the number of clothing items around 9 to 15, all capable of being mixed and matched together, allowing you a wide range of different outfits from the base core.

Do an image search online for ""travel wardrobe""; you'll see a visual display of many mix-and-match travel wardrobes that show how to use just a few clothes to make many weeks of differing outfits. Remember––it is often easier when you're traveling, precisely because you don't have your larger at-home wardrobe confusing you!

, As much as possible, roll clothes before adding them to the suitcase. This makes the clothing more compact and it can also guard against wrinkles and creases.


Do an experiment between laying clothes out flat and packing them rolled. You'll notice the space difference immediately.

, You can experiment on how to add larger or smaller rolls in spare spaces as required. In the end, you should find that a lot more clothing fits in neatly rolled than would piled in.

, For example, tip the amount of shampoo and conditioner you need into small travel-size bottles. Remove packaging from new items; you don't need to carry that with you., The configuration used in a shoebox is good because the shoes are compact, unlike the sprawled packing of shoes shown in this image.


If your suitcase or bag has shoe holders, try to fit two pairs of shoes per holder, one thinner pair with a larger pair. This won't always work but if it does, it keeps the shoes more compact.
Take as few pairs of shoes as possible. Always prefer shoes that can do double-duty, such as night and day wear, walking and casual wear, etc. Take socks instead of slippers.

, For example, stuff things inside of your shoes, such as rolled up socks and underwear, shampoo bottles or medications.

, Vacuum-seal bags that can be done by hand can squish down fabric and soft items that you don't want taking up space. The downside is often wrinkles though, so bear that in mind before using these bags., This sounds trite but when your mind is telling you ""what if"" as you pack, you can end up with a lot of useless, excess items. Remember that a lot of things can be bought as you travel, and you can make double use of many things, such as clothes and electronic items (for example, a phone can be used as an alarm, a communications device, a time-teller, a note-keeper, a holder of scanned documents, a camera, etc.).,"

Don't take a tank and weights.,
Take a mask and snorkel.,
Use full foot fins without boots if you go mostly boat diving in warm water.,
Pack a regulator.,
Take the simplest BCD jacket you can get, without the integrated weight system.,
Pack a suit with you.,
Take a dive computer with you.,
Take a bag with you.,
Use a logbook.",How to Travel Light With Scuba Gear," These items are the heaviest, and you definitely don’t take them on the plane. Most diving centers include this equipment in the price of the organized dives. If you go diving on your own, you should definitely rent these. Consider also renting the other equipment - just take a mask and a snorkel. There can also be a big difference in the quality of the equipment the different diving centers offer. Make sure you are informed before you arrive. However most divers prefer using their own equipment.;
, You can also rent these. There are also soft foldable snorkels that even fit in the pocket of the jacket. Take a low-volume mask that fits in the foot pocket of you fins. It protects the mask and you don't have to bring a box. Replace the silicon strap with a neoprene Velcro adjustable strap, which is lighter and more comfortable. But make sure the strap is tight so water doesn't go into your mask.

, If you need foot protection, you may take a pair of neoprene socks with a larger sized fins. Carbon fins are an option, but most of them are the long type that free divers use. If you can’t do without your open heel fins, don’t use the metal spring straps. Normally, those are preferable, but the conventional ones are lighter. Don’t pull them too tight.

, Plastic is recommended, although small light weighted metal second stages do exist. The first stage is always metal. Inform what valve system they use where you go diving - DIN or yoke. It avoids having to bring an adapter. The pressure gauge can be plastic. Use the modern braided hoses - they are half the weight of the normal type and more flexible.

, The back plate has to be small. Plastic D-rings and buckles are recommended instead of metal. Take the buckle of the weight belt in plastic.

, This depends on the water temperature. If the water temperature is below 18 °C (64 °F), consider a lightweight trilaminate drysuit. Take under-protection that you can also use as “normal” clothing. Use a full wetsuit about 2 mm thinner if you use a sleeveless 3 mm vest with hood under it.

, If you don't dive too deep, you don't need it. If you do, you can buy one that is integrated in your wrist watch. Make sure the batteries are full and bring an extra pair of batteries with you. It can be expensive or impossible to change them on your destination.

, For sure no hard case. Consider taking the trolley type with you - it is handy.

, Some models are bigger than a day-to-day office agenda. Pack your license and a few empty logbook sheets.

Find a suitable space for your suitcase or travel bag and items.,
Unpack the entire case or bag.,
Go through the items that you packed.,
Decant.,
Take out the heavy reading material.,
Repack.",How to Unpack Before Traveling," If you're not already spread out in a comfortable spot, do so now by transferring your packed case or bag to a suitable spot.;
, That's right! This is to ensure that nothing you put back in the case goes back in without good reason.

, Remove the following:


Anything you have the slightest dislike of. Don't fall for the ""it might come in handy"" excuse. If you don't like it, if it's too tight/small/dark/bulky/ugly/last year, out it goes.
Anything you have never worn before, that has been sitting in your wardrobe. Adding something you've never worn before just because it might get worn on the trip is asking for space to be wasted. If you haven't already been enjoying it, why will the trip change this? If you have a valid answer, by all means include it but if not, leave it out. The only real exception is a swimsuit, as these tend to need seasonal upgrades--be sure it fits properly though.
Anything you have worn once and never worn again.
More than one evening item. When traveling, you can make one evening dress or suit work all the time.
Awkward shoes, or too many pairs of shoes. Move out what's unnecessary. Have one good pair to walk in, one pair for work meetings (if relevant), and one pair that can double as smart casual and evening. Prefer a shoe with a lot of versatility over several pairs; for example, flip flops are great for pools, beaches, sauna rooms, and slippers on the go, and they don't weigh a lot.
Heavy sweaters. If you must take one, keep it to one. It'll last and do double duty all times. Take a layered approach to warmth and you can carry less.

, Remove anything that is packed in heavy or large containers. Try to avoid carrying glass bottles or jars. Avoid taking full size shampoos, etc. If the contents are absolutely needed, transfer a small quantity to a suitable travel container.


For perfume or aftershave, take a small solid perfume stick. While it may not be your usual scent, neither is the trip your usual home and work routine.
Choose makeup items able to double duty, or avoid wearing certain makeup items altogether.

, It is a fact of travel that you will never read as much as you intend. Halve it, then halve it again. There will be reading material wherever you go (except if it's in a foreign language), and for some reason, it's always more inviting than what you've brought along anyway.

, Only this time, put back in the quantity and quality of items that you are totally positive will be used, will combine well to create varied outfits from fewer items, and that serve a real purpose for your intended trip.


If you're still stuck, have a family member or friend help you to make the decision. Just be sure it's someone who is more objective than you!
Do not put back in anything that you have never worn before, unless it is a swimsuit.
Do not put back a single thing that is impractical. Home is where impractical things belong -- when traveling you lack the space, time, and luxury to be hassled by them.
Remind yourself that extra weight is an extra burden on your ability to get around easily.

Choose an item to shrink wrap.,
Choose a type of shrink-wrapping film.,
Turn on your impulse sealer.,
Prepare your shrink-wrap film.,
Seal your item.,
Shrink the sealed film with a heat gun.",How to Shrink Wrap1," Impulse sealers are some of the most common small-scale shrink-wrapping machines available, and they easily allow you to customize the size and shape of an item to be shrink wrapped. By first choosing the item you need to shrink wrap, you can decide on other specifics.;
, The two most common shrink-wrap films are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefin. Polyolefin is more durable when it comes to wrapping items with sharp edges, and it has less of an odor when it comes to wrapping food; however, it is also more expensive.


For most jobs, PVC is still the go to film, including CDs and Blu-Rays
Depending on your specific job, you can also decide between flat rolls of film, pre-made bags in various sizes with three sides already sealed, or gauge size ranging from 60 to 100.

, An impulse sealer resembles a paper cutter that seals the shrink wrap as opposed to slicing it when you bring down the arm (though some models do also have a cutter included).Your impulse sealer will have a knob with different heat settings. The specific setting you want depends on the film type and gauge size you decided on for your item. Your film may have come with a recommended heat setting, or you can easily practice on a small piece of film to find the ideal temperature where it seals without burning., With a flat roll of film, fold the film over your item as though you’re measuring out wrapping paper to wrap a gift. Cut the film with scissors, leaving yourself plenty of room to fit the excess on the three open sides under the arm of your impulse sealer.


If you ordered pre-made bags in a suitable size for your item, then you can simply place it in the bag.

, One side at a time, place the open edges of the film onto the impulse sealer and close the arm, which will heat and seal the side.Even in models without a cutter, the heat from the seal will make it easy to tear away excess material from the sealed sides of the bag.Try to get close to the item without actually bringing it in contact with the arm on the sealer. This will lead to a clean-looking finished product after applying the heat gun, and it will also help you save on wrapping film with practice.
If you’re shrink-wrapping a product that you still need a a customer to be able to smell (such as soap), then you can use a hole punch to puncture one small piece of the sealed bag before heat shrinking., A heat gun resembles a hairdryer, but it distributes heat more evenly to the film. From several inches away, make passes over the sealed bag. The film will quickly react to the heat and shrink down to the exact size of the sealed item.Make sure you rotate the item as you pass the heat gun over it to heat the film evenly.
Using the gun too close to the film or leaving it pointed at one spot for too long can warp the film or even burn it, so ensure that you make even passes from several inches away.

Remember Why You Teach Children Packing Skills!,
Pack Ahead of Time unless you have to, pack a few days ahead of time.,
Select Appropriate Luggage.,
Help Your Child Pack Your Bags.,
Help Your Child Get Packed.,
Bring Bedding, Etc.,
What Else is Going?,
Double-Check His or Her Packing.,
Remember the Comfort Object If your young child needs his or her blankie, teddy bear, or whatever helps him or her feel secure, bring it.",How to Teach Kids How to Pack," Yes, it would be quicker and easier to just pack their things yourself. But your child will never learn to prepare, organize, and think ahead unless you teach it. This is a critical point: you will need to be patient and focus on the process as much as the actual packing.;
, This will help you be patient with a child's pace of doing things, and teach thinking ahead.

, Help locate or buy appropriate travelling gear, whether it is a backpack, suitcase, duffel bag, or rolling luggage.


Remember that a child cannot carry more than 25%-30% of his or her body weight safely.
Avoid too many pieces of luggage: the more pieces, the more is easy to lose.
If you are flying in the United States, keep in mind checked baggage often incurs a fee.

, An excellent place to start is to have your child help you pack. You can model what you need, how to organize your items, and why.


Ask questions, such as, ""If I want to go in the pool, what do I need to pack?""
Have your child check on number of items: (If you are away four days, you'll need four pairs of boxers, for instance).
Help your child with skills like folding clothing, rolling socks, and zippering.
Have fun with it! A little silliness can drive important points home...for instance, you can't pack your entire sock drawer in your bag! Maybe you need to make some choices!

, Now that you've helped model packing, your child can get set.


Ask guiding questions: ""We're going to be where it's snowy this weekend. What sweater will keep you warm?"" ""We will be gone a week. So how many outfits do you need?""
Set limits as appropriate. Let your child have some independence and freedom. However, that Batman Halloween costume is not appropriate for Cousin Jose's wedding.






Beyond clothes, consider toiletries: soap, shampoo, sunscreen, etc.







, Travelling means packing clothes, but it can also mean inflatable mattresses, sleeping bags, blankets, pillows, sports equipment, camping gear, bicycles, and anything else that's necessary.

, Children are easily bored on trips, and a little entertainment can go a long way. It may be wise to have a small bag of travelling entertainments and comfort objects. But keep a limit on things: too much become a bulky burden rather than something to do while waiting for the train.

, In all likelihood, with your guidance, your child probably has done a decent job of packing. But check that bag before you head out. Children are unpredictable. Your child might have decided suddenly, last minute, that instead of packing her best dress for going to Easter dinner, her bumblebee tap-dance costume would be better.

, Travelling is fun but can also be stressful and this isn't the time to put your foot down about the ratty stuffed bunny.

Choose an item to shrink wrap.,
Wrap your item.,
Cut off excess film.,
Use the hairdryer to seal the seam.,
Heat the film evenly to shrink it over the rest of the item.",How to Shrink Wrap2," Just as with the impulse sealer method above, you still have to choose the shrink-wrap film best suited to the job at hand. For most items at home using scissors and a blowdryer, PVC film should work fine.

, Fold the item in the film as though you were going to gift wrap it, and cut a piece of film that size from the roll. The sheet you cut should be a single piece slightly larger than what you need.

, Trim off any excess strands of shrink wrap. The film should cling tightly to the item, eliminating any air pockets and uncovered spaces.

, If the way you wrapped the item has left a seam that needs to be sealed before you can continue, use the hairdryer to heat directly along the overlap of the seam to seal the film.

, Apply heat from the hairdryer evenly around the wrap until it shrinks. If you apply it unevenly, the wrap will not shrink proportionately.


A hairdryer will require more time than a heat gun to shrink the film properly. Heat as evenly as possible.
The finished product will serve its purpose, but this method requires lots of practice to create a finished product with a look similar to using actual shrink-wrapping equipment.

Check the weather.,
Plan your itinerary.,
Pack other essential items.,
Prepare your phone and finances.,
Bring your passport.",How to Travel to Scotland1," Scotland is known for its unpredictable weather. In the summer, it might be sunny and beautiful one day and rainy the next. The winter is typically quite cold due to the northern climate. Check the weather forecast for the period of time you’ll be traveling in Scotland so you’ll have an idea of what to bring. In any season, it’s usually a good idea to bring an umbrella or rain jacket.In the winter months, you’ll want to dress warmly. Bring clothes that you can layer in case the weather varies. And be sure to pack a warm winter coat.
In the summer, you can usually dress for warmer weather with short sleeves. But you may need a light jacket for the evenings or on rainy days.;
, Once you’ve decided when you’ll be traveling to Scotland, make a list of all the places you would like to go and try to decide how long you’d like to spend in each place. Perhaps you’ll spend three days in Edinburgh, one day in Inverness, two days in the Highlands, and two days in Glasgow. Whatever you want to do, it’s up to you. But you have to decide first so that you can start searching for accommodations.Consider visiting a variety of locations in Scotland – the cities and the countryside. There are beautiful castles, breathtaking views, and a lot of history to absorb throughout the entire country.

, Consider bringing your camera, extra batteries and charging cables, phone charger, a power adaptor, and a small daytime bag to carry with you while you are out exploring. You may want to bring some of your favorite snacks, a book to read on the plane, and any bathroom accessories you can’t live without.Remember that Scotland uses the same electrical outlet style as the rest of Great Britain, so you’ll need an adaptor to plug in your electronic devices.
Some devices (like hairdryers, hair straighteners, etc.) may also require a voltage converter.

, You should call all of your banks to let them know you’ll be traveling abroad so they don’t restrict your credit card while you are in Scotland. You may also want to check about adding an international plan to your cell phone. Using your phone abroad can get quite expensive if you don’t add the international plan.Also remember that they use the Great Britain Pound (GBP) in Scotland, so you’ll need to use that currency when you are spending cash there. You can withdraw pounds from an ATM in Scotland with your debit card, or you can request some ahead of time from your local bank before you leave. Most banks can order foreign currency for a nominal fee.

, When traveling abroad, you’ll definitely need to bring your passport to gain entry in the new country. Your passport should be in good condition and, in most cases, should not expire for at least six months after you plan on leaving Scotland.


If you are a citizen of the European Union, you won’t need a visa to visit Scotland. If you are a citizen of another country, you may need a visa – though these are often simply stamps you receive in your passport as you enter the country. Be sure to check visa requirements online before you plan your trip.Keep in mind that these rules could change once the “Brexit” negotiations (which will presumably take Scotland out of the EU) are completed.

Book your flight.,
Reserve your accommodations.,
Make travel arrangements between destinations.,
Check the licensing rules if you'll be driving.",How to Travel to Scotland2," When planning a trip abroad, it’s usually best to make your arrangements at least a month or two ahead of time. This will get you a better price for your fare and give you plenty of time to plan your adventure. Search around for the best rates on websites like kayak.com that compare flights from many different sources.


You can also reach Scotland by train, bus, car, or ferry, depending on your departure destination.
If you don’t feel like making all of the arrangements yourself, you can always purchase a group package online or pay a travel agent to book all of your travel and lodgings for you.

, Search various sites online for places to stay in each location you’ll be visiting. You can check hotels, hostels, bed and breakfasts, or more modern home-away sharing sites like AirBnb. Remember to consider the location of each prospective place; for example, you might want to consider staying in the city center if you won’t have a car or don’t want to deal with the hassle of public transportation.If you’re on a budget, hostels or AirBnb might be the way to go.
If you have some extra money to spend, consider hotels in the city center, bed and breakfasts in the country, or even some more exotic accommodations like castles, lighthouses, or brochs., If you want to really see the country, you should try to visit more than just one location in Scotland. This means that you’ll need to get from place to place. In some cases, it might be easier to take a train (like if you are going from one city to another, Aberdeen to Edinburgh, for example). But much of Scotland consists of small towns separated by long stretches of beautiful countryside that trains don’t necessarily reach. You can research bus routes or consider renting a car for the duration of your stay in Scotland., As long as you have a valid driver’s license in your own country, you’ll be able to rent a car and drive in Scotland. There are no restrictions on licenses for people who have a valid driver’s license from a country in the European Union. For drivers from all other countries, you can drive in Scotland for up to 12 months with a valid driver’s license from your own country.Remember that in Scotland they drive on the left side of the road. This will take a bit of adjusting initially if you’ve never done this before.

Make the most of the cities.,
Visit some castles.,
Take in the countryside.,
Go golfing.",How to Travel to Scotland3," All of Scotland’s major cities (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness, and Aberdeen) have much to offer. There are numerous museums, monuments, and iconic historical sights to see in all of the major cities in Scotland.In Edinburgh, you can see the famous Scott Monument, Holyrood Palace, the Scottish National Gallery, the Edinburgh Castle, and the National War Museum.
In Glasgow, you can visit the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the People’s Palace, George Square, Gallery of Modern Art, or the Glasgow Botanic Gardens.

, Scotland is dotted with many famous and beautiful castles. Some are mostly just ruins of what once was, while others are still quite intact. Spend some time exploring some of these old historical monuments.Among the most famous are the Edinburgh Castle in Edinburgh, Dunnottar Castle near Aberdeen, Braemar Castle, and Balmoral Castle in the Highlands.

, Venture out into the Scottish countryside to see some of the breathtaking views the country has to offer. There are many lakes, hills, valleys, rivers, and forests to discover.


You can explore some of the many lochs (lakes) in the Highland area, including the famous Loch Ness.
You can go hiking one of the countless trails through Scottish terrain or climbing up one of the mounds (large hills)., Scotland is a very popular destination for golfing vacations and cruises. There are many famous golf courses in Scotland with spectacular views and breathtaking lodgings. Some even have available lodgings in nearby castles (like the famous St. Andrews).If you’re interested in the golf scene in Scotland, check out the Castle Course at St. Andrews, the Royal Aberdeen course, the Kingsbarns, or the PGA Centenary Course at Gleneagles."
"
Interact with the locals.,
Try the local cuisine.,
Watch some live music.",How to Travel to Scotland4," One of the best ways to experience the culture of a new place is to spend some time interacting with the locals. That way you’ll get to familiarize yourself with the Scottish accent, Scottish slang, and various other mannerisms of the locals. You can compare cultural differences and both learn something new.Scottish people are typically quite friendly and enjoy meeting new people.
Try chatting up the person sitting next to you at the bar, or consider asking the person next to you on the bus about the best activities in town.

, If you travel to Scotland, don’t eat at places that remind you of home. Be a little adventurous and try some traditional Scottish cuisine. Scotland is known for its whisky, seafood, and other meat dishes.The national dish of Scotland is haggis. This is a type of savory pudding made with sheep organs (usually heart, liver, and lungs) mixed with vegetables and spices.

, Scotland is famous for its bagpipes and traditional folk music, both of which play a huge part in Scottish culture. Take some time to listen to some live music while you are in Scotland, even if it is just a band playing a gig at a local bar.Try to attend a traditional bagpipe or folk music event while you are in Scotland.

Plan your journey in advance before you set off.,
Use the Journey Planner on the Transport for London website.,
Check travel information at each station.,
Look out for seats designated for disabled passengers.,
Getting on the tube train.,
Check that you are buying the correct ticket.,
Make sure you check which platform you are headed for is the correct one.",How to Survive Taking the London Underground," Taking the underground, particularly during the rush hour, can put you under pressure so knowing where you are going beforehand simplifies matters. If getting to your destination on time is important, planning an alternative back-up route in the event of a line going down is advisable.;
, This used to be notoriously inaccurate, but is now vastly improved. It will recommend the quickest route, tell you about any major delays and even provide you with a map of the area to print out. Using the advanced options you can specify which means of transport you are happy to take and to specify your walking speed, etc.

, The majority of London Underground stations have notice boards next to the ticket machines with reasonably up-to-date information on delays and issues on all lines, so check these for updates whenever you see one.

, When the tube trains become full all the seats are taken and standing passengers are pushed together but remember disabled travellers and pregnant women should be given theses seats. So try not to sit in them or if you do be prepared to offer them to these people. Don't wait to be asked.

, In it considered good form to wait until those leaving the train have done so before jumping on. And it actually speeds up the time the train waits at the station.

, The London Underground is broken up into six travel fare zones, with tickets priced differently and valid only within specific zones and certain times. Check which zones you are traveling in and make sure your ticket covers all of them. In addition, if you are traveling in the morning during peak time, make sure you buy a ticket valid for this period.

, For example, Euston station has six platforms for just two underground lines! This may sound complicated but it really works quite logically. Which platform you are going to will depend on which direction you are traveling in (ie. Northbound, Southbound, Eastbound or Westbound) and, occasionally, which branch you are on (the branch will usually be named after a major station on the line). Take the time to familiarize yourself with the signs at the station if you are confused.

, The Cairngorm National Park is home to the second and third highest mountains in Scotland- Ben Macdui and Braeriach. There are beautiful views from every single one of them on a good day. If you aren't a big hill-walker then there are smaller, less strenuous mountains too. Remember to take your camera to capture the undulating land of Scotland!

, Two of the most prolific are Blair and Balmoral Castle. Balmoral is actually the holiday home of the Royal Family during the summer where they roam around Ballater and visit the local church- Crathie Kirk. You can't obviously visit the castle during her stay but it is open to the public each year from early April to early August.

, As well as the Cairngorms indicating a mountain range and a national park, there is also two mountains in the Cairngorm Mountain Range with the word in it- Derry Cairngorm and Cairngorm. However, the only one with a Funicular Railway going up it is Cairngorm. The train takes you all the way to the summit where a café called the Ptarmigan Restaurant awaits you. All ages are allowed to access the train.

, The forests are just as beautiful as the hills and give a variety in length. This is a good idea if you have a big family and don't want to trek the younger of them up the mountains.

, Waltzing Waters is a stunning show in the Kingussie area where water of different shades and shapes create wonderful shadows and images before your eyes. it is a must see. Landmark is also a must-see where the kids can play and have fun. It is a forest adventure park. There are even adjoining hotels and places to stay with everything from obstacle courses and climbing walls to water slides and train rides.

, Skiing is a wonderful activity whether you have done it before or not. The variety of ski-slopes, artificial and real, are extensive. You can even go skiing on Cairngorm mountain itself! It is a very enjoyable activity and reflects the personality of the Cairngorms National Park as a whole.

Plan your trip to Edinburgh based on climate and weather issues.,
Time your trip to coincide with popular Edinburgh festivals.,

Time your trip for holiday seasons in Edinburgh.",How to Time Your Trip to Edinburgh," From its position on the North Sea, Edinburgh enjoys a moderate, temperate climate, with mild summers and winters. That means a summer trip can be a good way to see this city, and also that a winter trip won't end up keeping you inside all the time. Travel experts point out that local climate is relatively good in Edinburgh compared to some other cities at a similar latitude, for example in Moscow, a place associated with winter weather.;
, The city of Edinburgh actually has a main festival season in August. This time includes such renowned annual fixtures as the Edinburgh International Book Festival and Edinburgh Fringe, an arts event, as well as earthy celebrations like the Beltane Fire Festival. All of these can be ways to see more of this interesting and historic city.

, If you plan your trip to Edinburgh carefully, you may be able to get in a game while you're in Scotland. From football to other popular sporting events, visitors can experience much of what Edinburgh is about for locals at their sports venues.


Read up on the Hearts and Hibs. The Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian teams are both part of the Scottish Premier League in football and a major part of local culture.
Think about trying to get to a rugby or ice hockey game. These rough contact sports are also popular in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland.
Hit the links. Golf enthusiasts can play a few rounds on courses where the game has been a fixture for centuries. Golf is an authentically Scotch game, and something else that Edinburgh offers to visitors as an interesting diversion.

, Like other European Union cities, Edinburgh has a number of activities happening around traditional holidays. Going to this destination during the holidays can add more memories to your trip to Scotland.


Consider the Scottish Hogmanay New Year's celebration. Many events in Edinburgh happen around the new year, and a trip on January 1 or 2 could get you into more of the local culture around these holidays.

Visit local restaurants, cafes and bars.",How to Plan a Summer Vacation at the Beach," The accommodations will depend on which beach you go to. For quieter country towns, you may be able to get a cottage, shack, bed and breakfast, etc. right on the beachfront. However, this can be both expensive and booked out if you don't plan early enough. Plan ahead with plenty of time to spare for popular places.


If you find the accommodations unavailable within your price range, look further afield; accommodations that are within 10 to 30 minutes walking distance from the beach are generally suitable, and you'll keep fit getting to and from the beach.;
, Both exist and both will have options for staying close by. However, the crowded option will tend to be booked out faster, while the more secluded option might have fewer places to stay, and also be booked out. The trick is to book ahead in plenty of time!


City beaches tend to be crowded, while country and wilderness beaches are often a lot more secluded. Which do you prefer? Each has its different benefits.

, Some beaches have local camping grounds nearby. This can be a beautiful way to enjoy the sounds of the beach while having a very small outlay on your accommodations. Most of your fellow campers will be of the same mind as you, so you might meet some new friends too.

, This option requires finding suitable parking places but this can be a great way to move from beach to beach, right along a coastline if you want to see as much as possible.

Be aware of local regulations with respect to parking or ""freedom camping"". In many places, the more overcrowded and the more pristine place both suffer from a desire to regulate who simply chooses to hang around for no cost.

, Be sure to help out in the house and shout them a meal out now and then, to pay them back for their generosity.

, If you're really keen to get away, go to a tropical island and book a resort stay. Many such resorts have miles and miles of beachfront that is exclusive to the resort. You'll get fed and looked after too, making this the ultimate in vacation time.

, You'll need swimsuits, flip flops or sandals, shorts or skorts, large hats, t-shirts and a lightweight jacket for those rarer cooler days., This is for when you head away from the beach for a night on the town or at the local restaurants.

, You might also like to bring along some hair conditioner or even something to help lighten you hair under the power of all that sun.


Always take your sunscreen to the beach. That way, you can reapply it every few hours, as needed.

, This includes beach or picnic blankets, throws, umbrellas or beach tents and small folding chairs. Bring along whatever you like to make your ""kingdom on the sand"" that denotes your chosen spot for the day.

, This will depend on what you like to do but can include sports gear, puzzles, an e-reader or novels, tanning items, camera/movie camera, writing tools, toys, etc.

, Some beaches allow Fido to have free rein, while dogs are banned at other beaches. Find out in advance, to avoid disappointment. Fido won't appreciate being tied up at the shack all day while you're all out having fun.


If bringing your pet, pack pet supplies such as drinking bowls, toys and favorite treats.

, This can be very helpful for the person who doesn't like to focus too much on the tedium of packing; images will direct you to gather the right things swiftly, then you can get back to planning what you'll do all day at the beach.

, You can play beach volleyball, tag, ball games, running games and swimming games at the beach.

, Build a large bonfire and throw a party. Just be sure it's legal to have both a fire and alcohol at your party.

, If you are all good swimmers, have a few swimming contests. Always stay between the flags. If there are no flags or lifeguards, know the signs of rips and bad seas, and avoid them.

, Make your sandcastles as elaborate as you possibly can. Hold sandcastle competitions with friends. Take digital photos and share on Instagram and Pinterest., Try to frame the photos using palm trees, boats or other interesting elements, as miles and miles of endless sea can be a bit tedious.

, If it's a popular beach spot, it'll have a night life which you can sample as well. This will make for a busy vacation––all day on the beach, all night eating and dancing!

Know how you're going to travel.,
Have a tube map with you at all times.,
Don't look like a tourist.,
Know the busiest times.,
Have a map of the city.,
Be careful what you spend.,
Have a meeting place.,
Look for the little places.",How to Get Around London Easily," The easiest method of travel in London is the tube. For this, it is easiest to buy what is called an 'Oyster card' or a get a travelcard for all zones from one of the automated machines in a tube station. These cover buses, tubes, trams and overground trains throughout the city. This is usually the best option, especially for tourists, as you can travel as much as you'd like in one day with one flat fare.;
, If you own a smart phone, access the internet and save a copy of the tube map onto your phone. If you don't, then try to load an image to your phone from your PC before you go. You can pick up paper maps for free from the stations, but holding a large map is impractical and shows you are unfamiliar with the city and therefore puts you at a greater risk to pickpockets.

, Tourists are usually the ones that get targeted by thieves. If you take a camera, make it a small one instead of a large SLR. Avoid bumbags (called fanny packs in other parts of the world) at all costs and try to put your belongings into a more casual bag instead of a backpack. Messenger bags are often the best option as they cross over your body and you can easily have it in your sight at all times.

, The streets and transport get incredibly busy at peak times, so try to avoid these. Although London is always busy, weekdays between 9 and 5 are usually calmer than weekends and the rush hour, and therefore make it easier for tourists.

, Again, it is usually most practical to have one of these on your phone is possible (if you have GPS that is even better as it can tell you exactly where you are and where you need to go) as London has winding streets that are not in a regular grid pattern as in cities such as New York. In the centre of the city and near the largest attractions there are sometimes people wearing bright coloured t shirts that are from companies that offer free directions and information to tourists. If you are lost and can see one of these people, don't hesitate to ask, it's better than being lost! They have maps and great knowledge of the city and are a great help.

, London is a great city to find deals, but it is very easy to get carried away. Paying in cash is never wise as cash is easier to steal than a credit or debit card, so keep tabs on what you're spending during your visit. Withdraw small amounts of cash for each day and don't go over budget, especially if you're buying souvenirs or shopping somewhere like Oxford Street. Many of the biggest attractions in London are free (Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square, the Tate Modern, and a number of museums) so take advantage of these wherever possible.

, If you're travelling in a group, know where to meet if you get separated. Make sure all members of your group have a phone with them and never let one person who is unfamiliar with London walk around on their own for very long. If you are travelling with children, no matter how mature they think they are, you should hold on to them at all times. In large crowd it is easy to get separated. Have an action plan if they don't manage to get off at the right tube stop. The usual method is to have them get off at the next stop and wait for you on the platform, whilst you wait for the next train which is never more than a few minutes away.

, It is very tempting to just see all the big attractions in London during your visit, but there are thousands of small shops, restaurants and parks that are hidden treasures of the city. They are always less busy than the large tourist attractions and give you a real feel of London.

Plan Your Itinerary.,
Take Safety Into Account.",How to Fit in when Visiting London,"


Remember that you're a guest in their city. Don't come across as the clamorous tourist. Try to keep your voice at a reasonable volume and refrain from drawing attention to yourself by making arrogant demands or complaining about how things are different from what you're used to.
Appreciate your situation. You're in a unique country with a vital and rich heritage that's quite different from your own. Don't expect things to be like they are in your own country. You'll find you'll be thrown a curveball fairly often, possibly when ordering from a menu or when you attempt to ""walk in"" for a pedicure. Take these things in stride and enjoy the cultural differences.
Good manners are part and parcel of British culture. ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" will go a long way. If you bump into someone on the street, do apologise. And for goodness sake, don't cut in front of anyone in line (also known as a queue)!;
,


Be prepared for diversity. As the heart of the British Empire, London saw huge immigration from the Caribbean, India and parts of the Middle East at the turn of the 20th Century, continuing right up to the modern day. Such was the scale of the influx that many people managed to retain their language and accents over the generations: two ostensibly Indian people talking in their own language in a corner shop could be born and bred in England of parents themselves born and bred in England. In London, more so than any other part of England, stereotypes of what constitutes ""English-ness"" break down, so be careful not to make simple assumptions about where someone is from. For example, over 350 languages are spoken around London (100 more than in New York) and Black and Asian children outnumber White children in London by 2 to 1. Similarly, there is a huge range of religions, from the typical to the odd, the agnostic to the devout and even fundamentalist. A single carriage on the tube, containing only English citizens, can often contain within it a dizzying number of cultures. In recent times new immigrants have begun to arrive from Eastern Europe and China (not to mention tourists!). London truly is a world capital
Don't be intimidated by Londoners' reserved nature. Like the denizens of any other fast-paced city, Londoners have fast-paced lives and are pretty focused on what they're doing and where they're going. They can be quite reserved. You may find a Londoner looking askance at you if you offer up too much personal information at first meeting. It may be difficult for emotionally expressive visitors to read a Londoner. They can be extremely helpful--just don't expect one to strike up conversation on the Tube with complete strangers. Take your time and don't delve into your life story and personal problems for oh, say, at least 15 minutes after meeting. Once a good level of familiarity has been established, British restraint becomes less formidable.
If possible, make some social contacts before arriving in the city (the Internet is a wonderful way to do this). This way you'll make some new friends before even leaving and with your new friends you'll be able to experience London from an actual Londoner's vantage point. And while Londoners are busy as they go about their daily lives, many are extremely social and great about meeting up for dinner or drinks or even showing visitors their London.
Cosy up to many Londoners' wonderfully dry and self deprecating sense of humour. They've elevated understatement to an art form. Caught in the rain and soaked to the skin? You're a bit damp, bless.

,



Women: London women in general dress in casual clothes, jeans are very common. Of course they may need to dress up for work but off duty casual is the rule.

Men: London, men, too are casual in dress. Jeans, sweaters and the like. Like women they may need to dress up for the office - suits are the norm in many such. Even when going to such ""posh"" places as the Royal Opera House you will fit in in casual wear. The only exception being on gala nights (when the prices are sky high).

If you're crossing the pond from America to England, you will encounter lots of words used for items for which Americans associate completely different meanings. You don't take the ""elevator""; You take the ""lift"". It's your ""mobile""; not your ""cell phone."" You ask the location of ""the toilets"", ""loos"", ""ladies'"" or ""gents'"", not ""the restroom"". The ""tube"" or the ""underground"", not the ""subway"". ""Subway"" is what Londoners call a walkway under the street to get from one side to the other, or a fast food chain. Wikipedia has a large list of British terms that are largely uncommon in American English which can be found here.
Give unfamiliar phrases the benefit of the doubt. Take into account cockney rhyming slang. Not that many people use cockney slang, but occasionally someone will. Ask them to explain and have a sense of humour when they do.
Brace yourself for a variety of accents. With the advent of the European Union, London is now home to people from all over Europe, not just the UK. The sheer number and variety of accents will blow your mind! If you have trouble understanding someone, you could always smile and nod but usually it's better to ask someone to repeat something. And this is done by saying ""Pardon me?"" not, ""What?"" which can be construed as impolite. However, as Nancy Mitford has pointed out, saying ""Pardon"" instead of ""What?"" may mark one as working class. Try saying ""Sorry?"" and engaging the conversation more with your head. Cultures are complicated.
Whatever you do, do not fake an English accent. It is very discourteous, and the natives can spot it instantly.

,



Maps While there are many tourist maps on sale, the best thing to buy is the the small (or ""mini"") London A-Z (pronounced A to Zed) which is a pocket sized atlas with maps of London extending roughly 7 miles (11 km) out from the city centre in every direction. Crucially, it also has an index of every single road, street, lane and square in the city, so you can always find where you are on the map. As if this was not enough, it also has maps of the London Underground and other useful information. There is a large version available as well, which extends 16 miles (26 km) out, but this is of little use unless you plan on visiting the suburbs. Maps are also displayed at all stations, and on most bus shelters and bus stops (the red letter on top of a bus stop sign shows you where you are on the map).
When asking for directions, don't truncate street or place names. It may be normal in the US to refer to Madison Street as Madison, but that's not the norm in the UK. And it can get confusing, as many streets and places share their names with other English towns and cities. For example, if your hotel is near Liverpool Street (a major railway station in the City of London) and you ask for directions to Liverpool, you may be directed to the City of Liverpool, home of the Beatles (and remember many tourists do want to visit Liverpool). The same is true of Gloucester (Road), Leicester (Square), Oxford (Street/Circus), Lancaster (Gate) and even Buckingham (Palace).
Neighbourhoods. London is broken up into dozens of areas called boroughs. Chelsea, Kensington and Knightsbridge offer great shopping and lovely cafés, wine bars and pubs. Soho, Shoreditch, Camden and Clerkenwell offer amazing night-life. St. John's Wood, Maida Vale and Primrose Hill are quiet, residential areas. Covent Garden, the South Bank and the West End offer loads of street performers, theatres, bars and restaurants.
Public Transport. London has one of the most extensive (and expensive) public transportation (public transport, as it is termed in the UK) systems in the world.

The London Underground (also referred to as the Tube) in particular is easy to understand if you speak English. Buy an Oyster card at any Tube station. Seven day's unlimited travel on the Tube and/or buses within zones 1 and 2 will cost you a reasonable flat rate. If you'd like to find out if any lines are not running or if a station has been temporarily shut down, visit the London Underground website for up-to-the minute information. When in the stations, be aware that the left-hand side of the escalators is for people walking only: if you don't plan on walking up or down the escalators, stay on the right-hand side.
Always check the current system failures and line closures when entering a station - those are frequent and could force a reroute. Be aware that in the summer there is no air conditioning on the Underground except on the Metropolitan line and on the newer trains on the Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines.
The DLR (an acronym for Docklands Light Railway) is another metro system in London which serves the Docklands, the East End and the City of London. Its trains, which are lighter than Underground trains, are driverless - their movement from station to station is controlled by a computer. Unlike the Underground, the system is mostly above ground, with only 4 stations being underground.
There are two types of taxis - Black Cabs and minicabs. Black Cabs are the traditional, familiar looking London taxis, though not all Black Cabs are actually black these days. Black Cabs tend to be the more expensive option and this is because London Black Cab drivers' fares are regulated. A Black Cab, known legally as a ""Hackney Carriage"", can pick up passengers from a taxi rank or when flagged down anywhere on the street. After hailing a Black Cab, tell the driver through the passenger-side window where you'd like to go, then get into the back of the cab. After you reach your destination, get out of the cab and pay the driver through the passengers' window. A modest tip is appreciated, typically by rounding up the fare to make cash payment convenient and fast.
The alternative, the minicab, must always be booked in advance, and will almost always cost less than a Black Cab for longer journeys. The saving achieved by using a pre-booked cab can be substantial, particularly for a long journey such as a transfer to or from the airport. Minicabs can be identified by a prominent TfL (Transport for London) ""Private Hire"" sticker on the rear windscreen and an identification license from the Public Carriage Office inside. Minicab companies typically operate 24-7, and their telephone numbers can be found in the Yellow Pages. An increasing number of minicab companies accept web-based bookings (either through their own websites or the increasing number of online cab booking portals now available), making it particularly convenient for the overseas traveller to book a trip before even arriving in London.
Like many major cities, London has a ferociously-busy rush hour, running from about 8am to 9.30am and then again at about 4.30pm to 6pm. Avoid travelling during these times if you can, and if you must travel during rush hour, it's best to be travelling against the flow of traffic - out of London during the morning rush hour, or into it during the evening rush hour. The trains, tube and buses are usually extremely cramped, slow and unpleasant during rush hour.

Restaurants in London are diverse, and rival those of some great American cities like New York and San Francisco. If you stick to British restaurants you're sure to find English ingredients like lamb shank on most menus. Restaurants of this calibre are a relatively new phenomenon and their standards have yet to trickle down to most mid-ranged eateries.
If you like ethnic food, London is the place to be. The choices are incredible - everything from street-corner kebab take-away to some of the finest Indian restaurants. Queensway is a great street to check out for everything from Moroccan to Afghan cuisine. Edgware Road is famous for its middle eastern cuisine. For Chinese food look no further than Chinatown in Soho.
Weekend brunch is very popular in London and provides a great opportunity to check out different areas. It will also save you some cash as brunch is always cheaper than dinner. There are some great blogs that give you insider tips on where to brunch such as londonbrunchreviewsbyarea.blogspot.com and londonreviewofbreakfasts.blogspot.com.
It's not uncommon to wait several minutes for a member of staff to acknowledge you. Only at the best restaurants will the staff conscientiously check on you to find out if you need anything. More than likely you'll place your order, get your food and then have to flag someone down to get your bill or anything else you might like. If you request water with your meal, bear in mind that you'll most likely be paying for a bottle of water unless you ask specifically for tap water.
A 10% tip for good service - and only for good service - is the general rule. Be sure to check your bill because a gratuity might already be included, typically itemized as a Service Charge. If you'll be eating regularly at a particular restaurant or café, be generous. They'll remember you for it and treat you accordingly.
It's a good rule of thumb to check your dining bill, as you should in any restaurant. Waiting staff are not beyond making mistakes.
Free refills are uncommon. To Americans every restaurant has free soda refills and it's considered unusual for refills to not be free. However in London it's exactly the opposite. The majority of restaurants will bring you a bottle/can of soda which isn't refillable. Some restaurants such as Pizza Hut or Harvesters do have free refills but the majority don't.
The term ""Soda"" is not used for soft drinks (there is baking soda and soda crystals which are used for cleaning). You need to name the drink you want, such as ""Pepsi"" or ""7-Up"" or cola.

Still/ soft drinks to try include Ribena, J20, Oasis and various fruit and coconut drinks.

The London Eye can provide an excellent view of Central London. It's particularly attractive at sunset.
The Thames: London is built on the Thames. On both sides of the river you're bombarded by attractions of historical, artistic, architectural and political significance - Big Ben, the houses of Parliament, the London Eye, Tate Modern, Tower Bridge and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre - to name a few.

The museums in London are some of the best in the world and, with the exception of special exhibitions, are free to the public. The Victoria and Albert Museum in Knightsbridge is packed full of articles used in everyday life in England going back thousands of years.
Seeing a show in London is an absolute must! Everything is concentrated in the West End, Theatreland runs neck-and-neck with the Great White Way. And while the large shows attract most of the tourists, locals know to look for productions by long established theatre companies like The Old Vic. For cheap theatre tickets be sure to check out the TKTS booth (the most known one is situated in Leicester Square).
Take advantage of the amazing music scene in London. It's a wonderful opportunity to see up-and-coming Brit bands before they explode in the US. Camden and London's trendy East End are great places to start.
In need of a workout? London parks and green spaces are some of the best in the world. Join other Londoners for an evening run or a bit of exercise at Regent's Park, Primrose Hill, Kensington Park or Hyde Park. Each provides excellent paths and beautiful scenery.
London has some of the finest shops in Europe. Considered among many as the fashion capital of Europe. Make sure you take the opportunity to browse some of the high end boutiques. Many can be found in Bond Street, Regent's Street and Knightsbridge. Dover Street market in Mayfair is particularly famous in the London fashion circles.

When travelling on the Tube or walking around busy places, be alert. Keep your handbag and other possessions securely with you. You will be warned by signage about pickpockets in the tourist-heavy areas. You can have your backpack taken or rifled and the pickpocket can be out of sight before you even notice, so be very aware. However, there is no need to be scared -- it is generally safe to use public transport and walk around at night.
Never leave your handbag on the seat next you on the tube or in a restaurant or outdoor café. Also, if you hang your coat on a coat rack in a restaurant, be sure you didn't leave anything valuable in your coat pockets, like your mobile phone.
Always be aware of your surroundings and act accordingly. Don't rummage through your handbag or count the money in your wallet when you're riding the Tube or standing in the street.
If you stray off the beaten track chances are you will stray into a more rough and deprived area than the more tourist-friendly parts. Keep your wits about you.

The South Bank was, until comparatively recently, outside the purview of the London police. It has always been more anarchic than the north side as a result. A glance at historical maps shows that this was the site of the original Globe (and its modern reconstruction), bear pits, taverns, flesh pots and so on. It's a lot more salubrious these days but retains its bohemian heritage as it is home to the Tate Modern Gallery, the Royal Festival Hall, The national Film Theatre, County Hall (home of the now defunct GLC), the Globe and the nice but crowded Borough Market. A wander along the South Bank is definitely worth it.;
, All the major museums and art galleries are free to enter, but they do solicit donations in order to try to keep them that way. Give what you can. This helps to make London one of the most culturally democratic cities in the world. One highlight is Holbein's ""The Ambassadors"" in the National Gallery, but with four major galleries and countless smaller ones there is something for everyone. The Big Three museums are in Kensington: the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museum. Each one of these could easily take up to a day to explore, depending on your level of interest, so glance at the websites first if possible and plan your visit if time is tight. The British Museum is near Russell Square. It is large and proverbially quite eclectic (in Artificial Intelligence circles the British Museum search is one which tries each and every path and has no information to help it navigate - you may feel this way after a while in there.)

, This is a note for visitors to our fair city: In Zone one in particular, many of the tube stations are quite close together. The tube map is schematic - that is, the distance between stations is not to scale. This makes for a wonderful piece of draughtsmanship but doesn't tell you how far you're traveling. You can get an ""Overground/Underground"" map in some vending machines on some tube platforms (mainly the ones at mainline stations). These are great for showing alternate walking routes. Or better still, invest in the Londoner's choice: the A-Z. The more dog eared and scribbled on the better! If your feet really are giving out, try the buses. With an Oyster card, fares are very cheap indeed and you get to see the sights. Taking one of the routes that crosses any of the bridges is great fun - especially on the top deck of a double decker. Try the 188, 168 or 68 from Russell Square (by the British Museum) to Waterloo (handy for the South Bank), for a great view from Waterloo Bridge. It's not free, but it's £1.20 with an Oyster at the time of writing!

, You can walk from Westminster to Knightsbrige almost entirely on grass, thanks to the swathe of parks that cover a large section of central London. These are a restful haven from the rest of the busy, often commercial, city. There are plenty of things to see and do - see the Royal Parks website for maps and guides. Speaker's corner in Hyde Park is particularly entertaining, and will banish forever your view of London as a reserved city. In the north of the city, near Euston, you can find Regent's park - small but very nice, with a well laid out English garden.

, London is home to a number of institutions: the Royal Society (of science), the Royal Society of Art, the Dana Centre. Quite often these hold free talks by distinguished and/or entertaining speakers. The British library holds free exhibitions which can be very interesting. See websites of the respective institutions for details.

, Many BBC radio and TV programs need a live audience. Search the BBC website for audience tickets and fill in the order form. Tickets are free and cover everything from music to comedy.

, The Royal Festival Hall often has music in their foyer - see their website for details. The National Theatre has a free pre-theatre musical performance most evenings. Many churches also have chamber music or choral events that may not be free but that are accessible for a charitable donation. Looks for free gigs in pubs. Search Time Out London for more details.

, There are many street performers there that can keep you entertained for a while.

, many of the Capitals museums are free such as the National Maritime museum at Greenwich. Don't forget to climb up Greenwich Hill to see the Royal Observatory Time Ball rise and fall just before 13-00 and take your picnic with you as it is all free. Then on to The Imperial War Museum on South Bank (behind the London Eye) Again most of it for free (if you don't do the special exhibits). Then there are the 3 museums at South Kensington. Natural History, National Geology and the Science Museum. Again all free! Don't do the add on paid for bits or purchase food in there as this is where they mark up and make their money!

If you prefer a simple countryside holiday, then there are plenty of cottages or big country houses you can book. Country houses are popular for a big family event and some can hold up to around 30 people depending on the size. Cottages on the other hand, are nice for either a small family or a couple.
You can enjoy the urban city lifestyle with the variety of hotels. It is great to book your place in a hotel with a penthouse view over the city. This option is convenient if you want to explore downtown and are more of a shopper than a hill-climber or sporty person.
The coastal beach-houses and hotels are also great alternatives if you prefer the salty smell of the sea and the beach entertainment. Aberdeen is an especially popular seaside city with plenty of these types of accommodation.;
, Binoculars are a great way to spot wildlife and maps are almost essential to find your way around the majestic hills or tranquil forests. Sun cream is obligatory in the heart of summer just as warm clothes are in the height of winter. Remember to take a camera to either capture the stunning landscapes or to take pictures of you and your family.

, Airports are present in the main cities and some other places and they are taxis waiting both at these airports and train stations. Many Scottish coach trips are on offer and a car journey is an alternative choice. However, due to the inconsistent weather conditions, you can never rely on Scottish transport as there is always a chance a vehicle might get snowed in or a car creating chaos on an icy road!

, Scotland is very inconsistent in this way and it is best to watch the daily weather reports every day to plan ahead for what you would like to do. One day the sun is shining as bright as ever and the next you have endless torrential rain!

, Scotland has many delicious restaurants and cafes in different locations. Seafood can be a popular menu item like steaks are and Scottish classics like soup, haggis, potatoes, fudge tablet and ice-cream are all present but maybe not all in one dish together! Taste the Scottish cuisine beforehand to be sure that it is too your taste and for most people, it usually is!

, Although Scotland is a relatively small country with the population less than that of London, it is a great country for sport and many different types of it too. Swimming, football, judo, rugby and athletics are all members of a large collection of popular sports. Football is probably the one that most people watch or take part in and there is a variety of stadiums all over Scotland, some with a capacity of up to 60,000 people. Swimming pools are very prominent too and many have the best facilities and equipment to use.

, Whether you would rather scale the rocky mountains or stroll the tranquil forests, the countryside is for everyone. There are many little trails for children and families too with adventures and hunts along the way. For an older or more experienced family or group of trekkers, you can have a go at walking some of the larger-scale walks which can be a holiday in themselves or climb some of Scotland's largest mountains such as Ben Nevis, Ben Macdui and Braeriach, all of which are over 4000ft by a great margin and in the top three highest hills in Scotland.

, There are many different tourist attractions on offer in Scotland for all moods, personalities and ages:


Try out some water sports on Scotland's endless supply of lochs. Some of the most famous lochs to visit are Loch Lomond, Loch Arkaig and Loch Ness. Kayaking and canoeing are popular activities on these lochs and great fun for all of the family.
Visit the castles and battlefields. These take you right back in time when there were countless armies roaming the undulating land of Scotland and battles and independence being fought for. The most famous of these is probably the Bannockburn Battlefield and castles such as Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle and Dunnottar Castle.
Take a look at the supply of theme parks and adventure parks. These are great for the kids and include everything from the Blair Drummond Safari Park out in the countryside to the Codona's Theme Park at the Aberdeen Beach.
Visit the museums and information centres. Every city and town in Scotland has some sort of gallery or museum. If you are interested in anything from art to wildlife then you will love going round these attractions. Most have some sort of interactive theme for the children too so you don't feel as if you are dragging them around with you.
Spend time in the city centres and find high-street brands known all over the world and other local businesses. Local bakeries and craft shops are very common in Scotland and are always worth a visit, especially for the keen tourist. The shopping centres are very extensive and in multiple numbers.

, While doing this you might find yourself visiting places in the Scottish islands like beautiful Skye which holds a lot of Scotland's best-kept historical treasures. The castles and battlefields are some of the best places to find Scottish history but everywhere you look, there will be a plaque somewhere or a building commemorating something that a Scot or a group of Scots did.

, Scotland will always be there again tomorrow with the hills waiting for you, the cities luring you to their shops and the countryside beckoning you to have a walk with it. Make the most out of your journey and let it become a possibility for further holidays and visits.

Use an online latitude/longitude finder.,
Use Google Maps.,
Use a real map.,
Use the North Star and a compass.,
Use an astrolabe.",How to Find Your Latitude," If you search ""how to find your latitude,"" several web sites that can help you find your latitude and longitude will come up. The only information these sites will require is the exact address where you're located, and you'll find out your latitude within seconds. The NASA web site is particularly nifty; once you type in your address, you'll be able to move your mouse right around the area where you live to track the subtle changes in latitude and longitude. Make sure to use a free site that doesn't ask for any financial information., You can also find your latitude quickly just by using Google Maps. Here's all you have to do:Go to Google Maps.
Type in your address.
Double click on your address and select ""What's here?""
Read your latitude and longitude. You'll be given your latitude first.

, That's right, there was a time when all maps did not have the word ""Google"" in front of them. You can find your latitude by opening up a map (all right, you can find a map online, too) and then finding your location on it. Though this won't be nearly as accurate as typing in your exact address online, you can still get a pretty sound measurement of your latitude if you know how to read a map. The latitude on a map runs horizontally, while the longitude runs vertically. Find your location and use a ruler or another flat-edged object to create a straight line from that location to the nearest latitude (horizontal) marker. That's how you can find your latitude.

, Though this is longer method for finding your latitude, it can be exciting to use your scientific skills to determine your location. Here's what you'll need to do:Find the Big Dipper. This constellation is also known as Ursa Major, or the Plough, and looks like a big spoon.
Find the back of the ""Plough blade."" This is the outermost part of the dipper, which is the furthest away from the handle of the spoon.
Move four blade lengths along from the back of the blade to find the North Star. You can use the constellation of Cassiopeia, the sitting queen who resembles a ""W,"" which is an equal distance from the North Star. The position of this star never changes.
Use the sight line that's on top of the aiming beam to align the beam and the North Star.
Take a protractor and measure the angle between the beam and the horizon, which should measure 90º to the plumb line. This is your latitude.

, If you have an astrolabe handy, then all you have to do is lie as close to the ground as possible and find the North Star (use the guidelines in Step 4 for help.) Use your astrolabe to find the altitude of the North Star and write it down. This is your zenith angle. Then, subtract this angle from 90 degrees to get your latitude. That's it.Though using an astrolabe may certainly not be the easiest way to find your latitude, it may be the most fun! You can make your own astrolabe using only a protractor, plastic straw, metal weight, and a piece of string. Just tie one end of the string to the hole in the middle of the protractor and place the weight on the other end of the string. Now, all you have to do is tape the straw along the flat edge of the protractor and you're all set.

Be eccentric!",How to Dress Like a Londoner," The wonderful thing about a big city is that you can pretty much wear whatever. There is no one certain 'look' or niche that you need to adhere to. This independent attitude is crucial.;
, Trends pick up quickly from the NME and Indie music. Particularly for guys, usually the cover of NME and the hyped up London bands are a sure cert fashion pointer.

, Love her or hate her she is, to a certain extent the doyenne of London fashion. She epitomizes 'how to dress like a Londoner': confident, apparently effort free, and with a strong rock n roll influence.

, If you are dressing pretty scruffy the rest of you shouldn't be. Overdone makeup - unless making a theatrical statement like Amy Winehouse or Lily Allen's neon eyes - is a no-no, however good grooming is essential. Less is more. Think fresh skin - pale or tanned - with lightly smudged black kohl or just a slick of mascara, and lipbalm. Alternatively a bare face with bright red or pink lipstick.

, Hair should be in good condition but with a 'just rolled out of bed' vibe. It should look natural, not colourfully dyed or straightened to death - think La Moss/Sienna Miller.

, Quirky accessories & outfits are central to London style. Don't be shy, and embrace the London high street fashion wear.

Flip the shirt over so it’s facing upward and place it in a plastic bag.,
Seal the bag by either zip locking or folding the top over.","How to Fold Pants, Suits, and a Shirt to Go in a Suitcase"," Home and bath stores typically carry a variety of storage type bags like this. Otherwise, check with the local suit store or online for larger clothing bags.


Buy several bags to accommodate more than one suit and shirts. Your shirts and suit will be different sizes once folded, so you don’t want a bag that is too big or too small.






Check each bag to ensure that it doesn’t have any holes or rips. The bag needs to be airtight when you seal your clothing, so a pristine bag is important.






Reuse bags several times. Retire the bag once it begins to show wear and tear––a ripped or worn bag can compromise the integrity of your clothing.





;
,, Make sure you can smooth the jacket along the surface and that no bumps or other obstructions will wrinkle the jacket.


Smooth the back of the jacket with clean hands to remove any wrinkles or bumps. Pick off any lint or loose strings from jacket to ensure that it packs totally clean.

, Fold the jacket the same way you would fold a t-shirt, by first taking the left side and folding it lengthwise inward, approximately 2 inches (5cm). Perform the same step for the right side.


Fold the sleeve along the folded jacket lines. Fold the sleeve over the jacket and then back, so that it lines the jacket fold. The sleeve should be in line with the fold on each side of the jacket.






Smooth the jacket sleeves downward to remove any wrinkles. Leave the jacket in this position on the table.







, Make sure the pants are clean and do not have any items in the pockets.


Lay the pants on the table and fold them in half again. Be sure you fold the pants end to end in order to form a square.







, Carefully lift the pants from the table and gingerly lay the pants on top of the jacket.


Place the pants on top of the jacket, toward the neck or top area. Make sure the jacket and pants are the same size, width-wise to create an even line.







, This will create a neat package with the pants situated inside the jacket.


Turn the jacket over so that the front is facing upward. Carefully remove any debris, loose strings or dust.







, Make sure you select a bag size that will accommodate the clothing so compare different bag sizes before selecting your bag.


Slide the suit package inside the bag so that the bottom of the suit is sitting at the bottom of the bag.
Seal the bag but be sure to trap a considerable amount of air inside. Test to make sure that air is inside the bag by pressing on the bag after you’ve sealed it. Keeping air trapped inside the bag will keep your suit wrinkle-free.







, Inspect both sides to make sure the shirt is free from lint, dust or loose strings.


Lay your dress shirt on a clean hard surface, facing downward. Smooth the shirt using clean hands to remove any wrinkles or debris.







, Instead of folding the arms inward, as you would a t-shirt, take a more complex approach to minimize any wrinkling.


Lay one shirt arm across the back of the shirt so that the end of the sleeve touches the opposite shoulder of the shirt. Use your opposite hand as a guide by laying the side of your hand near the armpit area of the shirt.






Lay your hand alongside the middle of the sleeve and fold the sleeve upward, toward the shirt neck.






Fold the top of the sleeve, near the neck of the shirt backwards to create a small square.






Repeat this step with the other sleeve.

, Smooth the shirt lines as you fold.

, Then fold the shirt again in half until you have created a small square.

, Make sure the shirt is free from debris or lint before sliding it into the bag.

, Shirts are not as vulnerable to wrinkling in transit once you’ve folded and packaged them properly. Now you should be set.

Look for a major chain.,
Locate a library.,
Try local transportation hubs.,
Sit in a hotel lobby.,
Check an app.,
Ask for the password.",How to Find Free WiFi when You Travel1," Apple Stores, Starbucks, and McDonald's are some international chains that are known for having truly free wifi, meaning you don’t need to buy anything to get access to the network. Locate major international chains in whatever place you visit and check to see if they have free wifi.You may also want to try retailers such as clothing stores, which often provide free wifi so that people can shop online as well as in-store.
If you find free wifi at a cafe or restaurant chain, try finding a bench near the building or a seat outside. If you simply sit down without ordering in the restaurant, you may be asked to leave or otherwise be expected to buy food or drink.;
, Libraries around the world are the go-to place for those who need internet access. You can generally get on the internet for free, though it may only be for a fixed amount of time depending upon the place.If the internet requires you to have a library card or identification number to log on, ask a librarian if there is an access code for guests. Explain that you are visiting the city and thus do not have or need a library card for that area.

, Transit stations such as train stations, airports, and even major bus terminals are increasingly making wifi available to the public. Check local transportation hubs to see if they offer free wifi.Many airports offer limited free wifi. Often, you will be able to get half an hour to two hours of access for free, but you may have to pay for anything beyond that.
Stay in the lobby and lounge areas to avoid arousing any suspicions. Trying to make your way back to a platform or gate and lingering may cause security concerns depending upon your location.
If you are looking for wifi while driving a long-haul trip, try stopping at major truck stops, which often offer free wifi.

, Many hotels offer free wifi throughout their lobbies and in their bars and restaurants. Look for hotels with conference centers or near convention centers, as these are more likely to have wifi that is open to people not staying in the hotel.Try to avoid posing a guest or entering a random room number to get access to wifi, as this could incur charges for the individual actually staying in that room.
Look to see if wifi is included when you book your own hotel to make sure you always have a place to connect.

, There are a number of apps out there that can help you find wifi hotspots anywhere in the world. Some, such as Wi-Fi Finder, work both online and offline, while others may require you to use data to locate a hotspot.


Some apps are more developed for certain regions. Research different hotspot locating apps to find out which ones have the best databases in the areas in which you will travel.

, Many places offer free wifi, but you will need to ask someone to obtain a password. Check with the front desk or someone working in the area if a password is required for a wifi network that you've found.


Know that some places, such as restaurants, may only offer wifi passwords to paying customers.

Take a train.,
Go for a bus ride.,
Call your cable company.,
Check with your airline.",How to Find Free WiFi when You Travel2," Increasingly, train companies around the world offer wifi included in your ticket. If you are looking to stay connected at no additional cost while on the move, consider taking a train or getting a rail pass to make sure you have internet access.Many trains across the United States, Europe, and Eastern Asia currently offer wifi included in the price of their ticket. Check your specific train route to see if wifi is available before booking.

, Like trains, many bus services such as Megabusand Greyhoundoffer wifi while on the move. Consider taking the bus for short trips or multi-stop trips to keep yourself connected while you travel.


While major bus services often offer wifi, local partners may not. Check when you book your ticket to see what company will actually be operating the bus and if they offer wifi.

, Some cable companies and mobile carriers, such as Comcast and Sprint in the US, offer access to wifi hotspots around the country, including in areas such as airports and ferry stations. Check with your current providers to see if they offer free connections anywhere.Some internet providers make apps so that you can locate nearby free hotspots. Download your provider’s app, if available, to make finding wifi on-the-go easier.

, If you are flying, check with your airline to see if wifi will be available on your flight. Some airlines offer complimentary wifi on certain flights, while others might have limited wifi so that you can access their entertainment options for free, but pay for additional internet use.


Look online or check your confirmation when you book a ticket to see if wifi will be offered as a part of your flight.
If wifi is available, check online or call the airline to see if they offer free unlimited wifi, or if free access is only granted for certain things.

Tether your smartphone.,
Check in with a tourist office.,
Ask around.",How to Find Free WiFi when You Travel3," While not technically free wifi as it eats into your mobile data plan, if you need wifi in a place where other options can’t be found, you can generally tether your smartphone to other devices. This allows your phone to share its data so that you can get some form of internet access.If you do not have an unlimited data plan, tethering can start to add additional charges rather quickly. It is thus advisable to rely on tethering as a last resort unless you have an unlimited plan.
Some smartphones may also have a function that allows them to be turned into mobile hotspots, eliminating the need to physically connect your phone to the other device.

, Rugged locations often have lodges, base camps, or tourist offices that offer limited wifi access. It is generally enough to check email, though likely not enough to stream video. However, it can sometimes be the only option in more rural destinations.Employees at the office or lodge may be able to assist you in finding places such as internet cafes where you can purchase internet access affordably if the provided wifi does not suffice.

, If you are in an area that does not have many of the spots where one can typically find free wifi, one of the best things you can do is simply to ask. Kindly ask a local business owner or someone on a smart device, “Would you happen to know of any free wifi hotspots in the area?”Try to avoid asking others directly to use their private network unless it is an emergency. This may come off as rude or off-putting depending upon where you travel.

Make a list.,
Pick out your bags.,
Pack it all up the day before your trip.,
Recharge all your essential devices.,
Pack your carry on.,
Weigh your suitcases.,
Take care of last-minute items.",How to Pack Smartly for a Plane Trip," You can use a generated list to make things easier. You fill out where you're going, what the temperature is going to be around, who you will be traveling with, and what size suitcase you will bring, then it creates a packing list for you. Search online or use an app for such a generated list.You could copy-and-paste this into a word document then changing it to meet your needs. Remember, the less you pack, the better. If you're not using a generated list, here are the basics:


Toiletries. You don't need everything (hotels have shampoo and the like), but bring your toothbrush and more personal items like deodorant.
Medications. Bring any prescription medications, and don't forget any occasional medicines you personally use, like ibuprofen or Claritin.
Clothes. Try to bring versatile clothes, like pants that match multiple shirts. Don't forget enough underwear and socks.
Specialty items. Are you going swimming? Hiking? Pack any items you need for activities like these.;
, By picking two smaller bags (ie. a roller bag that can fit in the overhead bins and a backpack for under the seat) you eliminate having to check any luggage at all, and that also eliminates lost luggage and finding luggage at the baggage claim! However, if you are unable to carry-on your suitcase, some important things to remember are:


Most airlines charge per bag, so aim for big suitcases if you need to to cut down on number.

However, overweight bags typically cost more than additional bags, so be careful!
Choose unique bags. You want to be able to spot it quickly at the pickup carousels. If you have a generic bag, put a marker like a ribbon on it.
Aim for at least one roller. You can stack a duffel bag on top of a roller bag, but carrying multiple duffel bags is a drag.
Check for damages to your suitcases/bags before you go.

, In the rolling suitcase, pack all of your clothes, toiletries, and items you won't need until you arrive. There are many different ways to pack, but many people find that rolling up your clothes keeps clothes from wrinkling and saves space in your suitcase. If you don't like that method, do some research to find other ways to pack your clothes. As you pack, check things off of your list to make sure that you haven't forgotten anything.

, The day before your trip, plug in all the devices you will be traveling with, such as cell phones, iPods/MP3 players, portable game systems, digital cameras, and any other device that require charging. Remember to bring your chargers with you if you think your devices will run out of battery while you're away.

, Bring things to entertain you while on the flight, like books, electronics, etc. Put your chargers in your carry-on in case you need to charge up at a layover. If you get hungry a lot, avoid high costs by packing a snack. Remember that you can only bring 3 oz. of liquids in a 1 quart bag through security.


Double-check TSA guidelines before packing something in your carry-on. You don't want to have to throw anything away.

, Each passenger gets a baggage allowance, which is usually determined by fare, destination, date of travel and how frequently you fly. To make sure that your suitcase doesn't exceed the weight limit, weigh your suitcase beforehand. There are gadgets to do this for you, or you can use a bathroom scale. If you are having problems with your scale, first weigh yourself, then weigh yourself with the suitcase, and subtract the the weight of you alone. Find out your baggage allowance, and if you luggage exceeds it, consider taking out some items.

, As you're packing, make a list of things that you don't have or need to pack last-minute. If you don't have a travel toothbrush, or you had to use your phone charger the night before, write it down and put the note in a noticeable area for easier remembering.

Determine what luggage you’re bringing.,
Use your checked baggage for large items.,
Store carry-on items in a clear bag.,
Prevent leaks and spills.",How to Pack Liquid and Gels on a Plane1," Odds are that you plan on bringing a carry-on bag to keep handy during the flight. Now decide whether you are packing enough items overall to warrant checking in additional baggage to be held in cargo. Rules regarding non-essential liquids and gels differ between carry-ons and checked baggage, so figure out what your options are.Non-essential liquids and gels (as well as aerosols, creams, and pastes) include: foods, beverages, cosmetics, toiletries, and inspect repellents.;
, If you are bringing both a carry-on and checked baggage, sort your liquids and gels by size. Check the size of each container that you intend to bring. Pack any container larger than 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g) in your checked baggage. You can also pack smaller containers here if you don't need them during the flight.The size of the container is the determining factor, not the amount of liquid/gel left inside. So pack large containers in your checked baggage even if they’re almost empty.
If possible, always use the original container describing what the product is, since unmarked containers may require closer inspection. This may lead to longer waits, confiscation, or even refusing your admittance.
If you wish to use any of these items in-flight (like, say, toothpaste), purchase another size that is 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g) or smaller.

, First, make sure that all of the non-essential liquids and gels that you intend to pack in your carry-on do not exceed 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g). If they do, purchase smaller sizes. Next, use a single clear, resealable 1-quart (1 L) bag to store them within your carry-on.Only one bag is allowed per person. If your 1-quart bag doesn’t fit all of your liquids and gels, use your checked baggage to pack those you won’t need inflight. If all you have is a carry-on, reevaluate what you’re bringing and leave behind whatever can be purchased at your destination.
Each passenger is entitled to one 1-quart bag, so if you're travelling with someone else and they have room in theirs, utilize their bag, too.
During passenger screening, you will be asked to remove your 1-quart bag from your carry-on for inspection. Rules specify that the bag must be clear in order to speed up this process.

, Air pressure can affect your containers' lids and seals, so consider repackaging liquids and gels whose containers have weak or problematic seals. Search online or in stores for a 3-1-1 compliant kit. Use a funnel to pour each liquid or gel into one of the kit's clear tubes and seal it with the corresponding cap.As long as the new containers are 3-1-1 compliant, it's okay to transport liquids in a container without a label. Just expect the possibility of a closer inspection of each liquid during screening.
As an alternative, you could remove the cap of the original container and use plastic wrap to create an additional seal before screwing the cap back on. As an added measure, you can pack each container in its own sandwich bag to prevent a bigger mess should one start to leak.

"
"
Keep essential items separate.,
Inform the screeners.,
Let them know if you don’t want X-rays.",How to Pack Liquid and Gels on a Plane2," If you need to bring medication, baby formula, breast milk, or baby food, do not include these in your 1-quart (1 L) bag for non-essential items. However, expect these items to possibly require closer inspection by security. So pack them so they are accessible and can be easily removed before screening begins.The size of the container does not matter with essential items. So don’t worry if it is higher than 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g).
Security may also wish to inspect any accessories, such as syringes, IV bags, pumps, or milk warmers. Pack these for easy removal, as well.

, When it’s your turn to go through screening, inform the agents right away that you have medication and/or liquid containers that hold more than 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g). Also let them know if you have accessories that go along with it. Expect the agents to inspect your essential items by:Visual inspection
X-ray screening
Testing small samples

, First, keep in mind that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has concluded that liquids and medications exposed to X-rays are still safe to take afterward. However, if radiation from X-rays is still a concern for you, be aware that it is your right to refuse X-ray screenings for medication, breast milk, and baby formula. If desired, tell the agents that you don’t wish this when you present these items.Refusing X-rays may lead to other security measures. This could include a pat-down and/or a closer inspection of your other belongings.

Shop with the return-trip in mind.,
Ship items home.,
Shop duty-free.",How to Pack Liquid and Gels on a Plane3," If you have checked baggage, this is less of a concern, since you can pack liquids and gels weighing more than 3.4 ounces (100 ml/g) in that. However, if you only have a carry-on, remember that any liquid or gel souvenirs that you purchase must be that size or less. Also keep in mind that they will have to fit into your single 1-quart (1 L) bag for non-essential liquids and gels. Limit your purchases by size and quantity accordingly.Also keep this in mind when deciding on what non-essential items to bring on the flight there. To make room for the return-trip, consider only bringing items that you can jettison at the end of your stay.

, Make packing for the return trip that much easier by shipping liquid and gel souvenirs separately. Ask retailers if they offer shipping themselves. If not, bring your purchases to a parcel service like UPS, FedEx, or DHL to pack and ship your items home.If you are travelling internationally, be aware that your items may be subject to customs fees upon delivery, depending on the item and countries in question.

, If you are travelling internationally, consider saving any souvenir shopping for liquids and gels for the flight back. Make your purchases before your flight at the duty-free stores located within the airport’s secure area. These items are exempt from carry-on rules, as long as:The sealed, clear security bag provided by the store at the time of purchase has not been opened or otherwise tampered with.
You keep your receipt for inspection.
The item was bought within the last 48 hours.

Research the average climate and weather for your vacation spot during the month you are visiting.With the weather information you just found in mind, pull the clothes from your closet that are climate appropriate to your destination.,
Get the smallest suitcase possible that will hold the clothes you have set aside and a few other small items.,
Try to match up just enough outfits for number of days you are going on vacation, if less than a couple of weeks.,
The easiest way to have a lot of options is to pack accessories.,
Pack the clothes into the suitcase by rolling them.,
Get together your toiletries and tuck them into the corners of the suitcase, or inside shoes.,
Try not to over stuff, but if you find that you cannot fit everything you wanted, close the suitcase and stand it up overnight.,
If all else fails, just pack as usual, then take half away.,
If you are really finding it all to hard a relatively cheap vacuum packer might be helpful just put it in the bag and it sucks out all the air leaving it crease free.",How to Pack Without Overpacking," Be sure, however, that even if the weather is warm, you still pack a light waterproof jacket in case of rain. Pack layers just in case, but don't stuff your suitcase with coats and mittens if you're going to Florida in August.;
, The best would be to use a small roller board or backpack. Hard suitcases, while being protective, are harder to pack well and tend to be much heavier. You can fit more at less weight in a soft shell bag. Make sure it has lots of little pockets for extra space and further organizing.

, For a longer trip, be sure to have clothes that mix and match well. Reusing articles of clothing to make new outfits gives you a large variety with a smaller amount of clothing. One way to do this is to have the majority be staple colors such as whites, beige, browns and black. Throw in a few colored or patterned pieces to add variety.

, Shoes are too bulky to carry a lot of, but be sure to have a casual pair and a slightly dressier pair. Remember, you can buy cheap flip flops just about anywhere, and you can throw them out at the airport before coming back home. Women especially can pack things like scarves, belts, and inexpensive jewelry, which will make any outfit unique.

, For shirts fold lengthwise before rolling, for pants fold in half lengthwise and then half horizontally. This allows you to fit more into a small suitcase. Be sure to keep clothes that wrinkle easily on the top.

, Be sure to wrap all of them in a plastic bag to make sure nothing gets ruined if they spill. Also keep in mind that that most hotels supply shampoo, conditioner and soap, and also most places sell travel size bottles, which help to keep the weight down.

, The contents will settle and you will be able to fit more into the top by the next morning.

, You probably will not need most of it, and unless you are trekking into rural or uncivilized areas of the world, you will be able to pick up anything you couldn't pack.

, Alternatively if you don't want to splurge on all that you could just use a vacuum cleaner to suck out the air from your clothes.

Try to ensure that you carry one bag and that is it.,
Trial your packing.,
Be more nimble.,
Save money by carrying your own bag.,
Stay safer.,
Carry less.The main idea behind packing light and yet packing sufficiently throughout the trip is to bring very little.,
Do not pack for the worst-case scenario.,
Pack smart.",How to Pack Smart While Going on a Foreign Tour," A carry-on size bag with dimensions 9"" × 22"" × 14"" should do just fine as it will even fit in the overhead bin in the airplane. If it is utmost necessary to carry more than one bag, make sure that the weight is within the prescribed limit—you will not want to pay extra charges while traveling by airplane for overloading, at least not without planning to do on purpose. ;
, While abroad, you will be walking with your luggage more than you think you will. Before flying overseas, check yourself out. Pack up completely and go into your hometown. Try out the tourist experience for an hour. If you are comfortable window-shopping while being fully loaded, it is well and good. If not, get back home and thin things out.

, When you carry your own luggage, it is less likely to get lost, broken, or stolen. Moreover, making last minute flight change plans becomes easier. A small bag sits on your lap or under your seat on the bus, taxi, and airplane. You do not have to worry about it and as soon as you arrive, you are ready to hit the road on your own. This in itself is a liberating feeling!

, While in most aircraft carriers, it is still free to check one bag on most overseas trips, you might have to pay a fee to check two. If you are vacationing in Europe and you're taking a separate flight within Europe, expect to be charged to check even just one bag.

, While in a foreign country, you can save a lot of other hassles by packing light. Remember that having too much luggage marks you as a typical tourist and it might make you a potential target for con artists, taxi drivers, etc. This also enables you to do away with the problem of hiring porters since, with only one bag, you are mobile and fully in control of your belongings.

, Before packing up all your items for the trip, spread them all on the living-room floor. Scrutinize each and every item carefully and ask yourself whether you will absolutely be needing them during the trip or not.

, Instead, pack for the best-case scenario and buy the rest of the stuff if you fall into some kind of emergency. Due to increasing globalization and rapid expansion of leading brands, you will find most of the popular brands of items in most of the countries.


For instance, you need not worry if your stock of toiletries get exhausted half-way through the trip. All you have to do is visit the shops in those localities and find the items that you require, such as toothpastes, soaps or razors. Tourist shops in major international hotels and even airports will surely be one of the places you visit and in these places, it's easy to find a personal item. Sometimes roaming around that city and shopping around can be a unique experience in itself.

, Whether you have to travel for a week or a month, pack for exactly the same. To keep your clothes tightly packed and organized, roll them up instead of folding. This creates room for more within your luggage. You can also try putting them in resealable bags and packing cubes.


Keep your toiletries, first-aid kit and gadgets separately, in tightly bound packets.
For smaller items like socks etc you have the option to use mesh cubes and small airless baggies.

Hang linen clothes in a garment bag.,
Pack linens in a hard-sided suitcase.,
Pack less to reduce pressure.,
Unpack linen as soon as you arrive.",How to Pack Linen Clothes1," Linen tends to form and hold creases more than some other fabrics, so packing to avoid wrinkles is the key. If it is possible, the best option is to hang linen clothes on a padded hanger and store in a garment bag. This makes it so that you don’t have to fold the clothing, or at least it won’t be folded tightly and packed with everything else.Once in the garment bag, if you can, leave it hanging up during the course of travel. If you can’t leave it hanging, lay the bag folded lightly in half with nothing on top of it.;
, Although people sometimes prefer traveling with soft duffel bags, these are not a good plan for linen since these bags can be squeezed and crushed easily. A hard-sided bag will maintain its shape and keep the garments inside from unnecessary pressure. The suitcase does not have to be “hard” as in unbending plastic sides, but it should have supports that help it maintain its shape.If you are packing the clothes for a move, consider boxes over bags.

, Suitcases that are tightly packed cause greater pressure on clothes, which means the creases are more likely to set. If you are able to pack less overall, do so, but at least try to pack less in the suitcase that your linen clothes will go in. Perhaps you can pack a separate, smaller suitcase for the linen clothes. If you can only have one bag, try to pack it loosely enough that the linen clothes are not smashed., Don’t leave your clothes packed up tight for longer than necessary. Whenever possible, you should unpack linen clothes and hang them up as soon as you arrive at your destination. Rather than leaving them packed for extra days, getting them out quickly will help reduce wrinkles.Once you have them unpacked, hang linen clothes up. If there are wrinkles, you can hang them in a bathroom and turn the shower on hot for long enough to make the room steamy. You can gently pull at the linen to help release the wrinkles.
It’s also a helpful option to pack wrinkle-release spray when you anticipate possible wrinkles.
You can use a steamer or blow dryer to release wrinkles. If you have an iron or steamer available, this is a good option for immediately removing wrinkles upon unpacking. Another good option is to spray the linen item with water, especially in the most wrinkled spots, and then turn the blow dryer on the clothing. The heat will help release the wrinkles.

Pad clothes with tissue paper.,
Pack each piece of linen clothing in a plastic dry cleaning bag.,
Pack linens in the best position in the pile of clothes.,
Try the rolling approach.",How to Pack Linen Clothes2," Wrinkles are caused, in part, by the friction of clothes pressing against each other, and tissue paper helps reduce this friction. For pants, insert pieces of tissue paper along both legs before folding or rolling. For shirts and suit jackets, insert pieces in both sleeves and throughout the torso.When you fold the clothes, there is still a chance of wrinkling. One trick that might help is to put a little extra tissue paper along the parts of the garment that are folded. Giving the folds extra padding can help keep from forming hard creases.

, Once you have the clothes properly padded, place each one in a plastic bag before packing into the suitcase. If you don’t have dry cleaning bags, zip-lock style bags are a great alternative. Putting clothes in plastic lets them slide around more, so it keeps the clothes from settling into a position and wrinkling., As you fill your suitcase or moving boxes, put clothes that are less likely to wrinkle on the bottom of the stack and put linen clothes near the top. This will reduce the amount of pressure on the linen and help avoid wrinkles. If you pack a bunch of linen clothes together, try to put larger pieces on bottom with smaller pieces on top.


If you are packing for flight, consider placing linen clothes in the middle, as baggage workers may not load and unload bags with the top up. Placing them in the middle ensures that if a bag is flipped upside down, all of the weight won’t end up on the linen.

, The trick of rolling up clothing to reduce wrinkles is debated, with people advocating for and against it. The idea is that by rolling, you avoid the hard creases that folding typically creates. The downside is that rolling can form smaller wrinkles if the clothes are not rolled tightly enough. Rolling may not work the best for shirts as they will most likely need to be folded in half, but it can be a good option for pants.Fold pants in half lengthwise preserving the crease in the front of the pants. Hold the pants at the hem and slowly roll all the way up to the waist. Gently smooth the pants along the way to reduce any extra creases forming.

"

Turn lined linen inside out.,
Fold as little as possible.,
Wrap linen items around other items.",How to Pack Linen Clothes3," Some linen clothes have a lining on the inside. If you have pieces of clothing like this, you can turn them inside out to reduce wrinkling. This is especially helpful when you have to pack a suit jacket with a lining. Stick your arm in each sleeve, grabbing the cuff, and pull the sleeve inside out as you remove your arm.


Place lined linen on top of all other clothing.

, How much you have to fold will depend on the size of your suitcase, but aim for only 1 or 2 folds. For pants, fold in half lengthwise so the legs line up, then either fold in half from waist to cuff or in thirds. For shirts, fold sleeves across torso and try to fold up the bottom third only. For suit jackets, fold in half lengthwise so the sides lay with the shoulders matching up.

, If you only have 1 or 2 linen items, take one and drape it, unfolded, over both sides of the suitcase. Place a few other non-linen items on top of the linen item. Fold the remaining portions of the linen item over the other clothes. You can repeat this as you have room.


This helps the linen clothes by letting them form lighter creases than if they were folded up tight.

Pack your car up!",How to Pack Lightly for a Family Vacation," Read up about your destination. If you have been there before, remember all the fun times you had. Research fun restaurants, attractions, and towns near where you are staying. Search pictures on the internet of where you are going. The more excited you are about your trip, the more fun packing will be.;
, It all depends on how long the vacation is. A suitcase that is a little too small is better than one that is too big, as a small back will prevent you from overpacking and paying expensive luggage fees. Find a carry-on bag too. This can be anything from a backpack to a purse or duffel to a small suitcase (though not recommended.) If you want to use the things in your carry on, make sure to bring a smallish bag instead of a small suitcase.

, Find out what the weather is going to be like where you are going and what the climate is. You can also find extended forecasts on well known weather sites, or a weather app.

, The general rule is: As many underwear as the days you will be gone (i.e, traveling 7 days, 7 pairs of underwear), 1/2 as many socks unless your destination is cold, then pack more, as many shirts as the days you're traveling, since shirts normally take up little space, 1 to 2 sweaters per week, 1 to 2 pairs of pajamas per week, 2-3 less pairs of shorts/pants than the days you're traveling, and 1-2 less bras than the days you're traveling.

, Set the bag beside them, and they do not have to be travel size. If they are, you will have more space in the bag. Basically, you don't have to go spend your money on travel sized things. Plus, it's very easy to run out of something travel sized as it is used very quickly. (i.e. hairspray) You could buy some at your destination if needed.

, I like to pack by putting all the shirts in one pile, all the shorts in another pile, all the socks in a pile. get it?It saves space. Do not roll the clothes! It could make them wrinkle. It may save space but you don't want wrinkly clothes! You could pack by putting an outfit with another on top of it. Except the socks, underwear and bras.

, Pack them nicely into a bag. I like to use several little bags. One for makeup, one for perfume,lotion, and shampoo. Another for hair ties, hairbrush, hairspray, toothbrush, and toothpaste.Put the toiletry bag into your suitcase. Place the toiletries on top of the clothes. The toiletries will keep anything below protected in case the stuff underneath shifts for some reason. (i.e. turbulence or slamming on the breaks).Pack all your carry on things. Laptop, phone, camera, MP3, headphones, DVDs, Mini DVD player book, pillow, blanket, etc. (Most of that could be packed in the middle of a suitcase where it will stay most protected. If you are driving, you won't be watching a movie on your DVD player).

, That way, it can be packed into the car faster.

, Don't you love coming home to a clean house...

, If you are just going to the airport, it doesn't have to be really neat. If you are driving to your destination, pack the car really nicely. That way, it will be easy to take everything out of your car and get it into the hotel/house you are staying in.

Bring sunglasses and a hat with a brim.",How to Pack for the Pool," If you are only going for an hour or two, you probably don't need to bring much. If you are going for over 2 hours, you may want to bring all of these suggested items.;
, You might want to think about a waterproof bag.

, One may fall in the pool or get dirty, and you don't want to rub dirt all over yourself. Even if nothing like that happens, it never hurts to have a spare. A friend may have forgotten to bring one, and you could loan them yours.

, You don't want to go to the pool all day and end up bright red the next day. If you want to tan, try bringing a lower SPF, like 15. If you burn easily, you may want to get a higher SPF, such as 50. If you need it, they do make SPF 100.

, Again, if you have two pairs, bring both. If a pair snaps or one falls to the bottom of the pool, you could use the other pair.

, Bring a cooler with water, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and other healthy snacks. Unhealthy snacks may taste good, but they won't fuel your body as long or fill your stomach enough. It also may be a good idea to bring Gatorade or ""Powerade"", as these energize you and replace your electrolytes.

,, If you are a child, it will give you something to do during adult swim. Also, you could read on a bench and tan while you read.

, You don't want to have your eyes be damaged by the sunlight, and the hat protects your face more.

Just pick one and move on. You won't need to haul snorkeling gear around Europe. You won’t need that flare gun. They are a hassle in security anyway. Chuck it. The “what if” game is dangerous to play when packing. Ask yourself: do I absolutely need this? If the answer is yes, then pack it. If the answer is maybe, leave it at home. The benefits of a light bag on your back far outweigh the drawbacks of not having something you ""might"" need.;
, The only way to get by on a single carry on bag while you travel for a week, a month, or even a year, is to accept that you'll need to do laundry. You will have to pay your hotel to do your laundry, wash your clothes by hand in your bathtub, or go to a laundromat. Try to make the experience positive. If you go with the third option, think of the experience as a glimpse into the local culture. Take pride in washing your clothes in Lima, Peru or Moscow, Russia. How many people at home can say they've braved a Peruvian lavandería or a Russian laundromat. Try to abide by the ""trilogy travel law"". Three pairs of socks. Three pairs of underwear. Wear one. Wash one. Dry one.This will free up space and works well if you're on the move frequently as most pieces will air dry in a day or so. Keep in mind, hair dryers can dry socks too.

, Limit the number of toiletries you bring and leave those that you don’t need at home. Toiletries take up space in your luggage and can really pack on the pounds. When packing light, consider using travel-sized moisturizers, deodorants, shampoo, and other products that can be placed in your carry-on bag. You can also buy some make-up items, such as mascara and lipstick, in travel sizes.Remember that toiletry items may be available at your destination, especially if you are staying in a hotel or resort. Hotels provide shower items you may need. If your hotel doesn't have what you need, you can buy Dial soap, Crest toothpaste, and Gillette shaving cream/razors in drug stores around the world., The most important item to bring when packing light is money. While forgotten items can be purchased at your destination, you need to pay for necessities should a need arise. You'll want a credit card for large purchases like hotel reservations and cash for smaller, day-to-day buys., Are you heading to the sunny beaches of Phuket, Thailand or the chilly Patagonian terrain of Chile? Will you be traveling to several different climates. Consider the weather of your final destination and pack accordingly. If you are going to the beach, bring appropriate light-weight clothing. Don’t bring heavy, cold weather clothes if you don’t have to. They really add pounds. If you are going to a colder climate, bring a single coat to wear over layers, rather than several coats, which can be cumbersome and heavy. Layers allow you to strip down, if weather permits.Bring dual-purpose clothing. If you know you’ll be traveling through several climates, consider purchasing pants that turn into shorts with a zip of a zipper. Various companies make jackets that have removable sleeves and hoods.

, When only a few pieces of clothing are available, putting an outfit together can be a challenge. Bring clothes that are neutral in color, such as white, tan, brown, black, or blue so they can be mixed and matched. Jeans are a versatile choice. You can wear shirts with jeans and be photogenic. If you are a girl, thin knits offer versatile as well as light clothing options., Shoes take up the most room in your luggage. To pack light, try to get by with only one pair of shoes. The type of shoes you pack will depend on your destination and planned activities. If you anticipate spending most of your time on the beach, a pair of flip flops should suffice. For business meetings, pack a nice pair of dress shoes in a neutral color that also works with casual attire.If you need more than one pair of shoes, wear the heavier pair for travel, and pack the lighter pair in your suitcase.

, Scarves, belts, bracelets, and earrings can help stretch your wardrobe to create different looks without adding a lot of weight or taking up too much space. Don’t bring too many accessories though. Keep in mind that some of the greatest souvenirs are clothing accessories. You might end up buying a silk scarf in Milan that you can wear later on your trip, so don’t pack a thousand scarves if this seems like a possibility., Their intended purpose is to compress your items into a manageable size. They have mesh lining that allow air to escape, thus allowing them to collapse to their smaller sizes.Use these as space savers not as excuses to pack more stuff. Remember that you want to pack lightly. Most people purchase them in the hopes of cramming more stuff into their large suitcase. If this is you, remember that most airlines charge extra if your bag exceeds 50 lbs and the added weight of several packing cubes along with the additional stuff you’ve crammed in them will send your airline fees skyrocketing., You can normally purchase them in packs of 2, 4, or 8. And they come in various sizes. Some come with vacuum spouts that allow you to suck out the air with a vacuum. Others require you to push the air out by hand.

, Whether you decide to use packing cubes or airless baggies or not, you’ll need to fold your clothes methodically. If you just throw your clothes into your bag, they’ll take up more room and be wrinkled when you arrive. Folding boards allow you to fold your clothes perfectly every time. They’ll be easier to stack on top of one another as well, helping you to save space., Half the packing battle will be unpacking in a timely fashion. Sometimes on the road, you’ll need to get something out of your bag quickly. It might be a passport or it might be a travel first aid kit. Regardless, you’ll want these things to be accessible. If you know you might need something, be sure to pack it towards the opening of your bag. Put all the items you think you’ll need to be more accessible together in the same spot near the zipper of your bag, so you can just pull them out easily."

Prepare a list of things to bring.,
Consider the weekend's activities.,
Pack to suit the weather.,
Keep possible emergencies in mind.,
Pack lightly.",How to Pack for Vacation1," A to-bring list of items can vary widely depending on the type of weekend trip you're planning. Certain things, like an extra set of clothes, are recommended across the board, while other things can be brought or left depending on the type of place you're going to. Here is a list of things to consider bringing:



Clothes. For a weekend trip, a fresh set of clothing should be considered necessary. You will want to feel fresh on the second and third day of being away from home, and in the case that your first set of clothes gets wet or dirty, you'll want something to fall back on. The same applies to socks and underwear. Bring heavier clothing, like a jacket, based on the forecasted weather.Toiletries. Toothpaste and a toothbrush should be deemed essential for your trip. If the place you're going has running water, a small vial of shampoo and conditioner should be brought along as well to ensure you're feeling fresh throughout the trip.

Trip entertainment. The journey to and from your location should be just as enjoyable as when you get there. This can be helped by taking along some entertainment. If you're driving, bring a few of your favourite CDs to cycle through. A good book is also recommended, particularly if you're going somewhere relaxing like a lake.

Trip-applicable items. A weekend vacation is often built around a certain activity. Your to-bring list should mention the specific things you'll need to perform that activity. If you're fishing, for example, you will need a rod and a bait box, among other things. Depending on where you're going, items like some mild first aid should be considered as well.;
, A weekend trip is relatively easy to outline. It's not a large amount of time, and it's usually focused on one specific activity. Try to gauge what your .Can you see any things you'll most likely be doing? What are you hoping to do over the weekend? Running through the vacation in your mind's eye will give you a stronger idea what you should be bringing along with you.


For example, if you're going to a lake in the Summer, useful items such as bug spray and lighter fluid are recommended. Imagine the possible scenarios that relate to the environment in question, and speculate as to the things you would need.
If there are activities you may do but aren't sure about (like swimming, for example) it's best to bring them along anyway. A weekend trip isn't going to require much baggage to begin with, and you might feel left out if you decide not to bring something.

, Your packing should be arranged with respects to the weekend's activity and the environment it's taking place in. Because your trip will only encompass a couple of days, it's prudent to check the weather forecast for those days and plan accordingly. If there's going to be rain, the clothes you bring should reflect that. A poncho and umbrella will be sorely missed if you neglect to check the weather beforehand. In the case of sun, bringing sunglasses and sunscreen will be helpful. Cold weather demands you bring heavier clothing, like a winter parka, along for the ride. If you're somehow unsure, prepare for the worst just in case.


Even if your weekend trip will be spent mostly indoors, bringing an umbrella can make a major difference in the case of rain.
Download an app like Weatherbug for on-the-go weather forecasts.

, Under the best circumstances, you won't need to use everything you bring with you on a weekend trip. In case something bad happens however, you don't want to be far from home and wishing you had brought something. This is especially true if you're going to be camping or otherwise hiking somewhere where help isn't immediately available.


Carry a small bit of first-aid along with your toiletries. This includes some band-aids, aloe vera and headache relievers. These will take up a negligible amount of space, and you'll be glad you brought them if it comes time to use them.
A set of extra socks will come in handy, especially if the weather is forecasted to be rainy. Nothing spoils a good weekend faster than wet feet.
Even if you're only going to be gone for a weekend, an extra set of underwear is never a bad idea.

, For a weekend trip, you're more likely to overpack than underpack. Unless you're going camping, you won't need much to hold you over for a weekend and carrying too much stuff around will sap some of the enjoyment of travel to begin with. If you can, see how much you can minimize the amount of stuff you bring, and try to stuff it all into a backpack.You don't want to skimp out on things you might miss, but optional luxuries like a hair dryer can probably be done without over a 48 hour period.


For a weekend trip, try to limit yourself to a single backpack forth of clothing and items. This will force you to prioritize what you need over the things you can do without. One change of top is usually all you'll need for a weekend."

Make a list of things to bring.,
Pack suitable clothing.,
Choose clothes to suit the weather.,
Bring essential toiletries.,
Procure some entertainment.Even the most glorious vacation is going to have its downtime.,
Pack clothing to accommodate the amount of time you'll be away.,
Purchase extra amenities at your destination.",How to Pack for Vacation2," If you're having trouble thinking up all the things you'll need for your trip, go through a regular day and write down the clothing and packable items you use. This is best done a couple of weeks in advance. That way, you'll have time to remember if there's anything you may have missed.You'll probably find yourself modifying the list when it comes time to actually pack. This is perfectly normal. A list should only be used as a general guideline to ensure you don't forget anything essential until it's too late.



Clothing. The majority of the space will be tops, although you should bring at least a few sets of pants. Bring lots of socks and underwear, as they don't take up much space. An extra set of shoes is a luxury, but best done without for the sake of space.Toiletries. A toothbrush and toothpaste are essential. Other toiletries, like shampoo, are optional, and can be picked up at your destination. Be wary of the TSA regulations on liquids. Liquid containers can only be 100 ml max per item. Any larger liquids (like shampoo) will be confiscated, so it's better to buy small containers specifically designed for air travel.Electronics and entertainment. A vacation is easily improved by having a book or two to bring along. A laptop, music player and multi-use charger will all come in handy for an extended vacation. If you're travelling abroad, a digital camera (or phone with cam capabilities) will prove useful as well.Identification. Bank cards (including a credit card for emergency situations), photo ID and a passport are necessary to bring along whenever you're travelling abroad. Consider holding onto them in your jacket. That way, if your luggage is stolen, you'll at least have your ID. You should have some of the local cash in your wallet as well., Clothes are arguably the most important and space-consuming thing you'll bring with you on your trip. Unlike a weekend trip, you won't be able to pack a fresh set of clothes for each day you'll be abroad. Bring along a few tops, and at least two sets of bottoms. One pair of shoes will usually be fine. If you're fashionably inclined, try to choose clothes that will be versatile and fit the other clothes you're bringing.You won't have the liberty to pick and choose as you would at home, so be smart and tactical when it comes time to choosing your clothes.


Don't forget to bring clothing that relates directly to the activities you'll be taking part in. This could mean items as diverse as your possible destinations. If you're going to Las Vegas for example, a set of dress shoes will befit your trip to the casinos.
Pack your clothing into rolls to maximize on space. This will also minimize the defined creasing of regular folds in luggage.

, If you have an idea how long you'll be staying abroad for, check the local weather predictions. Instead of packing to suit every possibility, you can judge from the weather forecast what you'll most likely need. Not having to provide for every possibility will free up a lot of travel space.


Apps like Weatherbug are available to use if you want weather updates on the go.

, Toiletries (toothpaste, a hairbrush etc.) are often taken for granted in the course of a morning routine, but you'll quickly miss them if you forget anything. Toiletries should fit into a small countertop bag. The more space-consuming toiletries you use on a regular basis, like shampoo, can be downsized easily enough. Squirt some shampoo or conditioner into a smaller container to save up on space.


It is important to note that certain liquids like shampoos are not permitted in carry-on bags for flights. It's a good idea to keep this in mind when you're organizing your luggage.

, If you're going to be on the plane for a fair amount of time, some entertainment will vastly improve your experience. A fully charged music player and a couple of books are perfect. A laptop may take up a fair bit of space in your luggage, but it more than makes up for it in its uses, and it'll give you a chance to stay up to date while you're away on your vacation.


Entertainment is particularly important if you have children coming on the trip with you. Children have a tendency for restlessness on longer trips, and should have something available to distract themselves with in the car or plane.

, By the end of a two week vacation, every piece of clothing you'll have brought will have been used multiple times. This is perfectly okay; reusing clothing (preferably after a thorough washing) is a good way to maximize on your luggage space. However, you should take care to bring more clothing depending on the length of time you'll be away.


Most hotels will have some kind of laundry service available to those who need their clothes cleaned. In this and most other cases, you can clean and reuse clothes for multiple days of your vacation. Bringing along a fresh set of clothes for each day of a two week vacation would be unreasonable.

, Instead of cramming everything you need into your suitcases, you can buy a new set of non-essential items when you reach your destination. Things like toiletries can be easily purchased somewhere else in the world, and most hotels will provide some sort of basic complements in the form of shampoo or toothpaste. Take a look at your baggage, and try to imagine what things you could reasonably find a matching pair of once you land. Provided the item in question is cheap enough, it may be worth the space you save.

"
Use suitable bags or cases.The most effective way to simplify your packing is to use bags that fit the vacation.,
Roll your clothes into rolls.,
Bring versatile and universal items.Versatile items may be defined as things that fulfill more than one use.,
Go digital.",How to Pack for Vacation3," This doesn't necessarily mean the bag with the most space or the largest number of compartments. Weekend trips should suffice with a single tote or knapsack. Longer vacations should comprise a couple of suitcases, with at least one smaller bag included within the luggage itself. That way, you'll have something to carry around if you're going on walking trips once you've reached your destination.


Compression bags are specially designed to maximize the space therein. You might consider buying one if you travel a lot and have trouble packing the clothes you want into your current bags.Try to make your luggage look visually unique. A lot of travellers have very similar-looking luggage, and something as simple as a brightly-coloured sticker will make yours stand out in a baggage carousel.

, Seasoned travellers may debate between neatly folding clothing into luggage, or rolling them up tightly. Neat folds will spare the inevitable creases, but rolling your clothing will save up on precious space, which is arguably more important when you'll need to be carrying everything around.Rolling socks together is especially helpful, as it helps keep pairs of socks together.

, Something as basic as a roll of duct tape can be used to solve a number of potential problems you may come across.If you're travelling as a party, bring items that more than one of you will use, and share it. In this manner, you'll minimize the amount of stuff you need to bring, all the while maximizing the utility you're getting out of the stuff you do take with you.


Convertible clothing, like pants that can be converted into shorts, is also recommended for this reason.
Shoes are very space-consuming and only serve one purpose. Unless you are bringing multiple pairs of shoes for a specific purpose (such as attending a formal event) it's best to bring a casual pair of shoes and wear them throughout your vacation., Things like books and maps are very helpful to have on a vacation, but they're going to take up an inordinate amount of space in your luggage. Wherever possible, it's best to go digital. If you're planning on reading a lot during your vacation, an e-reader will let you bring hundreds of texts with you at a minimum of space cost. If you have a smartphone, you can use that in lieu of carrying maps and print manuals.It's good to keep a credit card on you with at least a 1000 dollar limit in case you get into an emergency. However, you're best off keeping the local currency on you in order to save on potential transaction fees from your bank.
Try to minimize the amount of devices you bring. Bringing a phone with movies and music saves you having to bring items specifically intended for those purposes."
"
Make a list.,
Consider how much luggage you will need.,
Consider which electronics you will need.,
Bring identification, travel information, and emergency contact information.,
Be organized about your packing.",How to Pack for a Weekend Trip1," Lists are awesome. Obviously, you know where you are going, how long you'll be gone, and which activities you expect to fill your weekend. As you go on with your day (before you pack), write down all the essentials you need or go through it in your head. Write down all of the things that you will need: clothing, toiletries, electronics, money, identification. When you can't think of anything else, read over the list. Consider which items are nonessential, which items require accessories (e.g. phone and phone charger, contacts and contact case, toothbrush and toothpaste), and what, if anything, you may have forgotten.;
, If you will only be gone for a weekend, you should be able to fit everything you need into a backpack or a small carry-on suitcase. Put your books, electronics, and immediate necessities into a small backpack for easy access. Pack clothing and other space-intensive items into a light bag or suitcase. Choose your luggage before you pack so that the available space can help you with the decision process.


Bring one or two bags, depending on your means of transportation. If you are flying, you might try to fit everything into one carry-on to avoid checked luggage fees; however, you may as well bring a few extra things if you are taking a road trip and you have plenty of space in your car.
Consider where you are going and how you plan to spend your money. If you think you'll buy clothes and other items, save space!
Keep a collapsible bag or day-pack in the front pocket of your suitcase. If your bag is too heavy, you can put some stuff into the extra bag. This is also a good place to put any souvenirs that you pick up.

, Are you traveling to a place with cell service? Will you actually spend any time on your computer if you bring it? Do you want to listen to music on the way there? Do you need a camera?


Make sure to bring chargers and extra batteries. If you will be doing a lot of driving, consider bringing a car charger.
If you’re going abroad and you don’t want to pay roaming charges on your phone, you may be able to leave it on airplane mode but connect to the local WiFi. This way, you’ll be able to access email and Internet if needed.

, Consider which information you will need to facilitate a smooth, safe trip. Make sure that you have this information written down or accessible from your phone. If you won't have access to the Internet, make sure to print out physical copies of permits, contact information, and directions. Consider the following documents and information:


Your passport, if you’re leaving the country.
A photo ID.
The name, phone number, and address of the hotel or home you’re staying in.
Emergency contact info for anyone at home.

, You want to make sure you know where everything is so you aren't scrambling to look for it later. For example: put all your clothes together in one spot of your bag, suitcase or whatever you're bringing to pack your items in. Make sure to put anything small, or that could get loose in your bag, into a small pocket or bag.

Start with the basics.,
Check the weather.,
Pack versatile items.,
Bring the right shoes.,
Lay out your clothing before you pack your suitcase.,
Bring extra underwear.,
Roll your clothing instead of folding.",How to Pack for a Weekend Trip2," Set out only the items that you're sure you'll need, then build out from there. Bring as many changes of clothing as you will need, and consider bringing one extra outfit if you can fit it. Determine the number of outfits you will need for each day, not the number of outfits you want to have. If you are going to the beach and a bar one day, you will need an outfit for the beach, an outfit for the bar, and a set of pajamas.


Add one additional outfit to your list in case of an emergency. For example, say your clothes get drenched from rain but the day isn't over yet. If you pack an additional outfit, you will have a backup without needing to take away from your other outfits.

, Plan your clothing around the climate of your vacation spot. Check websites or the television to see what the weather will be like in that area before you go. If you are entering a warm or tropical clime, you can pack lighter, and if you are going to be hiking in the Arctic Tundra you're going to need to layer things which means lots more clothes. You don't want to pack the completely wrong clothes and be miserable during what is supposed to be a fun weekend.


If it is going to be cold, pack articles of clothing such as sweatshirts, pants, hats, etc. Make sure you pack enough. It is better to be over-prepared than under-prepared.
If it is supposed to be warm, pack shorts and t-shirts, but bring a few cold-weather items just in case. Meteorologists will not be able to give you a perfect weather forecast, so it is best to come prepared. Who knows? It just might happen to drizzle while you are on your little adventure for the weekend.

, The key to packing for a short vacation is to pack versatile items that you can mix and match depending on where the weekend takes you. If you already have a set itinerary, great – but remember that weather can be unpredictable, and that you may change your mind about what you want to do.


Try to bring clothing that you can wear for multiple days in a row. For instance, consider bringing just one pair of jeans that you can pair with several different shirts. Recognize which articles can be worn two days in a row. Jeans and pajamas usually can, but underwear should not.
Consider your color palette while picking your outfits. If you have the same colors, then you won't have to bring as many things to match.

, Consider the activities that you'll be doing, and plan accordingly. Try to limit yourself to two pairs of shoes. Bring one pair of shoes for walking, and one pair for another activity: flip-flops for the beach, heels or dress shoes for a night on the town, slippers for relaxing. Place shoes that you are not wearing on traveling days in plastic grocery bags or some other small bag. The shoes can either be added to your bag if there is room or be transported separately.


If you are going to be doing things outside (hiking, biking, running), you should come prepared with sneakers so that you can enjoy your weekend without having uncomfortable feet.
If you are going somewhere fancy, you probably won't want to wear sneakers while everyone else is wearing their dress shoes.

, Visualize how certain items will go together, and consider how many options you are giving yourself. Organize the items by outfit, color, or clothing type.

, Always pack extra underwear in case you are surprised by your menstrual cycle, end up partaking in a sweaty activity, etc.

, This will help you save space, and it may keep things wrinkle-free. Fold pants in half and then roll them from the top to the bottom. Fold shirts into thirds and then roll them from the top to the bottom. In this way, you can fit your whole list into a carry-on-sized suitcase, and you won't have to pay those pesky extra fees for checked baggage.


Put wrinkle-prone items on top. If wrinkle-prone clothing gets stuck beneath the weight of your other items, it will be more likely to come out of your bag creased.

Consider what you need.,
Pack toiletries into one single bag of your choice.,
Medicated face wipes.,
Bring a toothbrush.,
Find travel-sized versions of toiletries.,
Plan around your hairstyle.,
Bring deodorant!,
Consider bringing moisturizer.,
Consider whether you will need makeup.",How to Pack for a Weekend Trip3," Take inventory of all of the toiletry items (i.e. toothbrush, hairbrush, contact solution, etc.) that you use on a regular basis.

, Ziploc bags work. Place the toiletries into the largest bag you are taking first: you can leave behind bulkier clothing if they don't fit, but you can't leave behind toiletries.

, They’re good at clearing your skin and taking off your makeup, and they take so much less space than your face wash probably would (and you won’t have to turn it over to the TSA!). Tip: Sometimes buying the refill packages, as long as they’re resealable, is easier than a whole tub–especially to pack.

, You can pack it in a toothbrush case, a plastic bag, or wrapped in a cloth. Bring a mini tube of toothpaste, depending on where you’re staying. If you’re going to a friend’s house for the weekend, chances are s/he isn't going to be mad if you borrow his/her fluoride. However, if you’re going to a remote cabin somewhere, it’s good to take your own!

, You can buy travel-sized bottles of many products in pharmacies, grocery stores, and dollar stores. Consider buying 3-ounce travel bottles that you can reuse from trip to trip. You can mini-bottle your home toiletries, take exactly the amount that you will need, then wash out the bottles afterward to reuse on your next trip.


In the US, TSA will not let you bring more than three ounces of any liquid onto a commercial flight. Plan accordingly.
Try bringing samples instead of fully-packaged products. This can work for prescription creams and lotions, as well as luxuries like perfume. You don’t want to risk bringing and losing an entire tube of your doctor-ordered creams and lotions, but you still want to keep your pores clear. Make a trip to your dermatologist before you leave for your trip, and see if she can give you any samples to bring on your travels.

, If you have a hairstyle that won't keep up with water or sweat, bring hair styling tools in the case that your style is destroyed. Bring travel-sized hair spray. You’ll probably want to stick with your natural texture to save time (who wants to waste time with a flat or curling iron when you have sights to see?), but spray can give you a quick burst of shine and polish without a ton of effort.

, If you want to bring perfume, try to find a sample so you don’t risk all of your favorite scent spilling in your bag.

, Travelling can dry out your skin, especially if you're going by plane. As with other toiletries, try to find a travel-sized version of your moisturizer.

, Bring it if you think you'll need it, but don't bring too much. If you will be going out on the town, meeting people, and taking a lot of photos, then you may want to consider bringing


If your moisturizer is tinted, you can substitute it for foundation. If not, try using a stick foundation that can double as a spot concealer (and that you won’t have to put in the TSA bin). You could also bring a powder compact so you don't look shiny in your Facebook pictures, mascara, and your favorite lip gloss.
If you must have eyeshadow, try to find a versatile palette in a small compact that you can fit in your bag.

Obtain the right number of suitcases.,
Pack clothes.,
Pack your laptop.,
Bring your phone.,
Bring a portable music player.,
Pack a camera.,
Invest in an electrical adapter set.",How to Pack for a Year Abroad1," You can’t take everything with you when packing for a year abroad. Your packing needs limits. Three suitcases is too many, and one suitcase is not enough. The “Goldilocks number” of suitcases? Two. This will give you enough space for clothes and a few personal belongings., No matter where in the world you’re going, you’ll probably need to wear clothes. There are many types of clothes you could bring. The clothes you bring should depend partially on personal choice and partially on the climate.If you’re headed for year in the Tropics, you can probably leave your parka and mittens at home. If you’re taking a year in Siberia, on the other hand, you’ll not have much use for shorts and flip-flops.
Learn more about the climate and season weather patterns of the place you’re headed and pack your wardrobe accordingly.Other clothing items really come down to personal choice. You might want to bring a favorite set of pajamas, or that t-shirt from your favorite band.
Bring at least one formal outfit in case you have the opportunity to attend a formal event.
Don’t forget essentials. You should pack two weeks’ worth of underwear and socks to keep laundry costs down. Include a pair of sturdy and comfortable walking shoes.Be versatile when packing. Look for outfits that would be appropriate in both casual and professional situations. Choose clothing items that match well with many other items.

, When you’re abroad, you’ll likely want to continue checking your email and social media, check the news, read wikiHow and do all the other wonderful things that computers empower you to do. Your best bet is to invest in a padded laptop case and bring your laptop along with your other carry-on luggage., You may or may not be able to use your phone when you arrive in your host country. But while en route, you can use your phone to contact the people waiting for you at your final destination if your flight is delayed. Plus you’ll be able to use it pass the time during a layover by checking the news, connecting with friends and family on social media, and playing games.Don’t forget your phone charger.
If you can’t use your phone when you arrive in your host country, ask your boss or student coordinator to connect you with a new phone.

, If you’re not a big audiophile, you might find that your phone is adequate to cover your audio needs. But if you’re really into podcasts, audiobooks, and music, you’ll probably want more hard drive space than your phone allows. Pack your portable music device for your year abroad., If you’re satisfied with your phone’s camera, you could forego bringing a digital camera. But if you want higher-quality images, you should think about bringing along a digital camera.Don’t forget the memory card and charger when you pack your camera.
Avoid bringing a bulky long-lens camera. Their size makes them hard items to carry on your flight, and their fragility means you should not trust them to baggage handlers.

, Foreign electrical outlets are probably different than the ones you have in your country. Instead of two prongs they might have three, or vice versa. In order to use you phone, laptop, and other gadgets, you’ll need to invest in an adapter set.Electrical adapter sets are usually sold as part of a package that contains adapters all international electrical outlet standards. In other words, you won’t need to buy a set for Japan, another for Nigeria, and another for Scotland. Instead, the set will contain interchangeable pieces that you can use as needed in each country.
They are readily available online and in many hardware stores.

Pack some basics.,
Pack some electronics.,
Think about what you can do without.,
Use a backpack.,
Bring a padlock.",How to Pack for a Year Abroad2," You’ll need at least three or four shirts, pairs of underwear, and pairs of socks. Wear – don’t pack – pair of light but sturdy walking shoes. If you intend to do some mountain climbing or hiking, bring a pair of hiking boots, too. Pack a light and water-resistant jacket, too.The other clothing you select should depend on the climate of the area where you’ll be traveling. If you’re going to stick to hot climates, don’t pack gloves and heavy sweaters (though you might want one scarf or light sweater for cool nights). If you’re headed to a cold climate, don’t bring shorts.

, You should bring your phone with you, as it can be useful for browsing the internet and sending emails, even if you can’t use it for phone calls. Don’t forget to bring an international socket adopter. This will allow you to use your electronic devices with the foreign electrical outlets you encounter abroad.A pair of high-quality earbuds are also essential for traveling.
If you have a small, lightweight tablet or laptop, you might want to bring that as well.

, When packing light for a year of undefined travel, you should think more about what you don’t need than what you do. Keep your packing minimal. Lay everything you plan on bringing on the floor and evaluate each item one-by-one. Ask yourself, “Will I get a lot of use out of this? Is there some way I could avoid bringing this?” For instance, if you have three sets of shoes, you might conclude, “I could do with a single pair of shoes in order to pack lighter.”, Instead of packing a suitcase – or even two suitcases, get a sturdy backpack and a daypack. Use the backpack to carry your essential items – clothes, boots, and so on. Use the daypack to bring things you need when leaving your motel or hostel like a water bottle, phone, and money.Choose a backpack that is about 10% smaller than the one you think you want so that you avoid overpacking., Travel-sized padlocks are essential for keeping your bag secure. Hopefully you’ll be in hostels that have lockers available to store your things. You can keep the locker secure by locking it with the padlock. If you’re in a private room in a hotel, you could bind the two zippers on your backpack together with a padlock, making it impossible to open the backpack (though a determined thief could always slash the bag)."

Pack some accessories.,
Pack some toiletries.,
Bring a folder.,
Pack a scrapbook.,
Get a mini dictionary.,
Bring some mementos from home.,
Bring money.,
Bring a journal.,
Don’t pack too much.",How to Pack for a Year Abroad3," If you wear glasses or contacts, be sure to pack some. If you’re headed to a sunny location, you’ll need sunglasses. You could bring a quality pair housed in a hard-shell case, or wait until you arrive to get some. If the weather is cold or the winters harsh, pack some scarves and hats. If you’re a watch-wearing person, you could wear it abroad, though if you have a phone (or plan on getting a phone), it’s impractical to have a watch.If you like wearing makeup, you could pack a small makeup set, too.

, Over-the-counter medicines like aspirin and a first-aid kit should be part of your travel pack. You should also pack hygiene products like soap, a brush/comb, deodorant, and at least one month’s worth of feminine hygiene products. Depending on where you’re going, you might want to also pack a roll of toilet paper – it’s not available everywhere.Some items like razors and toothpaste might not be allowed on your flight.
Check the latest travel guides for your nation’s airport security bureau to ensure that whatever you pack won’t cause a problem at the boarding gate.
Check your local stores for travel sizes of various toiletries, especially toothpaste and soap.
Don’t pack too many of these. A small toiletries case should be sufficient. You can buy more soap, toothpaste, and so on when you arrive at your destination., If you’re headed abroad as part of a school program, you’ll probably need to bring insurance forms, transcripts, and other university documentation to your host institution. If you’re headed abroad to work, you’ll need to bring criminal background checks, ticket stubs, and related documents to your boss. If you’re married, you might also need to bring a marriage certificate. A folder or document organizer will be useful for organizing this paperwork in an orderly way.You might also want to bring some extra passport photos just in case you need them for a work permit or passport renewal.
If you plan on driving, you’ll probably want to bring your international driver’s permit.
Ask your host institution or company what documents you need to bring so you don’t forget anything crucial.

, A scrapbook is the perfect way to collect and organize all your pictures, tickets, and other scraps you collect while you’re making great memories abroad. When you return home, you can share your scrapbook with friends and family who are curious about your travels.You can get blank scrapbooks at most arts and crafts shops.

, Travel-sized dictionaries are indispensable for anyone heading abroad for a year. Whether you’re looking for a place to eat or just trying to say “hello,” you’ll be glad you’re armed with a mini dictionary when you head to explore your local surroundings. Take it with you when you head out and use it to learn some essential words when you arrive. Use the blank space toward the back of the dictionary to write down essential words and phrases like, “How much does it cost?” and “Where is the bathroom?”

, If you have a favorite picture of you and your family or a good luck charm that means a lot to you, you should bring it along. A year abroad is a great adventure full of neat opportunities, but having small reminders about where you’re from and who you are can help you avoid homesickness.Don’t go overboard with mementos from home. You should devote most of your suitcase to space for functional essentials like clothing., Before you leave your home, visit your local bank and exchange about $500 in your currency into the local currency of wherever you’re spending the next year. That way, when you pass through customs, you’ll be able to pay your taxi to wherever you’re headed and make purchases of things you couldn’t pack (or forgot to pack).


Place some money in your wallet for easy access, and reserve some – at least $100 – along with your passport in the event that you misplace your wallet.
Think about investing in a passport/document holder that you can sling around your neck beneath your shirt. That way, your important documents will always be with you.

, Traveling often inspires introspection and creativity. You’ll need an outlet to focus your energy on rainy days or days when you feel like simply relaxing. Journaling is a great way to express yourself and reflect on your travels when you’re on the road., Even if you have room left in your bag, it’s often best to leave it empty lest you exceed the weight limit for your bag.

Use vacuum bags.,
Bring a carry-on bag.,
Pack culturally-appropriate clothing.,
Find out if you need to pack sheets.,
Layer up when en route.",How to Pack for a Year Abroad4," Vacuum bags are special bags designed to reduce the volume of your clothes by compressing their total volume. These are especially useful for packing bulky items like coats and bedding. But remember, packing bags will only reduce the size of your luggage, not its weight., Your carry-on bag is the one that you’ll be able to bring with you onto your flight. You should pack your carry-on bag full of things to make your trip more pleasant. For instance, you might want to bring your portable MP3 player, phone, chargers, laptop, a snack bar, a book, and other odds and ends that you might want.If you have an ebook reader, you might want to bring it along, too. Instead of limiting yourself to just a book or two, you can bring a whole library of books with an ebook reader.

, If you’re working or even studying in another country, you might be considered disrespectful for dressing slovenly. Avoid wearing sweatpants, hoodies, and flip-flops to class or work. Choose clothing that is professional and projects the sense that you’re a mature and intelligent person. Failing to do so could result in you packing a lot of clothing that ends up serving no use while you’re in-country.Do some investigating about cultural mores in the country where you’ll be spending your year abroad. If you have a trip coordinator, ask them about what kinds of clothing is acceptable in the nation you’re headed to.

, Assuming you’re spending a year abroad for work or study, ask your host institution if you need to bring your own sheets. Often, the answer is that you don’t, but it’s best not to assume one way or the other. The last thing you want to do is find out that you’ve packed your bed set but don’t actually need it.If you don’t want to pack an entire sheet set, which can be quite bulky, pack a rolled-up sleeping bag. If it’s small enough, you might even be able to put it in a duffle bag and take it with you as carry-on luggage.

, If you’re headed to a cold climate, wear your big parka on the plane instead of trying to pack it. The same goes for at least one pair of gloves and a winter hat. Anything you wear on the plane will save space and weight in your luggage. You can always take it off and place it in your lap if you get uncomfortable while on board."

Coats like these are usually lightweight and pack well into any bag or suitcase. It's much more convenient to pack this item and not need it, than to not pack it and need it during your trip.;
, Wearing a cap under a hood keeps the hood from covering your eyes and keeps some of the water from your face.

, These could be waterproof hiking boots, galoshes or rain boots. Make sure your shoes have good soles. If it's rainy on your trip, you may be walking on slippery surfaces. Also, bring extra socks with you. Having wet feet and no dry socks to change into can make you feel cold and uncomfortable.

, Umbrellas seem to be one of those accessory items that get easily lost or broken. Having an extra one with you will ensure that you have something that will help you to stay dry in rain storms and shaded when the sun is especially bright.

, By placing wet clothes into the plastic bags and separating them from the rest of the items in your luggage, you keep your dry clothes from getting wet.

, These smaller bags may be used while you are traveling to help protect your cell phone, camera or other electronic equipment. You can also put maps, tour materials and other items you wish to keep dry in them. While these bags may not be fashion-forward, they will help protect your belongings.

, Often, during rainy weather temperatures may shift from cool to warm or warm to cool. If you layer your clothing, you can be comfortable regardless what Mother Nature throws your way during your trip.

, This towel can help you to dry off if you are caught in a surprise rainstorm without your gear.

Pick winter climates for protection against cold weather.,
Let your budget guide you.",How to Visit Europe During the Winter1," If you've always wanted to visit places like Greece, the Canary Islands, Sicily, and the southern parts of countries like France, Spain, and Italy, winter is a great time to do it. You won't run into the crazy crowds you do in the summer, plus you'll still get relatively warm weather (think 50s and 60s) compared to the rest of Europe., That is, if you choose cities that naturally have cold climates, you'll find that they have learned ways to deal with the cold. For instance, Prague has underground restaurants to help protect you from the cold. Additionally, many countries with colder climates specialize in warm winter drink and hearty winter food, such as hot chocolate in Switzerland and venison in Germany.Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, Germany, France, and Britain are just some countries that are beautiful in winter.

, Even in winter, some destinations are going to be more expensive than others. Before deciding on a destination, consider what you'll be able to spend. That will help guide where you go. For instance, it's often cheaper to stay in smaller towns rather than big cities. Tourist-dependent areas may also be fairly cheap in the winter."

You can also go ice fishing, snow kiting, or ice skating, to name a few.

Most of these hotels are located in Scandinavia. Each winter, they are rebuilt completely from ice, and they make a truly unique destination., In colder countries, the locals know how to do it up right, taking warm baths in local springs and tubs and getting the spa treatment.

Self-accomodation at daytime is quite cheap, when buying German delis in the nationalwide known discounters incl. fresh warm cakes and ice-cream delis in a 1,50 USD range for 2-3 portions. Near Berlin is a new wine producing area with wine - tasting events all over the year : affordable and always in good spirits.;
, Romania, Hungary, Slovenia and Turkey offer history, sun and wonderful cultural experiences. Many of these countries have recently adopted the Euro but are still more affordable than France, Spain or England.. The comfort is much lower in common than in the Western countries. Be alert due to petty criminal acts , more common than in the West.

, Finding an apartment in the Cotswolds or the Lake District can afford you adventure, hiking and relaxation for far less than a city center hotel.

, This is an ideal destination for bikers and wine-lovers because its beautiful scenery makes both very popular.

, Stay on the mainland instead of a more expensive island. You can often catch ferries for a very low price, instead of renting boats.

, If you like the idea of group travel, don't assume that packages are more expensive. Tour companies get bulk discounts, so they can still make a profit and cost less.


GoToday and Tour Crafters are good places to start looking. Some tour companies also let you book your own flights and then provide all the services in Europe. Make sure to factor in spending money, meals and tips with your tours. When travelling in a small goup, renting a microbus can be an affordable option. The Eastern German federal counties of Thuringia, Saxony and the rest can be better travelled by car. Accomodation is mostly cheaper than in the other federal counties . Visiting Franconia (NE Bavaria with several hundred familiy breweries and big-sized dishes are waiting for You.

, Fiddle with the different options as well. You can often undergo a long layover and shave hundreds of dollars off your ticket price.

, Then, once you arrive, book tickets on low-cost travel airlines, like EasyJet or RyanAir, to other European destinations. This is the best option if you are traveling very light with carry-ons, because you can avoid lost luggage and extra baggage charges.

, A short-term lease of a small car can cost less than a rental car.

, Aim for booking 1 month in advance, or at least 3 days in advance if you are on a shorter time line. TGV, BritRail and other train tickets are often half the price a month before.

, Train tickets are more expensive during commuting times and you will end up spending more money on gas if you are stuck in traffic jams in a rental car. Use your flexible vacation time to travel mid-day or during the late-evening or night.

, If you can sleep easily in transport, then you will save money on an overnight stay and arrive more quickly at your destination. Make sure to book all overnight trains or flights at least 1 month in advance.

, Buses and trains are likely to be far cheaper than rental cars and taxis. If you are staying in a city for a few days, get rid of a rental car, buy a pass, such as London's Oyster Card, and figure out the transportation system.

, If you are planning on seeing some main attractions, as listed on the pass, and buying a transportation pass, then a city pass is likely to be a better deal. Compare the list of included attractions and services carefully and add them up to ensure you are getting a good deal.

, If you bike in your home country, then research bike rentals, such as Roue Libre in France. Many large European cities are now renting thousands of bikes each day that you can pick up and leave at other locations.


Many of these rental stations require that you use a card with a smart chip in it. American Express cards work this way, but many other non-European cards do not. Research payment methods before you arrive.

, Look into hostels, agritourism farm stays, cottages, bed and breakfasts, apartment rentals, convents, castles and camping. Compare prices and you are far more likely to find a cheaper option in the area, than a traditional hotel.

, Find a reputable website and look for a person who needs someone to take care of their house. You can also arrange for someone to stay at your house while you stay in their house in Europe.


Start this process well in advance of your stay. A good house sitting profile can take a few years to build up. However, successful house sitters often stay at a European house free of charge. Finding a house trade can also take 6 months to a year.

, These are available through Orbitz and Expedia, but other versions without airfare are also available at vacations.easyjet.com and visitlondon.com. If you are planning on staying in hotels, then you are likely to find a good deal on a number of services by booking a package in advance.

, Many European countries, like England, France and Italy, do not require an entrance fee for cathedrals and museums. Chances are you can find a list of free attractions that is long enough that you won't be able to see them all during your time in the country.

, This office is similar to a chamber of commerce or visitor's center. They often hand out maps, discounts on public transportation and attractions, and they give you helpful tips.

, Whether you go to a fancy restaurant or a corner bistro, dining out will be inherently more expensive that making food yourself. If you don't have a kitchenette or refrigerator in your room, then embrace the picnic and buy freshly made bread, local cheese and meats, fruits and vegetables from a farmer's market and bottles of wine or water from a corner store.


Spread a blanket in a park for lunch and dinner. Although it may not seem like a local meal, eating fresh, local foods will be a more authentic taste of what Europeans eat. Buy granola and acquire fresh milk or yogurt every morning and eat your breakfast in your room.

, Most restaurants, expensive and low-cost, feature similar fare for half the price at lunch. Dress up and go to a fancy lunch, and then pick up a picnic for dinner.

, These places serve local cuisine that is less expensive than their fancier alternatives. In fact, some tapas bars serve appetizers for free to encourage people to stay and drink, so choose your bars accordingly.

, Prices are usually a few Euros more in the most convenient and popular places. Do a little extra walking to find an authentic place that offers average prices.

Ask yourself what is it about Europe most fascinates you?,
Do you love stories about kings & queens?,
Because of how ancient the countries of Europe are, much of the architecture in the various countries are several centuries old.,
Learn about the different foods which are traditionally European.,
For almost 2,000 years, Europe has been predominantly Christian.,Realize different European cultures have music and folk dances which are part and parcel of their particular nationalities.,
Europeans are known for their artistic talents: paintings, sculptures, etc.,
Europe was front and centre of both World Wars.,
Take a course in a European language, such as Italian or French, or German.

,
Go hiking in the beautiful mountains, which are found in many countries in Europe.

,
Although as already mentioned, Europe has been predominantly Christian for 2,000 years, many European nations still keep records of their pre-Christian religions, & the mythologies which had been born of them.,
Many great writers have come from Europe.,Read about the Crusades, and how they impacted European history.,
Do a lot of walking when staying in any European country.

,
Last, but, not least, are the Romany or Romani peoples, sometimes called Gypsies who exist in all the European countries.",How to Understand and Appreciate the Differences Between Different European Cultures," Could it be that all its nations have had civilizations going back thousands of years? Europe is a continent rich in history, as well as geographic beauty.;
, Then you have another reason to be fascinated by Europe. Although today, most European nations are now republics, a handful of them still have royal families. The United Kingdom is the best known European monarchy, but others include Spain, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Andorra. So if you are a ""royalty buff,"" do your research to find out about which European nations that still are ruled by kings or queens. And of the ones who no longer have monarchs, read up on the history of their royal families, and gain some knowledge of those countries. You may even want to visit the castles and palaces where the European royal families had lived.

, In fact, some are even a few millennia old. So, when you are studying European culture, and making your plans to travel, learn about their ancient cites which are so well preserved.

, A perfect example is pasta, which, as we all know, is Italian. Kebabs are Turkish. Of course both these foods have spread to many other countries, and it can be interesting to observe how they are adapted in different locales. This can teach you about European culture, too.

, Learn about how Christianity influenced European life. Churches and Cathedrals are a common sight throughout Europe.

,, So, upon booking a trip to Europe, see to it, that you make time to visit a museum or two.

, Learn about the various heroes, and lives lost, during the last century, especially during the Second World War, opposing Adolf Hitler.

,,, A perfect example is Greece. So brush up on your mythologies. Especially European mythologies.

, William Shakespeare was English; Victor Hugo was French. So, a great way to familiarize yourself with a particular European nation is to read the writings of the particular writers coming from that nation.

,,, These people are fascinating themselves, in that they are a culture that exist all over Europe, and yet do not have a Nationality of their own. To learn about the food, language, and religion of the Romani people would add to your whole European education and experience, and make it absolutely complete.

First, research the country; from pop culture to cultural norms, the weather to whether there is much nightlife.,
Know the school!,
Are you going to be living on campus or off?,
Bring comfortable and durable varieties of clothes.,
Also, bring a big suitcase!,
Pack for you!,
Bring something that is signature to your home area.,
Capture the experience by taking a camera with you!",How to Pack for School in Another Country," These are things you will want to find out before pulling together items to pack.;
, Does the school offer a suggested packing list? Are there outdoor activities or field trips on a regular basis? Are there opportunities to dress up? Is there a dress code to tell what is appropriate and when (skirt length, shorts, baseball caps, etc)?

, Either way you will want to know what is going to be provided in terms of towels and sheets and what you are responsible for yourself.

, Is 80% of your clothing falling under the ""comfortable with little attention required"" category? Then 10% should be what some call ""country club casual"" dress code- a couple of skirts/pairs of slacks that can be appropriate both for day or evening events, button up shirt/nice top and cardigan, and a pair of comfortable, sturdy dress shoes. Finally the last 10%- fun, durable nightlife clothes, or trendy outfits.

, Consider this carefully based on how much the transportation you will be using to get there may charge for the size of the bags. Two soft duffel bags of less than 50 lbs will cover a lot, if space and choices of clothing sets are managed wisely. Additionally, if your schedule allows for the pick up of a few items once you arrive, you may want to compare the cost of purchasing your hair care items over the duration of your travels to the cost (and weight) of packing as much of these expendable items to last the whole time. If the cost would be too much to purchase at your destination, perhaps consider pre-paying for parcels so a family member or friend can ship the needed items to you (and hopefully some items that will help you if you get homesick).

, A few posters, tape, small items to personalize your home-away-from-home, music, books, small sports items, writing material. Especially if you are living in a dorm, write your name on anything you would hope to bring back with you after your term.

, Who knows? You could make a friend with common interests, or change the world just by showing someone what your normal life is like where you are from.

, if you are nervous about potentially losing a digital camera, then consider taking a package of disposable cameras. Today, some places that develop photos will also have an option for making the photos digital later. It will be nice to have hard copies for frames when you get back.

Do your research at home.,
Plan an itinerary.,
Get a good map of your destination and study it.,
Study the transport options.,
Ask fellow travelers how they are going and if you can join them or share a ride.,
Be prepared to walk a little.,
Talk to the bus driver.,
Read road signs yourself even though you aren't driving.,
Add your potential transport to your detailed daily itinerary.,
Buy tickets as early as possible.,
Once in country, get more information.,
Buy tickets in-country in advance or failing that as soon as possible, when you arrive.,
Ask at any lodging about how to get to your destination, even though you think you know how.",How to Travel in Europe by Public Transport," Study up on these through travel guides or the internet:


What countries to visit. This is determined by your interests, time, finances, willingness to rough it, etc.
How far to range in the time you have. Unlimited time means you can go anywhere, but most people have limited agendas. For a week, don't expect to get to more than one or two countries or two or three separate destinations (city, monument, beach, etc.)
The most common transport in your destination countries. Some countries have only limited train service to anywhere but major cities or the capital. That means using the bus system instead. Some countries use ferries, which have different schedules (such as Scotland, Greece, or Norway).
The must-see places. Be careful if they are all out of the way, not in a major city. These are always harder to reach and take a whole day or more to get to and away from.;
, Decide exactly your schedule (being flexible is good but aim for a definite plan to be efficient): what you will do every day, which are travel days, where you will aim to sleep every night, which are lay-over/exploration days.

, How far away are each of the destinations? How long will it take to get to each one? Don't think of driving times, but bus, train or ferry times. Are there mountains, a lake to cross, an ocean crossing, a footpath in the mountains? What terrain must you negotiate?

, This is the most important and difficult step from afar. Check in books or online for national rail services first. Rail is the easiest, fastest and most comfortable. also more expensive. But it seldom gets you to out of the way areas. Find all the major routes and lines, and schedules. Check the website of the national rail carrier or Eurail. How often do the trains run? day or overnight? print out the schedules.


Book train tickets as much in advance as possible. For e.g., the German rail (www.bahn.de) provides a few tickets at Euro 29 regardless of the distance but these are only available for a few days from the time the booking is opened (currently two months). This is quite cost effective if you are travelling long distance intercity within Germany.
Consider a Eurail/Interail pass. There are several options available on http://www.eurail.com. But, If you're not traveling everyday,consider buying your tickets in advance, or failing that, at points of sale within the train station. It will probably be much cheaper to buy intercity tickets in advance.
Plan ahead. Most countries require a train reservation even if you are using a Eurail/Interail pass. It's about 7 euros per reservation and you must have one, especially in France.
Check out bus services. This is harder to find but possible. Search the major national or private carriers in your country. There is always at least one. If necessary, find a way to translate web pages or figure out how to read the cities and scheduled times at least.
If necessary, check ferry services, especially in Greece. Be aware that summer and winter schedules vary, and that not all islands are served daily (some only once a week). Note that ports may not be in the same place as the city you want to visit.

, Offer to pay your share. Most Europeans, specially in the south will offer you a free ride but you must be brave enough to ask for a lift.

, You may have to carry your gear, so travel light. You may walk on city streets or down a country road. Have the best map of the area you can find and carry. Ask people the way- at least say the name of the place with a questioning look. Note how to get back to the road where you will catch the next bus.

, Since buses can go anywhere, drivers have more knowledge of the immediate area. Ask them where to get off to walk someplace, and what time to come back to the road. Make sure you find out exactly where to stand on the road. Recognize what the local bus stop looks like, how it's marked.

, Notice where you are, how far it is to the next point, other places that may be possible to explore.

, For each travel leg, decide the method. Remember if you mix many different services, tickets are more expensive. Buying a rail pass is the best way if it serves your needs; some let you mix bus service with it (in Switzerland, for example). Some bus companies offer multi-ticket discounts. Check out Eurail passes for sure; they can be the best deal.


Factor in the connection and walk times for each journey. You must get from your lodging to the station, to the train or bus, find the right one, load luggage, and get off and get to the next lodging, maybe using a city bus or subway system, or even walking.

, For Eurail/Interail train passes, you must buy them in your country of origin. You can also buy major ferry line tickets on the internet to be sent to you or pick up at the counter upon arrival. Some bus systems also allow internet reservations (such as in Scotland); check the web sites and be sure of the cancellation or no-show policy.

, As much as possible. This includes:


exact schedules from the airport, hotel/hostel, train station, tourist office.
Look for posters or flyers of excursions to various spots, special tours, hostel buses, ride shares.
Brochures for various places with tips on how to get there.

, Some tickets can be bought at the airport, at the local transportation desk near the arrival lounge. Or at the first train station you get to in the country, it's possible to buy onward tickets for all the trips you will take there. Inquire at the ticket counter, and check the printed schedules and route maps.


For bus tickets, start at the largest city (or capital city) station and buy tickets for the major legs of your journey. For smaller local service, inquire from the driver or the station (ticket counter or sales point). You may be able to buy directly from the driver; just tell him where you will get off.

, Local tips may be better.

You’ll also want to carry a Pilgrim credential to track your progress along the way. Put all travel documents in a plastic case that you have easy access to so they stay safe.If you’re not sure how to get a passport in your country, contact your local government.
You can get a pilgrim’s credential at tourist offices, cathedrals, and pilgrim’s albergues in Spain. You can usually get one before you leave from a local pilgrim’s group in your area too.;
, Hopefully, you’ll have a safe trip and stay healthy the entire time but you need to prepare for health emergencies just in case. Bring your health insurance information in case you need to see a doctor or go to the hospital while you’re on the road.If you’re getting treatment for specific medical conditions, make a list with your doctors’ contact information and all of the meds that you’re taking too.
Keep your medical papers with your travel documents so you don’t lose them.

, Travel insurance can cover the costs if you get sick or hurt, lose your bags, or have to cancel your travel plans while you’re traveling. Keep the insurance information in a secure location that’s easy to get to in case you need it.You can Get Travel Insurance from the travel agency or booking site that arranges your trip, or buy it from an independent broker.

, You’ll obviously need money, debit cards, and/or credit cards to pay for expenses while you’re on the road. It’s a good idea to split up your money and cards, though. Stash enough for the day in an easy to get to pocket, and store the rest in a secure bag, like a waistpack.In most cases, you shouldn't need to carry more than 35 euros (39 US dollars) for daily expenses, such as lodging and food. Costs will vary based on the location, as prices in larger cities will be higher.

, Print out the confirmations for any flights, train rides, or accommodations after el Camino de Santiago before you leave for your trip so you have proof. Keep them in the case with your other travel documents for safekeeping., You don’t want to be lugging a heavy bag around on your trek, so invest in a lightweight backpack with multiple pockets on the outside. Look for one with hip straps too, so you don’t wind up with sore shoulders.Going with a smaller backpack is a good way to keep you from overpacking. If you don’t have room in your bag for everything and the kitchen sink, you won’t be tempted to bring stuff you don’t really need.

, You never know what the weather’s going to be like on your journey, but you’re probably going to find yourself in a shower or two. Keep your backpack and belongings dry by bringing a backpack rain cover and a pack liner for rainy days.You’ll have the driest pack if you use a silicone rain cover.
A pack liner can also keep your stuff protected if your shampoo, sunscreen, or other toiletries leak while you’re hiking.

, El Camino de Santiago can include some pretty rocky terrain. Bring along some trekking poles if you want a little help scaling mountains, moving more quickly, and making the declines a little easier. Look for a foldable style so they’re easy to stash in your pack.Be prepared for anything by wrapping some duct tape around the ends of your poles. You can pull the tape off and use it to make quick repairs during your trip.

, You won’t always be traveling in good light on the Camino. A headlamp leaves your hands free so you can light the trail and hike without any issues. Pack a mini flashlight too, so you can find things in your bag at night.Don’t forget to bring some extra batteries for your headlamp.
If you don’t want to lug around more batteries for the flashlight, go with a hand-crank model.

, You may not have a bed every night of your Camino, so you’ll definitely want to bring a good sleeping sack. Worried about bedbugs? Take a silk sleep sheet treated with a bug repellent like permethrin and a zippered pillowcase.Don’t take a sleeping bag. It’s too bulky to lug around with you across Spain.
When you’re sleeping in a dorm-like situation, it can be really hard to fall asleep. If you’re a light sleeper, throw a sleep mask and some earplugs in your bag for the trip.

, It probably goes without saying but you can’t go weeks without taking your prescription meds. Count out the exact number you’ll need for the trip and keep them in a plastic pill case.Toss in a couple extra of each pill just in case you lose any along the way.
Even if you’re not on prescription meds, you may want to bring some allergy, cold, and/or stomach medicines just in case you get sick during the trip. To be safe, bring enough medication for each day.

, All the walking you’re doing will definitely take a toll on your feet. Make sure you have a box each of bandaids, blister protectors, and moleskin padding to save yourself from serious foot pain., With all the walking, you’re bound to get some annoying aches and pains along the way. Bring a full bottle of your favorite pain reliever like ibuprofen to deal with sore muscles., It can get cold if you do your trek later in the Camino season. Bring a jacket made of fleece to keep you warm on cool nights. You’ll also want a lightweight rain jacket and pants to keep you dry on rainy days.Sunburn easily? Throw a foldable sunhat in your bag too. Sunglasses can also come in handy.

, You don’t want to bring a ton of clothes on the trip, so stick to just a few shirts that you can wash and dry in a hurry. Two short-sleeve and one long-sleeve is a good combo.You can’t go wrong with technical shirts. They dry fast, block the rays from the sun, keep bugs away, and draw sweat away from the skin.
Hiking shirts with sleeves you can roll up to the elbow are perfect if you can’t choose between long- and short-sleeve shirts.

, Just like with your shirts, you want to bring pants or shorts that you can wash and dry in a hurry. Take three pairs of pants and/or shorts that are comfortable and breathable. A pair of zippable long pants gives you the best of both worlds.Bottoms made from technical fabric can be pretty costly, but they’ll give you more options on your trip.
You may also want to pack a pair of thermal pants to double as pajama bottoms.

, You can’t forget comfortable undies and socks for your Camino. Limit yourself to three pairs of each and be ready to wash them daily.You can keep track of your freshest pair of undies and socks if you bring three different colors of each.
Ladies, don’t forget to bring a couple of bras too. Sports bras are the comfiest and easiest to wash.
Hiking can mean big time chafing. Look for anti-chafing underwear and sports bras to keep yourself comfortable.

, If you’re going to invest in anything for your Camino, a good pair of hiking boots is the way to go to save yourself from blisters and sore feet. Get them fitted at the store if possible, and break them in before your trip so you don’t screw up your feet.Depending on the route you’re taking, you may be able to get away with walking or trail shoes. It’s best to play it safe with hiking boots, though, just in case you run into any uneven surfaces or muddy areas.
Don’t forget a couple of extra laces for your boots. They can even double as a clothesline when you need to dry some stuff.

, Hiking boots are a must when you’re on the move, but you’re definitely going to want to get out of them once you’re done walking. Bring a comfortable pair of lightweight sandals that you can throw on in the evenings to let your feet breathe., You’re probably going to be bathing in communal showers, but you don’t want to come down with athlete's foot on top of all the blisters and other injuries your feet will suffer. Toss in a pair of inexpensive, lightweight flip flops to wear in the shower and protect your feet., You’ll want to be able to grab all of your shower stuff in a hurry so it helps to put all of the items in a single bag. Find a small mesh bag to throw your toiletries in so you can easily see what's inside.Look for a bag with drawstrings. That way, you can hang the bag in the shower while you bathe.

, Of course, you’ll need a towel to dry off after you shower. Look for a lightweight one that dries quickly. You may also want to bring a smaller, wash cloth size towel for face washing., You can get away with only washing your hair every few days on your trek, but you’ll still want to bring some shampoo and conditioner. Take small travel-size bottles, though, so they don’t make your pack weigh a ton. Remember a comb, hair elastics, and bobby pins if you use those too.Stick to simple styles on your Camino -- ponytails, braids, and buns are the way to go.

, A basic bar soap will last a long time and weigh less than shower gel or wash. Don’t forget deodorant either -- you’ll be sweating a lot and you don’t want to wind up with a nasty case of B.O. on your journey.A small travel-size deodorant should last you an entire two week trip. If you think you’ll be on the road longer, bring two along.

, Don’t neglect your teeth while you’re on your trip. Bring a full-size tube of toothpaste and a brush so you can keep your teeth clean the entire trip.Bring some dental floss along too. You may not floss every day, but you don’t want to go a whole two weeks without doing it at all.

, Under the sun all day, you can easily wind up with a nasty burn if you don’t protect yourself. Bring a tube of sunscreen for your face, and it can double as a moisturizer. Add a solid stick of sunscreen for your body.Make sure the sunscreens are at least SPF30.
Keep your lips protected from the sun too with a good SPF lip balm.

, You’ll probably have bigger concerns on your trip than facial or body hair, but you might want to bring a razor with you to clean up when you feel the need. Don’t worry about bringing shaving cream -- use conditioner or shampoo to make the blade glide over your skin., No one wants to be completely out of touch for a week or more, so don’t leave home without your cell phone. You’ll need to bring your charger along too, though, so you can keep it juiced throughout the trip.Check with your cell carrier before you leave to make sure that you’ll have service in Spain.
You may need a Western Europe plug adapter for your cell phone charger.

, What trip would be complete without fabulous photos of all the sights you see? Cell phone cameras can be pretty sharp these days, but you may want to bring a dedicated camera for really impressive photos.Don’t forget the charger cord for your camera.

, Hiking out in the sun all day, you’re bound to get dehydrated. You’ve got to drink plenty of water as you go, so you definitely want to bring a couple of plastic water bottles that you can refill along the way. You’ll want two in case one tears or suffers damage., On any hiking trip, a Swiss Army Knife multitool can come in pretty handy. You can use the scissors for cutting, file for smoothing your nails, screwdriver for making small repairs, and bottler opener for opening beverages."

It may also be a good idea to invest in traveler’s insurance, since you’ll be a long way from home for an extended period. These details are vital for a safe and successful trip, so get them taken care of with plenty of time to spare before your departure.


Prague enjoys a celebrated place in the European Union, making it a convenient, frustration-free destination for local and international travelers alike.
Check to see what the laws and restrictions are for traveling to Prague from your country.;
, It will be necessary for most travelers to fly into Prague. Plan a time that fits your schedule, then decide how long your trip will be and register for your flight well in advance. That way, you’ll have plenty of time to make new arrangements should the details of your flight change or you get notice of a cancellation.Though it’s a popular destination for tourists year-round, Prague tends to be the least crowded in the spring and early fall, from around March—May or September—November.
Score deals on airfare by visiting during slower seasons.

, You'll have numerous housing options available to you throughout the various sections of Prague, from luxury resorts and hotels to hostels and bed and breakfasts. Look into places to stay near the areas where you plan on spending most of your time. The city is laid out in a way that makes it easy to get to most places on foot.If money isn't an object, consider staying in one of the city's more historic sites, such as the Hotel Cerna Liska or Chateau Mcely.For less expensive lodging, reserve a room in a popular international hotel chain in the heart of New Town.

Most buildings in the Czech Republic are outfitted with standard European 220 volt outlets, so pick up a new charger or adapter if you’re coming from somewhere that uses a different type of outlet.

, Those who are vacationing from elsewhere in Central Europe may be able to drive into Prague and find parking for the duration of their stay. It is possible to enter Prague through Germany, Austria and Slovakia using major motorways and rural routes. Since the Czech Republic is part of the European Union, no special credentials are needed to pass through the border when coming from other countries in the EU.In order to enter Prague by car through Central or Western Europe, you’ll need a standard adult driver’s license, as well as a special sticker that permits you to drive on designated motorways.
Borders are open in the EU, but there may be one or more toll stops along the way where drivers have to pay a small fee.

, The city of Prague is home to one of the oldest and largest castle expanses in the world. Prague Castle was built in 880 and over its thousand-year history has housed monarchs, political ambassadors and religious officials. With its towering spires, stunning medieval architecture and beautifully kept courtyards, Prague Castle is on the must-see list for first time visitors.Walking tours of the castle are led at specific times and require the purchase of tickets for admission.
If you only have time to stop at one tourist spot during your time in Prague, Prague Castle should be it.

, Charles Bridge spans the Vltava river and links Old Town and Lesser Town, two of Prague’s most antiquated districts. Named in honor of Czech king and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, the 1,700 foot footbridge is paved with thousands of time-worn cobblestones and lined with Baroque statues of European saints, martyrs and heroes. Crossing it brings you right to the foot of Prague Castle, and provides many breathtaking photo opportunities along the way.Charles Bridge has undergone several restorations throughout its existence, making it an architectural marvel that stretches back centuries.
The bridge acts as a sort of nexus that connects the different individual districts (Old Town, Lesser Town and New Town) of the city.

, As one of Central Europe’s oldest and most storied cities, Prague is a treasure trove of art and antiquity. You can catch a glimpse of the Czech Republic’s visual history by visiting the National Museum, City of Prague Museum or Lapidarium. In their exhibits you will find statues, paintings, precious jewels and relics from times long past.In addition to museums, you’ll also be free to take your pick of quite a few different historical reserves and art institutes, like the Leica Gallery, the Czech Museum of Cubism and Lobkowitz Palace., Prague’s Old Town district was originally a medieval settlement that lay beside the Charles Bridge opposite Prague Castle. Though it has been renovated in the time since its construction, it’s still possible to see landmarks like the Old New Synagogue and the Astronomical Clock and walk along the original cobblestones that cover the maze-like streets. This is where Prague’s medieval roots are most strongly preserved.You can wander the streets of Prague for hours and constantly be wowed by its classical charm and nearly endless sights.
Stop at a food stand for a snack or a cup of coffee along the way, or browse collections of beautiful handmade crafts sold by street vendors., New Town is the youngest individual district in Prague and has grown up into a commercial hub in recent years. On both sides of its busy streets are department stores, boutiques, cafes, banks and movie theaters offering high quality wares and a break from the looming Bohemian atmosphere of the rest of the city. If you’re looking to pick up some one-of-a-kind souvenirs to bring home, New Town is the place to do it.You’ll be able to find all manner of living supplies and modern amenities in the newer sections of Prague, which means you can pack light and still have everything you need.
New Town makes a great place to unwind and have dinner or drinks after a day of learning about the city’s fascinating history.

, One fun alternative to seeing historic Prague on foot is to do it from the water. Rather than shuffling up and down crowded walkways, you can kick back and relax as a luxury riverboat carries you down the Vltava river and grants you a unique view of some of the finest vistas in the city. You’ll pass by Prague Castle, Charles Bridge and see the historic monuments of Wenceslas Square on your way to the river’s quieter outstretches.Riverboat tours typically last between 1-3 hours, and sometimes include dinner.
This is a great way to get off your feet and avoid the big groups of tourists you’ll typically find packed into the streets.

, There is a wealth of hearty, delightful cuisine to be found in Central Europe that draws from Slavic, Germanic and West Asian traditions. Prague itself bears the distinction of having several Michelin star rated restaurants within its limits for lovers of fine dining. You also have the option of settling into any number of cozy bistros that offer delicious meals, stout beer and genial service within walking distance of your accommodations.


Some traditional Czech dishes that are worth trying include guláš, stewed meat with hearty gravy and bread dumplings, smažený sýr, a deep-fried block of cheese, and palačinky, crepe-like pancakes filled with chocolate, fruit preserves and nuts.Beer is a specialty of Central Europe, with dozens of varieties brewed the old-fashioned way., Whether it’s your last stop before leaving the city or you’ve come for a simpler kind of getaway, there’s magic to be found in Prague’s rural outskirts. You’ll be able to bask in the quiet solitude of the countryside surrounded by hundreds of miles of shrouded forest, take a dip in a scenic man-made lake or walk through the silent halls of ancient monasteries and smaller castles. Along with its well-preserved urban centers, Prague’s natural beauty makes it one of Europe’s most prized gems.Prague is a backpacker’s delight. Most destinations are reachable on foot or are just a short train ride away, and the suburbs and country are dotted with affordable hostels to stay the night in.In the summertime, the hillsides of Prague come alive with colorful blankets of wildflowers.

Stick to the bare minimum of luggage possible.,
Remember that you can buy most things once you arrive in Europe.,
Look to bring wrinkle-resistant clothing.,
Beware of taking liquids on the plane.,
If you need to buy luggage, look for a wheeled backpack so you can switch from carrying to rolling as necessary.,
Remember that many accommodations offer laundry facilities, and almost every town has at least one laundromat.",How to Travel to Europe Cheaply2," If you pack light, you can save lots of money. If you pack carry-on only, you won't have to pay luggage fees on flights. Also, you'll be able to walk for distances instead of calling a cab as you won't have to drag so much along with you.

, There's no reason to bring a large supply of toiletries or food with you.

, Rolling it tight in your luggage will save even more space.

, There are many solid alternatives for common liquids, such as shampoo bars, lotion bars, even perfume sticks. Using these instead of liquid alternatives will make your carry-on more TSA-friendly.

, Make sure it is within the size limits of international carry-on luggage.

, If you're traveling for an extended period of time, only bring a few changes of clothes plus some concentrated powder detergent.

Buy your plane ticket several months ahead of time for the best prices.,
Consider airplane alternatives.,
Use public transport.,
Use your feet!",How to Travel to Europe Cheaply3," Overnight flights tend to be cheaper, plus you won't have to pay for accommodations that night. Also try to book from a deal website, such as Expedia or Travelocity, but clear your computer's cookies before doing so for even better prices.

, Flying is not the only way to get to Europe. Depending on the time of year and your availability, it may be cost-effective to take a ship at least one way. If you don't live overseas, see if you can get to Europe by train or bus.

, Once you arrive in Europe, avoid renting a car if you're traveling solo or taking taxis. Trains and buses are available to get from city to city. You can buy a Eurail pass ahead of time to save money.

, Walking is the cheapest method of transportation within a city, so make sure to bring a good pair of walking shoes. (This is another reason why it pays to travel light!) City buses are another inexpensive option.

Decide where to stay.,
Weigh the pros and cons of locations.",How to Travel to Europe Cheaply4," Depending on how you travel, there are different accommodation options that may or may not work for you.


Hostels are a popular option, and are great for solo travelers and platonic couples. Instead of renting a room, you rent a bunk bed. Other than that, hostels typically offer the same amenities as a hotel.
If you are traveling with a large group, book a no-frills guesthouse.
If you prefer to see the countryside instead of the city, there are campgrounds spread throughout Europe. You might want to travel in warmer weather for this option!
As long as you do background checks, interviews, or reference checks, staying in someone's home is a viable option. Couchsurfing, Mennonite Your Way, and Camp in My Garden are just three of the many home stay programs that have European connections.
This shouldn't be an every night option, but take advantage of sleeping in transit. For overnight train trips, you can book a sleeper car. If a train or bus station is open 24 hours, you can probably stay there before your departure or after your arrival.

, Accommodations away from downtown may be cheaper, but it may be more costly for you to get transportation. Consider cost of accommodation versus cost of transportation when considering where you want to stay.

"
"
Travel to places off the beaten path.,
Plan which days you will spend in which cities.,
Look for discounts offers.,
If you are a student (or even if you recently were one), bring your student ID as this can get you discounts at some attractions.,
Don't spend money on souvenirs!",How to Travel to Europe Cheaply5," Lesser-known cities will be overall cheaper. Although attractions may not be as famous, there is still  plenty to do for less!

, Some cities have free days for museums and other attractions, so you might want to plan your itinerary around that.

, Some cities, especially the tourist-heavy ones, will offer discount cards for many of their attractions. If you want to visit most or all of these attractions, a discount card may save you money.

, You can also try bringing along a AAA card, AARP card, military card, or any other card that you think may help get you a discount. They won't be as effective as they are in your home state, but if you ask for discounts often enough, eventually someone will give you one!

, They are overpriced, will weigh your pack down, and will inevitably just collect dust back at home. Taking lots of pictures is the best way to capture memories. You can also collect small free souvenirs, such as city guides and ticket stubs.

"
Search the internet for a cause you care about.,
Research more opportunities.,
If you want to stay long-term, there are many programs that will allow you to volunteer in exchange for room, board, and activities.",How to Travel to Europe Cheaply6," There may be a volunteer program available in Europe, which would be a meaningful way to spend at least part of your trip. Some programs can offer meals, transportation, or possibly lodging.


Diverbo has programs in Spain and Germany. In exchange for conversing in English for one week, you can get three-course meals, four-star resorts, and more for free!

, Read the e-book ""The Underground Guide to International Volunteering"" for information on opportunities you should and should not take. There is even a section in the back of the book that lists dozens of volunteer opportunities in Europe, as well as the rest of the world.

, Kandersteg in Switzerland and ACLE in Italy are two such examples.

Try monetizing your travel with online blogging.,
Consider au pairing.,
Get a job with a travel writing organization.,
Do odd jobs as you go.,
Look for any available scholarships.",How to Travel to Europe Cheaply7," Before you leave, start a travel blog and keep it updated on your journey. Use Google Adsense or another advertising program on your site and you could make some pocket money. But be forewarned, if you don't spend lots of time building up your blog, you may not make any money at all. Either way, it's an easy way to keep your family and friends updated on your travels. (And maybe they'll send you some money!)

, It is basically a cross between a foreign exchange student and a nanny. Most au pair programs require your hosts to treat you as part of the family and provide you with your own room, meals, days off, travel (if the family goes on vacation), and a weekly allowance. Young women are the hired more often as au pairs, but either gender and any age can apply.

, You can write or photograph for magazines, hostel booking websites, or any other travel-related publication that is your cup of tea. Unless you have lots of experience, you probably won't be paid enough to cover all your travel expenses, but you'll score freebies every now and then.

, Some European travelers play music, do hair, work in hostels, or even get jobs at local stores. However, check the laws about foreigners working before you do any of this. Nothing ruins a trip like getting arrested!

, Scholarships are available specifically to students who want to study abroad. This will also qualify you for a student visa, which will allow you to stay longer and maybe get a job.

Book an airline ticket.,
Book a hotel in whatever Belgian city you plan to stay in.,
Prepare for the exchange rate.,
Plan what you will do in Belgium.,
Pack good walking shoes.",How to Travel to Belgium," You will need a valid passport to enter Belgium. Make sure your passport does not expire before you plan to return home.


Apply for a new passport by visiting the State Department's website at www.travel.state.gov/passport. You can download the application and mail it in with your fee and passport photo.
Allow up to 8 weeks for a new passport. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get a passport before you leave for Belgium.;
,


Contact the embassy of Belgium for specific visa requirements if you plan to be there for more than 90 days. The website is http://www.diplobel.us/ or you can call (202) 333-6900.

, Most commercial flights from the United States fly into Antwerp or Brussels.


Check airfares on discount websites such as Expedia, Kayak and Hotwire. You can usually find lower rates on these sites than you can directly with airlines.
Take a train if you plan to visit European countries in addition to Belgium. You can take a train from nearby countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxemburg.

,

, There are many sites to see, including battlefield tours in Flanders, hot air ballooning in Bruges and several museums and cathedrals in Brussels and Antwerp.


Read travel books and visit websites for information on what to do in Belgium. Some good resources include Lonely Planet, Fodor's, Frommer's and TripAdvisor.

, There is no need to rent a car in Belgium. You can travel from city to city by bus or train, and all of the towns are scenic to walk through.

"
"
Get Started.,
Get your budget in order.,
Pack light.,
Decide Where to Stay.,
Choose a mode of travel.",How to Travel Through Europe,"


Commit to your decision and start saving money right away. You won't have an exact budget yet, but airfare alone will probably be in the range of $500 to $1000 if you live in the U.S.
Get there by boat or plane. Cheap flights from the United States to London are far cheaper than any other European destination. If purchased well in advance and during the off-season, flights to London can cost less than $500 round trip!
Get a passport if you don't already have one!
Decide where you want to go. This is the hardest part of the planning process. Most people have a limited amount of time to travel, so focusing on your top desires is key.
Make a ""must-see"" list - this can be cities, countries, specific monuments, open-air markets, whatever! Arrange them in a top-ten list.
Map out the most reasonable travel plan. Using Google Maps, plot all of your desired locations on a map and figure out a route.
Figure out how much time you want to spend in each place. This may depend on your budget, but for now list the minimum number of days it would take to really see your destinations. For example, only one day in a major capital like Madrid or Paris would be a shame.
Don't make your travel plans too rigid. You will want the ability to take an extra day or follow your new friends to a destination you hadn't previously thought of.
Remember that everything takes longer than you expect so ease up on ""seeing it all"" and add a buffer, extra experience day into your itinerary! Ideal is 2-3 nights (1-2 sightseeing days) depending on destination & personal interests. Use travel days to see sights en-route.;
,


Add up the price of your, flight, Eurail/Interail Pass or whatever transportation you have decided upon, your food and lodging, and the prices of your main attractions (most of which can be found online).
Take an ATM card instead of money. Use it at banks to withdraw cash. On each trip, withdraw enough cash for a few days. Alternatively, pay by card as carrying large amounts of cash is a risk. Check your bank fees, it might incur less charges to use your debit card than to withdraw cash.

Keep most of your cash in a money-belt, and wear it underneath your clothes, but keep a little cash in a pocket so you have fast access to it.


Pickpockets are everywhere. It's advisable to take a second ATM card or credit card in case one is stolen. Some banks (and AAA) sell re-chargeable Visa Cards (be aware that Credit Cards used in Europe will charge 2%-4% transaction fees. The exchange rate on transactions should run at the BBR (Bankers Buying Rate) plus percentages - but who has the time to check? Cash is king.

Take enough cash to last you until your first trip to a bank.



,


Under-pack. A collapsible umbrella not a rain-coat or hat. Opera Spyglass not binoculars. Walking shoes not pretty shoes. Use hotel soap/shampoo to wash out socks and under garments. Less is more.
Remember, you will be carrying your duffel bag/backpack/suitcase for miles every time you travel, so make it as light as possible. Also you will want to leave room for souvenirs to take home. All major hostels have laundromats nearby.
Search travel packing lists on the web and adjust according to where you're going. Remember that you can always buy stuff when you get there...Europe has thin towels that are great for traveling, and toiletries are pretty much the same there as anywhere else! Above all, get a good backpack and make sure it's comfortable.

,


Make a Reservation for your first one or two nights and your last night (if possible) accommodations before you leave home.
Begin to search for accommodation in the cities you'll be visiting. You could just book Hotels, but if you're on a tight budget (like most), staying in hostels is your best bet.
Review the ratings (there are tons of hostel booking sites, including specialty hostels for students, female, senior, etc.) and use common sense, you will be fine! Hostels usually run a little under 20-40 euros a night. They are usually the safest, friendliest, most social and best located options available to you. Often times they have pubs and meeting places located on the premises. They book up fast, so reserve well in advance.
Another option is ""couch surfing,"" which basically means staying at someone's home. Again, it seems sketchy, but there are verification processes, reviews, and you have your common sense! Not only is it free, it is a wonderful way to experience the city you're staying in; many hosts are willing to show you around and take you to the non-touristy parts.
Make allowances for travel fatigue which is very common and very real. If you pack your travel schedule too tight, you will spend more money on a daily basis and have less time to enjoy each place.
Arrive at your next over-night before dark. Vary your touristic experiences from location to location (museum, market, play, boat-trip, 'local' dining, bus, tram, bike, ferry, hike...).
Ask your host/hotel/hostel to make a reservation at your next destination - they usually oblige without charge. Stop for lunch and later for coffee or beverage along the way no matter where you are to soak up that location's uniqueness.

,


Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each mode of travel.
Travel by rail (also known as the train). This goes for the majority of Europe, though buses are used in smaller towns. If you don't have a problem with travelling by coach then that's great, because it works out cheaper. A useful coach comparison website to check out is www.getwayz.com

Trains can be slow compared to planes, until you factor in airline check-in time, and trains are good for shorter distances (less than 200 miles). However, it gives you more of a chance to see the scenery.
The Eurail/Interail Pass is something you can consider. You alter its terms to fit your trip. Most of the time a 30 day pass even includes small, local trains. The best part about the Eurail Pass is that you pretty much pay all of your transportation expenses up front - it's something less to worry about while travelling.
It may cheaper just to buy the train tickets. European Rail Companies have websites that offer special one-way off peak tickets. Some are 'domestic' and some 'international'.


Fly. Take advantage of amazingly cheap flights (often 30 to 40 euros) between all of Europe's major cities. For long distances you can save time and money by traveling with one of Europe's many budget airlines (some charge for baggage).
Rent a Car (age restrictions). Cars allow you to take the long and scenic route, stop in local villages and eateries, picnic, photo stops and carry your luggage for you and get you to less expensive accommodations.

A number of Major Car Rental Companies allow free one-way rental, without drop-off charges within certain countries (example: Pick-up Berlin - drop Munich). Most Car Rental Companies allow you to take cars into adjoining countries. Portable GPS systems can be down-loaded with European Maps to make finding destinations (in English) easy.
Driving is very similar to the USA & Canada (except UK and Ireland where they drive on the left!).
If you arrive and stay in a large city on arrival it is recommended you pick-up your car on departure of that city. By picking up cars IN the city (Train stations normally carry surcharges as do Airports) you will save money (dropping off at Airports does not cost extra and is very convenient) and the hassle of city parking is avoided.
Pick up car with 24-hour rental periods in mind. If only large cities are on your itinerary car rentals are not recommended. Public transport is the key in large cities.


Take local and long distance coaches/buses. Or use a combination of any or all of these options.
Ferry.

",How to Travel to Germany," You might wish to spend time visiting car factories in the industrial city of Munich. Or perhaps you want to travel to the castles in the lakes region. Many libraries offer excellent travel books, or you could pick one up fairly cheaply at a bookstore. It's also possible to download travel books to a smart phone, and carry all that information with you as you travel.;
, Leave yourself plenty of time to get your documents up to date. If you live in Europe, you may benefit from relaxed requirements in this regard, Germany being part of the Schengen Area. This is a group of countries in Europe that have agreed to let citizens of other nearby countries into their territory with minimal or no border controls. Check for the latest configuration of the Schengen Area if you think you live in a country which is part of this reciprocal agreement.

, Try the colorful DuoLingo, an app available for mobile devices, or for more intensive language listening practice, use something LingQ.com, a web based service which makes it easy to teach yourself a variety of languages. You will need to communicate with other people in Germany, and knowing a little of the language will help. However, you may also find that English is widely spoken. At the very least, when you choose a travel book, look for one with a bit of a glossary of basic terms, or buy a phrase book. It is also worth learning something about German etiquette and tipping, which again, will be covered in your tourbook.

Take at least two different ATM cards in case you lose one, or in case a bank machine grabs or mangles one. Note that the German post office has offered no fee ATM withdrawals. Check to see if this is still the case when you travel, as the post office may be your best deal for ATM withdrawals.

, Pickpocketing is a major problem in the busier tourist areas.

, Be sure to bring a camera, that you have practiced with ahead of time.

, Take care not to leave your luggage behind on any part of the journey, or you're up the creek without a paddle.

, Italy has a very strict rule that only licensed guides can tour these areas, so be sure to ask to see their licenses. There is such a wealth of art and information within the Vatican walls, that this is 1 place where your visit will be enhanced by paying a guide.


Go to mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/z-Info/MV_Info_Servizi_Visite.html to see a description of the various tours you can choose. There is a link at the bottom of the page where you can book your tour as a group or an individual.

, The Vatican carries its own dress code. Ensure your knees and shoulders are covered, although some people wear long pants and long shirts as a sign of respect.


Both men and women will be turned away if they do not have their knees and shoulders covered. This means tank-tops, sundresses and short shorts will not be tolerated. Women can modify their outfit by bringing a shawl and wearing tights.
Italy and the Vatican City are extremely warm in the summer and they can be rainy in the winter. Bring lightweight clothing that dries easily. This will help you when you need to cover up during your visit.
Wear good walking shoes. Many people spend a whole day on their feet in the Vatican City. Prepare in order to be comfortable on these hard surfaces and when you wait in line.

Spend extra time in the Pinacoteca. This is to the right after you take the entry escalator. Many people ignore this area, because it is the opposite way from the Sistine Chapel, but Italians think of the collection of Raphael, Da Vinci and Caravaggio works as a treasure.

, Summer visitors can quickly become dehydrated, and the Vatican affords you fewer opportunities to buy food and drink than other places in Italy. Come prepared with some water, so you can stay healthy and longer.

, This is a famous staircase that most visitors get to see and photograph.

If you prefer to take the stairs, you will have to purchase your tickets at the tower because stair only tickets are not available for purchase online.;
, There are many modes of transportation in Paris or Europe that will get you to the tower. You can choose to take the Metro, a bus, a bike, a boat or a car.

, Guided tours are available for those visitors who not only want to enjoy the views, but also desire to learn about the Eiffel Tower's history and construction. Guests on guided tours get to see the machine room that operates the elevator and a secret bunker under the Champ de Mars.

, This floor offers the panoramic views of Paris and is a popular spot for taking photos. It also houses the vision well, which is a glass window with a view to ground level. While you are on the second floor, browse in the gift shop for some souvenirs or grab a bite to eat at the Jules Verne Restaurant, which offers French cuisine.

, Guests may enjoy a chilled glass of either rose or white champagne at the bar, which is open until 10 p.m. daily. Gustave Eiffel's office is also on the top floor. It is home to a wax figure display of both Gustave Eiffel and Thomas Edison.

, Each hour, every hour, the tower is lit up for 5 minutes. Not only is the reflection on the River Sienne a beautiful sight, but so are all the lights in Paris or Europe.

Provence features rolling fields, quaint villages, wide sandy beaches and hangouts popular with the very rich. Cities such as Nice, Avignon, and Arles invite visitors to explore historic streets and shop. Or visit other spots in Provence such as the Gorges du Verdon, known as France's Grand Canyon, with its high cliffs and rushing river where you can hike and swim.
The Languedoc is less well-known to tourists but offers many sight-seeing opportunities. Mountains, beaches, ancient walled cities and the chance to experience another culture, that of Catalonia, are all reasons to visit this area.;
,


Other places in southern France include the medieval walled city of Carcassonne where you can walk the ramparts. The city of Nimes contains many Roman ruins including a coliseum where gladiators once fought . The Pont du Gard, just north of Nimes, is an ancient Roman aqueduct that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. You can climb the Pyrennes Mountains by car, bicycle, or on a small train.

,


Regional trains connect many cities and towns. Slower than the TGV high-speed trains, these make many more stops but are still a dependable way to get around the South of France.
Purchase tickets at the train station or at ticket agencies found in nearly any good-sized town.
Consider purchasing a train pass which allows you unlimited travel throughout France, and perhaps other countries, for a set period of time. Be aware you may have to pay extra for reserving your seat on each leg of your trip.
Remember before you board, you'll need to validate your train ticket at the yellow machine found at the entrance to each train track.

, Although trains will connect you to any large city, traveling by car gives you the freedom to stop in small villages and venture off the beaten path to other places you cannot reach by train.


You will need to have your passport, driver's license, and credit card in order to rent a car. Age limits may apply depending on the car rental agency.
Renting a car for a week usually provides the optimum deal for your money. Weekly rental plans often include unlimited mileage.
Check with your insurance company to see if you are covered while driving in France. If not, buy the optional collision-damage waiver (CDW) to protect yourself from having to pay for damage to the car. Also consider purchasing liability insurance and anti-theft protection. Never leave anything valuable in the car, even in the trunk.
Invest in a reputable road map. Regional maps are available for purchase online or at large book stores. You can also get them at a more reasonable price in visitor centers and book shops throughout France. A GPS device might also be helpful.
Familiarize yourself with French law regarding automobile travel. Learn the meanings of traffic signs. Knowing, for example, that French drivers always yield to the car on their right (unless signs indicate otherwise) will help you avoid problems.

, Trains are faster, but buses link cities with smaller towns and villages. Much of Provence and the Languedoc are networked by bus routes.


Very few buses run on Sunday. Plan your trip accordingly.
Some bus routes run every half-hour and are an efficient way to get to popular destinations.

, There are many tours which will take you to the scenic villages and countryside of Provence and beyond.


Some minibuses will pick you up from your hotel and drop you off again. Most have a list of options as to where they'll travel with tourists. Tours can originate from a variety of cities including Nimes, Avignon, Nice, and Arles.
Available and desirable tours include visits to wineries, lavender fields, the busy city of Marseille, or the French Riviera and destinations such as Cannes, where the famous film festival is held each year. You can even book tours to Monte Carlo and Monaco. Half-day or whole day tours are often available.

, For example, you can glide along the Canal du Midi, a tree-lined canal that runs from Toulouse to the Mediterranean and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.


There are other boating opportunities on the Rhone River and other canals and smaller rivers. Take a short cruise on the Mediterranean. Check for choices online or find them in a guidebook or travel bureau.

, The South of France has many hiking and biking routes. Again, ask at local tourist bureaus and check out opportunities in guidebooks.

,


Avoid going in late November through January when it can get very cold. May through September will provide the most enjoyable weather and moderate temperatures.
Be aware that if traveling to the South of France in August, you will encounter the largest crowds.

Its annual export volume of over €650bn consists of vehicles, chemicals, metals, textiles and foodstuffs. It is a big producer of, among other things, iron, steel, coal, cement, chemicals, machinery, machine tools, electronics, ships, textiles and food and beverages.;
, Having attracted out-of-work UK builders in the 1980s – as depicted in the 1980s sitcom ""Auf Wiedersehen, Pet"", Germany’s construction industry has fallen on hard times. Buoyed by abundant World Cup work, favourable interest rates, new tax breaks and Government support for making German homes more environmentally-friendly, the future is looking brighter. ‘The Land of Ideas’ – as Germany now astutely markets itself – is still among the most innovative and technically adept in the world. German consumers appreciate quality and innovation – often ahead of price.

, Germany is the leader in internet commerce and has the highest rate of internet access in the EU; 65% of marketing is conducted via e-mail and the internet. Beware the lattice of regulation that criss-crosses marketing; laws on privacy, consumer protection and data protection are stringent.

, German and British cultures are not as poles apart as popular comedic myth would have it – but there are differences worth noting. For example, the British sometimes are inclined to be overly polite. Feigned interest in a project or deal – in order to appear courteous – can be misinterpreted as genuine by more straightforward Germans.

, Caustically ironic British humour can be lost on their Teutonic cousins because of both language barriers and a different approach to humour. By the same token, do not misinterpret formal, straightforward communication as coldness – they simply adopt a mode of interaction best suited to maximising efficiency.

, Efficiency is valued – so plan meetings two or three weeks ahead, stick to a clearly delineated agenda, and persuade with facts, figures and illustrative examples. Charismatic charlatans are less likely to make headway in Germany.

, Quantifiable factors are important; intuition rather less so. So offer risk analyses and promise frequent reviews. Beware: a company with no track-record – a start-up – will automatically present a major risk in the German psyche.

, Punctuality is paramount. No wonder then that Germany has a first-class rail network; thanks to faster, more reliable trains, Germans are less likely to be delayed than their British counterparts.

, It only takes a day to traverse Germany by road, while every major city can be reached within one hour via a total of 552 domestic and international airports. Located in the heart of Europe, it is within a few hours of every European country in the EU, the biggest single market for trade and investment in the world.

, Being on the doorstep of the latest and potential EU-accession countries is particularly tantalizing; it has been predicted that the economies of the 10 states that joined in 2004 will grow faster than the EU average for several years. Despite having the benefits of being at the heart of Europe, Germany is not landlocked and has access to the lucrative North American markets, by sea.

, Distributors and exporters could do worse than site their logistics operations in the country.

, Germany is also the international hub for business conferences and trade fairs. Given that 90% of new products and technologies are introduced into the German market via trade fairs, it is difficult to overstate their importance. One the most famous trade fairs is the ""Leipziger Messe"" in Leipzig, which recently topped a poll, of thousands of CEOs, conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation, about the best German cities to do business in. In a survey of the 25 largest cities, Leipzig scored highest for business promotion and the competence of its political administration. Bremen and Karlsruhe came joint second, followed by Gelsenkirchen, Dusseldorf and Wiesbaden. Surprisingly, Berlin footed the table, with its banks, city council, trades council and employment exchange scoring particularly badly.

, However, there is no such thing as a free lunch. The tax burden on German business is onerous: large companies pay around 40%, one of the highest in the world. The headline figure can be misleading, however. The tax laws are complicated, and allowances, deductibles and write-offs lower the burden for companies in a number of industries.

, Mercifully, plans have been drafted to lower the tax burden to around 30% – the same as in the UK. Under the plans, partners of small firms would each get tax-free profit allowances of up to €100,000. With a VAT hike of 3% – to 19% entering into force on 1 January, it might offset the impact, especially given already fragile consumer confidence. Wages are also high – higher, even, than in the US: in 2002 they stood at $25 per hour, compared to $21 across the Atlantic.

, Aside from the fact that Germany is an affluent country, tough employment laws and substantial social security expenses have inflated wages. Companies have to share equally with their workers the burden of social security and healthcare costs. German companies are constrained by a myriad of bureaucratic regulations. Exacting safety and environmental laws can make the German markets difficult to enter, for instance. However, EU standards often use German laws as a template, so UK companies should already operate within most parameters.

The process for obtaining a French visa usually begins after arriving in France, and, in most cases, will be directed by the host employer or university.;
, Although speaking French is not necessary when traveling in France, taking the time to learn some basic phrases and vocabulary can be helpful. Translation dictionaries designed especially for tourists can be purchased online or from your local bookstore. When a communication breakdown occurs, the ability to look up key words is essential. If the person you are attempting to communicate with cannot understand your pronunciation, point to the word in your translation dictionary. Look for a dictionary that includes a section on commonly used words and phrases. Learning how to ask certain questions, such as ""how much does this cost?"" or ""where is the bathroom?"" can be very useful, especially when traveling in more remote locations where the majority of residents only speak French.

, Be sure to obtain a reservation confirmation via email, fax or written letter. Visitors in France will find a variety of inns, motels, hotels and bed and breakfasts. Accommodations in France are government rated on a scale from 0 to 6, and the price range for a given lodging is typically reflected in its rating.

Tourists traveling to locations like Lyon, Grenoble or Alsace during the winter months should prepare for heavy snow and subzero temperatures by packing a heavy winter coat and insulated boots. Travelers along France's southern border with Spain, Italy and along the French Riviera should not be concerned with packing more than swim wear and sandals as temperatures in the this area remain very mild throughout the year.

, Although purchasing a small amount of traveler's checks or exchanging a small amount of cash from dollars to Euros prior to departure is considered good practice in case of an emergency, you will typically receive a better exchange rate by withdrawing funds directly from your account using an ATM machine after you arrive. ATMs are plentiful in all but the most remote locations and, no matter who you bank with, your ATM card should be accepted. Check with your bank beforehand to avoid potential issues, as some banks do charge international transaction fees. Others banking institutions may place an automatic block preventing access to accounts from foreign locations.

, Although travelers in France's major cities, such as Paris, Marseille and Lyon, may not encounter closures, visitors to smaller cities, towns and suburbs won't find much open on Sundays or national holidays. Stock up on supplies on Saturdays, or on the days before a holiday. During these times it can be difficult, if not impossible, to find an open gas station, market, restaurant or any other type of service.


Remember that traveling in France during the month of August presents similar service issues, as this has traditionally been a time when many French citizens go on holiday. Most major hotels, resorts and restaurants remain fully staffed in August. However, expect to find some municipal, healthcare and other services shorthanded during the traditional holiday month.






Be flexible when traveling in and around France in the event of a transportation strike. Strikes by federal employees can and do occur with some regularity. This means that, at any given time, the potential exists for interruptions in metro bus, plane, train or taxi service, which could impact your travel plans. If traveling by air or by train, have a bus schedule handy with the travel information for your destination marked. A back-up plan may prove to be helpful in the event of a transportation strike.







, Although purchasing medical insurance for travelers is recommended, it is not required for treatment in the event of an emergency.


Consider the pharmacy first for minor illnesses and injuries. Pharmacists in France receive more extensive training than pharmacists in other western countries, and are generally considered the first line of defense for non-urgent medical problems.






Treat potential viral infections seriously. Viral infections contracted in foreign countries can be harmful because your body has not been given proper time to develop the necessary immunity. For this reason, it is advisable to take flu symptoms more seriously than you might in your country of origin.







, Certain areas within France's larger metropolitan areas, such as Paris, Marseilles, Lyon and Nice, are frequented by criminals known for targeting tourists. Purchasing a money belt for concealing valuables like passports, credit cards and cash is recommended. In the event of an emergency, keep the following numbers close at hand: 15 (medical), 17 (police) and 18 (fire).

, A ""prix-fix"" or fixed price menu typically offers 2 to 3 options for a 3 to 4 course meal. Although typically a more expensive option, diners also can order a la carte. Lunch is typically served between noon and 3 p.m. Restaurants often close after 3 p.m., reopening around 7 p.m. for dinner.


Observe local gratuity practices. A gratuity of 15% is generally included in the bill when dining out. However an additional tip of 1 to 3% is expected in France, based on the quality of service.







, Because France uses the 220 volt system, as opposed to 110, visitors originating from countries in North or South America will need to purchase a Type-E plug adapter in order to use any electrical devices brought with them. Although most new appliances and electrical devices can be used with either 220 or 110, check the device specifications to find out if a 110 to 220 converter is required to use the device.

Enjoy the rest of your day.",How to Make the Most of Your Day at Disneyland Resort Paris," Getting into the park is actually one of the most difficult and confusing parts of the whole process. In almost all cases, if you're visiting for less than three days, book online in advance, if you are staying for three or more days, consider buying an annual pass at the gate—but always check prices, current offers and annual pass blackout dates in advance before you go.


You can book online and print your own tickets. This is almost always cheaper than buying them at the park—often including an extra day in the park for the same price as at the gate. What's more, it allows you to bypass your first queue of the day—the ticket counter, which can often take more than one hour to clear at peak times. Booking online from inside France using the french Disneyland page, and your hotel address can also be significantly cheaper, but may be subject to additional restrictions, and may require delivery of tickets, rather than printing them.
Numerous third party online ticket sellers exist, and can provide significant savings compared even to the official Disney online ticket prices. Careful research of available online offers from different resellers can yield huge savings. Booking from French resellers and travel agents is usually cheaper than doing so in your home country, but be careful to ensure that they are legitimate and reputable and do not have any problematic terms and conditions before booking.
Annual passes are very affordable at Disneyland Paris, and are almost always worth their cost if you are staying off site, and visiting for more than 3 days.

The Francillien Passport is perfect if you are visiting Disneyland as part of a larger trip to Paris. It costs €135 and allows free access to both parks for a full year (minus 85 blackout dates) Purchase this on day one, and then visit the rest of Paris for the first two days (You cannot enter the park until two days after purchasing it), then return to Disneyland at the end of your visit. In addition to your entry costs, you save money at most restaurants, on gifts and get access to a few other special features.
If you need access to the park on the same day, the €179 Fantasy pass is a good deal. With less blackout dates than the Francillien pass (just 45 days per year), it costs around the same as a three day park ticket. It offers all of the above features, plus Extra Magic Hours (get into the park 2 hours early, and beat the queues for the most popular attractions and meet-and-greets), free on-site parking and much more besides.
If you happen to be visiting on a blackout date (or you intend to visit the park a lot during the year, or are buying a lot of gifts) the €223 Dreams pass offers an awful lot for your money, including no Blackout dates, additional discount in the stores, free stroller hire and luggage storage, and more. All of this is still cheaper than a 5 day park ticket.

All three passports also offer savings on Disneyland hotels (up to 35% at certain times) and are therefore usually worth exploring even if you are planning on staying at a disney hotel. The savings can be significant.
Disneyland Paris offers a Sponsorship (parrainnage) scheme, where current Passport Holders can sponsor people buying passports. New passport holders will receive 10% off the price of an annual passport, making this even more affordable. Sponsors must visit the Annual Passport office with the purchasers, so several online sites collate lists of when Passport Holders are visiting the park, and available to sponsor people. The most comprehensive can be found here.





Many Non-Disney branded and non-partner hotels in the Marne-la-Vallee area, and especially big-brand hotels in Val d'Europe nonetheless have special offers on Disneyland park tickets. Always ask at your hotel reception desk what deals they have before leaving for the park.
If you haven't booked in advance, don't worry, you have another option to avoid the queues.

Visit the Disneyland Hotel near the entrance, and speak to the concierge. Explain that you need to use the business centre. They will tell you to use your room key, just explain that you aren't a hotel guest (or that you don't have it with you) and they will let you in anyway. Internet access and printing does cost money—around €5 should be sufficient—but will allow you to book tickets online, and bypass the queues. It also has great quality coffee, and is a really nice place to sit, so is probably worth it just for that.

;
, You can get a feel for both parks (The Disneyland Park and the Disney Studios park) in a single day, but ideally, you will want to give yourself at least one day in the Studios park, and two to three days in the Disneyland Park, and even more time if you plan on trying all of the most popular attractions that the park has to offer.


If your ticket includes Extra Magic Hours (Dream and Fantasy passports, and Disney Hotel packages) make the most of these. You can enter the park two hours before the park opens to the public, and queues are greatly reduced. Not everything is open during that time, but most of the major attractions are.

, Like it or not, queuing is a significant part of any trip to Disneyland. There are, however, many ways to limit the amount of time wasted in queues.


Visit high profile rides and meet-and-greets during Extra Magic Hours, parades and mealtime hours. If you are staying for more than one day, and have already seen the parades, queue times can often be cut in half by joining them in the 30 minutes before, and during the main parade, but balloon immediately after their conclusion. Eating early or late, and queuing during mealtime can also save some time.
Use FastPass tickets where available, and consider FastPass Premium if you are an avid ride user. It costs €60, but can pay for itself in time saved, especially if you only have a short stay.
If you, or a member of your party have any kind of disability, speak to Guest Services about how they can help you. In many cases, you may be allowed to bypass the queues and enter through the ""Exit"" gate on most rides, shows and Meet and Greets.
Similarly, if you experience any kind of disappointment (e.g., ride breakdown, significantly longer queues than those indicated) Guest Services can, at their discretion, issue one or more single-use queue jump tickets, which will also allow you to enter through the exit gates.
Queues for the Disneyland Railroad are significantly longer at the entry gates (and often Discoveryland) than at other stations. If you just want to ride it for the grand tour of the park (rather than to get somewhere in particular) then it is usually worth getting on at the FrontierLand or FantasyLand stations. Both stations are set back from the main park area, and a little and off the beaten track so relatively few people stumble into the queues at these stations without going there deliberately. Both stations even include limited seating areas, compared making the queue even more bearable.
When visiting with small children, always take advantage of the Baby Swap service on rides for which children are too small. This will allow one of you to queue, while the other waits with the child, and can then enter through the exit or fastpass queue as soon as the first rider leaves. This reduces queuing times significantly, and, as an added bonus, means that a single FastPass ticket can be used by both parents (if the cast member is in a good mood of course).
Single Rider lines can significantly reduce wait times if you don't mind too much who you sit with. Single rider queues are available on many rides, and often result in a more than 50% reduction in wait times. You can, of course, queue as a group, and will possibly still end up in the same cart or carriage as your friends, but they can't and won't guarantee that you will sit together.
You can often walk into most timed shows a few minutes prior to their advertised start time, so queuing is usually unnecessary for these. The main exception to this is ""Disney Junior Live on Stage"" in the Studios park, which usually fills around 10-15 minutes before the show start time, due to a hosted children's dance party with Princess Sofia and Jake from ""Jake and the Neverland Pirates"" in the waiting area.
Visiting the park off peak—avoiding weekends and European school holidays—where possible will significantly reduce wait times for top-tier attractions.

Some French national public holidays can be very busy—over 50% of visitors on any given day are French. However, where those public holidays also coincide with blackout days for Francillien or Fantasy annual passports, this is largely mitigated against. As many visitors are local to Île-de-France, and hold these passports, many will not be able to visit on blackout dates. If you are visiting on a French public holiday, make sure you check if it is also a blackout date—if it is not, you're in for a very busy day.
However, certain religious public holidays, eg Easter Sunday and Monday, are taken very seriously in France, and are considered a time for family and friends. Most French businesses, including public transport, completely shut down, or run at greatly reduced capacity. This means getting to the park, and getting food etc. off site is very difficult for locals. Therefore, these dates are also usually blackout dates, so visiting on these dates can lead to a surprisingly empty park. However, beware, Disney will also be operating with a reduced staff, meaning meet-and-greet's, parades and shows etc. may all be less frequent and less spectacular than usual.


Break up long queuing by regularly choosing walk-on rides and walk-in shows, with very short queues, such as ""It's a Small World"", ""Casey Jr."" or ""Le Pays des Contes de Fées"". Psychologically, it will feel like you've done much more with your time, and future queues won't feel quite so bad.

, One of the biggest draws of Disney parks is meeting the characters. Top-tier stars, like the Disney Princesses and Mickey Mouse can have very long queues, but there are ways meet more stars in less time.


Buy an autograph book early in your visit. There is nothing more disappointing than seeing a character out and about, and not having anything for them to sign. You may not see them again, so ensure you have it with you at all times.
Most Disney Princesses can only be met at the Princess Pavilion, or during Character Dining Experiences. Occasionally, a single princess may be available at an advertised location (e.g. Merida is currently available for a few hours each morning in Frontierland) but generally, you will never find them wandering around.

The Princess Pavilion is now only accessible by a special ""FastPass"" like ticket. This ensures that queues will be quite short during your visit—usually less than 20 minutes to meet a princess—and that you get plenty of face-time with them while you are there, however tickets are very limited.
Tickets are distributed from 10:30 am next to the pavilion, but the queue usually begins to form at around 9:30. All tickets are usually gone by around 11:30 am, and anyone joining the queue after around 10:45 is very unlikely to get a ticket on a busy day. On very busy days, such as weekends and special events, even joining the queue at rope-drop at 10:00 am will not guarantee you get an entry ticket. In general, cast members will ask one family member to queue with entry tickets for all members wishing to visit the pavilion, to keep queues short.
Like all fast-pass tickets, these tickets are valid for a 30 minute window, increasing in 5 minute increments. Unlike other fast-pass tickets, they are distributed by hand by cast members, and are stamped with the number of people wishing to visit. This means that different cast members may have tickets for different time slots, and, if the time slot offered is not suitable, it is always worth checking if another cast member has an earlier/later slot available. Cast members will usually try to accommodate this, but make no guarantees. Asking for a later slot is always easier than asking for an earlier one.
If you are leaving Disneyland Paris before about 3:00 (e.g. when travelling home) you will need to be in the queue before around 9:30 am to stand a shot at getting a slot before you leave, and equally, if you are arriving into the park after about 11:30 there is usually no chance of seeing a princess on that particular day. Character dining at the Auberge De Cendrillon is likely to be your only option to guarantee a meeting with a Princess in this case.


Make the most of Extra Magic Hours. Not only are there more costumed characters out and about during this time, the queues for these characters are also much shorter.
Don't waste time chasing down a character who has just left a meet and greet location, they simply can't stop for you—there are very strict time limits for costumed characters, and if they stop for everyone, they will never get out of the park—but they will often sign your autographs as soon as they arrive back at their meet and greet location, if you have followed them back to it.
It is often quicker to get autographs from characters that are out and about, rather than at advertised locations, but, there are of course never guarantees this way. A quiet word with a cast member may give you tips as to who is going to be out in the park, and at what time.
It is often quicker to meet Mickey Mouse at the Toon Studio (in the Studio Park Backlot) than at his home in the main park. Queues for other characters stationed near Mickey at the Toon Studio are often even shorter still.
When meeting characters out and about, is more important to catch the eye of their handler, rather than the character themselves. Helping a handler manage a rowdy crowd is a sure-fire way to get your own child near the head of the queue.
Meals with characters are quite expensive, but guarantee your family significant facetime with characters, in a much more relaxed atmosphere. Often it is the only way to meet certain characters who do not appear elsewhere in the park.
Disney Hotels no longer offer meet and greet's in the public areas of the hotels, however, as a result there are far more characters available in the park during Extra Magic Hours, and if you are there early enough, you can usually meet Mickey and Minnie, Donald, Goofy, Chip and Dale, and possibly others, all near the main entrance, in around an hour during Extra Magic Hours.

That said, if you are a hotel resident on a top-tier package, don't be afraid to ask the concierges for help completing your autograph collection. You may get tips as to who will be where at a given time, and, if you ask very nicely, may even get an extra special in-person visit in your room.


There are generally fewer characters out and about on hotter days, and they are far less likely to go out of their way to meet you at anywhere other than their appointed spots, so take advantage of the advertised times and places on warm days.
Outside of peak season, and especially when Disneyland does not have a defined ""Close of Park"" event or show (e.g. Disney Dreams) characters are often stationed near exits on Main Street at closing time. This helps draw the crowd towards the exits, and is a great, if somewhat hectic, way to meet a lot of characters at once.
And of course, if possible, visit Disney parks with small children, ideally in costume. In a crush to meet characters (where there is no organised queuing), crowds, characters and cast members are all more likely to allow a small child through.

While Children under 10 are encouraged to wear costumes, older children, teenagers and adults will not be allowed entry into the park in costume. Disney have a global policy in place when it comes to attire, and dressing up in costumes which could be confused with a cast member is a big no-no. Graphic t-shirts, mickey ears, and other branded Disney goods are fine of course, but anything which either mimics a disney character overtly, or could be confused with one inadvertently (eg, certain wedding dresses) will not usually be allowed past security. For 10-14 year old's who still look pretty young, you will probably get away with arriving in costume, especially if the child has younger siblings, but if you're going to try, make sure you bring a change of clothes just in case.



, Disneyland, perhaps unfairly, has a reputation for being a very expensive place to eat and drink, however this isn't entirely accurate.


Disney restaurants, in and out of the park, are actually relatively affordably priced, compared to outside restaurants. However in a country renowned for it's culinary excellence, it is perhaps understandable that they are considered expensive for the type and quality of food often served. Nonetheless, if budget is your primary concern, you will be hard pushed to find meals for cheaper elsewhere.
Disney dining is broadly broken down into three tiers, ""Affordable Takeaway"" (€9-15), ""Mid Priced Table-Service / Bar Food"" (€13-25) and ""Top-Tier dining / Buffet"" (€28+). The difference in price between takeaway and the cheaper table service restaurants is minimal, but the difference in food quality can be significant, as are the levels of service you receive. Furthermore, many include unlimited cold drinks at these (look for ""Open Drinks"" on the menu) which more than offsets the difference in price if you have just one refill.

If you are considering using a fast-food takeaway restaurant in the park, the food at McDonalds in Disney Village is cheaper and of better quality. If you have the time to leave the park (approx. 10 minute walk), this is usually preferable on both counts.
Because of the type of dishes they serve, and their small menu's, the food at mid priced table restaurants is generally served just as quickly as at counter service ones.


Bottled drinks in the park are expensive. Multipack drinks are available for much cheaper at the nearby Auchan supermarket at Val D'Europe (Via RER) or even at the Marne-La-Valee train station near the park entrance.
Contrary to popular belief, you are very welcome to take outside food or drink into the park, and eat there, and outside food and drink—other than alcohol, and drinks in glass bottles—are not going to be confiscated at the security check

Picnicking—a particular French pastime, which usually involves whole families bringing large hampers of food to eat in open areas over several hours—is only allowed in the grounds outside the park. This has lead some to believe that outside food is strictly forbidden, as to most ""picnicking"" is synonymous with eating your own food outside. This is not the case though. Sandwiches, snacks and drinks can be brought into the park and eaten, and the restrictions would only apply to anyone taking up a lot of space in the park for an extended period of time.


Drinking water is readily available from water fountains throughout the park on hot days. Like most of Western Europe, the water is clean, fresh and perfectly safe to drink. Small bottles can also be filled at these fountains, though, by design, larger bottles can not easily be filled. Keep a small (300ml or so) bottle handy at all times. However, fountains may be switched off on cooler days, so ensure you still bring plenty of drinking water with you throughout the winter season. However, most restaurants will have a tap to fill water bottles inside them, and cast members in dining establishments will usually give you a cup of tap water on request.

, Even well after their 20th anniversary celebrations in 2012, Disney is continuing to all out to ensure your day is as memorable as ever well into 2015.


Daily parades are hugely popular, but very enjoyable. For their 20th Anniversary, Disneyland Paris hosted several parades, most of which continue to run in 2015. Their main parade (Disney Magic on Parade in the main park) feature a large number of stars, and is a must see attraction. The parade happens only once throughout the day, so ensure you take note of their time. Great views are available anywhere along the parade route, and additionally from the Main Street USA station. In both cases, you should steak out your spot at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the parade for unobstructed views, but any more than this is usually unnecessary.
""Frozen: A Royal Welcome"" is a horse-drawn mini-parade featuring Elsa and Anna from Frozen. It usually happens several times daily, and good views can be found anywhere along the parade route, and is a much more low-key affair than the main parade. As a horse drawn parade, it is a little more slow moving than the main parade, and allows great views of both princesses.
Frozen Sing-along is an interactive, hosted sing-along featuring characters and dancers on-stage, at the Chaparral theatre in Frontierland. It is a well produced show featuring both ""in person"" appearances from Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf, as well as several other singing and dancing villagers from Arendelle, alongside clips from the movie ""Frozen"". The show happens in both English and French, multiple times a day (as many as 12 shows during high season) and the high-capacity theatre means that you can usually still find a seat just a few minutes before the start of the show. However, several rows of the best seats are reserved for (in the first instance) children who have purchased a special ""Frozen"" costume (Elsa or Anna) in the park, and any extra capacity is handed over to children who have come dressed in costume. This means that for an unobstructed view, you will want to join the queue at least 15 minutes before show time during busy shows.
Disney Dreams is a multimedia nighttime spectacular, featuring fireworks, water effects music and video, and the ""Light'Ears"" light up Mickey Mouse ears available throughout the park. It uses Sleeping Beauty's castle as it's projection screen, so is best viewed as straight on as possible. A perfect spot for this will need to be claimed at least one hour in advance of the show during high season, though anywhere on Main Street will provide a good view, as long as you can get square to the castle.

, Though rides, characters, parades and shows are a the main reason for your visit, there is still lots more to do.


Visit the boutiques. Disney is full of shops, and shamelessly promote their wares at every available opportunity. This can be a real turn off to some, but spend even a little time in their shops and you'll quickly realise how beautifully designed they all are. Even if you don't buy anything, many of the shops, or boutiques as Disney refer to them, are just really nice places to explore, full of whimsy and charm.
Meet some cast members. Everyone at Disneyland Paris is considered a cast member, not merely a staff member. Everyone, from the street cleaners to the top brass, are considered actors, playing their part in the creating the wonderful illusion that is Disneyland. Feel free to approach any of them, to engage with them. Most of them really love their jobs, and relish the chance to meet with visitors for a while. All cast-members are, at least, bilingual, with almost all of them speaking French and English, though many also have a basic grasp of many other european languages.
Try your hand at Pin Trading. Disney have a vibrant and active pin trading community, and providing you follow the rules, all cast members with pins on their Lanyards are more than happy—in fact, required—to play along. Pin trading is a lot of fun, and a great way to meet cast members and other guests. There are thousands of designs available, so even if you can't find one you like in store, soon enough, you'll have something that you really love. Several designs each year are only initially available on Cast Member's lanyards, so meeting them early, as soon as they start their shifts, is key to getting hold of these designs.

If you are new to trading, multipack sets are a quick and affordable way to grow your collection. While most serious traders won't be interested in trading for these, remember that Cast Members with pins on their Lanyards or trading cards have to. You can quickly diversify your collection, and maybe, just maybe, find something really rare and unique which the serious traders will go wild for.


Just walking the clean, litter free streets of Disneyland is a pleasure. Remember, unlike a city or town, everything at Disneyland has been placed there with a singular purpose. Everything that exists is the way it is because the Disney Imagineers decided it needed to be that way. With this in mind, a slow stroll around the park becomes an exciting experience.

Hidden Mickeys are placed throughout the park by the imagineers. Hidden Mickey's are anything which takes the form of the Mickey Mouse logo. Strictly, this is one large circle, and two smaller ones above it, though any triangle of circular or spherical objects is possibly also a hidden Mickey. Numerous online and printed guides to finding hidden Mickey's are available, but nothing is quite so exciting as discovering one for yourself—keep your eyes peeled.


Spend some time in Disney Village. Disney Village is a Disneyland's free shopping and entertainment complex. You do not need to be a ticket holder to enjoy this part of the park, or the public parts of hotels. This is a great way to extend your trip if you have part-days (travel days, for example) for which you cannot justify buying an entrance ticket to the park proper.

Disney Village is also home to Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, a paid dinner-theatre attraction. If you cannot afford to see the show itself, it is usually worth trying to find out if they will be hosting free a mounted parade through the Disney village.
Characters can be met in Disney Village, especially in restaurants. Meet-and-Greet meals are available outside of the park in Disney Village.

This means either applying directly to a French institution as a foreign student, or applying to a study abroad/exchange program through an affiliated foreign university.You will probably need to pay an application fee, write an application essay, provide official transcripts, and submit one or more letters of recommendation.

, Contact your local French embassy to apply for a visa. Students accepted to French institutions are eligible for student visas such as the Long Stay Visa for Studies, which is required of all students who plan to reside in France for longer than three months.You’ll need to make an appointment with the French embassy nearest you, submit your application and all the required documents, and wait to receive your visa once it has been approved.

Learn the language.,
Decide where to move.,
Find a place to live.,
Book your flight to France.,
Get your belongings to France.",How to Move to France3," If you are moving to France, you’ll want to invest some time in learning at least a little bit of the French language. You’ll need to be able to talk to people when you rent an apartment, if you find a job, ordering food in a restaurant, and in almost every other aspect of your life in France. Learning the language is crucial.


Try hiring a French tutor, taking a class at a university, using an online program like Rosetta Stone, or a fun learning app like Duolingo.
If you move to a major metropolitan area like Paris, it is likely that you will encounter people who speak English quite regularly. However, if you are moving to a more rural area, you will need to speak French to get by in your day-to-day life., The location you move to in France may depend on your job, or it may be a little more open to selection for you. If you can choose, think about where you would like to go in France.If you want to live in a city with more job opportunities and that may be easier for a foreigner to integrate, consider Paris, Toulouse, or Lyon.
If you want a more quaint French countryside experience, consider moving to a more rural location with a smaller population.

, You may wish to stay in furnished housing, or if you are shipping some items you may prefer to get an unfurnished flat. There are many options for places to live in France, so consider which one will be the best for you.The Internet can be a good source of accommodations, especially sites that cater to those emigrating to France. Try searching on sites like SeLoger, PAP, or Lodgis.
If you want to find a traditional apartment in France, be aware that there are some things to consider. For example, if you don’t earn an income that is three times the rent, you will be asked to provide a guarantor (like a co-signer on a loan) who will be legally responsible to pay for you if you aren’t able to pay your rent. This person must be someone who earns income in France – so it can’t be your parents back in your home country – which can cause problems for people initially moving to a new country.
If you are planning on living in France for a shorter period of time (a matter of months, rather than years), you may want to consider renting a place on a website like AirBnb.This option might be a bit more expensive than obtaining a traditional apartment, but it will save you the hassle of searching for an apartment in person when you arrive in France, securing a guarantor, signing up for renter’s insurance, activating utilities in your home, furnishing your apartment, etc.

, Search for flights on the internet and try to find the best deal. Spend some time looking and consider all of your options. You could also go through a travel agent if you are not comfortable booking the flight yourself.When booking your flight, consider things like layovers and travel time. If you are checking a bunch of bags, the more layovers you have the more likely it is that all of your bags won’t arrive with you. If you are bringing a pet with you on the airplane, you may want to pay a little extra for a direct flight to limit your travel time.
Keep in mind that roundtrip flights are almost always less expensive than one-way flights. So, even if you don’t plan to return to your country of origin, you might want to consider purchasing a roundtrip ticket anyways.

, Ship valuables that you cannot take with you on the plane ahead to France. There are many shipping services you can utilize, but be aware of French governmental restrictions on shipping personal items.These restrictions may vary, but as of 2010 include: Firearms, ammunition, meat, dairy products, plants, narcotics, psychotropic substances, pets, medicine, precious metals, cash, counterfeit items, and wild animals.
If you want to bring your family pets with you to France, you will have to make sure your pet’s vaccinations (especially rabies) are up to date, have your vet complete a health clearance travel form (and possibly get this form stamped by your country’s import/export authority), and ensure that your pet has a microchip. France may require additional measures to be taken for pets being imported from certain countries.Before shipping any items to France, check with the French Consulate to be sure that you have the updated shipping restrictions.

Arrive in France.,
Apply for residency.,
Open a bank account.,
Enroll your children in French schools.",How to Move to France4," Once you have traveled to France, you’ll have to go through border control and customs to enter the country. The officers will definitely want to look at your passport and visa, but they have the right to request additional documentation before allowing you entry.If you are arriving in France with a preexisting visa, it will probably save you some time as you go through customs because the governmental authorities will not investigate your documents as thoroughly (since they know you already went through the vigorous process with the embassy).
If you are getting your travel visa when you arrive, they may ask you some questions about your trip, require proof that you will leave the country within a certain period of time, or request to see various documents. So be prepared for this.

, Once you arrive in France, you’ll need to apply for your permanent resident card, even if you have a visa. To do so, you’ll need to mail in your OFII (Office Français de l'Immigration et de l'Intégration) form that you received with your visa and wait to hear back from them. You will be asked to appear in person at the local préfecture to undergo a simple medical examination and to complete your resident application.Once this is complete, you will be granted your resident permit (carte de séjour) which will be good for one year, regardless of how long your visa has been granted for.
You may need to bring additional documents to your OFII appointment, but they will notify you ahead of time.
You can’t submit your OFII paperwork until after you have already arrived in France.

, If you’re going to be living in France permanently, you should consider opening a bank account at a French institution. This will save you from possibly hefty international transaction fees from using your foreign bank account and bank card while living in France.To do so, you’ll need to bring your passport and proof of residency in France. This could be a copy of your rental agreement or something from your school if you are studying in France.
You will probably have to wait a week or so for your French bank card to arrive in the mail.
Some common banks to use in France include LCL, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Banque Populaire, and La Banque Postale.

, If you’re living in France, you (and your children) are entitled to free education. School is mandatory from ages 6 to 16, so your kids will need to be enrolled.To enroll your children for the first time, you’ll need to contact the service des écoles at your local courthouse (or mairie, in French). They will help you find the school nearest your residence that your child should attend.
You may also consider an international school for your child, especially if they don’t speak French, to ease the transition. However, this type of school may not be free.

Plan to walk.,
Duck into an indoor mall on the Champs Elysees if it rains.,
Be aware of special events.,
Take your time.",How to Shop the Champs Elysees," While almost all of the shopkeepers on the Champs Elysees will speak several other languages, learning to say hello (bonjour) and thank-you (merci) will endear you to the people eager to help you.;
, Most of the tourist offices and hotels in Paris can provide you with a map of the Champs Elysees that highlights the street and identifies landmarks.


Download a digital map to your internationally enabled smart phone, or print one out at home before you leave. Paris Digest has a great i-map available on their website www.parisdigest.com/promenade/champselysees.
Use a Paris travel guide, if you prefer a printed version to a digital one. Most books about Paris will have a section about the Champs Elysees and a map.

, Most of the shops on the Champs Elysees are from 10:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Some stores stay open until 10:00 p.m. on Friday and Saturdays. Most are closed on Sundays and on any public holidays.


Expect varying hours. Each shop on the Champs Elysees sets its own business hours. Some might close during the European ""siesta"" from 1:00 p.m. until about 4:00 p.m. and others might open on Sunday.

, If shops like Cartier, Louis Vuitton and Gaultier are out of your budget,you can still enjoy looking.

, While high end shops are the draw in this neighborhood, you can also shop in popular favorites such as the Gap, Benetton and Sephora.


Prepare to pay in euros. France is part of the European Union, which means all prices will be in euros. You can pay with cash or credit cards at most stores. When you pay by credit, your bank will perform the currency exchange for you when the transaction goes through.
Give yourself a range so you do not overspend. For example, if you decide to spend between $200 and $300 on the Champs Elysees, you will give yourself the freedom to buy several affordable things, or one expensive item.

, Exploring the Champs Elysees on foot will ensure you see all the available shops, and the sidewalks are wide and clean. There are 4 metro stations that run to the area, including the Champs Elysees station.


Walk from one end of the Champs Elysees to the other. Without stopping to shop, it is about a 30 minute walk from Clemenceau metro station on one end to the Charles de Gaulle metro station on the other end.
Flag a taxi to take you back to your hotel if you do too much shopping. Stores will be willing to hold your purchases for you if you find you have too much to carry, and taxis are readily available on the Champs Elysees.

, There are shops indoors to shelter you if the weather gets bad while you shop.

, The Champs Elysees can get crowded on holidays such as New Year's and Bastille Day. There are occasionally parades and festivals held on the street which can either hamper or enhance your shopping experience.


Consult your travel guide for a list of festival dates and special events in Paris. You can also ask about any upcoming events at your hotel.

, Shopping on the Champs Elysees is meant to be enjoyed, so sit down for a cup of coffee and some people watching at one of the cafes along the street.

If you do not have a passport or your passport is set to expire before or during your trip, renew it well in advance.


Check with your national passport granting body about the process and timeframe for getting a passport. In the US, a new passport generally takes one to two months to get, and is issued by the US Department of State.;
, Citizens of certain nations need to procure a visa in addition to a passport in order to travel within France. Check online or with your local French consulate to see if you are required to have a short-term visa to travel in France.British, US, Canadian, New Zealand, South African, and Australian citizens, as well as citizens of EU member nations, must have a valid passport, but do not need a short-term visa in France.If you do need to apply for a visa, contact your nation’s French Embassy or nearest French consulate to inquire about what, specifically, is required to begin the visa application process.

, Solo flight transfers can be difficult if you have a layover in a country where you don’t speak the language, or if you're not part of a large group worth holding the plane for during delays. Save yourself the stress by booking the most direct flight you can reasonably afford.


Check multiple travel websites include deals sites as well as airline sites. Each will have different deals and specials to make certain flights more affordable.If you do have a layover, take a look at airport maps to help familiarize yourself with the gate areas before you fly.
Share your flight itinerary with family or a close friend so that someone can check in and ensure you got to the city safely.

, Paris is divided into 20 neighborhoods, or arrondissements, with lower numbered neighborhoods closer into the city center. Take a look at the attractions you want to see and think about the neighborhood atmosphere you want to experience to pick the best arrondissement for your stay.


The 3rd and 4th arrondissements, often referred to as The Marais, are centrally located and have a good mix of cafes, sights, and shopping. It's safe for solo travelers, and close to many attractions.The 5th arrondissement, or the Latin Quarter, is filled with Gothic architecture, old markets, and boutique hotels. It's preferred by younger solo travelers as a place to meet students and other young adults on an adventure.The 18th and 19th arrondissements offer budget-friendly accommodations and have more of a neighborhood feel than the tourist-crowded city center. It's a great option for backpackers and other long-haul travelers., If you are traveling alone, hostels make excellent accommodations as they are not only budget-friendly, but tend to have inherently social atmospheres. Hostels allow you to find travel companions when you want them, but also allow you the freedom to enjoy solo travel.Some hostels will have both private and dorm rooms, while others will only have dorms. Know that staying in a hostel may mean sleeping on a bunk in room of between three and eleven other people of the same gender. Bathrooms are generally communal.
Some hostels have age restrictions for their guests. Check with a hostel before you book to ensure there are no age restrictions that could stop you from staying there.
Many hostels require that you bring your own towels and toiletries, and some may request you bring some of your own linen. Check with your specific hostel to see what is provided.
Hostels often offer organized group meals as well as tours and outings. Look at the hostel’s website or ask for a calendar to see what sort of social events your hostel offers.

, Sites like Airbnbmake it easy for solo travelers to find safe accommodations by renting a room, apartment, or house for short period of time. Accommodations may be shared, such as renting an individual room, or may include the whole home.


Studio rentals are abundant in Paris, and offer travelers the chance to say close to the city center, often for a lesser price than that of an mid-level hotel. They also offer more security for solo travelers since they aren't as publicly accessible as hotels.
Vacation rentals also offer amenities that hotels do not, like access to a kitchen and neighbors that can recommend different places to eat and things to do around the city.

, When traveling by yourself, the right hotel can be a great way to ensure that you stay safe and get the most out of your travels. Check online reviews before booking to make sure that you are getting a clean, safe hotel room.While not all are bad, budget hotels tend to be riskier in terms of risks such as bedbugs or having items taken from your personal belongings. Look into a budget hotel extensively before booking.
Hotels are often more expensive than vacation rentals or hostels, but generally come with more amenities such as daily cleaning and provided toiletries.

, The Métro is the city’s subway system, and one of the easiest ways to get around the city. Single-ride tickets cost €1,90, and can be purchased from vending machines within the Metro stations. Tickets can also be purchased in bulk for a discount.The Métro runs until 1am from Sunday to Thursday and until 2am on Friday and Saturday.
The Métro is generally safe for solo travelers, but is often crowded and getting on and off often needs to happen quickly.
Grab a Métro map from a Métro station or tourist office, and use it to plan trips in advance so that you know where nearby stations are, where you need to get off, and how to transfer between different Métro lines., Taxis in Paris are abundant, and are generally a quick way to get from one spot in the city to another. Taxi prices vary depending upon where you catch the taxi and your destination, but generally cost around €7-€12. Tipping is not customary, though rounding up to the nearest Euro is often seen as polite.Taxis in Paris are most easily hailed from a station de taxis, a taxi stand indicated with a blue sign. There are over 400 around the city. This is the best way to avoid fake taxis.
Taxis in Paris are subject to strict fare regulations, including a base fare and price per kilometer. Do not accept a “discounted flat-rate fare” from a driver. Make sure the meter is turned on before any taxi ride starts, and leave the taxi if the driver refuses to start the meter.Paris cab drivers are not notorious for knowing or taking the fastest route through the city. Research routes to your destination beforehand, and request that driver take certain routes to avoid them driving up fares by taking longer routes.

, Paris is often regarded as a very walkable city, especially within the city center. Walking around Paris is typically seen as a safe activity, but certain precautions should be taken to avoid higher risk areas, as well as pickpocketing common in the city center.The outer arrondissements are sometimes reported to have higher crime rates and be home to less reputable areas than the city center.
No neighborhood is considered entirely dangerous, but it is recommended that tourists walk along main roads in the outer districts and avoid such areas alone at night.
In the city center, it is recommended that you avoid carry large amounts of cash, and that you wear bags across the body from shoulder to hip, with the bag in front rather than behind you.

, If you are traveling to Paris for the first time, you may want to see some of the more iconic sites such at the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Seeing these sites alone allows you the chance to fully take them in and stay for as long as you’d like.


Booking a tour of famous Parisian sites, either individually or as a group, allows you to experience the sites with others if you would prefer that. It also often allows you to avoid the long lines for individual entry.
Look into booking your tickets in advance either online or through the ticket counter. That way, you can ensure entry on your planned days.

, Paris is home to a number of iconic museums, and traveling solo means you’re in control of what you see when. Take a full day to wander around the Louvre or Musée d’Orsay, or check out the Centre Pompidou or the Musée du Quai Branly as you walk through the city.If you plan on stopping in multiple museums, look into purchasing a Paris Museum Pass, which can offer entry into a number of museums and monuments for single price.
Entry into municipal museums such as the Musée D'Art Moderne and Musée Galliera are free for viewing of the permanent collections.The catacombs are part of the municipal museum system, but have an admission fee associated with them.

, Solo dining is a part of Parisian culture, but meals out in France are often long, drawn-out affairs. Be prepared to spend a few hours dining with yourself, or look for restaurants with counter seating or other solo-diner friendly options.Cafes and bistros are often favored by solo travelers because they allow for a nice meal at one’s own pace, but tend to command more immediate service than a restaurant.
Many bars also offer small plates and dinner options in a comfortable space where you can request the check as fast or slow as you’d like.Do not be afraid to try a restaurant by yourself if you really want to. Treating yourself to a nice meal is perfectly normal in Paris. Just be prepared to take your time at the table.

, Cafes are a prefered spot for breakfast, and often function as community hubs. Grab a pastry and café au lait, and sit down for as long as you please. Cafe are generally considered good areas to read, people-watch, or strike up a conversation with a friendly stranger.Cafes are regular areas for solo travelers to find one another and strike up a conversation or even make plans to see part of the city together.
Cafes make popular breakfast spots, but are generally open throughout the day for you to enjoy a coffee or cup of tea in between meals or sights.

, While Paris certainly has clubs and dancehalls like any city, it is home to a rich bar culture that allows solo travelers the chance to order food, snack alongside their drink, or just generally enjoy a night out. Many bars specialize in serving French wine, and are generally considered safe options for solo travelers to take in some nightlife.Like cafes, bars are great places to read, strike up a conversation with other solo individuals, or simply people-watch.

, Carry your passport, along with your credit cards, with you at all times. Keep them in a secure location, such as in a bag that you carry at the front of your body, and do not remove them unless absolutely necessary.Avoid hiding these items in areas such as your shoes, as while it may be inconspicuous at first, it draws greater attention when you need to access them, making you an easier target for mugging, especially if you are alone.
Make photocopies of your passport and keep them in your luggage or a separate place from your original passport. This can make replacing a lost passport somewhat easier.

, Travelers who come to Paris wearing Hawaiian shirts and baseball caps stick out to petty thieves. Work to blend in by wearing simple, clean, clothes in monochromatic or neutral tones and avoiding conspicuous shows of being a tourist.Avoid wearing combinations such as shorts and a t-shirt, as well as items like baseball caps and fanny packs.
Don’t worry about looking like a high-fashion Parisian. Simply try not to stand out as an easy target for scammers and pickpockets, since solo travelers are already an easy target for petty thieves.

, Wearing a Rolex watch or photographing everything on your iPad advertises to petty thieves that you have items worth stealing. Try to avoid frequent shows of conspicuous wealth in popular or crowded areas.Lock up your valuables in your hostel locker or hotel safe when available, and don’t take them with you unless you need them for a specific purpose.
Opt for inexpensive replacements of expensive accessories. For example, purchase a cheap watch that you wouldn’t mind losing or find a fake piece of costume jewelry to temporarily take the place of your wedding ring.

, If you plan on staying out late, especially if alcohol may be involved, try to find another solo traveler to act as your buddy. You can find them easily at a hostel, or may be able to find a temporary travel partner online using forums on sites like Couchsurfing.For women traveling alone, it is often recommended that you find other solo female travelers. They generally have your best interest at heart because they are in the same situation as you."

Read the assigned material before class.,
Take notes in class.,
Re-read the assigned material after class.",How to Study Science1," Every science class you take will have an associated textbook. And your science teacher will probably tell you which chapters you need to read in advance of every class. Take the time and actually read that material - before class.Knowing what to expect during the lecture will help you absorb the lecture material more effectively.


Highlight important terms and concepts in your textbook.Write down any questions you have. If they aren’t answered in the lecture, make sure to ask.;
, Some science teachers simply go through the textbook in class. Others expand on what the textbook says. If you teacher simply regurgitates the textbook in class, it’s probably more important to pay attention to what is being said, rather then writing everything down. However, if your teacher is expanding on the subject matter, and outlining new concepts in class, make sure you take lots of good notes.Some teachers will provide students with copies of their presentation slides - this is extremely helpful. In this case you only need to make notes in addition to anything already written on the slide, rather than needing to copy the whole slide.
Some teachers may covertly (or overtly) tell you if the topic their discussing will be on the final exam. Make note of this. They’re giving you a freebie - take it!Consider sharing notes with other students. You might have made a note about something they missed, and vice versa. At the very least, make sure you have another student whom you can borrow notes from if you miss a class.

, And re-read your notes. Make corrections or updates to your notes where required. And highlight areas of the textbook where the teacher spent more time.Make a list of any outstanding questions and email or talk to your teacher about them.Rewrite your lecture notes. Condense them this second time around.Create flashcards from key terms and concepts.Re-draw important diagrams by hand. Science includes a lot of diagrams, visualizations and charts, and memorizing them all isn’t an option. Actually drawing them on your own, by hand, will help you remember more of what the diagram means than simply what it looks like."

Be safe.,
Conduct your experiment and record results.,
Write your lab report and submit.",How to Study Science2," Most reports will require the following six sections: an abstract, an introduction, methods and materials, results, discussion and references.Knowing this in advance will ensure you remember to capture all these items during the experiment, where required.

, Know what the experiment consists of, what materials you’ll be using, and any knowledge (theories, concepts, equations, etc.) you'll need to know ahead of time.Re-read appropriate pages of your textbook or notes that related to the experiment you'll be performing. Make brief notes about these theories, concepts or equations and bring them with you to the lab for reference.

, Determine what is required before the lab begins, and have these charts and tables ready to go when the experiment begins.Some lab instructors may provide tables to be used for recording results, in which case you do not need to prepare anything on your own.

, Know the lab rules and safety procedures. Follow the instructions of the experiment properly. Dispose of materials using the proper methods. Notify the lab instructor immediately if anyone is hurt., Follow the proper procedure for each experiment. Be able to identify the variables being used in the experiment, and how each one is controlled. Know what the results should be, and if your result is different, determine why that may be., Use the required format.

Take sample or practice tests.",How to Study Science3," Everyone has different priorities as to what type of study environment works best for them - find yours. Some examples might be: school or public library, classrooms, bedroom or home office, kitchen or dining room table, coffee shop, outside, etc.Try a couple different spots before deciding which one works best for you.
If you find more than one spot that works for you, alternate between them.
Don’t pick a spot that’s a hassle to get to, you might find yourself making excuses that you can’t study because you can’t get to your study location!

, Develop a study routine.Be consistent. Create a schedule that takes your classes into account, and assign yourself regular study time. Go one step further and assign specific tasks to complete during each study session - based on your class syllabus.


When making your study schedule, don’t schedule studying for one topic - say Physics - for six hours in a row one day. Instead, study multiple topics everyday and space Physics out over the course of a couple days. This is called the distributed study method and allows you brain to absorb more information over a shorter period of time.Beware of other activities that may appear in your schedule and reduce your study time. These activities could include a part-time job, hanging out with friends, volunteering, etc. These other activities are important too, but like studying, they need to be done in moderation. Schedule this “fun” time in, but not at the expense of your study time., You may be the only one providing yourself with motivation for studying science, so create rules and stick to them.Possible rules may include:


Reward yourself with a treat (not just food) after every x hours of studying.
Start every study session with a review of previously learned material.
Create a list of objectives for every study session.
Tell someone to follow-up with you about your studying every x hours.
Turn off your cell phone and don’t check your email.

, Take a short break at least every hour.Switch up the topics you study after each break.Breaks shouldn’t just be to stop studying - get up, walk around, go to the bathroom, etc.

, Eat properly balanced meals at somewhat normal times everyday. Exercise on a regular basis. Go to bed and get up at the same time everyday, even weekends. Get a full night’s rest (6-8 hours) every night. Stay positive - if you find yourself becoming too stressed or anxious, seek help., Whatever you ended with last time, start with this time. Review your notes and any problems you went through. Allow this review of materials to jog your memory., Using your class syllabuses, make yourself a list of what you’d like to accomplish in this study session. Prioritize the list based on importance or deadlines, or a combination of both.

, Memorizing simply does not work - unless you have an eidetic memory like Sheldon Cooper. Remembering science concepts is important, but understanding the concepts is more important. It’s easy to forget something you’ve memorized, it’s a lot harder to forget something you’ve learned.If you do need to memorize something, such as the historical timeline for the invention of the telephone, try using memory tricks, such as mnemonics and repetition., The absolute best way to learn a science concept or equation is to understand what it means - to be able to break it down into parts and understand how those parts fit together to result in the concept or equation. For each new concept or equation you should learn: the technical definition, the step-by-step procedures, and the key examples.Use your own words to describe the concept, equation, problems, etc., and your own words to describe how the concept works, or the equation or problem is to be solved.Write an explanation, in your own words, of why a concept, equation or problem is true, or why a concept, equation or problem ends in a certain result.Link new concepts and equations to things you already understand.Something you’ve learned recently may help expand your knowledge of an already known concept.

, Most textbooks have questions and problems at the end of each chapter - work through these as part of your studying. Doing is always better than reading. When answering the questions and problems, do so in detail. Lay out the complete solution as to how you got to your answer, not just the answer.In addition to the questions and problems at the end of a chapter, go through example questions and problems from the textbook on your own. Redo the question or problem without looking at the answers to ensure you understand how it was solved.If you get stuck, take a deep breath and don’t panic. Take a short break and come back and re-try the problem a second time. The second time around start on a new page, slow down, double-check your work, make sure your writing is neat and your solution is organized in a logical manner.When checking the solutions, give yourself a pat on the back for correct answers!
Do a few questions and problems for one chapter or topic every day for a few days - don’t do them all on one day., Crazy concept, I know! But very important. Teachers assign homework for a reason, and you should complete all the homework they assign, whether it will be marked or not.Once you receive your homework back (assuming it was handed in) review your marks and work through any problems you got wrong.


If, after reviewing the problems you got wrong, you were unable to figure out where you made a mistake, go talk to the teacher. Ask them to help walk you through the specific problem and point out where you went wrong.

, Flashcards don’t work for everything, but they’re great for: terms or concepts with specific definitions, diagrams or charts, and equations. You can write your flashcards in one of two ways - to use for testing yourself, where the question is on one side and the answer is on the back; or for review, where you use only the front of the card.Don’t feel you have to stick to actual flashcards (i.e. the small cards made of thick card stock). Some science topics are too complex for something that small. Feel free to use larger paper if required.

, Do as many sample or practice tests as you can. And do not wait until you’re studying for the final exam to do sample or practice tests, do them throughout the semester.Ideally the sample or practice tests should be similar to the ones you’ll actually do in class, but any test where you’re practicing the scientific concept is extremely helpful.

Take turns teaching each other.,
Encourage each other.",How to Study Science4," Study groups are suppose to be groups of people studying - not socializing. That means group members need not be friends, but rather people interested in getting a good grade in the science class.The ideal group size is 3-5 people., The study group should commit to meet at least once a week throughout the semester.Meeting locations should be a place where everyone is comfortable, and ideally contains enough chairs and power outlets for every group member. Having a room with a whiteboard or chalkboard is also ideal.Study sessions should last between 2 and 3 hours, and should include a couple of breaks.

, This is one group member who is responsible to coordinate the meeting times and locations, keeping track of the time, and ensuring the group is following the overall plan (if one was created).A facilitator isn’t required, but is nice to have. However, it’s important for this person to know they are now “in charge” but are simply making sure things are organized and stay on track.

, These goals and objectives can be created for the study group as a whole, or for each study session. If created for each study session, these goals and objectives would include what chapters or topics are to be covered during that session, and how the group members should prepare for the session.Having clear goals and objectives helps make sure the study group stays focused on what they want to accomplish., Use your own words to teach someone else a scientific concept or equation. This will help you understand the topic more clearly, and will also allow your group members to provide feedback on anything that doesn’t make sense. Don’t just teach each other new or unknown items, but use this method to review any and all concepts you’ve already learned., Study groups aren’t just for studying, they’re also for providing each other moral support and encouragement. Make sure you congratulate each other on a job well done. Turn feedback into a positive statement. Come up with fun and exciting methods to learn new materials in your group sessions."

Observe.,
Research the existing knowledge about the question.,
Form your hypothesis.,
List your materials.,
List your procedure.,
Test your hypothesis.,
Analyze your results and draw conclusions.,
Report your findings.,
Conduct further research.",How to Use the Scientific Method," It is curiosity that breeds new knowledge. The process of observation, sometimes called ""defining the question,"" is simple. You observe something that you can't readily explain with your existing knowledge, or you observe some phenomenon that is explained by existing knowledge but which may have another explanation. The question, then, is how do you explain that what causes it to occur;
, Suppose you observe that your car won't start. Your question is, why won't it start? You may have some knowledge about cars, so you'll tap into that to try to figure it out. You may also consult your owner's manual or look online for information about the problem. If you were a scientist trying to figure out some strange phenomenon, you could consult scientific journals, which publish research that other scientists have already done. You'd want to read as much about your question as possible, because the question may have already been answered, or you may find information that will help you form your hypothesis. 

, A hypothesis is a possible explanation for the phenomenon you observed. It is more than a guess, though, because it is based upon a thorough review of the existing knowledge of the subject. It's basically an educated guess. The hypothesis should posit a cause-effect relationship. For example, ""My car won't start because I am out of gas."" It should suggest one possible cause for the effect, and it should be something that you can test and which you can use to make predictions. You can put gas in your car to test the ""out of gas"" hypothesis, and you can predict that if the hypothesis is correct, the car will start once you add gas. Stating the effect like a fact is more like a real hypothesis. For those who are still stuck, use the ""if"" and ""then"" statement: If I try to start my car and it doesn't, then it is out of gas.

, Make sure that all of the tools that you'll need to do this project are listed. If some one else wanted to do your idea, they would need to know ALL of your materials.

, List step by step exactly what you did to test your hypothesis. Once again, this step is important if someone else wants to repeat your experiment. 

, Design an experiment that will either confirm or fail to confirm the hypothesis. The experiment should be designed to try to isolate the phenomenon and the proposed cause. In other words, it should be ""controlled."" Going back to our simple car question, we can test our hypothesis by putting gas in the car, but if we put gas in the car and change the fuel filter, we can't know for sure whether the lack of gas or the filter was the problem. For complex questions, there may be hundreds or thousands of potential causes, and it can be difficult or impossible to isolate them in any single experiment.


Keep impeccable records. Experiments must be reproducible. That is, other people must be able to set up a test in the same way that you did and get the same result. It's important, therefore, to keep accurate records of everything you do in your test, and it's essential that you keep all your data. Today there are archives set up which store the raw data gathered in the process of scientific research. If other scientists need to find out about your experiment they can consult these archives or ask you for your data. It's critical that you be able to provide all the details.

, Hypothesis testing is simply a way to collect data that will help you either confirm or fail to confirm your hypothesis. If your car starts when you add gas, your analysis is pretty simple--your hypothesis was confirmed. In more complicated tests, however, you may not be able to figure out whether your hypothesis is confirmed without first spending considerable time looking at the data you gathered in your hypothesis testing. Furthermore, whether the data confirms or fails to confirm the hypothesis, you must always be on the lookout for other things, so-called ""lurking"" or ""exogenous"" variables, that may have influenced the results. Suppose that your car starts when you add gas, but at the same time the weather changed and the temperature increased from below freezing to well above freezing. Can you be sure the gas, and not the change in temperature, caused the car to start? You may also find that your test is inconclusive. Perhaps the car runs for a few seconds when you add gas, but then dies again.

, Scientists generally report the results of their research in scientific journals or in papers at conferences. They report not only the results but also their methodology and any problems or questions that arose during their hypothesis testing. Reporting your findings enables others to build upon them.

, If the data failed to confirm your initial hypothesis, it's time to come up with a new hypothesis and test it. The good news is, your first experiment may have provided you with valuable information to help you form a new hypothesis. Even if a hypothesis is confirmed, further research is necessary to ensure that the results are reproducible and not just a one-time coincidence. This research is often performed by other scientists, but you may also wish to further investigate the phenomenon yourself.

Use citation programs.",How to Write a Scientific Paper," If you are in a field that crosses disciplines you might need to write the paper a bit differently than if you were aiming the information at one field. You want your study to be accessible to all readers, so you need to write the paper in a way that everyone will understand.


It is a technical paper so you will need to use some technical language, but avoid jargon for the sake of jargon and use acronyms only when absolutely necessary.Define all acronyms the first time you use them.;
, For the most part, journals will require you to use active voice. This is not the case for every journal so make sure to check the style guide before you start writing. To use active voice, write statements like “We performed this experiment…” instead of “The experiment was performed…”, If you are submitting the paper to a journal for publication, they will have a style guide or author guide that details all of the necessary formatting. It will tell you the maximum word count, the margin size, the font size/style, references format, etc. Following the author guide is absolutely necessary when submitting the paper for publication.


Any restrictions on table/figure sizes, table/figure legends will also be included in the style guide.

, Every scientific paper is structured the same way. It starts with an abstract that briefly summarizes the paper and then leads into an introduction. The materials and methods come next, followed by the results. The paper concludes with the discussion section and a list of references.Some journals move the materials and methods to the end of the paper and/or combine the results with the discussion section. Check the style guide for the specific journal you are submitting to.
Although this is the order the paper will be published in, it is not the best order to write each section. Follow the steps in the “Writing the Sections” for the best way to compose the paper., When you sit down to write your scientific paper, the first section you want to write is the materials and methods section. It is the easiest place to start and doesn’t require much time to complete. The methods should be described clearly and anyone with the proper training should be able to replicate your experiments based on this section.Materials used for each method should be included, with references to the company and catalog number for purchase.
You should include a description of all statistical methods used in the paper.
You should also include explanations of any ethical approvals needed for the completion of the studies.

, The results section is pretty self-explanatory. It is the portion of the paper where you describe the results that were obtained during the course of the study. Results should be reported neutrally and reference any tables and figures included in the paper.You can summarize the findings, but do not discuss the data.You don’t need to include every experiment you performed or result you observed, just the information needed to convince the audience of your findings.This is not the section to speculate or draw conclusions. That comes later in the discussion.

, This is where you interpret your results and discuss them in the context of what is already known about your topic. Draw conclusions about the data and talk about future experiments you would like to do to further the study. The goal is to convince the reader that this data is important and they should care about it. Avoid simply repeating what you have already said in the results section.Avoid making wild claims that can’t be supported by the data.Don’t ignore other papers that contradict your findings; discuss them and convince the reader why your data is correct despite the other information out there.
Some journals combine the results and discussion into one larger section. Check with the journal before you begin writing., The introduction is where you convince readers that the study you have done is important and tell them why it is important. This section should thoroughly review the available literature, discussing the problem, its significance, existing solutions, and the gap your work is trying to fill.State your hypothesis and objectives at the end of the introduction.Avoid long introductions; you want to be comprehensive, but succinct.

, Save the abstract until the rest of the paper is complete. The length of this section is usually dependent upon the journal, but is generally around 250 words. It is a short summary to tell the readers what you did and what the important findings were. The final sentence should offer some interpretation/conclusion about the findings.Think of the abstract as an advertisement to encourage people to keep reading.

, The final aspect of the paper to complete is to write the title. You want the title to be specific and reflect the data that is presented in the paper. This is the teaser for the paper, so you want to grab their attention. At the same time, you want to be succinct and use as few words as possible.Avoid technical jargon and abbreviations/acronyms.

, The way you present the data is completely up to you, but there are some guidelines to help you decide the best way to show it to readers. Tables are used to present the raw data of the experiment while figures are used to illustrate comparisons.If the data can easily be stated in one-two sentences, there is no need for a figure or a table.Tables are frequently used to provide information about the makeup of a study group or the concentrations used within a study.
Figures are used to compare the experimental results of the different groups in a visual way.

, When presenting data in a table, you must align any decimal points in numbers. You also never separate columns with vertical lines. Tables include short self-explanatory titles and brief legends to explain acronyms.Don’t include tables if they are not referenced in the text. You can add these tables to an appendix if absolutely necessary.

, When constructing a figure, avoid adding too many datasets to one graph. This will look cluttered and will be difficult for the reader to understand. You may need to split the data into multiple graphs.This does not change the way the data is analyzed or interpreted, it just makes it easier to see.


Avoid adding more than 3-4 datasets per graph.
Label all axes properly and use the appropriate scales.

, When using microscope images or photographs of specimens, a scale bar must be included so the reader understands the size of what they are looking at. Make the scale bar clear, the font size easily readable, and include it in the corner of the image.If the image is dark, make the scale bar white. If the image is light, make the scale bar a contrasting dark. If the reader can’t see the scale bar, it is not useful.

, If the paper is for a course, this step doesn’t necessarily apply. If you are submitting to a journal, there are substantial fees associated with color images, so avoid using colored figures if you can use line styles or patterned graphs instead.If you do use color, use complementary mute colors that don’t scream off the page.

, When making the figure, the font may look perfectly legible, but keep in mind it will be smaller when placed into the paper itself. Before you turn the paper in, look through all of the figures and make sure that all of the text is readable without having to squint., The figure legend shouldn’t be too long, but should give enough information to the reader for them to interpret the data without reading the corresponding text in the paper.Spell out any acronyms used.


The figure legend should be positioned underneath the figure itself.

, Every source should be cited directly within the paper. If you are making a statement based on information read in a book or another journal article, it needs to be cited directly after the statement.If you have multiple references that support one fact, cite all of them. Keep in mind, more citations doesn’t make a better paper.


Cite peer-reviewed literature, manuscripts, and published data.
Avoid personal communications, submitted, but unpublished manuscripts, and articles not in English., If you are submitting the paper for publication, the journal you are submitting to will have a specific style guide that will detail the format of inline citations and the reference list at the end. If the paper is for a course, ask your professor for the format.Some journals use an inline citation of (Author, Publication Year) with an alphabetical list at the end. Other journals simply use superscript numbers within the paper and have the numbered list of references at the end., Make sure the source you are using accurately reflects the information you are saying. If the source doesn’t support your statement, do not use it or find a different source.


Paraphrase the source and avoid direct quotes. If you must quote directly, put the information in quotation marks and specify the page the quote came from., You want your paper to be well-cited, but if you have a limit, you want to make sure you are citing important information that supports your conclusions. If you’re unsure about information, err on the side of caution and cite it.


If something is considered to be common knowledge in the field, it is not necessary to cite it. For example, stating that DNA is the genetic material of an organism does not need a citation.

, The easiest way to compile all of your references is to use a software program such as Endnote or Mendeley. These programs organize the references within the paper and make sure the format is correct. Many journals have a citation format that you can download and import into the reference manager that will update all of your references to the format required for that journal.Reference managers help avoid incorrect citations and save you hours of work updating the list of citations individually as you go.

Consider the essential role of enzymes in metabolism.,
Determine whether heat is necessary in the reaction.,
Examine the structure of enzymes.,
Understand the role of enzyme inhibition in fighting disease.",How to Understand the Structure and Function of Enzymes (Enzymology)," Enzymology is a discipline of science that belongs formally to the area of study which is called biochemistry or molecular cell biology. This area of science deals with the investigation of structure and mechanism of function of the various enzymes in the body of humans and also in microorganisms such as bacteria. Kinetics of enzymes function is one important area in the research of enzymes mechanism of metabolic reactions catalysis. Usually metabolic reactions in humans and in living microorganisms are all mediated by specific enzymes each is specific for a given specific metabolic reaction. These metabolic reactions are mostly different in their mechanism than reactions that are usually processed in the organic chemical laboratory.
, Many organic reactions proceed without the assistance of catalysts but others require catalysts that can be solvent soluble or solvent insoluble. In addition most reactions in the organic laboratory require heat to proceed. This condition of using heat to promote reactions is not possible in the body. Therefore other conditions are used in the body in order to force the reaction to proceed. In the body all reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes that usually function by lowering the free energy of Gibbs of the metabolic reaction that they catalyze. For this reason that metabolic reactions are unable to proceed without the help of the enzyme the investigation of this unusual function of this catalyst was crucial to the understanding of how these reactions occur., Enzymes are polymers of amino acids that have unusual structure and function. Each enzyme in the body has different sequence of amino acids which is called the primary structure of the enzyme. This primary structure is built based on a genetic code that is mediated by the sequence of the DNA bases on the same strand. This unique primary structure of enzymes can be altered and changed based on a change in the sequence of DNA bases that can be triggered by cancer for example. Cancer is usually caused by a change in the sequence of DNA bases or by a change in the manner of pairing between bases of DNA on different strands. This in turn can alter the genetic code for the translation process of enzymes making them defective in structure and function.

Enzymes in the blood have unusual tertiary structure that has an active site which is a small hall in its structure. This active site is of utmost importance for the catalytic process of metabolic reaction in the body. This active site contains few amino acids which are responsible for the whole catalytic activity of the enzyme. Therefore knowing the structure of these amino acids is very important in order to identify the mechanism by which the catalytic activity of the enzyme proceeds. Also the kinetics by which the enzyme performs its catalytic activity is studied based on knowing the amino acids that participate in the catalysis of the metabolic reaction.

, Kinetics of enzymes is a whole branch of enzymology. The design of pharmacological drugs that target the enzyme active site and block its function is a main strategy to fight diseases in humans that originate due to infection by microorganisms or due to cancer in the body. In both cases the drug blocks the active site of enzymes that are crucial for the normal metabolic reactions in the life of the microorganism or the drug can target key enzymes in the process of cancer cells formation in the body. The inhibition process of enzymes has also its own laws of kinetics describes the type of inhibition that each drug makes. The most useful type of inhibitor is of the irreversible type of inhibition. This type of inhibition can potentially neutralize completely the catalytic function of the enzyme. This type of enzyme inhibition is called noncompetitive inhibition. The other type of enzyme inhibition is of the reversible type of inhibition. This type of inhibition is characterized by its reversible nature that can be removed by increasing the physiological substrate in the blood.

Usually enzymes primary structure is composed of hundreds of amino acids. However for the purpose of elucidating its mechanism of catalysis it is sufficient to know the composition of amino acids in its active site. Inhibition of enzyme function is one way of treating diseases in the body of humans and is major area of research in the biochemical science.

Radio Waves
Microwaves
Terahertz Radiation
Infrared Light (IR)
Visible Light
Ultraviolet Rays (UV)
X-Rays
Gamma Rays
By understanding these names, you will need to know its range. Below is showing a table of the range.

;
, Read on if you want to find out about the general idea and the detailed information that you can learn from., Many things use this kind of radiation. They are all listed below.

Submarines
Mines
Time signals
AM Radio
Shortwave Radio
FM Radio
Amateur Radio
Line-of-sight ground-to-aircraft and aircraft-to-aircraft communications
TV

, You can research it on the internet. You don't have to memorize all of the things that use radio waves and what range that it uses, but it is vital to actually have a general idea.
, A folder stored in a drawer is the best idea, but other ideas are good too. Also, below is how things work with radio waves (the y in the picture is short for gamma rays). Do this step last after every section., Certain objects use this kind of radiation, but not very many (at least not as many as radio waves). Microwave energy is produced with klystron and magnetron tubes, and with solid state diodes such as Gunn and IMPATT devices. Microwaves use microwaves to heat up food. They are actually absorbed by the water, sugar, and fat in the food, and that is why they heat up. The plate stays cool since it doesn't have any water or fat. The power level varies on the energy of the microwave., You only need to get the general idea. For example, for microwaves, you only need to know that the microwaves are absorbed by water, sugar, and fat when heating them up. You don't need to know about how it works, or the complex algebra that it uses. If you do this, it will be very hard to remember (which will be discussed later) and you might fail. It is best to remember some detailed information that you can remember, but not the ones you can't., For example, microwaves are used for heating up food depending on the power level. If items were invented, and they were never used, would it be some extra item taking up space?, This technology includes transmitting telephone calls and the relay of television programs to transmitter antennas, between two locations on a ""line of sight path."" In microwave radio relay, radio waves are transmitted between the two towers at locations with directional antennas, forming a fixed radio connection between the two points. Long chained series of such links form transcontinental telephone and/or television communication systems., Antennas used must have a high directive effect; these antennas are installed in elevated locations such as large radio towers in order to be able to transmit across longer distances without obstructions in the path., It includes cameras, tracking, night vision, and remotes. There are many more things that use infrared waves, but the 4 listed above is a good start. Later on, you can research more on Wikipedia. If you want to understand how these work, you can teach other people, and you might become an engineer. However, most people don't do that, and merely gets it into their thought., Again, you don't need to know about the ""scientific method,"" but you can get some information about how the geo-thermal technology works in order to determine the temperature of something. For cameras which use infrared light waves of about 1-20 micrometers, you should understand how it works and where the infrared light will come in., Basically do the same thing for Infrared light and the other parts to the spectrum (shown above by steps). They will be all the same. When you are finished with the gamma rays, you should move on to how to remember these things (it may seem complicated to you, but you will get used to it)., The spectrum contains information that may lead to more inventions even in the modern world. If you do wish to be a scientist, or are already one, be aware of all the possible combinations that can lead to success., The information you researched can make a difference in real life., Again, this may be important. You must learn the concept before you become more aware of the situation., This isn't something to stress out with. Try not to when you realize that you still have much to learn. It takes time and patience, and by using it wisely, you can accomplish your goals. Maybe you could think of an idea for a pair of UV or even X-Ray goggles. It all depends on you."

Inspect centrifuge bottles/tubes for cracks before use.Because a centrifuge can spin at such high speeds, a liquid sample can easily become an aerosol if it is not properly contained.,
Cap tubes with the proper lid.,
Clearly label tubes for identification.,
Wipe the outside of the tube with disinfectant before placing it in the centrifuge.,
Make a counterbalance for the centrifuge tube you want to put in the centrifuge.",How to Use a Centrifuge1," Cracked tubes can fracture at high speeds or at the very least, leak sample into the rotor.


Discard broken or cracked tubes to prevent them from accidentally being used in the future.;
, Tubes that have been specified for use with a centrifuge have a proper cap or lid that seals the tube. Using a different lid or covering such as saran wrap or foil can easily lead to spills within the centrifuge.Making an aerosol of your sample can be hazardous to your health and the environment. In addition, it can lead to loss of precious samples.

, You may know how you placed your tubes into the centrifuge before they started spinning, but at the end of the spin you will not be able to tell them apart. Make sure you put some sort of label on each tube so you know which sample is which.If you have a balance, be sure you label it as such.


It is best to label the tube directly instead of using a sticker. A sticker can fall off during the spin making identification difficult.

, Wiping the tube is particularly important if you are working with a biohazardous material.You want to limit any possible spills or aerosol formation of your sample. The best prevention is to wipe down the sample with a proper disinfectant before the spin begins.

, At high speeds, a centrifuge can easily become unbalanced if there aren’t equal masses opposite each other in the rotor. Remember to balance the masses of the tubes, not the volumes. Weigh the tube with your sample and record the mass. Add water to a separate empty tube until the mass is the same as your sample.Unbalanced tubes can lead to permanent damage of the centrifuge and can be hazards if the rotor breaks free from the rest of the centrifuge.
Balancing is extremely important at higher centrifugation speeds.
Many centrifuges will automatically turn off if it senses an unbalanced load, but older ones may not have this feature. If the centrifuge begins to shake or wobble, it is off balance and you should stop it immediately.

"
"
Place the centrifuge on a firm, level surface.,
Choose the proper rotor to use at the speed you need.,
Load the tubes opposite each other in the centrifuge.,
Enter the centrifugation speed.,
Keep a safe distance while the centrifuge is running.,
Turn off the centrifuge if it is wobbling.,
Open the lid only after the rotor has completely stopped.Many modern centrifuges have a lock on them that will not unlock until the rotor has come to a stop.,
Remove the tubes carefully after the centrifuge has completely stopped spinning.,
Wipe down rotor and centrifuge after each use.",How to Use a Centrifuge2," Because of the high speeds the centrifuge spins at, it needs to be housed on a solid, flat surface. Find a level table or counter that is secure and can properly support the weight of the centrifuge.


If you notice the centrifuge sliding around or the counter underneath sagging, relocate the centrifuge to a more stable place.

, The rotor is the piece that spins your sample. Some rotors have arms that you can attach smaller buckets to, while other rotors are one piece that you place the tubes directly into. Rotors are designated for specific tubes and speeds. Use a rotor that fits the tubes of your sample and is within the limit of speed needed.


If your samples are in the wrong type of tube, you may need to transfer them to the proper type before spinning.

, If you are only spinning one sample, you will need to make a balance to load directly opposite the sample tube.If you are spinning more than two tubes, only the ones directly opposite each other have to be equal in mass.

, Centrifugation speed is often given in rotations per minute (rpm), or how many times the rotor completes a full rotation in one minute. Speed can also be given in relative centrifugal force (RCF) or the G-force on the rotor.Modern day centrifuges are digital and have settings for both.


The speed at which you spin your samples is dependent upon what you are spinning.

, Bumping or moving the centrifuge during use can cause an imbalance and lead to injury.Larger centrifuges can spin at very high speeds and are extremely dangerous if they become imbalanced.

, After starting the centrifuge, stay close until it gets up to full speed in case it needs to be turned off. When a centrifuge is off balance it may shake or wobble. This can damage the equipment and can also lead to injury in severe cases. If you cannot get to the power button, simply unplug the centrifuge.Many centrifuges will automatically turn off if it senses an unbalanced load, but older ones may not have this feature. If the centrifuge begins to shake or wobble, it is off balance and you should stop it immediately.
A small amount of vibration is normal, but excessive wobbling is dangerous.
If your samples are balanced and the wobble still occurs, stop using the centrifuge and call for maintenance.

, Older centrifuges may not have this feature so make sure the rotor is no longer moving before opening the lid.


Keep power cords away from the ground to avoid trip hazards that could move the centrifuge.

, You want to gently remove the tubes so that the separated suspensions do not mix again. You also want to check to see if any of the samples have leaked or tubes have broken.


If a spill occurs, clean rotor and buckets immediately.

, To keep the centrifuge clean and running smoothly, lightly clean the rotor and wipe down the centrifuge at the end of a run. When you are finished, leave the lid open so it can air out and remain dry.

Understand that the atomic theory has come a long way.,
Know that atoms are very small.,
Know that atoms consist of a small core or nucleus and orbiting electron(s).,
Know that all chemistry is determined by the number of protons in a nucleus.,
Know that most atoms have an equal number of electrons to balance the electrical charge of their protons.,
Understand that atoms also contain neutrons, which are not charged.,
Celebrate that you are made of atoms!",How to Understand Atoms," The ancient Greek philosophers are usually credited with first inventing the idea of atoms, but the idea had currency from a lot of other common observations, such as noticing that adding salt to water makes all the water salty.;
, A very large number called Avogadro's number is how many atoms are required to make 12 grams of carbon. To give an idea of how big this number is, a thousand has three zeroes, a million has six zeroes, a billion has nine but Avogadro's number has 23 zeroes!

, The simplest atom is hydrogen, which consists of a single proton in the nucleus and a single orbiting electron.

, If an atom has six protons, it will behave as carbon. Protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged.

, Atoms which do not have an equal number of electrons and protons are known as ions. Atoms can have too many electrons, in which case they are negatively charged, or too few and they will be positively charged., They ""balance"" the charge in a nucleus and are not involved in Chemistry directly. An atom with more neutrons will tend to have a higher boiling point for instance, but otherwise will undergo exactly the same chemical reactions.

, Everything you have ever touched, breathed or seen has been made of atoms.

Receive your results.",How to Test Hair for Drug Use1," If you need or want to have a hair sample tested at a professional laboratory, make an appointment at a time that is convenient for you. This can help ensure that you get a sample that most effectively will provide results about longer-term patterns of drug use.It is much easier to skew blood and urine test results. If you need a definitive sample, a lab hair test may be the best option for you.Most professional labs offer hair testing that is safe, private, and secure and can give you relatively quick results, especially if you aren’t using drugs.Some labs will allow you submit your own sample through the mail.Groups such as Quest Diagnostics or other laboratory groups have offices all around the United States that you can contact about scheduling your drug test.;
, The day of your lab appointment, wash and dry your hair before you arrive. This may help the lab more easily collect and test your hair sample.


You can use any gentle shampoo and conditioner you like to cleanse your hair.
Make sure to rinse any shampoo and conditioner out of your hair so that the lab can most effectively test your sample. You may also want to avoid using any products such as gel, mousse, or hairspray.

, Try and get to your appointment at least 15 minutes in advance of your scheduled appointment. This can give you time to ask questions or fill out any necessary paperwork.


Make sure to take any diagnostic prescriptions your doctor or employer has ordered. You may require testing only for certain drugs including amphetamines, opiates, cocaine, marijuana, or PCP., In order to test your hair, the lab will collect a small sample from the crown of your head. The sample is collected under the supervision of someone to help ensure its integrity for whatever purpose you need it.The lab tech will cut about 100-200 strands of hair from the crown of your head.She will cut your hair as close to the scalp as possible, but will not pull out or test your hair follicles.The sample collection should be a painless procedure.

, The lab at which you choose to be tested will run tests on the sample you provided. Most labs use a two-tiered process to test hair samples.This includes:


Screening a portion of the hair sample using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), which is a reliable method to analyze for longer-term drug use.
Samples that are suspected positive will undergo further testing using either gas chromatography or mass spectrometry to confirm use of specific substances., Depending on the nature of your test results, you can receive the necessary information in as little as 24 hours.Once you’ve received your results, provide them to the necessary employer or authority, or use the information for yourself.


Samples that are negative for drug use are often released within as little as 24 hours, which can help give you some relief if you’re nervous.If your sample tests positive or is on the border, it will likely undergo a second set of testing to confirm results and establish which substances are present in your system. Usually you can receive these results within 72 hours.If you have any concerns about your sample, you may want to have a second set of tests done.

Since many have different services, you may want to consider which company and test best suits your need.Groups such as Quest Diagnostics and HairConfirm offer lab results for sample collected at home.These tests offer the same privacy and security as tests one has done in a laboratory.Some companies offer different types of tests that analyze your sample for a host of drugs from illicit substances to prescription medication. Choose the one best suited to your needs.You can order at-home hair drug testing online at lab sites and even from some pharmacies., You’ll need to cut a small amount of your hair to send in to the laboratory associated with your at-home kit. Make sure to ensure the integrity of your test by clipping and sending a sample of your own hair, which may help prevent any uncomfortable situations in the event of later random drug tests.


Clip as close to your scalp as you are able without tearing out any of your strands.Collect approximately 100-200 strands of hair for the most accurate sample.Some tests may require few strands of hair, so follow packaging directions.Make sure your hair is clean when you collect the sample.

, You’ll need to mail your sample to the company associated with the at-home test you’ve chosen. Properly preparing can help minimize the risk of any cross contamination or losing the sample’s integrity.Place your hair sample inside of foil, a plastic bag, or other container provided by the kit.Once the sample is secure, put it in the envelope or box that accompanies the kit.Fill out any necessary documentation required by the at-home test. In some cases, this will require you to provide information online and along with your sample., Once you’ve sealed the sample and filled out any required documentation, ship the package to the respective testing lab. You can usually use regular mail or express services to obtain your results.Depending on what kind of testing you choose, you may only be able to use express shipping services.You may want to opt for delivery confirmation to ensure that your sample arrives and is tested in a timely manner.

, Most at-home hair drug testing kits report results online using a secure system. If this is the case, register your sample identification number and passcode with the proper company to ensure that you get your results as quickly as possible.Make sure to note the sample ID number and passcode so that you can access your results without difficulty.You can track the results of your test using this online system., Once the lab receives your sample, it will commence testing it. Labs may employ e a two step process to determine possible drug use.The screening often includes:


Determining drug use through an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), a reliable test to confirm longer-term consumption.
Any sample that may test positive usually undergoes additional testing through gas chromatography or mass spectrometry, which can confirm use of specific substances., Once the lab receives your sample, it takes about 24-48 hours to receive your results. Accessing the lab report site on a regular basis can help ensure you get your results as soon as possible.Log in to the company's website using the sample ID number and passcode provided in your kit.Evaluate the test results to see if you had positive or negative results, and, if positive, for which drug class(es).With a positive test result, the lab will include an assessment of the hair dose response. This can identify whether the donor is an occasional, weekend, daily or constant user.
You can download the test result report, print it and provide the hard copy to any party that may need it.

Attach the stringed/wired balls to the frame bar.,
Restore the bar to the frame.,
Assess your work.",How to Untangle a Newton's Cradle," You should do this in a well lit area, perhaps with a flashlight and magnifying glass handy.


Figure out the number and location of the knots that have formed.
See if you can follow which ball's string has gone around which other string or location on the cradle frame if that is the case.
You might take this chance to manually tug on the knot to see if it will pry loose. If it only tightens, you need to stop and proceed with the alternatives.;
, Either is possible, and if you are unsure which you have by visual inspection, you might check the packaging the cradle originally came with.If you are unsure what material the balls are suspended from the frame with, consider taking the cradle into a hardware store to have a professional look at it.
String will be easier to handle regarding tools, but will be more delicate and likely to break.
Wires will need better tools, but will be more durable while you work.

,


If you think the wires or strings are too badly damaged to simply untangle, you may have to replace them instead of just untangle them.
If you damage the strings or wires during the untangling process, you may need to replace some of them anyway.

, This will vary a bit depending on if you are dealing with string or wire.If you have a string-based cradle, a needle or pin may help with the prodding part of undoing the knot. A standard pair of scissors should suffice for cutting if it comes to that.
If you are handling a wire-based cradle, you will need wire cutters

, Desktop cradles are not usually expensive, so a replacement for the entire device may be a better option than a repair.


If replacement string/wire is not readily available, a full device replacement is probably a better option.
If you do not have the tools for undoing the knot or cutting the wire, getting a new cradle is a choice you should put more thought into.
The repair itself can be a very painstaking, tedious process. So if you are unsure if you have the patience for the detail of the task, then a replacement cradle may be the way to go.

, Whether you untangle or cut the wires, you will need to do a few things to make sure the cradle is in working order when you are done.Mark or make a measurement note of where the wires are attached to the top bar. This is crucial to ensure the balls are suspended the correct distance apart again when you complete the repair.
Measure how far the balls are supposed to be from the bar to the bottom of the frame.
Make sure you have replacement strings or wires on hand. Make sure they are approximately the same thickness as the ones suspending the balls already if you have to do a swap-out. If you swap one, its best to swap out all of them to the same material or risk deviations in performance.
Fishing wire or string will work. Whatever you choose, you will need to be able to cut and tie it if a swap occurs. Measure them so they are equal in length not only to each other, but to the length the original string/wires are.

, Set it so all of the balls are resting flat on the table.


Make sure the balls are not rotating and getting even more tangled.
You might find something heavy to brace the frame of the cradle with if keeping it stable is an issue.
Keep a stationary lamp on to shine a light on your work.

, Use your hands at this point to maneuver the balls slowly and gently along the flat of the table so you can see the knots.


Try to work the tangled balls in reverse around their respective tangles.
Stop if the tension is tightening and not loosening.
Any excessive force risks breaking the string/wire, so proceed cautiously.

, After you've exposed the knots, you can now proceed to prodding them loose with your pin/needle. Do this one knot at a time.


Insert the pin into the center cluster of the knot.
Try not to insert the pin into the string/wire itself or you might fray it, and make working it unmanageable.
Wiggle the pin in the center until the knot loosens and then withdraw the pin slowly.
Repeat this with the other knots.

, The loose knots should give you a clearer view of where each string/wire leads to a ball.


Find the last ball that went through the knot you are working on.
Grasp a hold of the last ball and the string/wire that passes through the knot you are working on.
Gently coax the wire and ball through the hole you opened up in the loosened knot cluster.
If you notice things tightening up, you may have grabbed the wrong string and ball, so check again.
Repeat this for the ball until it's free on its own string. Consider securing it with a zip tie or similar to the frame so it doesn't get tangled back up with the others.
Repeat these steps again for each ball.

, If the knots do not loosen, or you cannot undo them without breaking the wire, then cutting the string/wire may be an option.Only attempt this if you have extra string/wire handy to replace the ones you cut.
You should replace all of the strings/wires with the same kind to avoid deviations in performance.
You will need scissors for string or wire cutters for metal wires.

, Risk of injury is low, but thin wires, scissors, and wire cutters are potential hazards. So consider using gloves and eye protection. You will be retaining the balls and frame.Have a container ready to save the balls so they don't get lost. You will need to use your fingers to pull loose remaining string from the bar on the top of the frame.
The balls will also have a peg that the string/wires are attached to. If you cannot pull the string/wire out of the peg or loop of the ball still, you may need to cut again closer to the ball to free it and then pull the remaining string/wire bits out by hand.

, Frame construction varies greatly, so if there are instructions that came with your cradle regarding assembly, you may want to consult them.


Find a way to remove the frame sides and bar from each other. If they are one piece, this would require significantly more powerful metal cutting and reassembly tools and is not recommended--in the latter event you should reconsider replacing the entire device.
Once the frame is disassembled, collect the bar and new strings/wires you prepared earlier.

, You need to make sure the are the right length for the balls to fit the frame, but you also have enough to work with for fastening to the frame bar.Retrieve your measurement of the balls' necessary distance from the bar to the bottom of the frame.
Prepare each string/wire so its triple this length so you have enough for tying and adjusting.
Use a tape measure to acquire the measurement. Use scissors on the strings, wire cutters on the wires to achieve the desired length.

, Thread them through the hole or notch in the top of the bead and tie them together.


If you can set up a stationary magnifying glass, it may help see your work better.
You should have plenty of extra slack on the string/wire length to not have to redo a bad knot, but if you do--cutting and replacing the string is better than trying to undo the knot at this point.
Repeat this for each ball.

, Lay the bar flat on a table for this so measurements can be taken.


Note the marks or measurements where the original strings/wires were attached.
Try to re-fasten or re-tie the new strings/wires of each ball to the bar in the original places.
Take advantage of the extra string/wire slack to adjust the distance of the ball to the bar so it matches the original distance measurement from the frame.
Compare the new strings/wires of each ball to see if their distance from the bar is the same. If not, adjust it so it is before you do a final tie-off or fastening.

, Again, so the balls don't re-tangle themselves, its best to do this while the bar is still lying mostly flat on a table.


Find something to brace the balls with if necessary.
Place the frame pieces around the bar in the configuration it originally came in.
Reinsert the bar slowly, careful not to jar the balls in the process.
Stand the device upright slowly while holding the balls in their line and let them down gently.

, If the balls are visually not in alignment, you will have to disassemble the bar and frame and repeat the string/wire measurement process.


If this happens, you should have enough excess string/wire leftover to just cut a little and readjust. Otherwise, you will have to completely replace the string/wire on the problem-ball(s).
If you are unsure if the alignment is proper, use a ruler or tape measure to calculate each ball's vertical distance from the bar/frame and see if they match up. If not, you will have to readjust.

Replicate the experiment.",How to Think Like a Scientist," The first step in the scientific method is formulating a question. Make some observation of the world around you, and pose it as a question. You will then use the scientific method to investigate the question and attempt to answer it.The scientific method can be applied to all sorts of questions, for example, you could ask “Will I save money if I stop shopping at Store A and buy my groceries at Store B instead?”;
, It is likely that someone has asked a similar question in the past and gotten some answers. Research your question using the internet, the library, or other records. Even if you do not find an exact answer, you will gain an understanding of the variables that you need to consider in your experiment.For example, you might find that someone did a study of the prices of groceries at Store A depending on the time of year. While this doesn’t answer your entire question, it does bring to your attention that you should consider the time of year in your experiment.

, Once you have a thorough understanding of your question, you will need to develop a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a statement that reflects your educated guess as to what the answer to your question might be. A hypothesis absolutely must be falsifiable, or able to be disproven.Start your hypothesis with an educated guess. For example, if you have shopped at Store A and Store B before and you have an instinct that Store B might be cheaper, you could build your hypothesis around that thought.
A good hypothesis would be “Store B has lower prices than Store A.” A bad hypothesis would be “The prices of Store B are set by invisible magicians that can never be discovered by people.”

, Hypotheses are useful because they allow you to predict the outcome of one thing based on your knowledge about it. Then, you can adjust your hypothesis based on whether or not it was disproven. Keep in mind that a hypothesis can never be “proven.” It must always remain falsifiable, unless it is disproven. For example, your prediction might be “If I shop at Store B, I’ll save money.”

, An experiment is a test, or series of tests, to disprove your hypothesis. If the experiment fails to disprove your hypothesis, that means that it may be suitable for making predictions about the question you have posed. If the experiment disproves your hypothesis, it means that the hypothesis does not accurately predict the outcome of the situation.You might decide that your experiment will be to shop at Store A and Store B and compare the money you spent at each store.

, Once the experiment is laid out, you will need to carry out the steps. It is important not to carry out the experiment with bias. The scientific method does not allow for tweaking the experiment to make the results fit what you want.For example, you must commit to buying the same foods at each store for a fair comparison. You should not buy the name brand at Store A, and the off brand at Store B to draw the conclusion that Store B is cheaper.
In this scenario, the foods serve as your control and the stores are your variables.

, Sometimes, experiments do a poor job of testing the hypothesis. When this happens, you have to troubleshoot your experiment. Ask yourself what went wrong, and how can the next experiment address these issues.For example, you could compare receipts from each store and think that you are saving $15 per week, but you only notice an extra $5 per week leftover..
Upon a closer investigation, you realize that you have to buy extra gas each week to get to Store B, and that detracts from your savings. At this point, you would need to redesign your experiment to include gas receipts as well.

, Once you have completed your experiment, you will be able to analyze the data. You will either find trends that are consistent with your hypothesis, inconsistent with your hypothesis, or no trend at all. Inconsistent trends, or no trends, will disprove your hypothesis.Looking at the receipts from each store would allow you to analyze how money was spent during the experiment.
If your hypothesis constantly makes accurate predictions, it may become a theory.

, The data and trends will allow you to draw conclusions about your hypothesis. Sometimes, this will be easiest to express in words, and other times it is more suitable to use graphs or charts to summarize your conclusions. Either way, it is important to keep in mind that even if your hypothesis gave predictions consistent with this experiment, it is still a falsifiable hypothesis.You could summarize the conclusions of your shopping experiment by entering the the totals you spent at each store into a spreadsheet and generating a graph from the data. This would make it easy to see if Store A or Store B saved you money.

, For an experiment or a result to be scientific in nature, it must be replicable. You, or someone else, must be able to reproduce the same results each time you do the experiment. If your results cannot be replicated, then your hypothesis is not supported.If you go to the Store B and save money one time, but do not save money consistently when going to Store B, your results are not replicable.

, Additional versions of the experiment can be carried out by yourself or by someone else. The scientific method is designed so that anyone can get the same results when doing any experiment, given that they are knowledgeable about the procedures. The more times your hypothesis is supported, the stronger it becomes.You can replicate the store experiment by going to both stores multiple times and comparing your results. You could also have a friend go to both stores and analyze their data.

Have a separate notebook for Science.,
Start a brand new page for a new topic.,
Choosing a note-taking method.",How to Take Notes for Science1," It can confusing when you have all your notes from all your subjects crammed into one notebook. So you might want to think about have a separate notebook for social studies so it doesn't get mixed up with your math and language arts notes.;
, It doesn't matter if the last section stopped halfway through a page, that subject of notes has ended and you need to start a new page. This will prevent any confusion about what subject is what when going back to your notes to study off of later.


When a subject is continued onto a new piece of paper, add the word continued next to the title. For example, ""The Civil War Continued.""
And make sure you title your page at the right-hand side of your paper and date it on the left-hand side of your paper.
Use an arrow-preferably in a different color, such as red - at the bottom of your page to indicate that your notes are continued onto the next page.
And always, always, always use the back of your paper, not only will it save trees, but it will also save money too. And who doesn't want to save money?

, Taking notes isn't inscribed in ancient text, and there is no right way to take notes. But there is a more efficient way depending on where you taking notes from, such as a lecture, book, or textbook. There are four good ways to take notes and they are:


An outline. An outline is good for when you taking notes in class because you have an organized format to layout subheadings, key concepts, keywords. vocabulary, details, summaries, etc.
Cornell Method. The Cornell Method is a good note-taking strategy for taking notes during a lecture because of the way it is designed. The Cornell Method divides your paper into three sections: the ""Cue Column"", the ""Note-Taking Section"", and the ""Summary Row"". The Cue Column is written before class because this is where you write any questions you may have, anything you do not understand, and for key details. The Note-Taking is taken during class, this is where you write all your notes. and the Summary Row is written after class because you will summarize everything in the Note-taking Section and the Cue Column.
The ""T"" Method. The ""T"" Method is good for when you are taking notes in class because of the way it is formatted. The ""T"" Method divides your page into two section instead of three like the Cornell Method. The right-hand side is used for subheadings and key concepts of that subheading. And the left-hand side is used for an expansion your notes in the right-hand side.
The SQ3R Method. The SQ3R is a useful note-taking method for taking notes from a textbook because it makes you really think and comprehend what the text is about. SQ3R stand for: S.urvey, Q.uestion, 3 or the three R's R.ead: R.ecite, and R.eview.
Mindmapping. This note-taking method is good taking notes on a book, textbook, or lectures/in-class discussions. Mindmapping is a good note-taking method for visual learners because it is a way to visualize your notes.

Write Keywords and Phrases.,
Use Abbreviations.,
Cross Reference with Labs.,
Review Your Notes Before and After Class.",How to Take Notes for Science2," When you back to examine your notes, you may want to enter in additional information. Leave yourself space to flesh out ideas.

, Don’t leave out steps to problems, particularly when math is involved, assuming you’ll understand how to get from one point to another just because it made sense during the lecture. Write down every little step — show your work.

, This is not the place for complete sentences! For one thing, you likely won’t have time to write all the extra words. For another, the extra text can be a distraction. If you are marking key points in a book, highlight important words and phrases. It doesn’t do you any good to color in an entire page with highlighter.

, Learn scientific units and use them. For example, write g instead of grams or K instead of Kelvin. Use shorthand notation for words you use a lot. These can be symbols you develop yourself or you can get them from a book. Examples of helpful notation include w/ for with and e.g. for examples

, Refer to relevant lab exercises. If you are taking lab notes, let yourself know where to locate the lecture notes. Your lab book will be separate from your lecture notes, so you won’t be able to keep all of the information in one place

, If you review notes soon after class, you’ll reinforce the material and learn to identify holes in your coverage. Write down any questions you need to ask in class. Right before class starts, review notes to make sure you’re up to speed and the concepts are fresh in your mind so that you are ready to move on to new material.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Fill the cup 1/4 of the way up with purified water.,
Fill the bowl with ice.,
Sprinkle two tablespoons of salt over the ice.,
Wait about 15 minutes or when the thermometer shows the water is below freezing.,
Initiate ice crystallization.",How to Supercool Water1," For this method, you will need salt, purified water, a small clean glass or plastic cup, a large bowl, and ice. If you have a thermometer it would also be useful, but not necessary.



Make sure your glass is very clean; any impurities can cause the water to crystallize into ice before supercooling occurs.
The bowl must be large enough to contain the glass and enough ice to submerge the glass.;
, The amount of water added doesn’t have to be exact. Add enough that you will be able to measure the temperature, but not so much that you won’t be able to surround the cup with ice above the water line.Place the cup in the center of the bowl.


, Add enough ice so that glass









Be careful not to drop any ice into the cup of water.
Covering the cup before you add ice and salt is a good way to prevent accidental contamination.

, Adding salt to the ice lowers its freezing point. With a lower freezing point, the temperature around the glass can get cooler.









Again, be careful not to get any salt into the glass/cup.
At this point you can add a clean thermometer if you have one.

, Because this reaction works faster than the freezer, you’ll want to watch your water carefully. If you have a thermometer, you will be able to see exactly when the water is below freezing.










If you leave the water for too long, it will freeze.
If you don’t have a thermometer, you can set-up a second bowl with tap water. When the tap water freezes, your purified water should be super-cooled.

, There are two fun ways to cause the water to freeze: drop a piece of ice into the glass/cup or pouring the water onto a piece of ice. After dropping in the ice, the water should freeze quickly freeze in the glass/cup. This is often called snap freezing.Pouring the water onto ice will cause the water to freeze as you pour.









"
"
Obtain a bottle of purified or distilled water.,
Place the bottle in the freezer.,
Chill the water undisturbed for 2-3 hours.,
Remove the pure water from the freezer.,
Initiate ice crystallization.",How to Supercool Water2," You can’t use tap water because it has minerals and other impurities that will trigger ice formation during the cooling.Purified water removes these impurities allowing this experiment to work.



Water expands as it freezes, so ensure the bottle isn’t completely full before you proceed.

, Make sure wherever you put the bottle, it won’t be knocked around if someone else opens the freezer. If possible tell friends or family not to use the freezer during the remainder of the experiment.



If you live where the temperature outside is below freezing, you can put the bottle of water outside.

, The amount of time needed to supercool the water will vary based on the temperature of your freezer. A good measure is to also put a bottle of tap water in the freezer. Once the tap water is frozen, your pure water should be supercooled and still in its liquid state.Starting at 2 hours, check the bottle of tap water every 15 minutes to see when it freezes.
When the tap water is completely frozen, the pure water will be supercooled.
If your pure water is also frozen, you may have waited too long, bumped the bottle during the process, or the water wasn’t completely pure.
Melt the water and try again for a shorter amount of time.

, Carefully take the bottle of water out of the freezer. When liquids are supercooled a quick motion can cause it to crystallize into ice.


, There are two fun ways to cause the water to freeze: shaking the bottle and pouring the water onto a piece of ice. After shaking the bottle, the water should freeze quickly freeze in the bottle. This is often called snap freezing.Pouring the water onto ice will cause the water to freeze as it hits the ice. As you continue to pour the water will freeze on top of itself."

Increase the information or ""rain"" to your brain.,
Don't expect a pool of water or information to collect.,
Let it ""rain"" frequently to learn more.,
Be ready to absorb information.,
Work around the challenges of ""clay"" soil when absorbing information.,
Don't rely too much on quick-thinking with the ""gravel"" type soil.,
Don't think familiarity means you will recall well.,
Take notes.,
Use the ""water"" you absorb in your everyday life.,
Don't try to water your soil (absorb information) alone.,
Take samples of your ""water"" to see if your absorbing information.",How to Study Using the Groundwater Principle," Groundwater is generally replenished through precipitation such as rain. Once water comes down, it soaks into the ground, creating groundwater. When you're studying, the rain is the information you try to absorb. If you don't spend time reviewing information, your soil will have nothing to absorb., As water absorbs, it doesn't usually form a pool underground (though it does sometimes sink down into an aquifer). Rather, it just soaks into the ground, saturating it. If it becomes oversaturated, it moves away into lakes and ponds instead of staying in the ground. In other words, if you try to absorb too much water (information) at once, it can flow away elsewhere, and you won't retain it., One way to make sure your soil absorbs water at a steady rate is to let it precipitate frequently. In other words, you need to revisit information frequently over a longer period to help absorb the information.It helps if you keep up with your classwork as you go along, if you're studying for a class. That way, you're not trying to learn it all right before the test.

, When you're in class, it's important to pay attention to what your professor or teacher is telling you. They will often emphasize what's most important, meaning that's what you need to focus on when you do study., If you think of your brain as having a specific type of soil, you'll understand how different brains absorb information at different speeds. Some people absorb information more slowly, and they have a ""clay"" type soil. Clay is tightly packed, so it lets water through to the groundwater more slowly, just like people who have this type of brain.If you have a clay brain, you may find that you can't cram information in. You need to plan ahead when studying information, as you'll need to learn a little at a time.
You may also need to break down processes. You may feel overwhelmed if you're looking at a complex process, but you'll find it easier to work with if you have smaller steps.

, If your brain is a gravel-type soil, you absorb information more quickly, just as gravel lets through more rain to the groundwater. It can be helpful to absorb information more quickly, but on the other hand, it may lead you to think that you can put off studying.However, studies have shown that you still need to pace out your learning if you expect to retain information in the long run, as cramming the night before a test often only leads to short retention.
While you may not need as much time as a clay-type learner, try to spread out what you're learning at least a week before the test.

, Whether your a clay or gravel learner, you may misjudge how much time you need because you vaguely remember the material. In other words, you're familiar with it. However, just because you are familiar with it doesn't mean you will recall what you need in detail.To make sure you are retaining information, try rearranging into a form that makes sense to you. That way, you're not just trying to memorize it, you're synthesizing it as well.

, One way to help your retention over time is to take notes. Taking notes reinforces the information, helping you to absorb it. Try taking notes both in class when your teacher is speaking, as well as when you're reading for class.As an added bonus, you can use your notes for review later.
Don't try to take down every word. Rather, try to keep your notes short. It's best if you can put it in your own words because that means you're processing the information.
Try using an outline method. Adding in indentions and a numbering system can help you organize as you go.
One way to go faster is to use consistent symbols and abbreviations., If you can, use what you learn to ""water"" your soil. In other words, try to apply what you learn to how you live your life. For instance, if you're in an economic class, think about how economics on a national level is similar to your own personal budgeting issues., Working with other students can be beneficial. They can have a take on material that you wouldn't have thought of. If you work together, you can help each other to retain more information than if you work alone. Plus, working in a group can help keep you on track., One way to make sure you're absorbing information is to take samples of water periodically. In other words, try testing yourself on the information, particularly in the week leading up to your test. By testing yourself, you're forcing yourself to recall the information, which helps solidify it in your brain."

Study multiple related subjects.,
Participate in science fairs and clubs.,
Join a scientific professional society.,
Research career options.",How to Study Toxicology1," Toxicology is a multidisciplinary science, so any real study of it will involve immersion in many different subjects. If you are interested in studying toxicology, evaluate your current expertise in related subjects and consider what areas you might need to strengthen your base of knowledge in. Consider hiring a tutor, joining a study group, or increasing your study time for these subjects in order to master them. Biology, mathematics, and chemistry are the biggest components of toxicology, but other subjects pertaining to this discipline include:Medicine
Veterinary medicine
Pharmacology
Environmental science;
, If you want to study toxicology, work on gaining experience that will serve you in the industry. At a high school level, participating in science fairs and clubs is a good way to acclimate to the toxicology milieu. Extracurricular science projects can help students hone their research skills, which are a valuable asset for both an educational and professional career related to toxicology., On an undergraduate level, joining a scientific professional society will allow you to participate in informative events and meetings. For instance, the Society of Toxicology, a global non-profit organization and the largest toxicology society in the world, accepts university students under the title of ""Undergraduate Student Affiliates,"" allowing them to participate in the activities of the organization for free.Affiliates also have access to introductory toxicology lectures, advice and information about graduate programs, and the opportunity to meet personally with directors of academic toxicology programs and internship hosts.

, Before setting out to study toxicology, research the different career options that are open to you. For a comprehensive overview of toxicology-related careers, industries that employ toxicologists, and available training programs, consult the Society of Toxicology’s “Resource Guide to Careers in Toxicology,” available on their website. This guide also notes trends in the toxicology job market, and stresses the growing demand for well-trained toxicologists."
"
Start with a question.,
Gather data and research.,
Create a hypothesis.",How to Test a Hypothesis1," This question is not your hypothesis. Rather, it's the beginning of the scientific method which can lead to your hypothesis. Basically, the question is just something you wonder about when it comes to the natural universe. It can be as simple as, ""I wonder why water is clear."" or ""What fish do cats like best?""Your question should be about something that can be studied and observed.;
, Once you've decided what you want to study, it's time to gather data. Generally, you gather data through observation of the phenomenon, but you also might gather data by reading what other people have observed and written about., Make a statement about what you think is happening with what you're observing. Because this statement is a hypothesis, you're not saying it's 100 percent true. Rather, you're saying this statement is your best guess right now, but you're going to conduct experiments to find out if it's true.For instance, maybe after observing cats, you decided that they may like salmon the best. Your hypothesis could be, ""Cats prefer salmon over other fish.""

"
"
Speak with toxicologists.,
Obtain an undergraduate degree.,
Seek graduate studies in toxicology.,
Look into funding.",How to Study Toxicology2," Before embarking on your career plan, reach out to toxicologists at local universities, government agencies, or in the workforce of various industries, for advice. These experts can offer insight on the paths they took to complete their studies and join the field. Be direct and polite, saying something like, “I am considering a career in toxicology, and I was hoping that an individual as accomplished as yourself might be able to offer me some guidance. Would be willing to answer a few of my questions?”Be understanding if they decline, and do not hesitate to seek out other qualified toxicologists until you find someone who is willing to share their expertise.

, Establish what educational requirements are in place for the career you want before starting your studies. In order to work as a toxicologist, you must complete, as a minimum, an undergraduate degree in Toxicology, or a related subject. An undergraduate degree in biology or chemistry is a good basis for an academic career in toxicology.Most major universities offer toxicology degrees.

, If you are aiming for a long-term career in toxicology, pursuing graduate and post-graduate studies is advisable. These advanced degrees will qualify you for more lucrative positions in the industry – for instance, a Ph.D. will enable you to direct and manage toxicology studies.The role of Ph.D. level toxicologists includes interpreting the results of many different studies and integrating the data, making recommendations to regulatory agencies, and providing risk assessments for products and compounds to ensure their safe use.

, Attending a good university to complete your studies is an expensive venture, so look into financial aid options before planning your studies. Visit the FinAid website for information on scholarships, grants, and loans that may be available to you.Graduate and post-graduate students often receive financial assistance from universities in the form of Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships."
"
Apply for internships.,
Read peer-reviewed scholarly journals.,
Attend lectures.",How to Study Toxicology3," Internships are an ideal way to gain hands on research experience during your studies. Academic, industrial, and government research laboratories offer such programs to undergraduate students across the U.S.; this experience offers students an advantage when applying for competitive graduate programs. Contact the Society of Toxicology’s head office for information about available internships near you, or speak to an academic advisor at your university.For example, the Toxicology Lab of the Medical Examiner’s office of Philadelphia offers summer, fall, and spring internships to qualified undergraduate students of affiliated local universities. During these internships, students spend at least 18 weeks in the lab learning safety procedures, sample analysis, and finalization of toxicology reports., Reading up on current trends and issues in the field of toxicology is good way to strengthen your knowledge of the study and its subspecialties, such as chemical carcinogenesis and neurotoxicology. Reading academic journals is also an excellent way to keep abreast of scientific developments in this sector. Look online for peer-reviewed journals (i.e. journals publishing content that has been reviewed by experts in the field) related to toxicology.The Journal of Clinical Toxicology, for example, is a good place to start.

, Attending a lecture pertaining to your studies is a valuable opportunity to garner insight and individual perspective from an expert in the field. As a burgeoning field of study, toxicology has the potential for the development of many unique hypotheses, and lectures are an interactive way for academics to share their work with their colleagues and contemporaries. Look at your university’s website, as well as other local universities, to see upcoming lectures that might interest you.If live lectures aren’t an option, visit the Society of Toxicology’s website to watch video recordings of lectures delivered at events held by the organization.

Develop an experiment.,
Observe the phenomenon.,
Don't ignore data.,
Revise your hypothesis.,
Draw a conclusion.",How to Test a Hypothesis2," The most common way to test a hypothesis is to create an experiment. A typical experiment uses test subjects or creates conditions where you can see if your hypothesis seems to be true, though it can vary widely across disciplines.For instance, with the cat hypothesis, you could test your hypothesis by offering several different kinds of fish to a certain number of cats to see which they ate first. Make sure the conditions are as close to the same each time as you can make them, such as the distance the fish are apart from each other.
Depending on the hypothesis, you may also need a control group. For example, if you're testing how effective a drug is, you need to have a group on a placebo.
You can also change up the parameters after testing a large group to see if it changes your results. For instance, after testing 50 cats, you might switch the order of the fish around to see if that makes a difference.

, Sometimes, you'll test your hypothesis by observing a natural phenomenon more closely. For instance, maybe you hypothesized that wild bobcats only eat a certain kind of bird. In that case, you would need to observe them in their natural habitat to see if you notice them eating other things., While it can be tempting to only accept data that supports your hypothesis, that's is not scientific or ethical. You must accept all the data and watch for whatever patterns appear, even if it proves your hypothesis to be likely false., If the data doesn't support what you thought was true, then you can make a new hypothesis based on what you know now. For instance, if after observing cats, you find that they actually seem to prefer tuna over salmon, you could make a new hypothesis: ""Cats prefer tuna over other fish."", Once you've tested, revised, and tested some more, you can draw a conclusion about your hypothesis. If most cats eat the tuna, then that doesn't absolutely prove your hypothesis true. However, it does lend credibility to it, and eventually, with other support, your hypothesis may become a theory, which has more scientific weight."
"
Begin by writing the null hypothesis.,
Create an alternative hypothesis.,
Choose a significance level.",How to Test a Hypothesis3," The null hypothesis is an assumption you make about what is true. However, you're only proposing this statement to decide how untrue it is. While that is confusing, compare it to the courtroom. If someone is a defendant, they are assumed innocent. It's the prosecutor's job to prove they are guilty.For instance, maybe your null hypothesis is ""Most dogs sleep 18 hours a day.""

, The alternative hypothesis is based on your null hypothesis. It basically establishes what you think is not right about the null hypothesis, so you can test the null hypothesis.For example, maybe you've decided that dogs actually sleep fewer hours in a day. Your alternative hypothesis would be, ""Most dogs sleep fewer than 18 hours a day.""
In other words, it's your responsibility to prove the null hypothesis is untrue by proving the alternative hypothesis to be true.

, A significance level refers to the likelihood that your results could have happened by chance. The most common significance level is 0.05, so you can choose that if you don't know what to choose. At this level, only a five percent chance exists that your results could come from coincidence.This idea is similar to proving guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""
In other words, the significance level states that if the null hypothesis is true, then when gathering data, finding certain means or averages would be too unlikely because they are under the significance level. In that case, the null hypothesis is considered disproven."
"
Determine a way to collect data.,
Find the test statistic.,
Find the p-value.,
Check the p-value against the significance level.",How to Test a Hypothesis4," Generally, you want to figure out a way to sample a significant portion of whatever it is you're testing. Statistical hypothesis testing is usually used to analyze large amounts of data, such as characteristics across populations. Therefore, you need a significant portion to test.For instance, you may want to observe the sleeping patterns of 100 dogs in your area. Alternatively, maybe you just need to gather data from reliable sources, such as the U.S. Census Bureau.

, The test statistic is a formula. It tells you how likely it is that you'll observe certain outcomes based on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. To find the test statistic, you plug information into this formula:Test statistic = (Statistic - Parameter) / (Standard deviation of statistic)
Test statistic = (Statistic - Parameter) / (Standard error of statistic)
Standard error is most often used, but standard deviation is just the standard error divided by the sample size.
In this case, the parameter is what you stated in the null hypothesis, while the statistic is based on the data you collected.For instance, in the null hypothesis, you determined that most dogs sleep 18 hours a day. Therefore, your parameter is 18. Maybe you observed that dogs generally sleep 16 hours a day. That's your statistic.
The standard deviation is often the standard error or average deviation divided by the sample size. For instance, the standard deviation in hours dogs sleep may be plus or minus one hour, which you'd divide by your sample size of 100., To find the p-value, which is an expression of probability, use a probability calculator. Plug your information in, and it should return a probability between 0 and 1. The closer it is to 0, the less likely it is that you would find this outcome if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, the closer you get to 0, the more likely it is that the null hypothesis is false, based on your data.You'll need the test statistic (which may be referred to as t-score or z-score), the significance level, and whether you have a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis to plug into the calculator. One-tailed just means you decided the alternative hypothesis was either above or below the null hypothesis, while two-tailed means you are testing both above and below the null hypothesis., Now, compare the p-value to your original significance level. If it's less than the significance level, then you can state that the null hypothesis is likely not true."

Check out free online courses.,
Choose a topic to research.,
Try programming.",How to Study Computer Science1," If you cannot or don't want to attend an undergraduate program in computer science, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the availability of free coursework online.


For example, you can sign up for computer science related courses on Coursera.You should also check out OpenCourseWare from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.It is a goldmine of information for people who want to have access to computer science materials at an academic level without paying tuition.;
, Depending on how much you already know, you can choose topics that are of interest to you and research them online or in the library.


If you are just starting out, you will want to read books, journal articles, or websites devoted to topics like computer hardware, the internet, and basic computer programming.As you learn about these basic topics, you will find areas that seem especially interesting to you that you can investigate further. Some of these more advanced topics include security, cryptography, Turing Machines and the Halting Problem, set theory, operating systems, hardware architectures, semaphores and concurrency, computer networks and network protocols, and databases and information modeling.
You can also view do an internet search for the complete list of recommended topics by Professor Matthew Might, who teaches computing at the University of Utah., Basic computer programming is simple and easy to learn, and is a great gateway to more computer science knowledge. Plus, it comes in handy on job applications to have a working knowledge of programming, even if you don't have technical instruction under your belt.


There are a lot of different programming ""languages,"" or systems that use unique codes. If you don't know where to start, Python is a nice language for beginners. It's intuitive and easy to learn. You can also consider C or Java.
If you have tried imperative programming languages in the past, try learning functional languages such as Haskell.These are more advanced than the basic languages.
Whatever approach you decide to take, you can do an internet search for articles or videos that will teach you all you need to know. In your search bar, type in the name of the programming method plus the words ""beginner tutorial"" (for example, ""Java beginner tutorial"").

Prepare in high school.,
Apply for an academic program in computer science.,
Get relevant work experience.,
Take classes and get your degree.,
Find a career in computer science.,
Continue your education.",How to Study Computer Science2," If you know early on that you have an interest in computer science, it is helpful to focus your high school curriculum on courses that will give you an advantage in college and in your career.


Try to focus on courses in mathematics, science, and computing.
It is likely that you already gravitate toward these types of classes, but if not, ask yourself whether computer science is really right for you. Computer scientists must have an aptitude for science, math, and information, and the ability to problem-solve and think logically. Maintain a good grade point average and standardized test scores so you can apply to top programs in the field.

, This is the best way to begin a serious study of computer science, preparing you for a career in the field. You'll have access to the best resources and experienced teachers.


If you know specifically what you want to study in computer science, look for the highest rated college or university with a program in that field in your area. Otherwise, look for a school with a strong information technology program and professors who can mentor you as you choose your specialization.

, Having experience in jobs that utilize some of the basic concepts of computer science can help you learn more about the discipline and also bolster your resume so that you will be able to find a good job when you get out of school.


Try to find part-time, summer, or work-study experience related to computing, engineering, mathematics, or other technological fields. You may not get hands-on experience with actual computer programming in your early stages of work, but even being in the same room with computer scientists will allow you to make connections, ask questions, and learn more. Consider working as a lab assistant or a library aid.
Get an internship that will give you hands-on experience with computer science, for instance at a software development company or at a computer help desk at a major corporation or university., Most computer scientists get at least a bachelor's degree, but some fields will hire a candidate with only an associate's. In general, an associate's degree takes two years and a bachelor's degree takes four.


Your coursework will emphasize math, science, and technology, but you should also be sure to take courses in English (or other native language in the country where you study and plan to work), writing, and the humanities.

, There are many options for what to do with a degree in computer science, including systems analyst, database administrator, hardware engineer, data scientist, help desk technician, security specialist, and many others.Look online on career websites, classifieds, or the websites of particular companies. Many corporate websites list open positions in computer science under the category of ""Support"" or ""IT"" (Information Technology). Look for an entry level position that sounds interesting to you!
You can also ask professors and work supervisors for job recommendations and help locating open positions.

, Remember that even after you've found a job in computer science, computers will constantly evolve and change, and so must your skills in order for you to remain relevant and keep your job secure.Many big tech companies offer continuing education courses, seminars, or conferences. You can also enroll in night classes at a local college, or ask your employer if they will help subsidize courses you can take from home.
It’s a good idea to subscribe to technology blogs, magazines, or listservs in order to keep up with changing protocols and languages.

Decide if an advanced degree is necessary.,
Complete an undergraduate program.,
Take the appropriate standardized tests.,
Apply for graduate programs.",How to Study Computer Science3," Getting an advanced degree (such as a Master's or Doctorate) is a time-consuming and costly choice, so before you enroll, be sure you are making the right choice.


Of all fields of study, computer science is one of the most likely to pay off. Advanced degree holders in computer science are in demand, so if you plan to hunt for a better-paying job and you're willing to move (particularly to a large city), an advanced degree might be a good way to get there.However, if you are happy in your current job and have no desire to look for another position, it might be wise to not pursue another degree. If you need to learn another programming language or further your skills, your current employer might have policies in place to pay for continuing education seminars or other ways for you to further your knowledge without another degree.

, Before starting on a Master's or Doctorate, you need to have a Bachelor's under your belt. It is ideal if the undergraduate degree is in a field related to computer science, mathematics, or another closely related discipline.


However, with high enough grades and test scores, you might be accepted to a graduate program even without having focused on computer science for your bachelor's degree, particularly if you can show a long-standing interest in and aptitude for technology.

, For most graduate schools in the United States, you will have to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test, which tests your analytical writing, quantitative, and verbal/reading comprehension skills.For an advanced degree in computer science, you will need to show an aptitude for numbers, so your quantitative score will most likely need to be excellent. High scores in the other areas are also important for competitive program admission, but are likely to be slightly less important than quantitative scores.
For example, at the University of Chicago's Master's in Computer Science program, successful applicants generally score at least in the 50th percentile or above on the verbal section, and in the 80th percentile or above on the quantitative section.
If you're applying to a United States program from overseas, you may also have to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).Check with the programs you are interested in to see what you need to score for admission.

, Keep in mind that you may not get into your first choice school, so having a backup plan or applying to several schools is usually a good idea.


An application usually consists of application form, a resume or curriculum vitae, a letter of interest that explains why you think the program is a good fit for you, letters of reference, and a of your undergraduate transcript.
If you plan to start graduate school directly after completing your undergraduate, be sure to plan ahead when you schedule your standardized tests and your applications. Most application cycles begin the fall before you would actually start school (that is, a full year in advance), and most require completed tests to apply. That means you'll have to complete your standardized readiness exams over a year before attending graduate school.

Check rubber objects regularly for hardening.,
Examine the rubber for signs of damage.,
Keep rubber objects clean.,
Seal rubber in an airtight container to delay hardening.,
Place the container in a cool, dry, dark place.",How to Soften Rubber1," Slowly but surely, any rubber object, be it your car windshield wiper blades or the elastic waistband of your favorite pajama pants, will harden over time. Evidence of white or colored substances on the rubber can be one indication of a chemical reaction taking place.


Natural rubber has poor resistance to both ozone and UV light, as well as to petroleum oils. Additionally, temperatures below -60 degrees or above 220 degrees (Fahrenheit) will degrade it quickly, while temperature extremes in general will facilitate degradation and hardening.Rubber stretches and flexes because it is made up of long, tangled molecule chains that can be straightened out under tension. Degradation of these molecular chains can occur from repeated or excessive tension (think of frayed or over-stretched rubber bands), or by exposure to elements like those noted above.;
, Cracked rubber will remain cracked even when it’s softened. Once cracks form, your only options will be to try out a rubber patch kit or to simply replace the rubber object. There is no miracle cure by this point.


One point worth making here is that common softening methods — heat and oils — actually damage the rubber in the process. So, every time you do soften up a stiff rubber gasket or shoe sole, you are also contributing to its eventual demise., There is only so much you can do to keep oxygen, temperature fluctuations, and light away from rubber, but wiping away residue can help keep deteriorating oils from damaging the object.


Clean rubber objects with only warm water and a clean cloth when possible. If necessary, use a mild detergent and rinse it away completely.
Solvents found in cleaners can degrade or even dissolve rubber., If possible, remove as much air (and thus oxygen) from the container as you can before sealing it.


Placing rubber items in zip close bags and using a straw to suck out most of the air can noticeably delay the hardening process. If you’ve ever compared rubber bands kept in a plastic bag in your junk drawer from those loose in the drawer, you know the difference it can make.Natural rubber is especially susceptible to oxidization because sulfur is added to the mix when making items like rubber bands. Oxygen reacts with sulfur and essentially removes it from the item, leaving it more brittle.

, The same place you might store apples or potatoes would actually make a decent place to also keep your bagged-up sneakers.


68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit (20 to 25 degrees Celsius) is a sensible temperature range for storing rubber items, though lower temperatures can also be good.You might even consider keeping tightly sealed rubber items in your refrigerator. The excessive cold and higher humidity of the freezer, however, makes it a less ideal choice.

"
"
Choose your preferred heat source.,
Place the rubber object in an oven on the “warm” setting.,
Heat the rubber with a blow dryer, alternatively.,
Allow the rubber to cool for 10 minutes.",How to Soften Rubber2," An oven or hair dryer are the most likely choices, although some people espouse placing rubber soled shoes on a radiator, for instance.Ensure your oven’s heat element can run at a low setting and your blow dryer’s heat element can use a high setting, to get approximately equal temperatures.


A clothes dryer placed on its highest heat setting could be another option, especially for sneakers.
The temperature range you seek is roughly 200-220 degrees Fahrenheit. Temperatures above this range will likely do more damage than good.Remember to clean rubber objects, ideally with just water, before heating them.

, In case your oven overheats and melts the rubber, place the item(s) on an oven safe pan or other container (but one you won’t use for food).


If you are heating shoes, make sure the soles are facing up, to reduce the chance of them melting onto the oven rack or pan.
Keep the item(s) in the oven for five to 10 minutes. If you happen to have an infrared surface thermometer, you can take the guesswork out of reaching the desired temperature range.
Again, be careful about overheating, because high heat will break down rubber, and because cleaning up melted rubber is no one’s idea of fun., For rubber-soled shoes, at least, heating on “high” for seven to ten minutes has been claimed to be successful.Don’t hold the dryer in any one spot, and check the rubber item regularly for signs of melting or other deterioration.
Check carefully, however, as the rubber can become very hot. Again, an infrared surface thermometer could prove useful.

, Then, try to manipulate it. With luck, the item will remain softer and more flexible even after cooling.


Keep in mind, however, that there are many rubber formulations, and some may respond better than others. Also, there is no miracle cure, and some hardened rubber items will simply be too far gone for softening. You are actually damaging the rubber by heating it to soften it, and some items cannot take the beating any longer."
"
Remove the rubber part from non-rubber components so that it can be soaked individually.,
Mix a solution of three parts rubbing alcohol to one part wintergreen oil.,
Submerge the rubber item, seal the container, and check regularly for softening.,
Remove the softened item and wipe it with a clean cloth.",How to Soften Rubber3," This method is best for industrial or mechanical rubber parts that will be inserted back into an assembly.


Unless you have rubber soles that can easily be removed and reattached, this may not be the best method for shoes. The soaking solution may damage or discolor leather or other shoe materials.
Remember to clean the item thoroughly first, ideally with just warm water and a clean cloth., Make sure that the amount of the solution is enough to completely cover the rubber item when placed in the container.Although both these liquids can be handled safely in small quantities, it may be best to use tongs or gloves when inserting and removing the rubber object. At very least, you will keep your hands from smelling like wintergreen.

, Sealing the container will limit evaporation, which may expose your submerged item.


It may take only a few hours to see results, or instead take several days. Be patient and keep checking. After several days, however, you are unlikely to see any additional benefits by keeping the item soaking., Allow the rubber to air dry. Although the rubber will smell strongly of wintergreen, it is best not to use water to wash the substance off.By leaving the leaving the oil in place, the softening process can continue.
Of course, remember that the oil residue is also slowly damaging the rubber while softening it, so you’ll have to use your best judgment as to whether it is best to leave it on or rinse it away with water. It is probably best regardless to avoid using harsh detergents."

Understand blood transfusions and who can receive blood from whom.,
Learn about immunohistochemistry.,
Learn about the role of cancer.,
Learn about breast cancer.",How to Study Haematology," Such physicians are known as haematologists.


Their routine work mainly includes the care and treatment of patients with haematological diseases, although some may also work at the haematology laboratory viewing blood films and bone marrow slides under the microscope, interpreting various haematological test results.
In some institutions, haematologists also manage the haematology laboratory.
Physicians who work in haematology laboratories, and most commonly manage them, are pathologists specialized in the diagnosis of haematological diseases, referred to as haematopathologists.
Haematologists and haematopathologists generally work in conjunction to formulate a diagnosis and deliver the most appropriate therapy if needed.;
, Haematologists may specialise further or have special interests, for example in:


bleeding disorders such as haemophilia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
haematological malignacies such as lymphoma and leukemia (onco haematology)
haemoglobinopathies
the science of blood transfusion and the work of a blood bank
bone marrow and stem cell transplantation

, Only some blood disorders can be cured.

, Haematological analysis involves the determination of different blood parameters, which can be done using either the electronic quantification or the manual quantification.


The electronic quantification can be done with the use of the auto counter and these displace about 15 parameters, while the manual quantification of PCV for example, is by the use of the Micro haematocrit centrifuge. This Micro haematocrit centrifuge is used to determine the Packed Cell Volume (PCV), from which many other parameters can be obtained.
The best way to determine blood parameters is through the electronic device called auto counter because it gives accurate values and manual red blood cell counting is obsolete and inaccurate Although, the manual quantification is also used to confirm whether the values obtained from the auto counter correlate with it for PCV.
The haematocrit (Ht or HCT) or packed cell volume (PCV) or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF) is the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. It is normally about 46% for men and 38% for women. It is considered an integral part of a person's complete blood count results, along with hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, and platelet count.

, The term ""haematocrit"" was coined in 1903. Its roots stem from the Greek words hema- blood, and krites, judge - meaning to gauge or judge the blood.In mammals, haematocrit is independent of body size. The PCV of animals can also be determined, to know their anaemic state.


Elevated haematocrit - In cases of dengue fever a high haematocrit is a danger sign of an increased risk of dengue shock syndrome.

Polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces excessive numbers of red cells, is associated with elevated haematocrit.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other pulmonary conditions associated with hypoxia may elicit an increased production of red blood cells. This increase is mediated by the increased levels of erythropoietin by the kidneys in response to hypoxia.
Professional athletes' haematocrit levels are measured as part of tests for blood doping or Erythropoietin (EPO) use; the level of haematocrit in a blood sample is compared with the long-term level for that athlete (to allow for individual variations in haematocrit level), and against an absolute permitted maximum (which is based on maximum expected levels within the population, and the haematocrit level which causes increased risk of blood clots resulting in strokes or heart attacks).
If a patient is dehydrated, the haematocrit may be elevated. Repeat testing after adequate hydration therapy will usually result in a more reliable result.


Lowered haematocrit - Lowered haematocrit can imply significant hemorrhage (for example, in an ectopic pregnancy).

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the red cell distribution width (RDW) can be quite helpful in evaluating a lower-than-normal haematocrit, because it can help the clinician determine whether blood loss is chronic or acute. The MCV is the size of the red cells and the RDW is a relative measure of the variation in size of the red cell population. A low haematocrit with a low MCV with a normal RDW suggests a chronic iron-deficient erythropoiesis, but a high RDW suggests a blood loss that is more acute, such as a hemorrhage.



, They include:


Infants who may not have adequate iron intake
Children going through a rapid growth spurt, during which the iron available cannot keep up with the demands for a growing red cell mass
Women in childbearing years who have an excessive need for iron because of blood loss during menstruation
Pregnant women, in whom the growing fetus creates a high demand for iron.
Patients with chronic kidney disease, as their kidneys no longer secrete sufficient levels of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow.

, This is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.


In newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease.
Foetal haemoglobin, (also hemoglobin F or HbF) is the main oxygen transport protein in the fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and in the newborn until the neonate (newborn child) is roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal haemoglobin differs most from adult haemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.
In newborns, fetal hemoglobin is nearly completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by approximately the twelfth week of postnatal life. In adults, fetal haemoglobin production can be reactivated pharmacologically, which is useful in the treatment of such diseases as sickle-cell disease.

, When fetal haemoglobin production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult haemoglobin (HbA). Children with sickle-cell disease instead begin producing a defective form of haemoglobin called haemoglobin S. This variety of haemoglobin aggregates, forming filaments that cause red blood cells to change their shape from round to sickle-shaped, which have a greater tendency to stack on top of one another and crowd blood vessels. These invariably lead to so-called painful vaso-occlusive episodes, which are a hallmark of the disease.

If fetal haemoglobin remains the predominant form of haemoglobin after birth, however, the number of painful episodes decreases in patients with sickle-cell disease. Hydroxyurea promotes the production of fetal hemoglobin and can be used to treat individuals with sickle-cell disease. Combination therapy with hydroxyurea and recombinant erythropoietin—rather than treatment with hydroxyurea alone have been shown to further elevate haemoglobin F levels and to promote the development of HbF-containing F-cells.

, This refers to the process of determining the genotype of an individual by the use of electrophoresis. Current methods of doing this include PCR, DNA sequencing, ASO probes, and hybridization to DNA micro-arrays or beads. The technology is important in clinical research for the investigation of disease-associated genes.


Due to current technological limitations, almost all genotyping is partial. That is, only a small fraction of an individual’s genotype is determined. This experiment actually only determines the phenotype, not genotype.

, Experiments with blood transfusions, the transfer of blood or blood components into a person's blood stream, have been carried out for hundreds of years. Many patients have died and it was not until 1901, when the Austrian Karl Landsteiner discovered human blood groups, that blood transfusions became safer.


Mixing blood from two individuals can lead to blood clumping or agglutination. The clumped red cells can crack and cause toxic reactions. This can have fatal consequences. Karl Landsteiner discovered that blood clumping was an immunological reaction which occurs when the receiver of a blood transfusion has antibodies against the donor blood cells.
Karl Landsteiner's work made it possible to determine blood groups and thus paved the way for blood transfusions to be carried out safely. For this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930.

, An adult human has about 4–6 liters (1.6 US gal) of blood circulating in the body. Among other things, blood transports oxygen to various parts of the body. Blood consists of several types of cells floating around in a fluid called plasma. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen. Red blood cells transport oxygen to, and remove carbon dioxide from, the body tissues. The white blood cells fight infection. The platelets help the blood to clot, if you get a wound for example. The plasma contains salts and various kinds of proteins.

, The differences in human blood are due to the presence or absence of certain protein molecules called antigens and antibodies. The antigens are located on the surface of the red blood cells and the antibodies are in the blood plasma. Individuals have different types and combinations of these molecules. The blood group you belong to depends on what you have inherited from your parents.


There are more than 20 genetically determined blood group systems known today, but the AB0 and Rh systems are the most important ones used for blood transfusions. Not all blood groups are compatible with each other. Mixing incompatible blood groups leads to blood clumping or agglutination, which is dangerous for individuals. Nobel Laureate Karl Landsteiner was involved in the discovery of both the AB0 and Rh blood groups:

ABO blood grouping system - According to the AB0 blood group system there are four different kinds of blood groups: A, B, AB or 0 (null).
Blood group A - If you belong to the blood group A, you have A antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and B antibodies in your blood plasma.
Blood group B - If you belong to the blood group B, you have B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and A antibodies in your blood plasma.
Blood group AB - If you belong to the blood group AB, you have both A and B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells and no A or B antibodies at all in your blood plasma.
Blood group 0 - If you belong to the blood group 0 (null), you have neither A or B antigens on the surface of your red blood cells but you have both A and B antibodies in your blood plasma.
Rh factor blood grouping system - Many people also have a so called Rh factor on the red blood cell's surface. This is also an antigen and those who have it are called Rh+. Those who haven't are called Rh-. A person with Rh- blood does not have Rh antibodies naturally in the blood plasma (as one can have A or B antibodies, for instance). But a person with Rh- blood can develop Rh antibodies in the blood plasma if he or she receives blood from a person with Rh+ blood, whose Rh antigens can trigger the production of Rh antibodies. A person with Rh+ blood can receive blood from a person with Rh- blood without any problems.



, According to above blood grouping systems, you can belong to either of following 8 blood groups:


A Rh+
B Rh+
AB Rh+
0 Rh+
A Rh-
B Rh-
AB Rh-
0 Rh-

, You mix the blood with three different reagents including either of the three different antibodies, A, B or Rh antibodies. Then you take a look at what has happened.


In which mixtures has agglutination occurred? The agglutination indicates that the blood has reacted with a certain antibody and therefore is not compatible with blood containing that kind of antibody.
If the blood does not agglutinate, it indicates that the blood does not have the antigens binding the special antibody in the reagent.
If you know which antigens are in the person's blood, it's easy to figure out which blood group he or she belongs to! Application:

A person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic.
A person with A+ blood receives B+ blood. The B antibodies (yellow) in the A+ blood attack the foreign red blood cells by binding to them. The B antibodies in the A+ blood bind the antigens in the B+ blood and agglutination occurs. This is dangerous because the agglutinated red blood cells break after a while and their contents leak out and become toxic.



, For a blood transfusion to be successful, AB0 and Rh blood groups must be compatible between the donor blood and the patient blood. If they are not, the red blood cells from the donated blood will clump or agglutinate. The agglutinated red cells can clog blood vessels and stop the circulation of the blood to various parts of the body. The agglutinated red blood cells also crack and its contents leak out in the body. The red blood cells contain hemoglobin which becomes toxic when outside the cell. This can have fatal consequences for the patient.


The A antigen and the A antibodies can bind to each other in the same way that the B antigens can bind to the B antibodies. This is what would happen if, for instance, a B blood person receives blood from an A blood person. The red blood cells will be linked together, like bunches of grapes, by the antibodies. As mentioned earlier, this clumping could lead to death.

, Of course, you can always give A blood to persons with blood group A, B blood to a person with blood group B and so on. But in some cases you can receive blood with another type of blood group, or donate blood to a person with another kind of blood group.


The transfusion will work if a person who is going to receive blood has a blood group that doesn't have any antibodies against the donor blood's antigens. But if a person who is going to receive blood has antibodies matching the donor blood's antigens, the red blood cells in the donated blood will clump.

, This is the localization of antigens or proteins in tissue sections by the use of labeled antibodies as specific reagents through antigen-antibody interactions that are visualized by a marker such as fluorescent dye, enzyme, or colloidal gold. There are numerous immunohistochemistry methods that may be used to localize antigens. The selection of a suitable method should be based on parameters such as the type of specimen under investigation and the degree of sensitivity required.

, Cancer occurs as a result of mutations, or abnormal changes, in the genes responsible for regulating the growth of cells and keeping them healthy. The genes are in each cell’s nucleus, which acts as the “control room” of each cell. Normally, the cells in our bodies replace themselves through an orderly process of cell growth: healthy new cells take over as old ones die out. But over time, mutations can “turn on” certain genes and “turn off” others in a cell. That changed cell gains the ability to keep dividing without control or order, producing more cells just like it and forming a tumor.


A tumor can be benign (not dangerous to health) or malignant (has the potential to be dangerous). Benign tumors are not considered cancerous: their cells are close to normal in appearance, they grow slowly, and they do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors are cancerous. Left unchecked, malignant cells eventually can spread beyond the original tumor to other parts of the body.
During the immunohistochemical staining of a tissue, antigens are usually expressed if the tissue stains positive. These antigens can either be breast cancer antigens or non-breast cancer antigens

, Breast cancer is an uncontrolled growth of breast cells. To better understand breast cancer, it helps to understand how any cancer can develop. The term “breast cancer” refers to a malignant tumor that has developed from cells in the breast. Usually breast cancer either begins in the cells of the lobules, which are the milk-producing glands, or the ducts, the passages that drain milk from the lobules to the nipple. Less commonly, breast cancer can begin in the stromal tissues, which include the fatty and fibrous connective tissues of the breast.

Know what to do after an accident.",How to Stay Safe in a Science Lab1," Before going to lab, make sure that you are dressed appropriately. Wear long pants and closed toe shoes. Avoid wearing clothing that hangs loosely around your body.Avoid wearing anything that is a fire hazard such as synthetic materials or hairspray.
Avoid loose clothing like cardigans or scarves.
Remove dangling jewelry.;
, Many experiments involve chemicals that can get trapped behind or inside your contact lenses. In order to avoid damage to your eyes, choose to wear your glasses instead of contacts., If you have a medium or long hairstyle, you should secure your hair in a ponytail or clip before your lab begins. Long hair could catch on fire, dangle in chemicals, or get caught in lab equipment.Keep a ponytail holder or hair clip in your bookbag in case you forget to secure your hair before arriving at the lab.

, Food, drink, and chewing gum are not welcome in the lab. You should also avoid bringing any food preparation or eating utensils into the lab. You do not want to introduce any chemical or hazardous material to your body., Be sure to wear any protective gear, such as aprons, goggles, and gloves, that is recommended for the experiment. Many chemicals, including their fumes, could damage your eyes or skin if they come in contact with each other. Other experiments require proper equipment to protect your body from fire or heat.Fireproof aprons, heat gloves, and face covers will be available when appropriate.

, Rinse your eyes or skin immediately if you come in contact with a toxic chemical. Notify a teacher or other adult if you have an emergency. If you have a spill, notify your teacher before trying to clean it up. Some chemicals have to be cleaned up following special protocols.For example, mercury must be cleaned up with a vacuum. Touching it can result in heavy metal poisoning.

Keep walkways clear.,
Do not sit or lean on a lab table.,
Know the location of safety equipment.,
Avoid working alone in the lab.,
Do not “horseplay” in the lab.,
Always keep two hands on lab materials.",How to Stay Safe in a Science Lab2," Make sure that all backpacks, books, and purses are out of the walkways of the lab. Consider putting them under the table or chair, on the back of a chair, or in a locker. Keep in mind that other people will be walking through the lab carrying hazardous materials. Tripping on items in the walkway could cause serious injury., Be sure to sit in the chairs or stools provided by the lab or remain standing. The weight on the table could cause it to tilt and spill or break lab materials., Before the lab begins, be sure to know where the safety equipment is located. You should know the location of the fire extinguisher, eye washing station, and first aid kit., It is best practice to have at least two people in a lab during an experiment. This is especially important if you are dealing with toxic chemicals or fire. Make sure there is someone to help you in case you get injured before starting an experiment with hazardous materials., Avoid running, pushing, goofing off, or playing pranks while in the lab. Be aware of your surroundings and walk through the lab with care. These kinds of careless behaviors will result in spills and accidents in a lab., You need a good hold on lab materials while you are carrying them through the room. There is always a chance that someone might accidentally bump you, or that one hand might slip. Try to carry any containers with one hand on the bottom and one on the top or side."

Follow instructions.,
Handle instruments with care.,
Ask for guidance before using new equipment.,
Never taste or smell chemicals.,
Clean your workspace when you are finished.",How to Stay Safe in a Science Lab3," Listen to all of the instruction from the teacher before beginning the experiment. If you are following a book or manual, be sure to read the instructions thoroughly. Do not skip steps. Do not work ahead unless you have been instructed to do so., Take care of the lab equipment during the experiment as well as during clean up. Report any chips or cracks glass equipment as they could cause injury., If you are unsure how to handle a piece of lab equipment, ask your teacher or classmate for help. Do not assume that you understand how to use the equipment.

, Many materials in a lab are very toxic. Never eat, drink, or smell any materials during an experiment. Also, never use lab equipment as eating utensils for non-lab materials., Before leaving the lab, be sure that your space is clean. Follow instructions when you are disposing of chemicals and other lab materials. Thoroughly clean your materials and wipe down your workspace. Finally, wash your hands thoroughly to make sure that you do not transfer any lab chemicals or materials onto things you touch.Do not pour chemicals down the sink or into the trashcan.

Check the answers.,
Record your answer in the required format and include the proper units.

",How to Solve Circuit Problems," Confidence is the first and most prominent task to solve the circuit problems. Believe that you can solve the problems, then, ultimately, the formulas, information and ideas will come to your mind.;
,, Look at the circuit and be clear about what is to be determined.

,, Normally, there are many ways to solve a circuit but there are only one or two easy ways to the solution.

, Remember, while solving circuits, to slowly review the solution process in your mind. This will lead you to the next step in your solution. It is part learned attack strategies and part insight. The most helpful problem-solving skills will be developed over many sessions and by acquiring a good understanding of circuit theory and the transforms and simplifications that are available.

, Remember that you are working with a set of equations and can use linear algebra techniques and matrix manipulations to easily extract a solution or solution sets. If you are not familiar with linear algebra, take the time to learn the techniques, particularly Cramer's rule, and to develop proficiency. This tool will speed your analysis immensely.

, First, ask yourself if the answer seems reasonable. Remember, most solutions are physically possible, though not all. Use the substitution method to verify your answer.

Create an outline of your ideas for how the science fair should run.,
Add detail to your outline, making your bullets into paragraphs.,
Go to your guidance counselor to find out whose permission you would need to run a science fair at your particular school.,
Change some aspects of your plan if you need to do so.,
Ask the science teachers if they want to attend the fair, or if they will endorse it by giving extra credit to those who participate.,
Create posters about it.,
Ensure that you venue has enough space for all of the people signing up, or you may need to get permission to change venue.,
Ask science teachers for permission to go into their science classes to talk about the fair.,
Talk to your peers about it.,
Recruit judges through your advertising.,
Ensure that both the participants and judges know the basis for scoring if that is applicable to your fair.,
Make sure you have time to go to the store for refreshments a few days out.,
Bring ribbons, trophies, or other awards if you are awarding prizes for placing in the fair.,
Bring as many sheets for judging as there are presentations if your fair involves judging.,
Ask for permission to leave class early to set up for the fair if it is after school.,
Make sure that you have enough tables and chairs for the number or people you are expecting.,
Sit back and watch people fill in with their projects.,
Make sure that the judges get there with enough time to judge all of the projects.,
Direct the judge to each presentation and allow to creator(s) of the presentation to give the judges a rundown of what their project is about and the specific components of it.,
Help people take down their projects and talk about what you liked best from each of them.,
Make sure all snacks get put away.,
Take down any decorations that are still up.,
Thank the venue manager for allowing you to use their place to host your fair.",How to Run a Science Fair," Be sure to include the following in your plan:the approximate date and time,
how you intend to advertise it,
what decorations will be up,
what refreshments will be there,
what categories there will be, if any,
whether or not it will be competitive,
and if there are any prizes involved.;
, This will be the proposal you hand in to get permission for the fair, so you need to switch the intended audience from yourself to you school administration. Check for spelling or grammar mistakes, and then reread it to see if you need to add detail anywhere. You may want to add a cover page as well., (Most schools require any extracurricular activities to be run through administration first.) You may also want to check with whoever manages the area you want the science fair to take place in. (For example, check with the librarian if you want it to take place in the library.) Be sure to have the following things with you:

an outline of the details of how you want it to be run,
an approximate date, and
where you want it to take place.

, Just change what they ask you to and persist in trying to get approval. You may also want to add extra detail this time so that they won't send it back to you asking for even more revisions. Resubmit your proposal with the revisions, and they should allow you to go forward., This is a definite motivator for students, so consider this as a route to go. This may also help in advertising as the science teachers may be excited about it and bring it up during their classes., Show the date and time of the fair. Be sure to also include how to contact you for any additional information. You may also want to include illustrations or images off of the internet formatted to make to poster interesting looking and attractive. Remember: you want people to be exposed to the idea in this stage. Be very clear in your poster about whether participants must work individually or if they are allowed to work in groups.


Though the posters are good for advertising, don't have people sign up or or by the poster. You may want the participants to sign up by email or through you with their idea for their project so that you know more realistically how many people will be involved. This will tell you how much space they will need in total, as well as give you an idea of how to set up tables and chairs before the fair.

, For example, a medium sized school library can fit roughly 30 people in an empty space and still be organized. Be sure to account for both the number of participants and the number of people coming just to watch.

Normally, a few teacher and a few administrators will show up to the fair. Some parents and people from the local media might shows up as well, so be prepared for that too. If your fair has about 30 participants, be prepared to have about 10 extra people coming to watch.

, Give a five minute rundown of your ideas for the fair and how it will run, and then tell them how to contact you and how to sign up for the fair. Do not go by a show of hands to estimate how many people will attend, though, as many of the people who raise their hands might not end up attending the fair. Use the sign up method for estimating the number of participants., This one is the easiest and most obvious step, but some people get so worked up in making this a matter of work that they forget to let their friends know about it. Let people know during lunch, at sports practice, or any free time about the science fair you are hosting. Ask them to spread the word about the fair to their friends as well.

If you feel awkward bringing it up in conversation, send out texts to your friends about it and they will respond to the idea that way. This also takes away social pressures so they will be more likely to answer honestly about whether they can make it or not. Be sure to give them ample time to check their calendars before having them get back to you. If they can't make it, let them know that that is fine and to spread the word to others who might be able to.

, For example, if you want to have a competitive science fair rather than just an exhibition-based one, you should ask the science teachers whose classes you advertise to if they want to be judges. If they can't, don't worry too much. There are normally other teachers or administration who are willing to do the task. You will likely need at least one judge per category of your fair, and at least 2 or 3 judges total. For example, if you have a ""Research"" category and an ""Experimentation"" category, make sure you have at least one each so that you don't overload one judge. Things to keep in mind when choosing a judge:

available on the date of the science fair
scientifically literate
enthusiastic, and preferably talkative (so they can clarify parts of people's presentations when judging them)
fair and unbiased towards the students participating

, The participants should be given ample time with these criteria so that they can keep them in mind while creating their projects. If possible, put these criteria on the posters you make and/or include them in your presentation to each class so the potential participants know as early as possible., Buy enough snacks and drinks for however many people you expect to be there, and ensure that the food is fresh and of good quality. If you intend to bake something for the fair, make sure you have all of the ingredients you need and enough time to bake. Especially if you have a larger fair, you may want to have someone who can run to the store during the fair to pick up more snacks if they run out. If this is not possible, just be sure to bring more than you think you will need. After all, it's better to have leftovers than not enough food for everyone!


Examples of things you would want to bring for roughly 30-35 people:

4-6 liters of soda (2-3 2 liter bottles)
60-70 cookies, cupcakes, or slices of cake, etc.
2-3 bags of chips



, Make sure you have enough to award them for every category that you created if this is applicable to your fair. You ma want to make each place a different colored ribbon (gold, silver, or bronze) or label the ribbons so that people will remember which place that they got., The judges will fill these out during the presentations and give them back to you so you can determine the overall winner, or the winner in each category., Let the administration know that you need time to set up. They should give you a pass to leave your class so that you can organize tables and chairs in a way that is optimal, as well as set out the refreshments.

You will likely wants to leave at least 15 to 30 minutes before class gets out. Give yourself even more time if you plan on setting up decorations. You may also want to have a buddy who will help you set up if you have an elaborate setup or a large venue. Be sure that they have a note to get out of class as well.

, If you realize that there are not enough, you may need to borrow some from classrooms which are not in use. Be sure to thank the teachers for allowing you to do so if you have get extras from their room., Aid them in setting them up if needed. Compliment their work and enjoy the fair. Ask them about the process of creating their projects and engage with them. Ask them if they are having a good time and thank them for coming.


Be as grateful and polite as possible so that people will have a positive review of your fair and will be more likely to participate again next year if you decide to host another one.

, If you fair doesn't specify an end time, assume that it will run for about 2 to 3 hours. They will likely need about 3 to 5 minutes per presentation, so plan accordingly.

Also make sure that you have enough time to sift through the judging papers and determine first, second, and third place overall and/or in each category. This should only take about ten minutes, unless you have more than 30 to 40 participants. If this is the case, give yourself 15 minutes to sift.
You may want to give them another copy of the criteria in case they forgot their original copy.

, Give the judges time to rate and ask questions before moving on the next set up.

Awarded prizes, if applicable, about 10 minutes from the end of the fair.

, They should be appreciative that you hosted the fair and will likely thank you as well. Make sure that all projects get either sent home with the participants or sent to their teachers for extra credit or display.

, Take any leftovers home with you and throw away any wrappers or crumbs on the floor. If anyone is helping you clean up, ask them if they think the job is done for a second set of eyes.

Go by the standard of whoever in the group has the strictest idea of cleanliness so as to avoid leaving any trace of a mess that may upset the venue manager. When you think you're done, go back around and check under every table and chair to make sure you got everything. Wipe every table, especially if any spills took place.

, Look around the room to make sure that you took down them all. If you plan on having the same fair next year, you may want to be careful while taking them down so that you can use the same decorations and not have to make new ones. Additionally, make sure you put all of the furniture back to their original positions as best as you can remember.

Normally, a few people will stay after to help you out with taking down decorations and putting back furniture with this as a token of their appreciation for the fair. Be sure to thank them if they do.

, Ask if there was anything you could have done better, as well as about the things you did well in the fair itself as well as the clean-up afterwards. Ask them if you put the furniture back right and if you cleaned up to their liking.

They will likely congratulate you on putting together the fair, so accept your congratulations with grace. Discuss with them any plans you may have to host the fair again next year.

"
This portion of the guide is geared towards those who have little to no Science Bowl experience.,Be prepared.,Bring paper and a pencil for computation problems and taking notes.,
Know the basic rules.,
Listen carefully to the question and stay focused.,
Listen closely to the format of the question.,
Answers given to multiple-choice questions must be either the letter of the answer choice (W, X, Y, or Z), an exact statement of the “scientific answer” (i.e.,Answers given to short answer questions must be an acceptable variation or form of the given answer in the opinion of the moderator.,
Take notes on longer questions, or questions involving many numbers.,
During short-answer questions, buzz as soon as you know the answer.,
During multiple-choice questions only buzz before the correct answer choice has been read in the following situations.,
If you buzz before the question has been completely read and are verbally recognized by the moderator, this is known as an interrupt.,
If nobody is buzzing in, don’t be afraid to guess.,
For those who are new and/or are being “out-buzzed”: buzz quickly.,
For those who interrupt excessively: stop that.,
For everyone: find a happy medium.,
A lot of people get so absorbed in the game that they stop caring about their competitors as human beings.,
Shake people’s hands after you play them.,If they ignore you, rest easy with the knowledge that they have many non-scientific lessons to learn.,The competition can get intense, but always remember to have fun with it.,If you get frustrated after a loss or gloat after a win, remind yourself that you ultimately play because it teaches you science and leadership skills in an exciting way and inspires others to learn and grow as well.,If this is not the case for you, or you just plain don’t enjoy it, do something else that you do value for the right reasons.,This section of the guide is for more advanced competitors looking for ways to gain an edge in the competition mechanics and practice strategies.,While the guide is aimed at team captains, others would benefit from it as well, particularly coaches, prospective captains, and members of highly competitive teams.,The Science Bowl values leadership and teamwork over scientific knowledge, but values speed over all three.,Push yourself faster during practice even if it costs you some interrupts; this will help you speed up more quickly, and your teammates will struggle to keep up, which will help them even more.,
Speed can scare your opponents into psychological submission.,
Never let a question die; always guess if no one else knows the answer whether it be a toss-up or a bonus.,There is an ideal speed at which the difference between “penalty points” (the points you lose to interrupts and correct toss-up and bonus answers by the other team to questions that you interrupted – a maximum of 18 per question) and “reward points” (the points you gain by answering more toss-ups and their bonuses correctly – a maximum of 14 per question) is greatest.,
For any one person, this ideal speed varies with time, because they will constantly learn more science.,Ideal speed depends on the ratio of your teammates’ average accuracy to average speed, because there will be times when you buzz before your teammate can say the right answer and get it wrong and vice versa.,
When your teammates are missing too many questions, whether by answering incorrectly or not buzzing on questions they know, tell them to adjust their speed accordingly.,
Toss-ups:

Anticipate – when you’re facing the best teams in the U.S., especially during earlier rounds, you may notice that they answer questions correctly before enough information has been given to solve them.,
Bonuses:

Divide and Conquer (especially on computation questions) – quickly assign various parts of the problem to your fastest computers.,
Rather than being humble or arrogant, a strong captain knows his/her own strengths and weaknesses at least as well as those of his teammates.,
The strongest captain doesn’t necessarily win the most toss-ups or know the most science, but he or she does know what his friends know (and when to take their advice).,
Taking the extra time to make sure your answer is right doesn’t cost anything anyway (unless you’re trying to catch up quickly at the end of the game).,
This is when knowing yourself comes into play, because you must consider your own answer along with everyone else’s and assign it its due weight.,Bonus questions are worth 2.5 toss-ups; if you and your team master bonuses, you will win the matches in later, harder rounds (like the finals) when each team may only answer ~4 toss-ups correctly.,
At the national competition, rounds consist of two ten-minute halves.,
You are given twenty seconds to answer bonuses.,
If your team is too far behind the other time to catch up by playing at your ordinary pace, and a multiple choice toss-up is given, give a random guess immediately after hearing the question type and subject.,
There are a lot of ways to study for Science Bowl; pick the ones that work best with your learning style (i.e., visual, auditory, kinesthetic) to reduce wasted time not just in Science Bowl but in all subjects.,
See http://www.Nosb.Org/ for more information.,
You might consider making a few temporary alterations to the rules though.,
Whoever is moderating should be super nit-picky about all of the rules, because the competition moderators (at least at nationals) certainly are.,
Many super talented teams lose matches because they don’t actually know the rules.,
The challenge system will reward your diligence for reading the rule-book and your people skills in communicating your challenge to the moderator.,There are many ways of picking teams, but regardless of the method you and/or your coach chose, explain it to your team at the beginning of the year!,
Ask your coach to keep track of people’s scores and attendance at practices.,
Shuffle the teams you compete in at practice until you settle on your team(s), so you can see who works well together.,
You could build your a team by taking the highest 3 scorers, with the remaining the remaining slots being filled by whoever best fills the gaps in knowledge of the 7 subject areas: Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science, Energy, Math, and Physics.",How to Prepare for the Science Bowl," For those looking for more advanced tips, scroll down to the ""Captaining"" section.
,,, These are:

Answering after you buzz but before you are verbally recognized is known as a “blurt.” Blurts are treated like an incorrect answer to an interrupt (at least at the official Department of Energy competitions). Don’t blurt.

If you have trouble doing this, don’t watch the moderator; only listen to him or her. Eye contact doesn’t count as recognition. If you still have trouble, put your backpack or some other large object between you and the moderator.


Points are issued for a correct answer to a toss-up question. Collaboration is not allowed on toss-ups. If you say anything (except your answer, and then only if you are called on), your team will be disqualified from answering the question.
Points are issued for a correct answer to a bonus question. Should your team answer a toss-up question correctly, you will earn a bonus question, which only your team is allowed to answer. Collaboration is allowed on bonus questions, and you are given longer to find the correct answer. The designated team captain must start giving the answer before time is called. The other team can’t make noise (especially by buzzing).
Points are added to the other team’s score for an incorrect interrupt of a toss-up question or an interrupt blurt.
Once one person on your team has either collaborated, blurted, or given an incorrect answer to a toss-up question, no member of your team may buzz. If you don’t know the answer, don’t buzz in early and prevent your teammates, who may know the answer, from answering. If you do know the answer, buzz quickly. If nobody on your team has buzzed about 3 seconds after the full question has been read, guess before the question expires.

, Questions are not repeated., Is it a toss-up or a bonus question? Is it multiple-choice or short answer?, the correct answer as written on the answer sheet), or both. For example, if the scientific answer to a multiple-choice question were “resonance points,” “resonance point” would not be accepted. Hence, it’s usually best to just give the letter. The only times you would want to give the “scientific answer” would be when you had forgotten the letter or the correct answer has not been read yet. You never would want to give both answers because it would be counted wrong if they didn’t match.,, You may even want to write down the format of the question, because people often forget it and do silly things like blurt out “X” as the answer to a short answer question., Teams have five seconds to give the answer.,

The question clearly implies the exact format of the answer choices (such as a question asking for a simple numeric answer)
The answer-choice(s) read so far establish a pattern as to the format of the remaining answer-choice(s) (for example, if the first answer-choice is: “W. Milliohms,” and you know the answer is some variant of Henry's, you should buzz in and say “Millihenrys”.
Of the 4 answer-choices, if three have been read and none are correct, buzz in and say “Z.”
While some older Science Bowl questions include “none of the above” or “all of the above” as an answer choice, which could throw a wrench in this logic, no new Science Bowl questions contain these types of choices.

, Should you interrupt and give an incorrect answer, you will be penalized. The majority of questions are answered by interrupt in some matches, so interrupts are often worth the risk., On multiple-choice questions there is no advantage to waiting for someone else to guess if nobody knows the correct answer. (You have a 1/4 chance of guessing correctly if you go first. If you wait, then there’s a 3/4 chance that the other team will guess wrong, times a 1/3 chance that you’ll guess correctly from the remaining choices, which gives you the same 1/4 chance of guessing correctly.) Don’t wait for them to guess, because you have a brain and intuition, so your chances of guessing correctly are actually at least a little better than random.

Only refrain from randomly guessing if your team is running out of time to catch up to the other team or the question is computation-based, in which case your buzz would give the other team extra time to solve it.
Always make a reasonable guess; even when you think you have no idea, you might get it right just by saying a scientific word that seems related to the question.

, Do not hesitate. Be confident in yourself.,,, Don’t let that happen to you., Whether you trounced your opponent, vice versa, or it was neck-to-neck battle, thank them because they’re challenging you to improve (or because they were polite enough to take a pounding).,,,,,,,,, Never be too shy to buzz; decide whether or not to buzz rationally. Buzz a little more slowly than you have been during the week or two before a tournament but not necessarily to the point where you aren’t getting any interrupts., It may scare weak-minded teams when you get an impossible question right. Don’t be weak-minded; we beat many teams that knew way more science than us, because we were better at playing the game.,, The ideal speed also varies with the difficulty of the questions, because easier questions increase both the speed of your teammates and your opponents, so you’ll want to buzz really quickly while still getting the bulk of them right (after all, they’re easy).,, Ask your teammates to do the same for you. Ideally everyone on the team would know how to adjust their speed to the ideal during any match., They’re not just guessing; they’re really good at predicting what will be asked. If you want to beat a team that can do this consistently, you’ll have to push yourself to anticipate what questions will ask.

, The more divisions the better, but usually the problem only has a limited number of parts that can be done by different people. Have everyone who doesn’t get a part do the same thing as someone else as a double check. You can set up default roles during practice to eliminate the need for the initial “giving of orders” during the actual competition.
Feed – as long as you start talking before time is called they will let you finish your answer, as long as you don’t stall. If your teammate knows the answer, but doesn’t have time to tell you before time is called have them say it one word or phrase at a time while you repeat it to the moderator. You will want to tell practice this with your team during practice, so they learn how to feed to you.

, No one respects a cocky jerk or a timid pansy., Even if everyone agrees on the correct answer, ‘double check’ if you have time. There are a lot of tricky Science Bowl questions that will dupe everyone on your team no matter how smart you all are., Also, when you have time on a bonus question, ‘double lens.’ ask your teammates how certain they are of their answer and adjust for their tendency to have the correct answer, have the correct answer in that subject area/topic, and perceive their own accuracy correctly., Everyone has a tendency to trust themselves too much or too little. As with humility and arrogance, neither will help you or your team; adjust, adjust, adjust.,, If your team is moderately ahead of the other team, it is advantageous to slow the game down in order to preserve your advantage., Use eighteen or nineteen of them even if you know the answer immediately., (If you buzz in any sooner, the moderator will simply ignore you.), Consider participation in the National Ocean Science Bowl. It’s like Science Bowl, but focuses on ocean-related questions, and is sponsored by the consortium for ocean leadership., The most effective type of practice is one that simulates an actual match. Practices that simulate actual matches will help your team increase their speed, master the rules, develop their intuition for the types of questions that are asked (helpful if you start to ‘anticipate’), test out strategies presented in this guide and/or some of your own to see if they work for you, master the strategies that do work for you, and take the competition more seriously., To encourage bravado, you could give shy-buzzers the handicap of going without penalization for interrupts (until they are sufficiently bold)., They should also change their moderation style between each game (i.e. read more or less quickly, use clearer or less clear pronunciation, or even switch your accent to simulate judges from different countries)., Get everyone on your team to read the rule-book (including yourself). Know the rules; they change not just from year to year but from judge to judge. Most, if not all, judges, especially at state, will know the rules worse than you do, because they don’t spend all year training. (If they don’t, study them more.) Challenge them respectfully when you catch a mistake, and challenge during practice the same way you would at a competition. The moderators will likely (and rightly) get irritated if you whine like a brat., Additional methods of practice include studying the glossaries of science textbooks to build your science vocabulary (possibly having each team member specialize in certain subjects) and reading sheets with Science Bowl questions and answers. You can get questions by asking for a copy at the end of any competition you attend (they may or may not give you one), searching “Science Bowl questions,” and asking other teams to email you copies of their questions.,, The sooner you pick your team(s), the sooner you can practice that much more realistically. However, the sooner you pick your team(s), the sooner you will remove the motivation of making the top team(s)., Pick teams out of individuals who preformed well, participated often, complement each other’s weaknesses, effectively answer bonus questions together, and have experience at state or nationals or are younger and have the potential to lead the team to nationals in the future., (Note that although some old Science Bowl questions are in the computer science category, no new questions have this category.) You would then repeat the process with the remaining members for the B team, and so on."

Gather the necessary materials.,
Inflate the balloon to two-thirds capacity.,
Coat the tip of the skewer in oil.,
Spin the skewer and slowly insert into the top of balloon.,
Twist the skewer until it pushes through the bottom of the balloon.",How to Skewer a Balloon1," For this party trick, you’ll need a balloon, a wooden kabob skewer, a small amount of oil or dish soap, and some patience. All of these items should be easily purchased at your local grocery store.


The oil or dish soap is just for lubricating the skewer so you don’t need more than a teaspoon.
Metal or plastic skewers will also work for this trick.;
, For this trick to work properly, you don’t want to overfill the balloon. Blow it up until it is about two-thirds full. If you overfill it, just let a little bit of the air out before you tie the knot.You’ll know that you have the right amount of air if the top end of the balloon is a little bit darker than the sides.

, Oil serves as a lubricant for the skewer and helps prevent the balloon from popping. Soak the pointy end of the skewer in oil or simply rub a bit on the end with your fingers.While this step is not strictly necessary, it is recommended to increase the success of skewering the balloon.
If you use your fingers, watch out for splinters from the wooden skewer.

, While twisting the skewer, gently push the pointy tip into the darkest part of the top of the balloon. Continue to twist and push until the skewer penetrates through to the balloon., Push the skewer slowly through the balloon to the opposite side. When it comes into contact with the bottom near where the balloon is tied off, start to spin the skewer again. Don't push too hard, but use a little pressure as you push through. Don’t go through the knot itself, but next to the knot instead. Continue to spin and push the skewer until it breaks through the other side.If the balloon popped, try again with more spinning and gentle pressure. Practice makes perfect!

Gather the necessary materials.,
Blow up a balloon about two-thirds full.,
Place two strips of clear tape in the formation of a cross anywhere on the balloon.,
Place another tape cross on the opposite side to this one.,
Push the skewer into the balloon through the center of one taped cross.,
Push the skewer up through the center of the taped cross on the other side.",How to Skewer a Balloon2," For this version of the trick, you’ll need clear plastic tape, a balloon, and a kabob skewer. You’ll need enough tape to make 4 small-sized pieces. All of these items should be easily obtained at your local grocery store.


Any type of tape will work for this, it just needs to be able to strongly adhere to the balloon. Clear tape works best.

, An overfilled balloon is more likely to pop, so if you overfill it, simply let some air out. Skewering the balloon is easiest when it is a little flat. Longer balloons for balloon animals don’t work as well as normal round balloons., When attempting this trick for the first time, you might want to place the tape cross at the bottom of the balloon. As you get more experience, try placing the tape cross on the side of the balloon where it is stretched more.The bottom of the balloon is less likely to pop because the rubber is not stretched as tightly.

, Again, if trying this for the first time, you will want to place the second cross at the top of the balloon directly across from the first tape cross at the bottom of the balloon.


After you tried the top and bottom, try the sides of the balloon. Just make sure the tape crosses are directly opposite each other.

, Applying gentle pressure, carefully push the skewer through one of the taped crosses. It does not matter which cross you go through first. The skewer should easily pass through the rubber of the balloon without popping.If the balloon pops, try again. Make sure the tape is firmly pressed onto the side of the balloon.

, After you have penetrated one side of the balloon, push the skewer through to the other cross. Position the skewer so that it pokes through the center of the cross. Apply enough pressure for it to go all the way through. The skewer should go through without popping the balloon.If you want to make it really fancy, push several skewers through by adding more tape crosses.

Choose events based on your strengths.,
Join a study event.,
Join a building event.",How to Prepare for a Science Olympiad Competition1," One of the best ways to excel at the SO is to choose events based on your strengths. To do this ask yourself, “Which science classes do I enjoy most?” or “Which science classes do I excel in?” By answering these questions, you can figure out which events you will enjoy the most, and thus, which events you will excel in., Study events are reading and writing intensive. This type of event often involves completing a written component. Either a test will be administered during this event, or it will run in stations. If it is run in stations, there are typically 10 to 20 stations. For each station there will be a corresponding section in your test with questions. The stations also have time limits; typically five minutes per station. On the other hand, if a test is administered, it will be like a normal test with questions and answers. Sometimes models, like anatomy models, will be present as well.Prepare for study events by making a binder. Your binder should include your notes, charts, and diagrams. Use flash cards to help you remember names of muscles and bones. You can also use school textbooks to help you study.
Put extra time into studying charts and diagrams since a lot of the questions on the tests pertain to charts, like the skeletal or muscular system. Study their corresponding names and numbers.
Buy test packets and field guides. Purchase test packets depending on which division you are in. Test packets include tailored exercises for each event and division. For example, if you are in Division C and will be participating in a physical life sciences event, buy the Division C test packet for the life sciences., Building events are more hands-on and require participants to build something. Participants either have to build something before the competition and bring it the day of, or build something at the competition from start to finish.


Prepare for a building event by reading the rules and specifications for your model. Memorize the rules and hold study sessions where you quiz yourself and your teammates on the rules.
Plan out your design before building it. Once your design is built, hold multiple testing sessions in order to see how your model functions. Make sure both you and your partner are present during testing sessions. Also, record any adjustments you make in a log so you can gauge what effect the adjustment had on your model.Use materials that are sturdy and straight, like metal and wood, so they will not bend during competition time. You also want your model to be flexible and not rigid. This means refraining from using too much glue; use screws and fasteners (if weight restrictions do not apply) to hold your model together."
"
Learn the rules.,
Set up regular meetings with teammates.,
Time yourself.",How to Prepare for a Science Olympiad Competition2," Learning the rules for each event and for each level, i.e., regional, state, or national, is crucial to successfully completing an event. Ensure that you have an up-to-date handbook by checking for the year at the bottom of the page next to the page number. The handbook will advise you on what materials to bring, like goggles or a lab coat, as well as what materials you cannot bring.

, Once you have acquired all your studying materials, set up regular meetings with your team and teammates. These meetings should be weekly meetings. Teamwork skills are very important. Therefore, practice working as a team, and learn to trust your partner’s skills.


Learn to trust your partner’s skills by practicing with them regularly. By practicing with each other, you will be able to assess each of your strengths and weaknesses. Adjust your partnership relative to you and your partner’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, if one of you excels at identifying muscle groups, while the other excels at writing, adjust your partnership accordingly.
Practice with sample questions from your test packets, field guides, and training guides.

, Remember that events are timed. In order to be successful at the competition, practice under timed conditions. Have your teammate time you as you practice completing a task, and vice versa. Come up with sample questions and stations in order to practice completing these tasks on time. "

Create a binder.,
Make extra copies of your notes.,
Have a toolbox.",How to Prepare for a Science Olympiad Competition3," Create a binder that contains your resources, like your notes. Have a copy of the rules, as well as lists that are needed for an event, for example, a list of birds or fossils. If you are attending multiple events, section off the materials in your binder so you can access them easily and avoid mixing up the materials; also label the section tabs.Try to get as much information as possible on a page by reducing the size of images. Or, type up your notes in small font (but not so small that you cannot read it), and then write extra notes in the margins. Include things in your notes that you have trouble memorizing.
Color code important information so you can access it quickly. Keep the colors of your codes consistent so that you will be able to associate a color with a particular piece of information. For example, color code muscles pink, the respiratory system blue, and the endocrine system red., Make extra copies of your notes in case you lose your binder or your original notes. Protect your notes by placing them in plastic sheet protectors., For students who will need to bring models to the event, bring along a toolbox in case your model comes apart or loses a part in transit from your home to the event."

Know the layout of the competition site.,
Plan what you will do ahead of time.,
Get a good night’s sleep.,
Eat a healthy breakfast.,
Show up early.",How to Prepare for a Science Olympiad Competition4," You will be provided with a map of the campus that will be hosting the event. Take some time to review the map and locate which buildings your event will be in. If you have time and live near the campus, visit the school or college that will be hosting the event. This will enable you to become familiar with the buildings and locate convenient parking sites., Plan out how you will get to the event, when and what you will eat for lunch, and what time you plan to arrive and leave the event. Try to obtain the phone numbers of some of your teammates in case you get lost at the event or cannot find the correct building your event will be in., Ensure that you have enough energy for competition day by getting a good night’s sleep. For a good night’s sleep, it is recommended that you sleep at least 7 hours. Also, try to relax before competition day by doing something fun instead of studying or practicing., Eating is also crucial if you want to have a successful day. Try to have a healthy breakfast by eating fruits, oatmeal, eggs, and grains for breakfast. Try to avoid sugary foods like cereal or pop tarts. Sugary foods will most likely cause you to have a sugar rush, which might make you crash and become very tired., Show up early to the competition and to your event. Show up three to five minutes early for your event. This will ensure that you have enough time to set up your materials, gather your thoughts, and take a couple relaxing breaths to ready yourself for the event.

Pour water into a glass container.,
Locate a power source.,
Submerge the leads.,
Place aluminum foil in a beaker.,
Keep the beaker ventilated.,
Add hydrochloric acid.,
Use a balloon or bottle to collect the hydrogen.,
Avoid contact with oxygen.,
Collect only small amounts.",How to Make Hydrogen (Science Experiment)," Avoid using plastic or metal for this. You will be running an electric current through the water that could melt plastics. Metal will conduct this current and could shock you if you touch the container.If you are unfamiliar with this experiment, start with one cup of water. Producing too much hydrogen can be dangerous.
Children should only do this experiment with a responsible/knowledgable adult.
Add a tablespoon of salt to the water for better results.;
, While large scale hydrogen production requires a lot of energy, this experiment can be done with little input. A 9V battery is sufficient to perform the electrolysis (splitting of the water into hydrogen and oxygen). You can also use multiple batteries in series to strengthen the effect.A portable power supply is good for this experiment, as this experiment should be done outside or under a fume hood.
An easy way to make leads is to connect a paper clip to each terminal of the battery.
While batteries aren’t generally dangerous, keep in mind that you will have salt water on your hands. You should wear rubber gloves to avoid being shocked.

, You will have a negative lead (the anode) and a positive lead (the cathode). You can create these leads by wrapping a paper clip around the positive and negative terminals of the battery. Electricity will flow from the anode, through the water, and to the cathode. Hydrogen bubbles will form at the anode and the cathode will produce oxygen and chlorine gas.Be cautious not to touch the leads together.

, Tear up pieces of aluminum foil and put them into a beaker or other container. Do not use a container with a lid or cap, as this could result in an explosion. There is no need to measure the amount of aluminum used.You could tear a three inch by three inch square of aluminum foil into pieces about the size of your thumb.

, Do this experiment outside or under a fume hood. Hydrogen gas disperses quickly, but is very flammable. A buildup of hydrogen gas that is exposed to the air (or any other source of oxygen) can explode.One example of hydrogen gas exploding is the Hindenburg.

, There is no need to precisely measure the amount of hydrochloric acid used. The chlorine in the in the hydrochloric acid will react with the aluminum to form aluminum chloride. This will result in the formation of hydrogen gas.Start with about two ounces of hydrochloric acid and add more if needed.

, Place the opening of the collection vessel (bottle or balloon) over the opening of your reaction beaker or container. The hydrogen gas is less dense than air and will move up into your collection vessel. This method is often used to blow up a balloon to demonstrate the upward movement of hydrogen gas., Hydrogen gas in contact with oxygen will explode. If you are doing electrolysis, do not collect the gas emitting from both leads, as it will be a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. If there is only one opening in your container and you lack way to avoid mixing the gases, do not collect them at all. If you do collect the hydrogen, keep it away from fire and in an airtight container., You should not collect or store a high volume of hydrogen gas. It poses a serious safety risk, and is difficult to contain. You should do this experiment only for entertainment or educational purposes."

Fill a bottle with warm water and set aside for a minute.,
Fill a plastic bag or strainer with ice cubes.,
Pour out all but one inch of the water in the bottle.,
Cover the bottle with the ice cubes.,
Troubleshoot any issues.",How to Make Fog in a Bottle1," The safest way to make fog in a bottle is to simply use ice cubes and warm water. To start, fill a bottle with warm water. The water does not need to be boiling. Just try to run tap water as hot as it goes. Fill the bottle to a little below the brim and set the bottle aside for 60 seconds.Fog is formed when warm water vapor comes into contact with cold temperatures. By heating up the inside of the bottle with hot water, you are creating warm vapor inside the bottle.;
, While you're letting the bottle sit, prepare your ice. Take some ice cubes from the fridge and place them in a plastic bag or a strainer. Whether you use a bag or strainer depends on the container you're using for your project.


Some people use jars instead of bottles for this experiment. If you're using a jar, it's a good idea to set the ice in a strainer, which you should be able to find at a grocery store. The strainer's circular shape makes it fit more easily over a jar.A strainer may not fit easily over the smaller opening in, say, an empty soda bottle. As you want to cover the lid completely, a plastic bag, which is more malleable, can sink slightly into the bottle. This will cover the opening. Use a plastic bag if you're using a bottle.

, Once 60 seconds have passed, pour most of the water out of the bottle. Leave about one inch of water on the bottom of the bottle.Now, the air inside the bottle is warm. When it's exposed to the cool temperatures caused by the ice cubes, fog will form inside the bottle., Take the plastic bag or strainer. Place it over the covering of your bottle or jar. In a few seconds, you should expect to see fog form inside the bottle.A strainer should fit fairly easily over a jar. However, a plastic bag may need to be secured. If your bag slips off the bottle, try to secure it with a few pieces of duct tape.

, In the event fog does not form, review your process. It's possible the opening of the bottle is not completely covered, preventing the cold air from the ice cubes from interacting with the warm water vapor in the bottle. You also may not have gotten the water hot enough to cause fog. Try repeating the process, using hotter water and a bigger bag or strainer.

Assemble the ink ingredients.,
Find a writing implement.,
Write on the paper using the ""ink"" of choice and the writing implement.,
Gather the necessary items to create the crystals.To make crystals you need very few things:


100 g or more crystal powder (If you want to grow a big crystals, you should have more than 100 g)
100 ml distilled water (or boiled water)
Filter paper
2 clean jars.

,
Note from the outset: Do not taste or touch the crystals, or the substances used for making the crystals.,
Mix the crystal powder and the water.

,
Stir until the powder stops dissolving.

,
Filter the obtained solution.,
Place the solution in a clean jar after it is filtered.,
Let the solution sit for a while.,
Filter the solution again.,
Add new solution when needed.,
Assemble the items needed.,
Empty the entire bottle of glue into a mixing bowl.

,
Fill the empty bottle with warm water and shake (put the lid on first, then shake).,
Measure 1/2 cup of warm water into the plastic cup.,
Notice the reaction.,
Store properly.",How to Make Fun Experiments Home," To make invisible ink many things can be used, choose from one of the following:


Orange juice
Milk
Lime
Grape juice. ;
, For example, a cotton bud, toothpick, paintbrush or a fountain pen.

, Let it dry completely before sending to someone.


Attach a note. Writing invisible messages is fun but it can be a problem if the person who gets the invisible message does not know that it has a message; he or she might think of it as something else like a prank. If the recipient isn't aware, send a note along with it saying, for example: ""Dear , This blank paper has an invisible message. To read it heat it or look at it under a bright light.""

,, Some are highly toxic (potassium dichromate, potassium nitrate or iodine compounds).

,,, Don't worry if the powder wasn't all dissolved. You should keep the powder on the filter paper.

, Cover the jar with something, such as a layer of wax paper or a lid or maybe a filter paper. Otherwise, the solution may attract some impurities from the air and then it will grow many ""parasitic"" crystals.


Don't put the jar on a heat source.

, A big crystal isn't going to grow all of a sudden. Wait a while. The next time you take a look at your crystals, you'll see that there have grown many crystals. Choose one that you like (a seed) and put the remaining crystals where you put the remaining powder.


If you want to grow many little crystals quickly, you can heat the water. However, if you want to grow big nice crystals, you shouldn't do that, as it won't work for a large crystal.
If you want to grow a little crystal quickly, you can put a little ""crumb"" from the powder as the seed.

, Then put your little crystal into the solution. (You may do this every time you see little crystals.)

, When you see that in the jar isn't enough solution to cover the whole crystal, make some new solution as you have made the first one (I mean make the solution in a clean jar, filter it and then fill the jar that have you're crystal).


Growing crystals takes a lot of time, so be patient. They take at least a few days.
If you have some small crystals sticking out of your crystal, put your crystal in water and leave it there until you don't see any more small crystals.
Crystals are fragile and break easily. Move the jar with care.

, Use clear PVA solution––this is the secret to great slime. The measurements do not have to be exact but it’s a good idea to start with the proportions below for the first batch. Just vary the quantities of each ingredient to get a new and interesting batch of goo.


Elmers glue (8 oz bottle of Elmers Glue-All) 
Borax (a powdered soap found in the grocery store)
Large mixing bowl
Plastic cup (8 oz size works well)
Spoon
Measuring cup
Food coloring
Water
Paper towel (to clean up)
Zipper-lock bag (to keep it when you're done)
Water.


This recipe is based on using a brand new 8 ounce bottle of Elmer’s glue.







,, Pour the glue-water mixture into the mixing bowl and use the spoon to mix well.


Go ahead. Add a drop or two of food coloring, if using.

, Add a teaspoon of borax powder to the water. Stir the solution – don’t worry if all of the powder dissolves. This borax solution is the secret linking agent that causes the Elmer’s glue molecules to turn into slime.


While stirring the glue in the mixing bowl, slowly add a little of the borax solution.

, Immediately you’ll feel the long strands of molecules starting to connect. It’s time to abandon the spoon and use your hands to do the serious mixing. Keep adding the borax solution to the glue mixture (don’t stop mixing) until you get a perfect batch of Elmer’s slime. You might like your slime more stringy while others like firm slime. Hey, you’re the head slime mixologist – do it your way!

, When you’re finished playing with your Elmer’s slime, seal it up in a zipper-lock bag for safe keeping."

Gather your supplies.,
Add warm water to your bottle.,
Break the dry ice into small chunks.,
Add the dry ice to your bottle using tongs.,
Play with your fog in a bottle.",How to Make Fog in a Bottle2," You can make more intense fog by using dry ice. This process is a little trickier, and there is some potential danger when handling dry ice. Before you start, make sure to gather your supplies.


You'll need a plastic bottle. Any bottle, like an empty soda or water bottle, will work. Avoid using a jar when using dry ice, as you'll need a smaller opening for the experiment to be effective.You will need dry ice. Dry ice can be purchased in large bags at most supermarkets or drug stores. However, you need to be at least 18 to legally purchase dry ice. You do not need a lot of dry ice, so go for the smallest bag you can find. If you're younger than 18, you'll have to have an adult purchase dry ice for you. In general, it's a good idea to have adult supervision when using dry ice as the substance can be dangerous when handled improperly.You will need thick gloves and tongs. Dry ice is very cold and can cause severe burns if handled by bare hands.You will need a hammer to break the dry ice into chunks.

, Fill a plastic bottle about 1/4 of the way full with warm water. Once again, you do not need to use boiling water. Just run tap water as warm as it gets for the project to be effective., Use your hammer to break the dry ice into small chunks. Make sure you wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt to avoid coming into direct contact with your dry ice. If you're younger, it's a good idea to have an adult break up the dry ice for you., Once you've broken the dry ice into chunks, use your tongs to add a few chunks of dry ice to the bottle. You should not need to add more than one or two pieces of dry ice before a thick fog begins to form in your bottle., Once your fog has formed, you can play with your fog in a bottle. Squeeze the bottle gently, causing small circles of fog to puff out of the bottle. If the fog starts to die down, add another chunk of dry ice.Be careful when playing with your bottle. You do not want to accidentally spill or drop it. It's a good idea to keep protective gloves on when squeezing the bottle.
If the water gets too cold, you can pour the bottle's contents down the sink. Then, add warm water and repeat the process.Never cover your bottle. If dry ice is put in a sealed container, gas will build up until the container explodes."
"
Use protective gloves when handling dry ice.,
Store dry ice carefully.,
Treat burns quickly.",How to Make Fog in a Bottle3," Dry ice is extremely dangerous to handle with your bare hands. As dry ice exists at very low temperatures, as low as -109 degrees Fahrenheit, it is very harmful to the skin. Extreme burns can result from touching dry ice with bare hands. Always use protective gloves when handling dry ice. You should wear cloth or leather gloves to protect your skin. An oven mitt would also effectively protect you from dry ice., You will probably not use all of your dry ice in a single science experiment. Make sure you store the dry ice properly when you're done making fog in a bottle.


Store dry ice in an insulated container that is not completely airtight. As stated previously, an airtight container will cause dry ice to explode.You should make sure the room you're storing dry ice in is well-ventilated. It can be dangerous to store dry ice in a cellar or car.You should also not store dry ice in a freezer or fridge. This will result in the thermostat in your freezer/fridge dropping to the point the fridge turns off., During the process of making fog in a bottle, you may get burned by the hot water or dry ice. Most burns can be treated at home. Run the burn under cool water for about 10 to 15 minutes, or as long as it takes for the pain to ease. Then, do some follow up care.Remove any items, like rings, from the burned area. If you have any blisters, avoid breaking them. In the event they break on their own, clean the area with water and mild soap.Add some aloe vera gel to help keep the area from drying out. You can try an over-the-counter pain medication, like ibuprofen, if the pain is severe."

Gather your tools and materials.,Fold a sheet of aluminum foil several times until it's thick.,
Place the small box on the foil and neatly wrap it around securely.,
Mold the box twice as tall as your finished ice cube.,
Carefully unfold the foil off the box, but not folding all the way through.,Repeat the same steps to make more molds for multiple ice cubes.,Preheat the oven to 450° Fahrenheit (232° Celsius).,Pour the clear beads in each opening in the foil molds.,Place the molds on a baking tray standing straight.,Allow the fake ice to bake for about 30 minutes, until the beads melt,
Remove the fake ice from the oven and carefully peel off the foil.,Leave the fake ice on a plate to sit until they're cool enough to touch.,
Using the knife and metal file, shave off the extra lingering pieces.,
Understand how it works.",How to Make Fake Ice," You will need clear craft beads, a metal file, baking tray, aluminum foil, small ice cube sized boxes, a utility knife, and an oven.
,, It's important to securely wrap the box to avoid leakage when melting the beads., When the ice cubes bake you'll want them to have plenty of room to form, so it's important to keep the mold tall. Make an opening on one face of the box.so you'll have an area to pour the beads in. , After removing the foil you will have a finished mold to use when it's time to make the fake ice.,,,,,, Take extreme caution, the molds and foil will be hot.,, Carefully shave off an excess foil on the edges or corners to help form a smooth, shiny surface on the fake ice., When you place the clear beads in the oven, it melts and turns into a clear color. When it's placed in the mold, the shape resemble an ice cube shape once baked and cooled. This creates the fake ice structure. "

Prepare your materials.,
Make the base for your crystals.,
Tie the pipe cleaner with string.,
Tie the other end of the string to the pencil.,
Dissolve the borax with the boiling water.,
Pour the borax mixture in the mason jar or bowl, carefully.,
Add the food coloring.,Place the pencil in the jar or bowl and allow it to sit overnight.,
Watch for your results.",How to Make Crystals with Borax," You will need borax, a glass container, boiling water, pipe cleaners, a mason jar or small glass bowl, string, a spoon, a pencil, scissors, and food coloring if desired for color.
, Using the pipe cleaners, shape the pipe cleaners into any desired shape. You may want to shape it into the shape of a flower, heart, snowflake, or a star. Remember that this will be the base for your crystals so choose a shape you'd like., Cut a 10 inch (25 centimeters) piece of string using the scissors. Lay the pencil across the jar or bowl. Tie the pipe cleaner with the string and place it in the container. The pipe cleaner should be close to the bottom, but it should not touch the bottom of the container. , To help the pipe cleaner hang freely, tie the other end of string onto the pencil. When you have your string tied and ready, lift the pencil and the pipe cleaner out of the container. Set it aside., For every 1 cup of boiling water, dissolve 3 tablespoons of borax in a glass container. , Use oven mitts if needed as the mixture is boiling hot. It's normal for the borax to settle on the bottom. , For a vibrant color, add 10-15 drops of food coloring. For a lighter color, add about 7-10 drops of food coloring. Stir around with a spoon until the mixture is bright and vibrant.,, After the container sits overnight, the crystals will appear on the base. Mixing the boiling water and borax creates a suspension of solid particles. When solution starts to cool, the water molecules slow down and move closer together. The molecules bond together and form crack and then start crystallizing. "

Heat water until it's very hot, but not boiling.,
Fill a glass jar with the hot water.,
Pour out most of the water.,
Place a metal strainer over the jar.,
Fill the strainer with ice.,
Watch the fog form.",How to Make Fog1," If your tap water is very hot, you might be able to use this water right out of the tap. You can also heat water on the stove, or fill a glass container and heat it in the microwave.The water should be hot to the touch but not quite boiling. Aim for a temperature somewhere between 120 and 180 degrees Fahrenheit (49 and 82 degrees Celsius).
You can check the temperature with a kitchen thermometer. If you don't have a thermometer, simply feel it with your finger. It should feel scalding hot to the touch.;
, Start by pouring in a small amount of hot water, and swirling it around the base of the jar. Next, fill the jar completely and let it sit inside for a full minute.The reason to start with only a small amount of water is to prevent the glass from cracking with hot water. Make sure that you're using a canning-quality jar, such as a Mason or Ball jar. These jars are intended to be used with very hot water.
Set a timer for 1 minute (or 60 seconds) while you wait. This can be a good time to retrieve a metal strainer, if you don't already have it handy.

, Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) inside the jar. The goal is to have a very hot jar with hot water in the bottom.If you pour out too much water, you can use hot tap water to replace the water at the base of the jar because the jar itself is already hot.
If you heated the water to the boiling point, you can allow it to cool a little. However, you may want to use a hot pad to protect your hand when you pour out the water. The hot jar could burn your hand.

, Rest the strainer over the top of the jar so that the basket is held inside the jar.


Do not let the strainer come into contact with the water itself.
The strainer should rest inside the warm air of the jar, but not inside the hot water.

, Place at least three to four ice cubes inside the strainer, working quickly. Alternatively, you could put a few pieces of ice into the lid of the jar and set it atop the hot jar.If your strainer is too small to fit that many ice cubes, you could use crushed ice, instead.
The contrast of the cold ice against the hot wet air inside the jar is what creates the fog.

, When cold air from the ice suddenly clashes with the warm air of the jar, rapid condensation should occur, causing fog to form inside the jar. If you have an aerosol spray, such as hairspray, a quick spray inside the jar will make the fog more long-lasting.For colorful fog, add a few drops of food coloring to your hot water.
As the jar cools, the fog will diminish.

"
"
Fill up a jar halfway with warm water.,
Stir in the crystal base.,
Watch as crystals form.",How to Make Crystals1," Any jar will do, as long as it's clean, since debris could interfere with the crystal growth. Using a clear jar will enable you to watch the crystals form. You could also use a glass, a vase, or any other dish that will hold water.;
, Start by adding about two tablespoons of your chosen crystal base, then continue pouring in more base and stirring until no more base will dissolve. You'll know it's time to stop when you see a fine layer of crystal base collecting on the bottom of the jar.


Rock salt makes a cheap, accessible crystal base. Epsom salt also works, and is available at most drug stores.
Alternative crystal bases include alum, a substance used for making pickles, or borax, which is available at hardware stores.

, Within an hour or so, crystals will begin to form on the bottom and sides of the jar. As the water in the jar evaporates, the crystals will grow larger. The longer you let the mixture sit in the jar, the bigger the crystals will get.


If you want to make an individual crystal you can use as a decoration, remove a piece of crystal from the bottom of the jar and tie a string around it. Tie the other end of the string to a pencil and rest the pencil over the mouth of the jar with the crystal suspended in the water. Let the crystal grow as large as you want before removing it and drying it off.
You can keep the crystals in the jar for as long as you like. To prevent them from getting dusty, cover the jar with a lid after the water has finished evaporating.

Gather your materials.,
Cut the copper wire to 10 inches (25.4 cm) and the plastic straw to 2 inches (5.1 cm).,
Punch a hole in the lid of the jar.,
Secure the straw to the lid with hot glue.,
Twist the top 4 inches (10.2 cm) of the copper wire into a spiral.,
Insert the copper into the straw and make a hook 1 inch (2.5 cm) long.,
Cut two triangle shapes out of aluminum foil.,
Hang the triangles on the copper hook and screw the lid onto the jar.,
Test the electroscope with a charged balloon.",How to Make an Electroscope1," Most of these materials are household items that are easy to find. To make this electroscope you will need:A clear jar (glass or plastic)
The jar lid
14 gauge copper wire (can be obtained at any local hardware or home improvement store)
A plastic straw
Scissors
A hot glue gun (can be purchased at any craft store)
Aluminum foil
Wire cutters
Pliers
A ruler
A hammer
Tape
A balloon;
, Ask for adult assistance to cut the copper wire with wire cutters. The straw can simply be cut with scissors. Measure with the ruler and cut to the desired length.When cutting the wire, sometimes pieces will snap away during the cut. It is recommended to wear eye protection during this step.

, The hole in the lid needs to be large enough for the straw to fit through. Ask an adult for help with this step. Position a nail or punch in the center of the jar lid and hammer through until you have a hole of appropriate size.


Take caution with this step. It is recommended to wear eye protection in case bits of plastic fly during the hammering process.
If you punch the hole too big, simply add more hot glue in the next step to secure the straw in place.

, Insert the straw into the hole until half of the straw is above and below the lid. With the hot glue gun, secure the straw in place by gluing all along the edges of the straw and hole.Ask for adult supervision with the hot glue gun as it is very hot and can cause burns.

, This spiral is important because it allows electrons to be transferred from an object to the electroscope. More surface area means more electron transfer and a bigger response from the electroscope.


Hold on to one end of the wire with the pliers and twist it around to form the spiral shape.
Make a loose spiral with some space between each curl.

, Insert the straight end of the wire into the straw so that the spiral is on the top side of the lid. With the last inch of the wire, shape the straight end into a hook. This hook will hold the foil leaves in place.Grasp the end of the wire with the pliers to properly shape the wire.
The hook does not need to be perfect, it just needs to be able to hold the foil pieces in place.

, The size of the triangles will slightly depend on the size of your jar. You don’t want them to touch any sides of the jar. A good starting point is to make the height of the triangle about 2 inches (5 cm) and the base around 1 inch (3 cm). Cut out two separate triangles, but make them identical.


Punch a small hole into the top of each triangle. The hole needs to be large enough to fit through the copper wire.
If you rip the foil leaf, simply make a new one.
Avoid crumpling the foil during this process. Try to leave them as smooth as possible.

, Hang each triangle onto the copper hook you made. Make sure the foil leaves are touching each other.If the leaves do not touch each other, try altering the shape of the hook so that they can touch.
Carefully, screw the lid onto the jar to complete the electroscope.

, Rub a balloon on your hair to charge it with static electricity. Bring the balloon close to the copper spiral and watch the foil pieces push each other apart. The electrons transfer down the copper wire and into the foil. Because both pieces of foil become negatively charged, they repel each other.You can also rub the soles of your shoes rapidly on carpet and then place the electroscope near your shoes.
Testing works best on a dry day because the electrons cannot escape into the moisture of a humid day.

Mix pure glycerin with distilled water.,
Add fragrance oils, if desired.,
Poke several holes in the side of a metal can.,
Cut the top off a plastic 2-liter (2-qt) bottle.,
Tape the narrow end of the bottle to a pie tin.,
Light the candle.,
Pour the fog juice into the bottle.,
Watch the fog form.",How to Make Fog2," You'll want to use 3 parts glycerin to 1 part water. For example, with 1/2 cup water use 1 1/2 cups of glycerin. This is known as ""fog juice.""Liquid glycerin can usually be found in the pharmacy section of a convenient store or grocery store.
Make sure to use pure glycerin, rather than a synthetic variety. Pure glycerin is able to absorb water from the air, which is why it's used to create fog., Scented fog can bring an additional element to your party or theatrical event. Use 1/2 tsp (0.1 oz) of scent per 1 quart (1 L) of fog juice. The oils you use should be specifically labeled as ""fragrance oils."" Do not use essential oils. For a spooky circus themed scent, mix together equal parts anise oil and cotton candy oil.
Create a swampy scent by combining one part campfire oil with two parts rain oil and four parts rich potting soil oil.
Go for a crypt themed scent by combining one part dill pickle oil with two parts potting soil oil and two parts amber oil.
Theme your fog scent around the idea of a haunted hayride by combining 1 part tall grass oil with two parts cedar oil and two parts pumpkin oil.

, The purpose of the can is to hold a metal pie plate over the candle's flame. The holes will allow air inside the can so that the flame burns freely.Never use a plastic can, as it might release toxic chemicals if it's burned.
A coffee can, or a large soup can, works best.

, You'll want the funnel part of the bottle to funnel your glycerin fog. For best results, use sharp scissors or a razor blade to cut the top 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 cm) of a plastic soda bottle.Keep the top and discard the rest of the bottle.
Be careful when using any sharp blade. Wearing protective gloves may help guard against accidental injury.

, Duct tape, or any strong household tape, will hold the funnel in place. A small pie tin, such as is used for a pot pie, will be sufficient for this project.The fog juice will rest against the metal of the pie tin inside the funnel to create the fog.
Check to make sure that the pie tin is centered on your can, so that it's unlikely to fall off once you've added fog juice.

, Ideally, you'll have a multi-wick candle that will create an even area of heat across the breadth of the pie tin. If you don't have a multi-wick candle (a candle with more than 1 wick), use several small tea light candles to achieve the same effect.If you do use tea light candles, make sure that the candles are closely bound together so that the heat is concentrated in the same general area.
Position the pie plate over the candle
Make sure that the bottom of the pie plate is near the flame but not close enough to touch it.

, Add anywhere from 1 tsp (5 ml) to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of fog juice to the heated pie plate by pouring it into the opening of the bottle top.A little fog juice will go a long way. Resist the temptation to get carried away by pouring too much fog juice in at once.
You can add more fog juice as needed.

, The heated solution should quickly turn into fog, and the fog should burst out of the top of the bottle and flow into the room.For a interesting effect, shine colored light on the fog. If you want to create colored fog, the easiest and safest way to do this is by shining colored light directly on the fog as it flows out of the bottle top.
The clear droplets from the fog will reflect the colored light.

Fill a large metal or plastic container with hot water.,
Put 5 to 10 lbs (2250 to 4500 g) dry ice in the water.,
Watch the fog form.,
Add more dry ice as needed.",How to Make Fog3," Use 4 to 8 gallons (15.1 to 30.3 L) of hot water to maintain the fog in 15-minute bursts.Try to maintain a temperature between 120 and 180 degrees Fahrenheit (49 and 82 degrees Celsius). Additionally, boiling water is not ideal because it adds its own vapor to the dry ice fog, causing it to flow up instead of sprawling down and outward.
Keep your container of water hot using a hot plate to maintain your fog for a long time.

, Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide, which has a much lower freezing point than water (-109.3°F or -78.5°C.) Drop the dry ice into the hot water using tongs. Typically, 1 lb (450 ml) will produce enough fog to last for 2 to 3 minutes.Hotter water will create more fog, but the hotter the water is, the faster the ice will turn to fog and the more often you will need to add more.
Always handle dry ice with insulated gloves and tongs.

, The extremely cold temperature of dry ice will have an immediate reaction to the hot water, causing a thick cloud of fog to form. The rising steam of the hot water, together with the melting ice, creates the effect of fog.Control the direction of the fog with a small electric fan.
Because fog will naturally be heavier than air, most of the fog will sink to the floor or ground unless you force it to rise with the fan.

, Every 15 minutes or so, you'll need to add more dry ice to consistently maintain the fog effect. Smaller pieces of dry ice added to the water will maintain greater fog volume over time, rather than larger pieces that will great large bursts of fog.Try using a hot plate to keep your water from cooling off, or refresh with hot water from your kitchen.
Be aware that water is likely to bubble out from the reaction of the dry ice and water. If you're making fog indoors, know that the floor is likely to become slippery wherever the fog is.

Go to a hardware store for supplies.,
Create two soft copper coils.,
Place the smaller coil into the larger coil.,
Place both coils into a stovepipe.,
Connect the coils.,
Submerse the pump in an ice chest full of ice water.,
Turn on your pump.",How to Make Fog4," You'll need a few basic supplies to build your own fog machine. These supplies should be available at most hardware stores, and are not expensive. Unless you plan to keep your fog machine for a long time, most of these items can be repurposed for other projects. The items you'll need include:


A 2-foot, 6-inch round sheet metal ductwork pipe. This is also known as a stove pipe, and this will be the container that you make your fog inside.
A 25-foot length of 1/4-inch copper refrigerator tubing
A 50-foot length of 3/8-inch copper refrigerator tubing
A 12-foot length of 3/8-inch clear plastic tubing
A 2-foot length of 1-1/2 inch pipe (used as a form, then discarded)
A 2-foot length of 3-inch ABS plastic pipe (used as a form, then discarded)
4 pipe clamps for the 3/8"" Clear plastic tubing
1 small submersible pump (80 gal/hour)
A package of plastic wire ties
An ice chest or bucket

, One coil should have a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) and the other coil should have a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm). Form the coils by tightly winding soft copper refrigerator tubing around a piece of PVC pipe. You should be able to wind the copper tubing around the pipes using your hands, but if you have difficulty grasping it, you could grab the tubing using pliers.To create the inner coil, wind the 25 foot (7.6 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).
To create the outer coil, wind the 50 feet (15.24 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm).
Slide the coils out of their respective tubes once created.

, Slide the smaller coil directly inside the larger coil and secure it in place by using small wire ties. This allows the fog to pass in and around the coils, which provides the best cooling.If tying the smaller coil in place is too difficult, you can just allow the small coil to lay against the bottom of the larger one.
Because the coils will need to fit inside the stove pipe, stretch them out until they roughly match the length of the pipe.

, Slide the larger coil into your stovepipe, using wire ties to hold both coils in place. The goal is to have the two coils as close to the center as possible inside the larger pipe.Hanging the coils in this way allows the fog to pass in and around the coils and cool it even better.
The machine will work without using the ties, but it won't work as well.

, At one end of the chiller, connect the ends of the inner and outer coils using short pieces of plastic tubing and pipe clamps.You'll need to connect the ends of the coils on the other side of the chiller to a small submersible pump using longer pieces of plastic tubing and pipe clamps.
Cold water will come from the pump, and circulate through the coils.

, The pump should be completely submerged and there should be room for a small commercial fog machine to sit beside it.The water needs to be ice cold in order for the mechanism to work, so you may need to wait 30 minutes or so after dumping the ice in the water before you can create the cold fog.
Place your fog machine into the other end of the ice chest. The spout should face outward.

, After a minute or so, cold water should circle through the copper tubing.Test the temperature of the copper by touching it. You should be able to feel the cold water through the sides of the copper.
Follow by turning on your fog machine. Fill the fog machine with commercial fog juice and switch it on. Fog should roll out, but instead of floating up as hot fog does, it should sink to the floor thanks to the cooling mechanism.

Fill up a jar halfway with warm water.,
Stir in some sugar.,
Add color and flavor.,
Suspend wooden sticks in the sugar solution.,
Cover the jar.,
Remove the sticks when the crystals have formed.",How to Make Crystals2," Since you're making candy this time, be especially sure that the jar is clean. Wash it out with warm soapy water and dry it completely before you get started.

, Use a spoon to dissolve sugar into the warm water. Keep adding sugar until no more will dissolve. You'll know you're finished when a layer of sugar collects at the bottom of the jar.

, Plain crystal rock candy turns out clear and tastes like sugar. It's easy to make delicious variations by adding a few drops of food coloring and flavored extract. Consider the following color and flavor combinations, or think up your own:


Purple food coloring with grape flavoring.
Red food coloring with cinnamon flavoring.
Green food coloring with peppermint flavoring.

, You can buy special candy sticks with knobs on the end, or use chopsticks or popsicle sticks instead. Place them inside the jar of sugar solution and lean them against the side.

, Place a layer of plastic wrap or another covering over the jar to prevent bugs from getting in. Make sure it isn't too tight, or the water inside won't be able to evaporate.

, After a few days to a week, the sticks will be covered with sugar crystals. Remove them when you're satisfied with the size of the crystals, and enjoy the candy you have made.

Make crystal ornaments.,
Make crystal eggs.",How to Make Crystals3," Make up a solution of warm water and the crystal base of your choice. Suspend plain wooden ornaments in the solution by tying the ornament string to a pencil and placing the pencil over the mouth of the jar. Wait a week for crystals to form, then remove the ornaments and dry them off before using.


You can form pipe cleaners into different shapes and use them in place of wooden ornaments.
Stars, trees, crescent moons, and leaf shapes all make wonderful crystal ornaments.
Add a few drops of food coloring to make colorful holiday-themed ornaments.

, These geode-like creations are made by painting eggshells with alum and submerging them in crystal solution. Follow these steps to create colorful crystal eggs:



Blow out a chicken egg, use a scissors to trim it in half, and carefully clean and dry the inside of both halves.
Use a paintbrush to apply glue to the inside of the egg, then sprinkle it with salt, alum, borax or sugar.
Make a crystal solution by filling a jar half full of warm water and adding salt, alum, borax or sugar until no more will dissolve. Add food coloring for colorful eggs.
Submerge the egg halves in the solution and wait for the crystals to grow. Remove them and let them dry.

Gather your materials.,
Push a plastic straw through the bottom sides of the foam cup.,
Attach the top of the cup to the pie plate.,
Crumple a 1-inch square piece of aluminum foil into a ball.,
Hang the foil ball from the straw with a piece of thread.,
Test the electroscope with a charged foam plate.",How to Make an Electroscope2," A pith ball electroscope works on the same principle as the foil leaf electroscope, but looks a little bit different. To make a pith ball electroscope you will need:


A small piece of aluminum foil
A foam cup
An aluminum pie plate
A plastic straw
Hot glue or tape
Thread
A balloon
A foam plate
A ruler
Scissors

, Make two holes near the bottom of the cup on opposite sides and slide the straw into place. Position the straw so that three to four inches sticks out on one side of the cup.


Secure the straw to the cup with tape or a little bit of glue.
Avoid making the holes too large or ripping the base of the cup.
It’s okay if the base of the cup has a hole in it as long as the straw is stable in its place.

, Turn the cup upside down so that the bottom of the cup is facing up. Tape or glue the top of the cup to the pie plate. Position the cup towards the edge of the pie plate so the straw sticks out over the edge.Make sure to secure the cup firmly to the bottom of the plate.
Use caution when using hot glue as it is very hot and can cause burns.

, Measure and cut out a one-inch square of aluminum foil. Crumple it tightly into a spherical shape. Try to make it as evenly crumpled as possible so that it looks like a foil marble.The square does not need to be exactly 1-inch, it just needs to be a small marble-shaped aluminum ball.

, Cut a piece of thread long enough to hang the foil ball from the straw without it touching the table (about 2-3 inches should be enough). Tie the thread around the foil ball and knot it in place. Tape the other end of the thread to the end of the straw. The foil ball should hang straight down from the end of the straw.


Make sure the foil ball hangs close to the edge of the pie pan, but does not touch it.

, Rub the foam plate against your hair or a rubber balloon to charge it with static electricity. Place the electroscope on top of the plate and observe what happens. The foil ball should move away from the pie plate. The foam plate transfers electrons to the pie plate and gives it a negative charge, repelling the foil ball away from it.When picking up or moving the electroscope, carry it by the foam cup. If you touch the pie plate, the charges will change and it will not work properly.

Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil.,
Spread some colored sand in a thin layer onto the baking sheet.,
Take the baking sheet to a well-ventilated area.,
Spray the sand with waterproof fabric protecting spray.,
Let the sand dry, then spray it again.,
Leave the sand out to dry.,
Transfer the sand into a sealable container.,
Fill a clear container with water.,
Pour the sand into the water.,
Poke, prod, and squish the sand.,
Consider making a scene.,
Take the sand out of the water when you are done playing with it.,
Let the sand dry off, if necessary.,
Store the sand back in its container.",How to Make Aqua Magic Sand," You can also use parchment paper, plastic wrap, or even wax paper.This will make cleaning up at the end easier.
, If you want to make more than one color, you can use a second or third baking sheet. You can also make smaller patches of colored sand on one large baking sheet, but be sue to leave some space between each one!, The best place to work in would be outdoors. If this is not possible, a large room with windows open might also work. You need good ventilation in the next step so that you don't get lightheaded., You can use any type of waterproofing spray for fabric, such as Scotchgard. Keep spraying until the sand is damp. The spray will make the sand resistant to water and keep it dry., Allow the sand to dry for about 10 minutes first. Stir it up with a spoon, fork, your fingers, or even a toy rake. Spray it once more in a thick, even layer. You want the sand to be damp but not soaking wet.

If the sand still doesn't feel evenly coated, you can repeat this step for good measure, especially if you have a lot of sand., It will take about 30 to 60 minutes for it to do so. It may take longer, however, if you have a lot of sand and it's a damp day., Choose a container that is easy to pour from, such as a mini jar. If you made multiple colors, pour one color into each jar. If you dried your sand on parchment or wax paper, you can use that to funnel the sand into the container., The container does not have to be clear, but if it's clear, you'll be able to see your designs from the side! Vases, large mason jars, and even old (but clean) aquariums make great choices!, You can pour it straight from the jar or you can use a funnel. You can even pour it into a plastic squeeze bottle first, then squeeze it into the water., Grab a clump, pull it out of the water, and watch how it ""magically"" becomes dry again., If you want to make a more permanent display, fill a small, plastic aquarium with water, and pour the sand in. You can create different looks by pouring the sand from a cup, through a funnel, or out of a squeeze bottle. Create some mounds and pillars. Lastly, add some ocean-related figurines inside, such as fish, shells, or mermaids!, You can do this using your hands, a spoon, or even a cup. If you used multiple colors, consider using a spoon to scoop individual colors out. You might still get a few specks of other colors, but it is still a good way to preserve the original color., The sand won't get wet, but there may be some beads of water cleaning to it. If you spot any, spread the sand out on a sheet of parchment paper, and wait for the water to evaporate.If you don't have parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead.

, If you had to ""dry"" the sand, use the parchment/wax paper to funnel it back into its container. Put the cap or lid back on so that the sand doesn't spill."

Gather the necessary materials.,
Add water.,
Pour oil on top of the water.,
Glue the lid onto the bottle.,
Tilt the bottle to make the wave.,
Ask a scientific question.,
Write a hypothesis together.,
Make some observations and discuss density.",How to Make a Wave Bottle," Wave bottles are pretty easy to make and can be constructed from materials that you already have around your home. To make a wave bottle you will need an empty, clear plastic bottle, water, liquid oil, food coloring, a funnel, and hot glue. You can also include small toys/trinkets like googly eyes or beads to add to the wave bottle.You can use baby oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil.
The funnel is optional, but makes the process less messy.
The hot glue is also optional, but prevents the bottle from leaking over time.
Clean the bottle and remove the label before use.
To make it look more like the ocean, use blue food coloring.;
, Place the funnel in the mouth of the bottle and pour water into the bottle until it is almost halfway full. The exact amount of water isn’t important, you just want to make sure that you have a good distribution of oil and water at the end. You can even do up to 3/4 full of water, if you desire.Add a few drops of food coloring to the water and swirl to mix.

, Keep the funnel in place and pour the oil into the bottle. The exact amount added will vary depending on the size of your bottle. Keep pouring until the bottle is almost full. If you’re adding decorations make sure you leave enough space so the bottle doesn’t overflow.At this point, you can drop in any decorations that you want. Add beads, glitter, or any other small trinkets you’d like.
You can pour the oil slowly or quickly. If you let the oil and water sit, they will separate over time.

, To prevent the wave bottle from leaking over time, it’s a good idea to glue the lid shut. This step should be done by an adult because it involves hot glue. Squeeze some hot glue around the rim of the bottle and then screw the lid on shut before the glue dries.Alternatively, you can use superglue to seal the lid.
Sealing the lid will also prevent anyone from accidentally drinking the solution.

, Hold the bottle horizontally and gently tilt it up and down. As you tilt, watch the water make a wave in the oil. You can even shake the bottle and watch how the oil and water mix with each other. Over time, they will separate again.The oil and water separate because oil is less dense than water. It is floating on top of the water.

, In this experiment you will be observing the different properties of oil and water. The question you will be answering is “What happens when oil and water mix?” Ask your child about any times they may have seen oil and water together.They may have seen oil and water while cooking pasta, using salad dressing, or oil in water puddles in a parking lot.

, Ask your child what they think will happen when they try to mix oil and water together. Will they mix evenly so that you can’t even tell them apart or will they separate from each other so that they’re easily distinguishable?Talk about how a hypothesis is an educated guess about what will happen in the experiment.
This experiment is appropriate for all ages, but discussing a hypothesis is best for ages 5+.

, As you pour the oil on top of the water discuss what is happening. Your child should notice that the oil is sitting on top of the water or that little bubbles of oil have formed within the water.Did your observations match your hypothesis?
Density is a property that everything has and refers to the amount of mass it has in terms of the volume it takes up. Something that is very dense will be very heavy even if it is small. Something that is not very dense will be very light even though it is large.The metal lead is very dense, while a piece of foam is much less dense.
Oil is less dense than water and therefore, floats on top of the water.

Cut the bottle in half.,
Puncture the lid.,
Invert the upper part inside the lower part.,
Measure and mark how many drops will fall within a certain amount of time.,
Use the water clock.Your clepsydra should now be complete.",How to Make a Water Clock (Clepsydra)1," Use sharp scissors to cut a disposable plastic water bottle into two pieces. The top should ideally be only slightly shorter than the bottom.


Note that you can create a larger water clock that tracks more time if you use a larger bottle, like a 2-L (2-qt) soda bottle.;
, Use a bradawl or other tool with a sharp, narrow point to pierce the lid of the bottle, creating a small hole with a diameter of roughly 1/8 inch (3.175 mm).


The hole should not be much larger than this, since a bottle with a hole that is too large will lose water too fast to be effective as a water clock.
Alternatively, if you do not have a tool that can create a hole in the hard plastic lid, you can use a plastic cup instead of the top part of the bottle. Pierce the bottom of the cup with an embroidery needle or sewing needle to create a small hole.

, Flip the top part of the bottle over so that the cap faces down. Slip this top part into the bottom portion of the bottle so that the cap rests 4 inches (10 cm) or so above the bottom of the lower half.


Make sure that the cap does not touch the bottom of the bottle. The higher up it is, the better, as long as you can create a snug fit.
If using a plastic cup instead of the top portion of the bottle, rest the cup inside the lower half of the bottle with the bottom of the cup facing down.

, Pour water into your water clock and start timing the flow of water.


Use a permanent marker to mark, on the lower half of the bottle, how much water falls within one minute. Repeat this for the second minute, third minute, and so on, until all the water originally poured into the upper half has dripped out.

, You can use it to measure the passage of time over several minutes.

Choose two containers for your water clock.,
Prepare the containers.,
Prepare a wooden dowel for your float stick.,
Assemble the float stick.,
Fix two eyelet screws to a wooden stake.,
Insert the float stick into the eyelets.,
Create a small hole in the upper container.,
Assemble the water clock in the proper order.,
Calibrate the clock.,
Use the water clock as desired.From this point on, your water clock should be able to accurately tell how much time has passed based on the current water level, as indicated by the calibrated gauge drawn on your wooden stake.

",How to Make a Water Clock (Clepsydra)2," You will need two large containers for this version of the water clock. The two containers can be the same, or they can be different, but they should be roughly the same size so that they can hold the same amount of water.


The larger the containers are, the more water they can hold and the more time they can track.
Ideally, the bottom container should be clear so that you can read the measurement of time more easily. A glass vase or large plastic food storage bin would work well. Make sure that the bottom is flat so that the water pours in evenly.
The top container can be clear or solid. Ideally, the bottom should not have any holes in it, but if it does, this can be corrected later on. Consider using flowerpots, buckets, or empty soup cans.

, Both containers should be empty, clean, and free of holes.


If either container has any holes in it, patch the holes with thick plumber's putty.
Perform a water test on both containers to verify that there are no leaks. Fill the containers with water and let them sit for an hour or so. Check periodically to see if you can spot any leaks. After an hour passes, if there are no leaks, the containers can be used for your water clock.

, Use a hacksaw to trim a wooden dowel down to a length of 2 feet (60.96 cm). This will serve as a guide and measurement gauge.


The dowel must be sturdy, but it should not be heavy enough to push the cork or other buoyant material into the water.

, Carefully hammer a nail into the top portion of a wine cork roughly halfway. Remove the nail, then insert the dowel into the hole.


You need a buoyant material for the float stick, which is why a wine cork is used. Cork does not absorb water as time passes, either, which is another important feature for your float stick.
Make sure that the dowel is firmly secured to the cork. It should not wiggle around or rotate, nor should it fall out.

, Use a hacksaw to cut a wooden stake down to a length of 2 feet (60.96 cm). Screw two eyelet screws into the stake at even intervals, roughly one-third the distance in from either end.


Mark the center of the wood stake using a ruler and pencil. The center will be at about 3/8 inch (9.5 mm). This line should be a vertical one.
Place the wood stake next to the bottom container. The bottom of the stake should be even with the bottom of the container. Make a pencil mark on the center line of the stake 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the top edge of the lower container.
Place the float stick inside the container, near the same side as the stake. Make a mark on the center line 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the top of the float stick.
The two eyelet screws should be screwed into these two measured marks.
Hammer a nail into the marks, only sticking it in for one-quarter of its length. Remove the nail and screw the eyelets into both holes.
These eyelet screws will secure the float stick in a vertical position, thereby reducing the amount of bobbing the stick will do and making it easier to accurately read the water clock once it is assembled.
The dowel you use will need to fit into the eyelet screws comfortably and without much friction or tension. The screws are only meant as guides. They should not hold the float stick perfectly still.

, Insert the top end of the float stick up through the eyelet screws attached to the stake. Make sure that the top of the dowel extends through the top screw.


The top end of the float stick is the side of the stick opposite of the cork.
You should also make sure that there is no friction or tension between the eyelet screws and the float stick, since either one would restrict the float stick's ability to move freely and measure accurately.

, Use a pushpin to make a small hole through one side of the container, roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the bottom. This hole will be the spot from which the water drains.


If you are using a container made of metal, clay, or another thick material, you might need to use a thin nail to make the hole instead of a pushpin. Use the thinnest nail possible. You do not want to create a large hole, since the water will drain out too quickly and make the water clock fairly useless.
Do not make a hole in an area previously covered with plumber's putty. The putty can change shape over time, making the hole larger and changing the rate of time it takes for the water to drip out.
If you make a mistake, you should cover up the hole with plumber's putty and try to create a new one in a different spot.

, The upper container needs to be positioned over the lower container so that the water dripping out of the upper container can drip into the lower one.


Attach the wooden stake to the lower container using strips of clear packing tape. Both the container and stake should stand vertically straight, and the float stick should be placed inside the lower container.
Set the upper container on a ring stand or box and angle it so that the water from the upper container can drip down into the lower container without hitting the float stick. You do not need to secure the upper container to the lower container, but you should avoid bumping it as it runs, since doing so could make the results less accurate.
Perform a quick test by running water through the system to verify that everything is in working condition.

, Before you can use your water clock to tell time, you need to calibrate the stick so that you can use it to gauge the passage of time.


Use a permanent marker with a fine tip to draw a small line on the float stick, just above the bottom eyelet screw, and a matching line on the wood stick. These lines are your starting point. Mark it as ""0 seconds.""
Set a kitchen timer for a set amount of time. For this version of the water clock, which should last for several hours, 30 minutes to 1 hour is ideal. Do not start it yet.
Pour water into the upper container. Block the hole with your finger to prevent the water from flowing out yet. Use your marker to draw a line showing the starting water level on the inside of the upper container.
Start the timer as soon as you uncover the hole on the upper container.
After your set amount of time passes, use your marker to draw another line on your wood stick to match the line drawn on your float stick. Label this line with the correct amount of time.
Continue to let the water drip out, marking every interval of 30 to 60 minutes on the stake, until all the water has dripped into the bottom container from the top.

Gather your materials.,
Measure out equal parts baking soda and white vinegar.,
Color the vinegar with red food coloring.,
Construct a volcano.,
Push the canister into the tip of the volcano.,
Fill the volcano with baking soda.,
Pour the vinegar into the volcano.,
Understand the difference between a dormant and active volcano.,
Understand the chemical reaction.,
Repeat the experiment with different volcano shapes.",How to Make a Volcano with a Film Canister for a Science Fair Project," You will need an empty film canister, modeling clay, and disposable cups to make the volcano. You will use baking soda and white vinegar to make the lava. Food coloring will color the lava if you choose to use it. You should also get a Styrofoam or plastic tray to do the experiment on for easy clean up.Using disposable cups and a tray will allow for faster and easier clean up.
A film canister is the packaging container that holds camera film. You will need a regular 35 mm film canister. You could also use a baby food jar as a substitute.;
, Use the film canister as a guide. Fill the canister with baking soda and then pour that baking soda into a cup. Wipe out the canister to remove any residual baking soda. Now, fill the empty canister with vinegar and pour that vinegar into a separate cup. Be sure to keep the baking soda and vinegar separate at this time so that they do not react before you are ready.The total amount of baking soda and vinegar used for the experiment is not important. The important part is that you use equal amounts of baking soda and vinegar.

, If you wish to make the “lava” red in color, add red food coloring to the cup of vinegar. Add 2-3 drops of food coloring, or enough food coloring to make the desired color. The coloring does not affect the reaction that takes place.The food coloring is not necessary to perform the experiment but is there for visual effect.

, Use the modeling clay to build a volcano structure. You can make the volcano as large as you want. The taller your volcano is the more surface your lava will have to flow down., Make sure that you have removed the lid and push it down with the open side facing up. Make the top of the canister flush with the top of the volcano. Do not pack any clay into the center of the canister. You need to leave the canister empty., Pour the baking soda that you have set off to the side into the canister. This will be the first reactant in the center of your volcano. Be careful not to get any baking soda in your eyes.Use protective eye gear.

, Using the colored white vinegar that you have set off to the side, pour the vinegar into the volcano’s center. The vinegar will react with the baking soda and cause an “eruption”.Stand back as the volcano erupts. While it is not a dangerous reaction, it will be messy.

, Your volcano filled with baking soda represents a volcano that is dormant. Once you add the vinegar, your volcano is now active. While this is not how an actual volcano works, the experiment does give the appearance of a volcano.You could explain the the mock volcano is actually just a visual aid. Say something like “This model volcano serves as a good visual of a real volcano, even though the eruption is created by a chemical reaction instead of extreme pressures.”
A real volcano erupts due to the pressure that the rocks put on the magma inside of the volcano., The vinegar and baking soda react in an acid base reaction. When combined they form carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide gas rises like bubbles in a soda. This creates the “eruption” or “explosion” effect of your volcano.You could explain this by saying something like “Gas is generated rapidly through the chemical reaction, and is unable to escape the volcano at the same rate. This causes pressure to build and forces the contents of the volcano out the top violently, which looks similar to a real volcanic eruption.”

, Notice that when you change the shape of the volcano it will change how the volcano erupts. The lava might spew differently or roll down a different side of the volcano.Explain that the different shapes will affect how the volcano erupts and how the “lava” flows. For instance you might say “If we build a steep volcano with a narrow opening, the eruption will be violent and then run down the sides of the volcano quickly. On the other hand, a short volcano with a wide base and wide opening will allow the lava to flow out more slowly and flow down the volcano at a slower rate.”

Obtain an empty water bottle.,
Remove the label from the bottle.,
Squeeze the water bottle in the middle and twist.,
Twist the water bottle about 4 to 6 times.,
Untwist the cap with your thumb.,
Watch the water vapor.,
Untwist the bottle.,
Refill the bottle with air.,
Recap the bottle and twist.,
Launch the cap across the room.",How to Make a Water Bottle Cap Pop off with Air Pressure," This experiment works best with a water bottle that has relatively thin plastic. You need to be able to twist the bottle, so bottles made of thicker plastic will be difficult to use. You also want to use a standard size (16.9 oz or 500 mL) or larger, not the miniature ones.


You want the bottle to be mostly empty: if you leave a small amount of water in the bottom of the bottle, you will see a cloud of water vapor form at the end.Bottles with smaller lids also tend to work better.;
, While this step isn’t entirely necessary, it can make it easier to twist the bottle for the experiment.


Recycle the label when you’re done with the experiment.

, In order to build up the air pressure inside the bottle, you need to decrease the amount of space available by crushing the bottle. Start by squeezing the middle of the bottle and twist the bottom.Starting the twist can be difficult. In some cases it can be easier if the bottle starts out slightly deflated. Remove the cap, squeeze the bottle a bit and replace the cap while keeping the bottle slightly squished.
Make sure the cap is tightly screwed on to the top of the bottle before beginning this step.

, As you twist the bottle, you will notice it will become more difficult. Twist the bottle as many times as you can until you can’t twist it anymore. If you are not strong enough to do it, ask an adult for assistance.Keep the bottle pointed away from your face and others while you are twisting the bottle. While it is unlikely for the bottle to pop during this step, it is possible.

, Grasp the water bottle tightly against your stomach with the cap facing away from you. Use the side of your thumb to quickly twist the cap off. Make sure you fully twist the cap off, or the cap won't pop out. If done successfully, the cap should fly across the room.Another way to pop the cap off is to hold the bottle between your legs and then twist it with your hand.
If the cap does not fly across the room, there wasn’t enough air pressure built up inside the bottle. Untwist the bottle, blow into it to refill with air, and try again., When the cap flies off you may notice that a cloud of white vapor is coming out of the bottle as well. This is water vapor that is formed when the cap gets released. As the pressure builds inside the bottle, the water molecules get squeezed together. When the cap goes off, the temperature inside the bottle cools causing the water molecules to condense into vapor.This is also how clouds form in the sky. At cooler temperatures, the water vapor forms around dust particles to condense., Once you have launched your cap, you can do it over and over again until you get bored. Untwist the bottle until it is back to its original shape. The bottle will be a little bit crunched but it will still work.If the plastic cracks at any point in the bottle, it will no longer work for this experiment.

, Place your mouth around the top of the bottle and blow into it until the bottle puffs up again. You will hear a crackling sound as the plastic inflates. It does not need to be completely full, it just needs to have enough air inside it to compress.Don’t share bottles with multiple people to avoid the spread of germs.

, Replace the lid on the bottle and squeeze in the middle as you did before. Repeating the same steps, twist the bottle until you can’t twist it anymore. Remember, the more twists you can get, the more pressure that will build up inside the bottle.The bottle should begin to twist more easily the more times you use it.
At some point, the plastic will likely crack and you will not be able to use that bottle anymore.

, Position the bottle against your chest with the cap facing away from you and twist it off. Watch it shoot across the room again as the air pressure gets released. Repeat as many times as you’d like or until the bottle cracks.Remember, never aim the bottle towards a person or an animal.
Avoid pointing the bottle at your face as well.

, Put a little warm, soapy water in the container, put the cap on, and shake it for a few seconds. Then rinse the container out.

, Use scissors or a sharp knife to remove the bottom of the container about an inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom. You may also want to cut the top off just below the bottle's neck - you'll have a bigger hole to look through if you do. If the container has a handle, make sure to leave the handle on the container intact, so that you can use it to hold your Waterscope.

, Make sure the piece of plastic is big enough to completely cover the bottom of the container, as you want it to seal the bottom and to stretch almost all the way up the sides of the container. Pull the plastic tight, and make sure there are no wrinkles or folds in the viewing area (the base of the container).

, Use duct tape to attach the plastic wrap to the sides of the container. Place the tape to be fairly high on the container, because you'll be dipping the bottom into the water. You may also find that a rubber band or two, stretched over the plastic wrap around the whole container, will hold the wrap in place.

, Wade into a lake or creek, and dip the bottom of the container into the water while holding the container straight upright. Look through the hole at the top. As long as no water enters the container, you should be able to clearly see underwater.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Prepare the elodea plants.,
Make the sodium bicarbonate solution.,
Place the elodea sprigs in the bottom of the container with the funnel inverted over them.,
Fill both test tubes with water.,
Invert the test tubes and place over the stems of each funnel.,
Store one jar in direct light and one jar in darkness.,
Check on the experiment after 24 hours.,
Lift the test tube from the funnel of the “light” experiment.,
Burn the oxygen.,
Repeat this with the control elodea that was kept in the dark.",How to Show Oxygen Is a By Product of Photosynthesis," To prove that oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis, you can set up an experiment with an aquatic plant and capture the gas it emits in response to photosynthesis. You will also setup a control condition where the plant will not be exposed to light, preventing photosynthesis. To perform this experiment you will need the following items:8 sprigs of an elodea plant, an aquatic plant available at your local pet or garden store
2 large, clear containers
Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), no more than 1 tablespoon
2 large funnels (must be small enough to fit inside the large container)
2 test tubes (must fit over the end of the funnel)
a light source: sunlight or at least a 40 watt bulb
dechlorinated tap water (chlorine in the water will kill the plant), enough to fill both containers about ¾ full
Gloves;
, For each sprig, remove several leaves at the base of the stem and cut the end at an angle. Gently crush the end of the stem with your fingers.You will use four sprigs for each experimental setup.

, Fill the large container about ¾ full of room temperature dechlorinated water and add a few spoonfuls of the baking soda. Stir the solution until it is fully dissolved. This bicarbonate solution will provide the elodea with the carbon dioxide it needs to use photosynthesis.Add the same amount of baking soda and water to both of the large containers.

, Add four sprigs to the bottom of each container. Invert the funnel and place in the container so that it covers all of the sprigs of elodea and the end of the funnel points towards the top.


Make sure there is enough water so that the end of the funnel is still submerged. Add more room temperature water, if necessary., Either submerge the test tube in water until there are no bubbles left in the tube or simply fill the tube all the way to the top. It is crucial to the experiment that there is no air trapped anywhere in the test tube., Hold your thumb over the top of the test tube, gently turn the test tube over and lower the end into the water. Remove your thumb and check for any bubbles in the tube. If there are bubbles, tilt the tube until the bubbles escape to the surface. When all bubbles are gone, set the test tube over the stalk of the glass funnel.Ensure that the setup is stable and the test tube sits snugly on top of the funnel.
At this stage there should be no air bubbles anywhere in either of the test tubes. If there is air, remove the test tube, refill with water, and try again.

, For the jar in direct light, place it near a window or next to a lamp. For the jar in darkness, store it in a dark room or closet with no windows. Leave a note on the door that says “Do Not Open” so your family will know an experiment is in progress.


The jar stored in the darkness is the “control” for photosynthesis. Since we are trying to prove that photosynthesis produces the oxygen, we want to make sure that no oxygen is produced in the absence of light.
Leave both jars alone for at least 8, but up to 24 hrs.After just a few hours, you should start to see air bubbles appear in the test tube of the elodea in the light.

, Take the jar that has been sitting in the sun at the end of the day. You should see an air bubble at the top of the test tube. For the experiment that was in darkness, there should be no air bubbles at the top of the test tube.If you don’t see air in the setup that was stored in light, try the experiment again with some fresher elodea sprigs.
If you see air in the setup that was stored in darkness, you may have accidentally let in air while you were setting up the experiment. Try it again, making sure there is no air when you place it in the dark.

, Put gloves on to avoid contaminating your test tube. Keeping the test tube upside down and submerged in the water, remove it from the funnel. Place your thumb over the end of the tube and take it completely out of the water.


Be careful not to tilt the tube at all because the oxygen bubble at the top will escape and you will have to start the experiment again.

, Light a match, but blow out the flame quickly so it is still glowing. You might need a second pair of hands for this step: someone to light the match and someone to hold the test tube. Invert the tube so it is now upright and the trapped gas is at the top of the tube. Remove your finger and place the glowing match into the gas of the test tube.


Parental supervision is recommended when lighting matches.
Don’t let the match touch the water, only the gas.
You should see the match reignite, bursting into flame. Because oxygen is highly flammable, when the smoldering match comes into contact with it, it bursts back into flame.

, Again, remove the test tube from the funnel and place your thumb over the top. Although you can’t see any air at this point, you want to perform all the steps the same way you did previously. Remove the test tube from the container, light the match, and remove your thumb. Place the match into the top of the test tube and observe the results.


Because there is no gas in the tube, the match will touch the water and be quenched. This part of the experiment proves that the oxygen in the “light” condition was produced by photosynthesis.

, This is optional but it makes it easier to see the demonstration and tornado.,, The breeze should be blowing up. ,,,, The fan air forces out of the chamber. The air from outside the box is forced in through the slits on the sides, which creates a vortex or spiral of air because the air is taken out of the box. Real tornadoes form in a similar way by using and creating updrafts and wind-shear, when wind is from different directions. "

Clean up.",How to Understand Osmosis with Eggs," Before you begin this experiment, individually weigh each raw egg on a kitchen scale. To keep the eggs from sliding off of the scale, you may wish to place the eggs in a small bowl as you weigh them. Be sure to measure the weight of the bowl beforehand. When you weigh the egg in the bowl, subtract the weight of the bowl from the total. You will be left with the weight of your egg. This number will be important as you compare other data that you will collect throughout the project.;
, Carefully pour the vinegar into a cup. Do not fill it to the brim—you do not want it to overflow when the eggs are placed in the cup. The vinegar is key to dissolving the eggs’ shells. The acid in the vinegar reacts with the calcium in the shells., Gently lower the eggs into the cup of vinegar using your hand or a spoon. The eggs should be submerged, but it is all right if they float as long as there is enough vinegar to cover the surface of the eggs.Place the cup in a safe place where it will not get knocked over.

, The eggs should soak in the vinegar for at least 24 hours. Once the shells dissolve, the eggs will be naked, encased only by the thin membrane.


Keep the eggs out of direct sunlight and be sure that the temperature is stable.
Carbon dioxide bubbles will cover the eggs as the vinegar dissolves the shells.Beneath an egg’s shell lies the egg membrane, which is a layer that is made up of proteins that help protect the egg’s center from bacteria., After 24 hours, the egg shell should be completely dissolved. Gently and slowly pour the vinegar into the sink, letting it strain through your fingers. This will ensure that you can catch the eggs in your hand. Rinse the eggs under slow, running water to remove any film on the outside of the egg.


If you use a spoon to remove the eggs, you may risk breaking or damaging the eggs., Using a digital kitchen scale, weigh each egg individually. To keep the egg from sliding off of the flat surface, place the egg in the same small bowl you used to weigh the eggs before the experiment. Subtract the weight of the bowl from the total. Record the weight of each egg in a notebook or on your computer.

, With the egg shell gone, the egg’s membrane allowed some of the vinegar and the water from the vinegar to pass into the egg. This movement of water through a semi-permeable layer is the osmosis process. The eggs should be noticeably larger than when you started the experiment.

, Fill a clean cup with enough water to submerge only one of the naked eggs. Place the cup in a safe place where it will not be disturbed.

, The egg should remain in the water for 24 hours. The water molecules will move into the egg in time. That is because the egg has less water concentration that the water itself., Pour the water from the cup into the sink, again using your hands to gently catch the egg as it pours out with the water. Being careful not the break the egg, clean the egg’s surface under running water.

, Use your scale to measure the naked egg again. Notice that the egg has expanded its size and weighs more than it did at the beginning of the experiment. The process of osmosis worked to equalize the amount of water inside and outside the egg.

, Gently lower the other naked egg into the corn syrup. The egg will try to float to the top. Gently place a spoon on the top of the egg to keep it submerged for at least 24 hours. The spoon can left there to keep the egg submerged.Corn syrup has a high density due to its high concentration of sugar molecules, and it is denser than both water and vinegar. This disparity in density will demonstrate how osmosis can have a different effect on the appearance of the egg.

, Slowly pour the syrup into the kitchen sink and gently allow the egg to land on the palm of your hand. Gently rinse the egg under running water to remove any corn syrup on its surface.

, Weigh the shrunken egg and record the data. The sugar molecules in the syrup were too big to pass through the egg’s membrane, but the water molecules within the egg were able to pass outside the egg with ease. The water continued to move outside of the egg until the density of the corn syrup and the density of the egg were equal, which caused the egg to shrink! This is another great example of osmosis that created a different result., During an experiment, it may be easy to forget what solution your egg has been placed in. To avoid any potential errors or miscommunications, label each container before placing the egg inside. This way you can double-check and make sure you placed the egg in the correct solution.

, Recording your data is an important part in any science experiment. Using detailed descriptions and measurements allows you to study the changes that the egg undergoes during an osmosis experiment. Be sure to keep track of the weight of the eggs during each step of the experiment.


Record the egg’s circumference. You may wish to observe how the circumference of the eggs changed throughout the experiment as well. Use a flexible tape measure to measure the widest part of the egg. Record this data and gently measure the egg in the same place after each section of the experiment.Measure the amount of liquid used. Keep track of how much water, vinegar, and corn syrup you placed in each cup. When the egg has been removed, pour the remaining liquid into a beaker or a measuring cup. Record the amount of liquid lost or gained during the experiment.

, After you have collected all of your data, review it and make note of any interesting, extreme, or unexpected changes. Ask yourself why these changes may have occurred, and note if there is any outside variable that may have interfered or influenced the data in some way.Was the temperature outside particularly hot that day? Did you accidentally spill some of the vinegar when retrieving your egg? Make note of anything that could have altered the data.

, After reviewing your data, summarize what the data has demonstrated. Did the size and weight of the egg prove that the water molecules were released in the corn syrup? Did the egg’s expansion in the water show that osmosis occurred through the egg’s membrane? Ask yourself what the information is telling you, and use your data to support your conclusion.

, Be sure to thoroughly wash your cups and wipe down the counters, your tape measure, your kitchen scale, and the small bowl after completing your experiment. The eggs can be discarded in the trash.

Learn about biodiversity.,
Learn about genes.,
Learn about species.,
Learn about ecosystems.,
Write your own report on biodiversity.",How to Understand the Concept of Biodiversity," Biodiversity is a shorthand way of saying biological diversity. Biodiversity includes all of the various forms of life on Earth. You might also know it as ""the web of life"". This web of life is divided into three parts to help simplify a very complex concept:


Genes
Species
Ecosystem;
, Genes are special codes or instructions that are found in all cells. The codes give organisms different characteristics; this is what determines the way that we look and behave. For example, it is genes that determine whether we have blue or brown eyes, big or small feet or the ability to sing or not etc. Genetic diversity is a key part of biodiversity that makes people, animals and plants unique.

, A species is a group of organisms that can reproduce. Every day we see different species as we go about our daily lives, including humans, dogs, cats, birds and worms, making species diversity the most obvious type of biodiversity. Our planet, Earth, supports millions of species, many of which we are yet to identify!


Within a species, there is genetic diversity, as discussed in the step before. This means that groups of organisms that share a common ancestor and have the same characteristics are identified as a breed for animals and as a variety for plants.

, At its most basic, an ecosystem is the nature in which all species live. Ecology is the study of species in their natural environment. You are probably aware already that there are many types of ecosystems on Earth. Some of them are more familiar than others but all are equally important in terms of biodiversity. Here are some types of ecosystem:


Mountain
Peatlands
Desert
Forest
Marine
Snow

, For a class project, it can be both fun and educational to produce a small report, booklet or mini-essay about biodiversity to help increase your class' awareness of what biodiversity is. Suggestions for a report or project include:


A photo essay of the different types of ecosystems and species
A booklet on what biodiversity is with illustrations drawn by class members
A mini-essay detailing what you think biodiversity means to you and include pictures
Make models of biodiversity elements from paper, plasticine, pipe cleaners etc. Create an ecosystem; divide into class groups and choose an ecosystem each and hold a show to display each one. Have each group describe the important aspects of their chosen ecosystem.
Hold a show-and-tell event in class; have all the class bring photos/magazine cut-outs or perhaps toy animals, pieces of plant life from the garden and family photos etc., to describe the basic elements of biodiversity.

Enjoy presenting the project.",How to Win First Place in Your School Science Fair," After you’ve learned about the science fair, you should schedule a time, possibly with your parent or guardian, to briefly discuss it with your teacher or the project coordinator. This way, you’ll form a clearer understanding of the rules and parameters of the project.;
, Make sure you have your own copy of the science fair project rules and then review them in detail. This is extremely important, as you want to be sure about rules and other requirements of the project. Properly reviewing the rules will make sure that there are no surprises down the road.


Get a highlighter and go through the rules, highlighting key rules and requirements.
Review the schedule of the project, along with preliminary due dates and final due dates.
Make sure to take a look at the next level of competition if you win your school or district’s competition., Sometimes you might have several months to work on the project, and other times you might have several weeks. Once you’ve committed to competing in the project, look at the schedule and form an understanding of the important bench marks you’ll have to meet to create a winning project. After all, you certainly have other obligations to meet at the same time, and you won’t be able to commit all of your energies to the project., If this is allowed, it can be a great way to cover more ground and share ideas together. One word of warning: choose wisely! Don't pair up with a person you know you won't work well, or just because that other person seems cool.


Choose a person you have worked with in your past and you know there is some sort of great connection with that person.
Avoid choosing a partner who isn't interested in science or who won't contribute equally, winning this science fair might be your passport to success, in college or your following year.
Work alone on your project if you do not work well with others, or if there are no suitable partners available.

, Perhaps the most important element of winning a science fair is working on a project that you are excited and enthusiastic about. Being enthusiastic about your project will motivate you to go that extra mile. But if you’re not excited about the project, you probably won’t take the extra steps to do everything it takes to create the best project. To try to figure out what interests you, consider the following:


Do you like to build things? Think about something mechanical.
Are you interested in biology or agriculture? Consider a study of plant or animal life.
Does the weather fascinate you? Consider a meteorology project.
Brainstorm with your partner on this, if you have one.

, There are many lists of really good potential projects available on the internet. Many of them have been done by other people, but yours could be different. Browse these lists to see if your interests line up with potential projects., If lists of projects don’t work out, start a search on your own. Using the subjects you find interesting, begin a search online, read books at your local library, or ask your teachers for certain topics that you may not know about, and might interest you.


Begin with topics of interest to you personally and find scientific angles that arise from this interest.
Ask yourself if the idea is doable before going too far with it.
Don’t be afraid to spend time on research. You might have to spend a couple days or a week or even two at the library after school reading up on general topics in order to come up with an idea., Originality is often an important criteria for award winning projects. How original is your idea? The more original you are, and the more that you try to do an experiment in a different way from how it has been tried before, the better it will be received by the judges., Once you’ve narrowed your potential projects down to a few, you need to examine whether they are good ideas, and whether they are doable or not. If you’ve got a brilliant idea, but you won’t have the resources or time to do it, then that idea is best shelved for another time. If you’ve got an easy idea, but it’s not original and will clearly be a loser, don’t waste time on it.


Discuss your favorite ideas with your science teacher to see if they think your potential projects might be good.
Rank your ideas, and begin vetting the ones you are most interested in.
Narrow your list down to the top 5.
Make individual outlines for your top ideas. Make sure to briefly explore what your project will entail and how long it will take. Don’t spend more than a couple hours making your outlines for each idea. You might need to spend an hour or two on each idea. That’s okay.
Put together preliminary budgets for each of your top 5. You might find that some projects are much more expensive than others, and you might want to choose one or another as a result of monetary constraints., This may be determined by the project or it may be something you can do almost anywhere. Make sure to conduct the experiment or build your invention in the best, and most convenient, location possible.


Can you do it in class?
Can you perform your project at home?
Will you be required to travel to conduct your experiment or to complete your project?

, Now that you’ve got your project, and the basic information about it, you’ve got to create a timeline so you’ll be able to complete it before the due date. The timeline will really depend on how much time you have in your individual circumstances. But consider certain factors:


If your project is time dependent, like growing a cucumber plant, you’ll need to build in the 60-80 days that some varieties of cucumbers need to mature.
If you’ve got to order supplies, build this in as well.
Make sure to reserve time for compiling data, writing your reports, and designing your visual presentation after the experiment has concluded., Chances are, you don’t have an unlimited amount of money for your project. Find out how much you have, and then go through the list of resources you’ll need to acquire in order to create the project. This is something you might have considered earlier, but now you’ll have to make a much more specific budget. List every little thing you might need, as expenses mount quickly., Working out your equipment and resources should have been something you explored in the vetting process. Now you just need to secure that equipment and other resources, so that you have all of the items and needs sorted ahead of performing the experiment. If something is missing, the experiment might fail for lack of whatever it is rather than for other reasons.


Is the equipment available in your school? Go ahead and secure permission to use it.
Are you borrowing items from someone else? Talk to them and provide specifics on when you will need equipment or whatever else it is you are borrowing.
Do you need to order special supplies online? Now is the time to go ahead and order those supplies.

, This may be as simple as wearing old clothes or working over a sink. Or, it might mean that you need safety goggles, head protection or some sort of safe room or box, etc. Know what is needed before starting and be sure you can meet the safety requirements totally., For almost all science fair projects, you’ll need to start with a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an educated guess about how your project/experiment will work out. It is essentially your guess about what the results of the project will be. The results of your experiment will either support or contradict your hypothesis.


The hypothesis needs to be something that you can and will test.
You need to form a hypothesis before you begin the experiment or project.
You should form your hypothesis after you’ve done a good job researching and sorting out your logistics.
An example of a hypothesis is: “If I don’t water a fern for 10 days, the fern will die.”, Begin your project and start the experiment. Put time and care into whatever project you’ve chosen. This might be a long and tedious process, but it could just pay off with a blue ribbon!


If you’re germinating seeds, make sure you do it correctly.
If you’re building some sort of device or contraption, make sure you don’t do it in a rush.
If you’re doing something that requires it, include a control element to test the outcomes against.

, Along the way, document every part of the process and experiment. All of this documentation will help you when it comes time to compiling your data and creating your reports. It is best to over-document instead of under-document, as you never know what information might be useful when you’re creating your report and arriving upon conclusions.


Take photos if possible.
Keep dated and timed records.
Keep a journal of everything you do, everything you observe, and what works and doesn’t work. If you’re testing a new model airplane and something small failed, document that in your journal.
Consider a video diary of your experiment. This way is a great way to capture small details without spending lots of time writing them down., Once you’ve completed your experiment, you need to look at the data and decide whether or not your hypothesis was correct. Don’t be afraid to be wrong. Let the data speak for itself. After all, you’re the one that performed the experiment, and if you did so diligently, than that is either really good evidence for or against your hypothesis., After you’ve resolved your hypothesis and reviewed the data, you need to come to a larger conclusion about the project. What does your data really say about what you were testing or creating? Be brave when it comes to this. If you’ve got data or an invention of some sort that contradicts what others have previously said, don’t hide it. After all, you’ve documented your process and you’ve have either photos or a final product to prove your results.


When forming your conclusion do so in a clear and concise way. Make sure you can easily articulate your conclusion.
Don't guess or jump to conclusions that are not supported by facts, data, and observation.
Don't let your hypothesis or over expectations cloud your conclusion. Let the data speak for itself., Using the data you’ve documented and collected, prepare graphs, tables, or other ways of displaying your information. Print out or develop your photographs. Edit your videos. These elements highlight your data and process. They make it easier for people to read your paper/poster/outline, etc. and makes the end result more interesting.If you choose to make a video, make sure that it is easy to hear, logical in sequence and shows clearly what has been done. Back up a video with a printed overview, as a paper copy of the things said in the video will help the judges and can be read by anyone interested.
Make sure graphs are labeled clearly and are large enough to be viewed from at least five feet away.
Make sure you include at least short one sentence explanations of any data you include through graphs or images.
If you’ve got some sort of invention, make sure you clean it (of grease, oils, saw dusts, whatever) and prepare it to be displayed to others.

, Using all of your data, you should now create a written report of your project. The length of the written report might vary, depending on specific contest rules. It may range from 3 to 20 pages. It may also depend on your project, the importance and number of images and graphs you include, and more. Consider including:


A brief overview of the project, that explains your project in clear and concise terms, and explains why you were interested in it in the first place.
Your preliminary research.
Your hypothesis.
The process of your experiment.
Your findings.
Your conclusions. Also make sure to make a comment about the relevance or practical usage of your findings in everyday life., Perhaps the most important part of your project, after the experiment itself, is preparing a visual display of your project. This display will often include graphs and images that you’ve already created. It will often be on a large cardboard or poster board display. You’ll include much of the same information you included in your written report, but it will be condensed considerably so people can view the project quickly and get a good idea of your process and findings. Consider including:


Your hypothesis being tested.
An explanation of how the experiment was carried out.
An outline of your findings.
General and specific observations of what happened during the experiment
Graphs, charts, and images that are particularly helpful for individuals seeing your project for the first time.
Anything unusual or interesting that you spotted.
The conclusions you've reached, detailed and explained clearly., Your oral presentation is going to be extremely important when it comes to communicating your findings to judges and others who will be viewing your project. Make sure your oral presentation highlights and explains all of the material on your visual presentation.


Talk judges and over observers through the material on your poster board.
Make sure your oral presentation is between 3 and 5 minutes long.
Practice this presentation to family and friends ahead of delivering it in front of a class or in front of judges.
Speak clearly and slowly when delivering your oral presentation., Make an answer sheet with FAQs (frequently asked questions) that you think students, teachers and judges might ask. This will help you to identify important things to focus on in your presentation and it will help calm any nerves you might have about being asked questions., You've put in a lot of effort and helped continue humanity's quest for knowing more about the world and universe in which we live. Through sharing your ideas with others, you're helping to keep the scientific tradition going. Make sure to be enthusiastic and to think about your project as something important.

"
Gather the necessary materials.,
Remove the string and staple from the teabag.,
Stand the teabag upright on a foil tray.,
Light the top of the teabag on fire.,
Watch it burn.,
Measure how high the teabag flies.,
Use different sized teabags.,
Test conditions with wet teabags.,
Work with your parents.,
Use caution with the flame.,
Perform the experiment in an open space or outdoors.",How to Make a Teabag Hot Air Balloon," To make a teabag hot air balloon you will need a teabag, a pair of scissors, a lighter, a small piece of foil, markers, and parental supervision. A teabag with string attached that can stand on its own will work best for this experiment.This experiment involves fire so parental supervision is necessary.
The teabag must be unused and dry.;
, Once the staple is removed, you can unfold the top of the bag and pour out the contents of the teabag.Pour into a cup so you can make the tea later or simply dispose of the loose tea.


At this point, you can decorate the teabag as a ghost by drawing a little face on it with a marker. You could also make it look like a rocket ship., After emptying the contents, unfold the bag so that it can stand on its own. Shape the teabag into a cylinder shape until it can stand upright. Stand the teabag on top of the small piece of foil.Alternatively, a baking pan or ceramic plate can be used as a base for the teabag.

, Parental supervision is recommended for this step. Using a match or the lighter, light the top of the teabag on fire.This will initiate the teabag hot air balloon.


At the end of the experiment the teabag will get burned up so you will need multiple teabags if you want to perform multiple tests.

, As the flame consumes the teabag, it burns to the bottom of it. Once it reaches the bottom, the teabag will become airborne and you have your very own hot air balloon. It will rise and then quickly fall. As it falls, it will be cool enough for you to catch and dispose of.The teabag rises because the flame heats up the air inside the bag. As molecules heat up, they spread out and the air inside the bag becomes less dense than the air outside the bag. The difference in densities causes the bag to rise., Once the teabag lifts off, try to catch it at its highest point before it starts falling back down. Hold your hand at this point and have a friend measure the distance between your hand and the table.Record the results of each teabag’s flight and then try testing different conditions with the teabags. Record the height for each test and compare the results.

, Try cutting the teabags smaller or using jumbo sized teabags. When you light it, what happens? Does the size of the bag affect the teabag's ability to fly? Does a bigger bag fly higher?Try cutting the teabag in half and then in thirds. Which size flies the highest?

, After setting up the teabag, dab a little bit of water onto it. After lighting it on fire, observe the results. Does the teabag still catch fire? Does it burn as quickly? Does it still fly?


Use varying amounts of water and see how it affects the flight of the teabag. Is it different if there is a little bit of water versus a completely soaked teabag?

, Because you will be using fire, it is best to have parental supervision. They will help keep you safe and make sure nothing goes wrong with the experiment., Working with an open flame always has the potential to be dangerous. Always have a fire blanket or extinguisher on hand in case something goes wrong.This is a simple experiment and should work fine, but you should be careful all the same.

, When working with fire, the safest place to be is in an outdoor space. Doing this outside may be difficult if it is a particularly windy day, so if you must be indoors, make sure there is plenty of space between your workbench and the ceiling.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Collect rain in a clean container.,
Dip the pH paper into the collected rain.,
Compare the color paper to the pH chart.",How to Test the Acidity of Your Rain1," For this experiment, you will need to collect some rain water and get some strips of pH paper. pH paper is a special type of paper that changes color based on how acidic or basic a solution is. The paper comes with a separate color chart that allows you to identify the pH according to the color.pH paper can be purchased at gardening or pool stores.;
, To test the acidity of your rain water, you want to obtain a sample that is free from contaminants. Place a clean jar or bucket outside while it is raining. Make sure the bucket is at least two meters (six-and-a-half feet) above the ground to prevent contamination from dirt and dust.Place the bucket on a table or hang it above the ground.
Contaminants can alter the pH of the collected rain.

, Take a single strip of pH paper from the stack and dip it into the rainwater for about two seconds. The color should change immediately and then you should proceed to the next step.If you let the strip sit for too long without looking at the chart, the color might change.
Try the test at least three times and see if they all come out the same color. If the strips do not come out the same color, the strips may be expired and you’ll need to buy new, fresh strips.

, As soon as the color changes on the strip, compare it to the associated chart. Find the color that is the closest match to what you see on the strip. The pH written next to that color is the pH of the collected rain water.The color comparison must happen immediately because the color will fade with time.
Normal rainwater is slightly acidic with a pH between 5.0 and 5.5. Acid rain usually has a pH of around 4.0 but anything in the range of 4.2-4.4 is considered acidic."
"
Gather the necessary materials.,
Chop up some cabbage.,
Boil the cabbage.,
Strain out the cabbage and save the water.,
Test the indicator.,
Test the acidity of your rain.",How to Test the Acidity of Your Rain2," To make your own pH indicator, you will need half a head of red cabbage, a knife, water, a stove, and a medium saucepan. Red cabbage contains a chemical called anthocyanin that changes color based on acidity. By boiling the cabbage, you can make a pH indicator from this chemical and test the acidity of your rain.Adult supervision is recommended for this because you will need to handle a hot stove and a sharp knife.

, You want about 2-3 cups of red cabbage cut into small pieces. If you are young, have an adult help you with this step to avoid potential injury. The exact amount of cabbage is not important, so just cut up half of the head of cabbage., Place the chopped cabbage into the saucepan and add enough water to cover the cabbage. Put the saucepan on the stove and bring the water to a full boil. Once the solution boils, turn the heat off and let the water cool to room temperature.Have a parent help with this step to avoid injury when using the stove and working with boiling water.
You should notice that the water is now purple.

, Pour the cabbage and water mixture through a strainer into a bowl. The purple water (the indicator) is currently neutral because the water from your tap is neutral. In the presence of an acid, the indicator turns pink. In the presence of a base, the indicator turns blue.You can refrigerate the solution until you need it.

, To make sure the indicator is working properly, you can test it using baking soda and vinegar. Put 1 teaspoon (~5 mL) of the cabbage water into two small, clear glasses. Add a teaspoon of vinegar to one glass and a teaspoon of baking soda to the other.Vinegar is acidic, so the water will turn pink.
Baking soda is basic, so the water will turn blue.

, Collect some rainwater in a clean, plastic container. Pour 1 teaspoon of cabbage water into a small, clean glass. Add a teaspoon (~5 mL) of the collected rainwater to the cabbage water. The water should turn pink because all rain is slightly acidic. The deeper the pink, the higher the acidity in your area.This method will not tell you the exact pH of the rain, but will give you an idea of how acidic it is. You can compare rain from different areas and see if the deepness of the pink changes.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Collect some rainwater.,
Calibrate the pH meter.,
Measure the acidity of rainwater.",How to Test the Acidity of Your Rain3," Another method to measure the acidity of a solution is to use a pH meter. This is a specialized piece of laboratory equipment that is expensive and you may not have access to one. If you do have one available, you can use it to determine the exact pH of a solution.For this experiment, you will need:


Rainwater
A pH meter
Calibration buffers (one with pH 7.0 and one with pH 2.0)

, During a rainstorm, place a clean container outside at a height of at least two meters (six-and-a-half feet). Placing the bucket up high prevents dust and dirt from getting into the rainwater. These contaminants can affect the pH of the water.Collect at least one cup (250 mL) of rainwater for measurement.

, Before using a pH meter, it must be calibrated so that it gives you the correct reading of your sample. Each meter is different but the general calibration process is the same. First, rinse the electrode of the meter with water and then place it into a buffer with a known pH of 7.0. Set the readout display to 7.0 so the meter knows that this is what a neutral pH is.Repeat this process with another buffer that is acidic (around pH 2.0).
Some meters may also require that you calibrate with a buffer that is also basic (around pH 10.0).
Always rinse the electrode between solutions.

, Rinse the electrode with distilled water before use. After calibration, you can place the electrode in the rainwater. Once the reading has stabilized on the meter, the display is the pH of the rain.Remember, normal rain has a pH between 5.0 and 5.5. Acid rain is usually in the range of 4.0-4.4."

Collect a CO2 sample.,
Mix calcium carbonate with Hydrochloric acid (HCl).,
Cover the test tube with a bung.",How to Test for CO21," To begin your test, you will need a sealed test tube filled with collected gas. You can collect carbon dioxide in a gas jar, a boiling tube, or another airtight container. Collection is usually performed over water in a beaker. CO2 gas is denser than air, so you can collect it using ""downward delivery"" or a gas syringe.;
, The simplest way to collect carbon dioxide is to react calcium carbonate (or limestone chips) with Hydrochloric acid. First, pour 20ml of HCl into a conical flask. Add a spoonful of calcium carbonate (or limestone chips) to the HCL. When the reaction starts, cover the conical flask with a bung and delivery tube: you will collect the gas through the delivery tube and into an upturned test tube (which is immersed in bowl of water). If the water in the test tube is displaced, then gas is being collected.You can continue to collect the gas for as long as the reaction occurs.
For classroom demonstrations, you only need a small amount of Hydrochloric acid, which is diluted to 1M; a 2M concentration works best, but should be used with extra care. The equation is: CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) ==> CaCl2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g).
Be very careful when working with Hydrochloric acid – wear gloves, a lab coat, and protective goggles, and do not let the acid touch your skin! It's best to only perform this reaction if you have access to a lab environment., Put the tube on a rack to keep it safe until you perform the test. The ""bung"" is essentially a small cork or cap that allows you to pipe the contents of the test tube elsewhere through a connected delivery tube. It's important to seal the CO2 gas into the container. If you leave it open, the gas will mix with the air, and your test will be much less effective.

Bubble the gas through limewater.,
Make a limewater solution.,
Bubble the gas through the limewater.,
Look for cloudy water.,
Know the chemical reaction.",How to Test for CO22," The most effective way to test for CO2 is to bubble the gas through ""lime water"", a diluted solution of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime). When you bubble carbon dioxide through the solution, it forms a solid precipitate of calcium carbonate – chalk or limestone. Calcium carbonate is insoluble in water.Thus, if there is CO2 present in the sample, the limewater will turn milky, cloudy white., The process is simple: dilute calcium hydroxide with water. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) is a colorless white powder that you can buy from most chemistry suppliers. Pure limewater, once mixed, is clear and colorless, with a slight earthy smell and the bitter, alkaline taste of calcium hydroxide. Follow these steps to make your own limewater:


Put 1 teaspoon of calcium hydroxide into a clean one-gallon (or smaller) glass jar. Limewater is a saturated solution, which means there will be some extra chemical that doesn't dissolve. A teaspoon will result in a fully saturated solution, whether you use a gallon jar or a smaller container.Fill the jar with distilled water or tap water. Distilled water will always give you a purer solution, but the minerals present in tap water should not hinder your test.
Put a lid on the jar. Shake the solution vigorously for 1-2 minutes, then let it stand for 24 hours.
Pour the clearer solution off the top of the jar through a clean coffee filter or filter paper. Be very careful not to stir up the sediment. If necessary, repeat this filtering step until you obtain a clear limewater solution. Store in a clean jar or bottle.

, Half-fill a test tube with limewater – then boil it. Use a delivery tube to pipe the contents of the CO2 sample test tube directly into the boiling limewater. You can use a flexible pipe or a (metal) straw as a delivery tube, if nothing better is around. Let the captured gas ""bubble"" through the liquid, and wait for the reaction to take place.


If you don't want to boil anything, you can use a gas syringe to discharge the CO2 gas directly into the half-filled limewater test tube. Stopper the test tube, then shake vigorously for 1-2 minutes. If there is carbon dioxide in the sample, then the solution should grow cloudy., If CO2 is present, the lime water will turn milky white with calcium carbonate particulates. If the limewater is boiling, and the gas is piped directly into the limewater, then the reaction should begin immediately. If nothing happens after a minute or so, you can safely assume that there is no carbon dioxide in your sample., Understand what exactly is taking place to indicate the presence of CO2. The equation for the test is: Ca(OH)2 (aq) + CO2 (g) -> CaCO3 (s) + H2O (l). In non-chemistry language: liquid limewater + gas (which contains CO2) react to solid lime (the particles) and liquid water."
"
Try using the sample to extinguish fire.,
Collect the gas in an upside-down test tube.,
Place a small flame inside the test tube.,
Alternately, try using a gas syringe to put out a candle.",How to Test for CO23," Carbon dioxide extinguishes fires, in high concentrations. You'll simply need to hold a small lit flame inside a test tube that you suspect contains CO2. If the gas is present, the flame should go out immediately. Combustion (creation of a flame) is the reaction of oxygen with another substance; it is a rapid oxidation of the organic compound and a reduction of oxygen. The fire goes out because the oxygen is replaced by the CO2, which is not a combustible gas.


Bear in mind that any oxygen-free gas will also extinguish a flame in this manner. Thus, this is an unreliable test for carbon dioxide, and it may lead you to misidentify the gas., Make sure that the sample has been properly stored and stoppered before you try to test for CO2. Be reasonably certain that the test tube does not contain any flammable or explosive gases; in this case, the introduction of fire could be dangerous, or at least very frightening.

, Use a splint or any long, thin strip of wood. In a pinch, a match or a lighter will do – but the further your hands are from the opening of the test tube, the safer your experiment will be. If the flame immediately goes out, there's likely a high concentration of CO2 in the test tube.

, Fill a syringe with carbon dioxide. Then, use a drop of molten wax to affix a short candle to the surface of a coin. Next, place the candle and coin into a wide-mouthed cup – and light the candle. Equip the syringe with the tubing, and push the syringe to transfer the CO2 to the bottom of the cup. If you push out the entire contents of the syringe within a second or two, the flame should go out.

Start by pulling back one ball.,
Release the ball.,
Watch as the energy and momentum transfer from the first ball to the last ball.,
Observe the cycle you have created.,
Tweak the experiment by pulling back two balls.,
Have fun experimenting.,
Show that energy must be conserved using the cradle.,
Observe that momentum is also conserved in the cradle.,
Think about why the last ball does not continue its upward path.,
Be aware that the cradle will stop.,
Bounce a bouncy ball.,
Play a game of pool.,
Use a pogo stick.",How to Use the Newton's Cradle," The further you pull back the ball, the more potential energy you will give it. This potential energy is created because you have moved the ball to a higher point, and now it has the potential to fall when released. When you release the ball, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy., This will allow the ball to fall, converting its potential energy to kinetic energy. The other important thing that happens is that ball gains momentum. This momentum, as well as the energy, cannot simply disappear when the ball reaches the bottom. It must be conserved., Ultimately, this is the entertaining part of the Newton’s Cradle. When the first ball reaches the bottom and strikes the second ball, it stops. The momentum and kinetic energy that the ball gained during its fall is transferred through the middle balls and passed along to the last ball, which swings out away from the other balls., Momentum and energy will continue to be passed from the ball on one side of the cradle to a ball on the other end. Gradually, the energy and momentum will be dissipated. This will be evident by the balls’ max height being a bit lower each time than the time before.Once the last ball swings up and away from the others, gravity will not allow it to simply stay there.It will reach a peak point that is nearly as high as the starting height of the first ball.
At this point, the ball will have converted all of its kinetic energy to potential energy. The fall back down converts the potential energy back into kinetic energy and momentum, then transfers these back through the middle balls into the first.
Now, the first ball swings up again and the cycle continues for a long time.

, Momentum is equal to the mass that is moving times the velocity (not speed) that it is moving. Since this momentum must be conserved, the two balls at the end will be pushed away from the center ball instead of just one. Other than two balls on each end moving, the cycle will continue just as if you had pulled back one ball., Try doing three or four balls and see what happens. You can also pull the ball(s) back more or less to tweak the amount of energy they start with. If you let it, this can entertain you for quite a while.


Hint: The number of balls you pull back will be the same number that swings out on the other end., The inability to create or destroy energy is a central theme of thermodynamics. This means that whatever energy you introduce to the system (by raising the first ball) must be conserved in the system. This means that the energy must continue to move through the system even after the first ball reaches the bottom and stops. You can see this happen when the last ball goes up to nearly the same height as the first.

, Not only is the energy of the system conserved, but the momentum is also conserved. This is why the same number of balls swings out on each side at the same speed. Momentum is nothing more than some mass times the velocity at which it is moving., It would seem, since momentum is conserved, that once the last ball is launched away from the others, it would continue traveling up and away. Theoretically, this would happen if it weren’t for gravity. Gravity acts upon the ball as it travels upward, slowing it. As this happens, kinetic energy is converted back to potential energy and momentum is reduced.Once the ball reaches its peak height, gravity flips roles and converts the potential energy into kinetic energy and momentum, but in the downward direction instead of the upward direction.

, In an ideal system the energy and momentum would be passed back and forth from one side of the cradle to the other in an endless game of tag. However, the real world is not what physics considers an “ideal” system. Friction is a force that slows the motion of the balls.In this case, the impeding force of friction comes from a combination of factors. There is a small amount of air resistance as the balls are traveling up and down. There will also be some energy and lost to heat when the balls collide with one another. Even the sound you hear is a vibration that slowly saps energy from the cradle., Bouncy balls are made of highly elastic materials which means, when they collide with a surface, they do not lose much energy. Instead, the collision deforms the ball (by making it compress and changing the kinetic energy to potential energy) and then the ball springs (or bounces) back into shape. The act of bouncing back into shape converts the newfound potential energy back into kinetic energy, except now the momentum is in the opposite direction.


This is much like how gravity converts the kinetic energy of balls in the cradle to potential energy, and how the balls pass along the kinetic energy and momentum through highly elastic collisions. When the ball is going up, gravity acts on it exactly the same way as the balls in the Newton’s Cradle.

, Pool balls, like the balls on the Newton’s Cradle, are hard and contact each other in a highly elastic way. Energy is put into the system by hitting the cue ball with the cue. That ball travels until it hits another ball and stops. The momentum from the cue ball is conserved by passing it along to the target ball, and in turn moving the target ball down the table.

, This is very interactive way to get a feel for these principles. The pogo stick operates the same way as a bouncy ball more or less. The biggest difference is that you are on the stick, so you can literally feel some of these forces at work!

Fill a container with a saline solution.,
Weigh a dry diaper of each brand or type.,
Place the diaper upside down for ten minutes in your saline solution.,
Hang the diaper for two minutes.,
Weigh the wet diapers.,
Calculate how much saline solution was absorbed.",How to Test the Absorbency of Different Brands of Diapers1," Disposable diapers use chemical compounds known as super absorbent polymers (SAPs) to soak up liquids. Due to the salt content in urine, they have a harder time soaking it up than water. You should use nine grams of table salt to each liter of water to simulate your baby’s urine and get accurate results., Knowing the dry weight of the diaper will make it easier to determine how much liquid the diaper absorbed. Use a scale to gain as accurate of a measurement as possible. Write your measurement down for later reference.Keep a journal or spreadsheet with the dry weights of all diapers. Include a column for wet weights, which will be measured later, and for the difference between dry weight and wet weight.


, You want to expose the absorbent core of the diaper as effectively as possible. Avoid the urge to press down or apply pressure to the diaper. Set a timer for ten minutes, and when the ten minutes is up remove the diaper from the saline solution.Use a timer to ensure that the diapers are all exposed to the liquid for the same amount of time. This eliminates the possibility of one diaper absorbing more just because of extra time to absorb liquid.


, Using clothes pins, hang the diaper from its corners. This will allow excess liquid that was not absorbed to drip off the diaper. If you do not have clothespins, you can just hold the diaper up with your hands for two minutes.Weighing diapers with excess liquid on them will make it look like the diaper absorbed more than it actually did.


, This will give you a final weight. The difference between the dry weight and the wet weight will tell you how much liquid you absorbed. Be sure that excess liquid was allowed to run off the diaper for the most accurate results., Set up an equation to determine the amount of liquid that was absorbed. Subtract the dry (initial weight) from the wet (final weight). Since the weight of the actual diaper materials does not change, the difference in these two weights is the weight of liquid absorbed.For example, if your dry weight was 100 g and your wet weight was 250 g, you would simply subtract. 250g−100g=150g{\displaystyle 250g-100g=150g}

Cut out different colored pieces of paper.,
Place the colors outside.,
Observe the number and type of insects that land on each color.,
Tailor the experiment to be more time efficient.",How to Test Insect Responses to Color1," Construction paper works well for this, as it is a little sturdier than normal paper. Choose your colors, for example red, black, blue, green, yellow, and orange. Cut them into any size or shape you desire, but make sure that each piece is the same size and shape as the others.You may also choose to fold the papers after cutting them. Depending on the type of experiment you are doing, you could make a tent or shelter from the paper.
Kids should only use scissors under appropriate adult supervision.;
, Put the colors in relatively the same area and against the same background. For example, avoid putting the red paper on a brown tree and the green paper in the green grass. Place your papers in a place that you know insects frequent, such as a flower garden., Once your colored paper is placed, step away and wait. Be patient and quiet until you start seeing insects land on the paper. Record the number and type of insect that is attracted to each different color and then compare the results.If you want to take your results a step further, you can enter the data you collected into a spreadsheet and generate graphs and charts.
The more bugs you observe, the more reliable your data will be. You should try to observe at least 20-30 bugs to start seeing reliable trends., You may wait for quite some time to see bugs on the paper cut outs if you simply place them outside. If you need to do a more controlled (or more time effective) experiment, fold the paper into tents and place them in a Petri dish. Introduce one bug at a time into the dish and record the color that they prefer. Do this at least 20-30 times to see reliable trends.This method would be prefered for science projects.

To compliment this, you could simultaneously study photosynthesis (the process by which plants make food). You can also investigate how different liquids affect plant growth., You will need a petri dish full of agar gel. You can buy these, or mix your own agar. Take a cotton swab and swab a surface that you want to test. Then, roll the swab on the surface of the agar. Cover the petri dish and let the bacteria grow in a dark place that is warm (98 °F (37 °C))., Animal and plant cells are large enough to study under a microscope. Allow the class to look through the microscope and analyze the differences between these two types of cells (e.g. plant cells have cell wall and animal cells do not). As they study the cells, have them draw each cell as they see it under the microscope."

Introduce density.,
Study gas production.,
Make a model volcano.",How to Think of Fourth Grade Science Project Ideas3," A quick and simple way to introduce young kids to density is to fill two glasses with water. In one glass, add a teaspoon of salt. Put an egg in both glasses, and the egg in the salt water will float while the egg in the plain water will sink.You can explain to your students that this happens because the salt water is more dense than the plain water.

, A simple experiment for fourth graders is to mix vinegar and baking soda. The reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, which can be captured in a balloon to show the experiment is working., You can use anything from paper mache to a coconut to serve as the mountain. The real fun is in making lava erupt from the top of the volcano. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda to 1/2 cup of vinegar inside the volcano. These chemicals will react and cause an eruption from the top of the volcano. If you want to change the color of the lava, you can add food coloring to the vinegar before reacting."

Build ramps for toy cars.,
Drop items of different sizes.,
Demonstrate elastic and inelastic collisions.",How to Think of Fourth Grade Science Project Ideas4," The ramps will show kids how the cars are affected by different inclines. The steeper the ramp, the more gravity changes the movement of the car. Have your class make a showing how the cars are affected by each ramp., Gravity acts the same on all objects regardless of their size or weight. You can demonstrate this by dropping two or more items (e.g. rocks and apples) and letting the students analyze their fall. Keep in mind that dropping something like paper will subject the experiment to greater air resistance (this will make it appear that gravity is acting differently on different objects)., You can do this easily by dropping bouncy balls and paper balls. The bouncy ball is an elastic collision (the energy is mostly preserved and the ball bounces). The paper ball is an inelastic collision (the energy is mostly dissipated and the ball stops).

Analyze the materials available.,
Evaluate the amount of time you have to complete the project.,
Consider the location your project will be displayed.",How to Think of Fourth Grade Science Project Ideas5," Consider where you are constructing your project. If you are constructing it in the classroom, think about what materials are available to you in your classroom. If you are constructing it outside or in the gym, consider the materials that are available to you at there. Make a list ahead of time and bring any needed materials with you.Ask other teachers for help locating materials for your project.

, Limit your options to things that you can achieve in the amount of time that is available. Some projects take hours to complete. Other projects could take days or weeks to complete. If you are creating a complicated project that takes weeks to complete, be sure to pace yourself to ensure that you have enough time and your students follow along., There are many variables that can affect your science project. You should take these variables into consideration when you are selecting a project. Decide which variables you can control and which ones you cannot.


For example, do not select a project that requires you to mix colored lights if you don’t have the ability to turn the lights off where your project will be displayed.

Fill multiple pitchers with saline solution.,
Place the diapers facing up.,
Pour the solution on the diapers.,
Compare the amount of solution absorbed.",How to Test the Absorbency of Different Brands of Diapers2," Choose pitchers that allow you to control pour easily. Mix a solution of nine grams of table salt per one liter of water to simulate urine. Fill each pitcher with the solution.Use identical pitchers and have one pitcher for each diaper you are testing.


, You want to be able to pour directly onto the center of the diaper. This will most effectively test how well the liquid is absorbed and dispersed throughout the absorbent core. This is a better simulation of urinating than uniformly soaking a diaper in liquid., Pour slowly. Allow all of the liquid to be absorbed. Any excess liquid that runs off of the diaper will cause results to be inaccurate. When the diaper stops absorbing, stop pouring. If, after a few seconds, the diaper absorbs the liquid, try pouring a little more until absorption stops.Put the diapers in a bowl or pan to catch any runoff liquid. Pour the excess liquid back into the pitcher to improve the accuracy of your measurements.


, In this step, no math is needed. Put the pitchers side by side. The pitcher with the least amount of saline corresponds to the diaper that absorbed the most saline. The pitcher with the most saline corresponds to the diaper that absorbed the least saline.Use a chart or table to keep track of your data. Have one column for the brand or type of diaper and one for the amount of liquid left in the pitcher. The more liquid left in the pitcher, the worse the diaper performed.

Weigh a diaper.,
Put the diaper on your baby.,
Record the time that the diaper was on your baby.,
Weigh the wet diaper.,
Repeat with other brands and compare.",How to Test the Absorbency of Different Brands of Diapers3," Knowing the weight of the diaper before putting it on your baby gives you a reference point for later. Each brand will likely have a different weight. Be sure to do this for each diaper you want to compare.This experiment will be done over many hours or even days. Keep track of your diapers and how well they perform in a chart. Have a column for brand, dry weight, wet weight, difference between dry and wet weights, and amount of time that the diaper was on the baby.


, Do this just as you would do any other time. The idea of this method is to test how diapers perform on the baby. Make sure that the baby wears the same clothing overtop of each diaper you test. Otherwise, differences in how the clothing fits over the diaper (and puts pressure on the diaper) could interfere with your results., The most reliable time to do this test is at night. Nighttime is also the longest stretch that a diaper will need to keep your baby dry. Write down the time you put each diaper on, and the time you took it off.Change diapers when they are wet. Do not leave wet diapers on your baby to try to absorb more, as this could lead to diaper rash and skin irritation for your baby.


, Unfortunately, measuring time alone is not an accurate way to gauge how hard a diaper is working. Your baby may not urinate exactly the same amount every night. To help level the playing field, take a final weight for each diaper to see how much urine it absorbed during the time it was worn.Subtract the dry weight that you took before putting the diaper on from the wet weight. This will give you the weight of the urine absorbed.


, Go through the same series of steps with each brand of diapers. The more methodical you are with your process, the more accurate your comparison will be. While testing diapers on your baby will help you get a feel for what brand of diaper performs best on your child, keep in mind that it is not the same as a controlled experiment to test absorbency."

Select different colored lights.,
Prepare a power source for the lights.,
Turn the lights on at night.,
Watch for bugs to interact with each light.",How to Test Insect Responses to Color2," You can use one different light bulb for each color on the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), or you can buy a rainbow fluorescent light. You can hang a translucent sheet above each color to make it easier to see and count the incoming bugs. The lights will be more effective at attracting bugs at night than during the day., Since you will be doing this outside, it is likely that you will have to run an extension cord. You may also need a power strip, depending on whether you use individual light sockets or one fluorescent rainbow light. Make sure that you are following all safety specifications for your extension cord (don’t put too many things on it, be careful around wet grass, etc.)., You should leave the lights on throughout the entire night, if possible. Different bugs will be more active at different points in the night. You can stay up all night to watch the bugs, or set an alarm for every couple of hours to remind you to get up and go check on your experiment.Another great way to capture bug activity around your lights is to set up a camera or video camera.

, Several different measurements could be taken. You could count the number of bugs that go to each light, or you could keep track of how long bugs stay engaged with a particular color. Each added measurement will make it that much harder to keep track of your experiment, and it might be a good idea to do several different experiments to measure each aspect of bug-light interaction.If you want to measure multiple things, using a camera or video camera can allow you to capture moments of the experiment and analyze them later. Otherwise, you could make it a multi-night experiment and look at one characteristic each night.
You should see many bugs throughout the night, especially if you are recording times that you are away from the experiment. You should aim to observe at least 20-30 bugs for the sake of seeing reliable trends."

Choose two plants of different colors.,
Take note of the condition of each plant.,
Check the plant regularly for insects.,
Check the plant regularly for leaf damage.,
Compare your results.",How to Test Insect Responses to Color3," Choose two of the same plant in different colors. For example, some plants will come in red or green leaf variations. It has long been hypothesized that the color difference affects the way that insects interact with the plant., By noting any damaged leaves or insects on the plant initially, you will be able to compare what happens to each plant over the course of your experiment. Write down the number of leaves, record any damage to them, and how many insects you find on the plant. If you only want to look at one part of the plant (the leaves for example) then you do not have to record the number of insects on other parts (like the fruit or stem)., You should choose a fixed interval to check your plant. In other words, do it at the same time every day and the same number of times every day. This will help to reduce bias based on when certain insects are most active. Each time you check your plants, write down the number of insects you find on the leaves of each color plant., Insects will gnaw and chew through the leaves of a plant. This is the primary food source for many insects. Even if you don’t find an insect on your plant, small holes and damage on the leaves can show you that they were there. Keep track of these damages and write down the location and number of damaged leaves for each plant in your study., Once you have collected enough data from your different colored plants, it is time to analyze how the insects interacted with each color. You can simply tally up the number of insects and damaged leaves found on each plant, or you can go so far as to create charts and graphs that show your data. Either way, look at the numbers and draw a general conclusion about how the color of the plant changes how insects respond to it.A general conclusion might be something like “insects preferred green plants over red plants.”

Heat water and add salt to make saltwater.,
Add salt until it no longer dissolves.,
Spoon the water onto dark construction paper.,
Wait for salt to form.",How to Separate Salt from Water1," It's easy to see the principals of evaporation in action by performing this simple experiment. To start, all you'll need is a little ordinary table salt, some tap water, a saucepan, a little black construction paper, and a stove. Add a few cups of water to the pan and place it on a hot burner. Wait for the water to heat — it doesn't necessarily need to boil, but the hotter it gets, the more quickly it will dissolve the salt.


The reason hot water is best for dissolving salt (and other chemicals) has to do with the motion of the molecules making up the water. When the water gets hot, these molecules move faster, running into more salt molecules and pulling the salt crystals apart.;
, Continue adding small spoonfuls of salt and stirring to dissolve them. Eventually, you'll reach a point at which the salt won't dissolve any more, no matter how hot the water is. This is called the water's saturation point. Turn the stove off and let the water cool slightly.


When water reaches its saturation point, it no longer has any ability to dissolve salt at a molecular level — so much salt has dissolved that there is no longer any chemical potential for the water to pull apart new salt crystals., Using a spoon or ladle, pour a little of your salt water over a dark-colored piece of construction paper. Place this paper on a dish to avoid having it soak through to the countertop or work surface below. Now, all you need to do is wait for the water to evaporate. This process will be slightly faster if you leave the paper somewhere the sun's light can hit it.


Don't waste your leftover salt water — there are tons of things you can use it for. For instance, you can use it to poach an egg, boil potatoes, preserve spinach, and even help you peel nuts!, As the water evaporates, it should leave behind miniature salt crystals. These should look like small, shiny, white or clear flakes on the surface of the paper. Congratulations! You've just separated salt from water.


Feel free to scrape a little bit of salt from your paper to season your food — it should be perfectly safe to eat. Be careful not to get any paper shavings in your food, though!

Store everything in its special place.,
Clean up after every experiment.",How to Set Up a Lab (for Kids)," Before you begin setting up your home lab, you need to make sure that it will be okay with your parents. Ask them to help you choose a space and set it up. You will probably also need their help to pay for some of your new equipment.


Your parents are more likely to say yes if you have a plan for your science space. Tell them the types of things you would like to do with the space to convince them that it is a good idea.;
, You want to make sure the space is big enough for the types of experiments you will be doing. Choose a room or a corner of the room that has enough space for a table and chairs. Mark this area specifically as the “science lab” and keep all of the science experiment supplies in this space.


Dedicate an area of the playroom to the “lab” and set up boundaries using bookshelves as walls.Use an old table that can be damaged without consequences.

, If possible, set up your lab near a window. A well-lit space allows you to see what you are doing during the experiment. It can be dangerous working in a poorly-lit space. If the overhead lighting is not sufficient, consider purchasing a floor or table lamp to increase the light in the area.This will be particularly helpful if you are doing experiments involving the weather or plants that need sunlight., Another reason to set up your lab near the window is to provide good ventilation. Some of your experiments may get smelly or may produce potentially harmful fumes. Working in a space with good air circulation is important in these instances.You can use a fan to help circulate the air with the window open during the experiment.

, Even if you are being super careful, it is likely that you will spill something during your experiments. If the room you are setting everything up in has carpet, consider getting a plastic mat to place under the workspace to make cleanup easier.In a pinch, you can lay down plastic bags or newspaper during the experiment and clean it all up when you’re finished.

, You definitely want to have a fire extinguisher and first aid kit in an easily accessible place. It is best if you can set up your lab near a sink or bathroom. Having running water nearby makes the lab space that much safer in case of emergency.


Have a cleaning kit for spills and decontamination nearby as well.

, A true home scientist must also be a safe home scientist. Safety goggles, a lab coat, and gloves are three essentials to any laboratory.You may not need them for every experiment, but it is good to get in the habit of putting your protective equipment on to stay safe.


These items can be purchased at education stores or online.
Lab coats will also keep your clothes from getting damaged during the experiment.

, There are many kits for kids that have all the basics included in one box. There are kits specific to different subjects as well. It all depends on what you’re interested in. The kits are a good place to start to gather materials needed for future experiments.


Some of the components of these kits are reusable so be sure to save them.

, Test tubes, beakers, flasks, and measuring devices are all necessary for the home scientist. Glassware can easily be purchased online. You can use measuring cups like the ones in the kitchen or you can purchase a graduated cylinder to help measure volumes.A scale for weighing things can also be useful.
With some creativity, you can use a lot of items around the house for your experiments. Old soda bottles, cans, and take out containers can be very useful.

, Every good scientist keeps track of the experiments that they have done. When you are working on something, take notes in your lab notebook. Make sure to include the date you were working and everything you did. Write down your results as well.


If you took pictures, be sure to include those in your notebook.

, When organizing your lab space, you want to make sure that the table you will be working on is always clear. You will need lots of space for your experiments and you don’t want the bench to be cluttered with items.


When doing experiments, keep only the things you’ll need on the bench space. Leave everything else stored away.

, Make a dedicated space for all of your lab equipment. This will make it easier to find when you need it later. Keep a set of plastic drawers or a bookshelf near your work bench to make things easily accessible.Return everything to its spot when you’re done with the experiment.

, When you are finished working in your lab, make sure you put everything away and clean your bench space. If anything was spilled, clean it up. Wash all of the containers you used and put them away as well.If your lab coat got messy, take it off and have it washed.

Start boiling a pot of salt water.,
Set a lid on the pot offset.,
Let the water collect in a bowl.,
If necessary, repeat.",How to Separate Salt from Water2," The simple experiment above showed how to get the salt from water, but what if you want to keep the salt-less water, too? Distillation is the answer. Distillation is the process of heating a liquid to separate it from other chemicals dissolved in it, then collecting the condensation, which should be relatively ""pure"". In this case, we'll start by making a few cups of saltwater (see above for directions) and heating it to a boil on the stove.

, Next, find a lid for your pot (it doesn't necessarily have to fit perfectly). Balance the lid on the pot so that part of it is hanging over the rim. Try to arrange the lid so that the portion hanging off of the edge is the lowest point on the lid. Watch as condensation forms on the bottom of the lid and starts to trickle down it.


As the saltwater boils, the water (minus the salt) will turn into steam and rise out of the pot. As it hits the lid, it will cool slightly and form liquid condensation (water) on the underside of the lid. This water doesn't contain salt, so all we need to do is gather it to have salt-free water.

, Since water runs downhill, the condensation on the underside of the lid will naturally gather at the lowest point of the lid. Once enough condensation gathers here, it will start to form drops and fall. Place a bowl under this spot to catch the drops of distilled water as they fall.


If you like, you can also run a long, skinny metal or glass object (like a stirring rod or thermometer) from the bowl up to the lowest point on the lid — the water should run down this object into the bowl.

, As the salt water in the pot boils, more and more distilled water should gather in your bowl. This water will have most of its salt removed. However, in some situations, a small amount of salt can remain. In this case, you may want to perform a double distillation — boiling the distilled water you gathered in the same way as you boiled the salt water to remove any lingering salt.


Technically, this water should be safe to drink. However, unless you're sure that both the lid for your pot and the bowl you collected the water in (and the skinny metal or glass rod, if you used one) are clean, you may not want to do this.

Use reverse osmosis.,
Add decanoic acid.,
Use electrodialysis.",How to Separate Salt from Water3," The methods above aren't the only ways to separate salt from water, they're just the most convenient for most people working at home. It's also possible to separate salt from water with other methods requiring specialized materials. For instance, a technique called reverse osmosis can remove salt from salt water by forcing the water through a permeable membrane. This membrane acts as a filter, permitting only water molecules to pass through and keeping dissolved contaminants (like salt) out.Reverse osmosis pumps are sometimes sold for residential use but are also often used for recreational purposes like camping. Pumps can be somewhat expensive, usually running several hundred dollars., Another way to separate salt and water is via chemical reaction. For instance, research has shown that treating salt water with a chemical called decanoic acid is a reliable way to remove the salt.After adding the acid and heating slightly, then cooling, the salt and other impurities ""fall out"" of the solution (that is, solidify and sink to the bottom). When the reaction is complete, the water and salt sit in two completely separate layers, making it easy to remove the water.


Decanoic acid is available from chemical supply stores — usually around $30-$40 per bottle.

, Using the power of electricity, it's possible to remove particles like salt from water. This is done by submerging a negatively charged anode and a positively charged cathode in water and separating them with a porous membrane. The electrical charge of the anode and cathode essentially ""pull"" dissolved ions (like those that make up salt) toward them like magnets, leaving relatively pure water.Note that this process does not necessarily remove bacteria or other contaminants from the water, so further treatment may be needed to get drinkable water from this method in the wild. Recent research has been promising, however, suggesting new techniques that do kill bacteria as part of the process."

Gather your materials.,
Label the test tubes.,
Record your control and experimental groups.,
Construct your control group.,
Construct your experimental group.,
Observe your experiment.,
Understand the causes of rust.,
Observe your control group.,
Observe your experimental group.",How to Prove That Rusting Takes Place in Moist Air," You will need two test tubes, a test tube holder, four iron nails, wool cotton (cotton balls), Calcium Chloride crystals, and water.Clear plastic cups could be used as a substitute for test tubes. However, you would need to use larger pieces of wool cotton, like chunks of the cotton batting used in furniture cushioning.
Calcium Chloride crystals are also known as rock salt or ice melt. You can find them at any home goods store near the snow removal items.
Calcium Chloride crystals can also be found in moisture absorbers which are often located in home improvement stores with the dehumidifiers.
The size of the nails do not matter. Just be sure that two nails will fit inside of each test tube.
Most nails are made of iron but some of them are coated. Be sure to use iron nails that are not galvanized or covered in another coating.;
, Write “Tube A” and “Tube B” on the test tubes. Tube “A” will be your control group and tube “B” will be your experimental group. Place both test tubes in the test tube holder.

, Keep these notes so that you can record your observations of each test tube over the course of the next couple of days. This can be done on a chart or in a lab notebook. The goal is not to mix up the different test tubes.

, In the bottom of test tube “A” place two dry nails. Then, layer wool cotton, Calcium Chloride crystals, and more wool cotton on top of the nails., Simply place two moistened nails in the bottom of the test tube that you have labeled “B”.Be sure to place your test tubes next to each other in the same room. They need to be exposed to the same air.
Do not cover your wet nails with cotton or Calcium Chloride crystals. You want these nails to be exposed to air.

, Over the next week observe your experiment and record your observations. The nails in tube “A” should remain rust-free while the nails in tube “B” should begin to rust.You are likely to start seeing results within 24 hours.Record your observations daily.

, Rust forms when iron is exposed to moisture and oxygen. When oxygen from the air comes in contact with iron, the iron loses electrons to the oxygen atom. This process is known as oxidation. In order for the iron to oxidize, it must also come in contact with water. Even the smallest amount of water, or moisture, is sufficient for oxidation to occur., The nails in test tube “A” did not rust because they were dry. Not only did these nails go into the test tube dry, but you also added Calcium Chloride crystals to the test tube, which absorbed any moisture which may have come into contact with the nails below the wool cotton., The nails in test tube “B” did start to rust. This is because they came into contact with both moisture and oxygen from the air that entered the test tube. The contact with the moist air speeds up the rate of oxidation, which causes rust to form.


Even in a dry environment, rust will form as long as oxygen is present. Moist air just provides a more favorable setting for the oxidation process to occur faster.
You can repeat the experiment with a humidifier in the room. You should see your results intensify.

Come up with a question.,
Talk about making observations.,
Discuss how to make a hypothesis.,
Plan an experiment.,

Ask guided questions.,
Do experiments with kids.,
Write everything down.,
Communicate what has been learned.",How to Simplify and Explain the Scientific Method for Kids," The scientific method is a series of steps that scientists follow when thinking about a problem and how to solve it. It is how scientists study and learn about things in nature. By using the scientific method, they have ordered steps to follow that will help them better understand whatever they are studying.The scientific method can be used to answer any question you may have about anything. Think of it as the roadmap you follow on your scientific journey.;
, The first part of explaining it to kids is to list all of these steps so they can seem them all at once. Depending on the age group you are teaching to, you can make these steps more or less specific. The most basic steps of the scientific method are the following:Ask a question.
Make some observations.
Form a hypothesis.
Test the hypothesis
Draw some conclusions.
For primary school children, stick to the basics listed below.
For middle school and high school aged kids, add more details for each step and encourage them to think about what steps they would use before talking specifically about the scientific method.

, The official first step of the scientific method to ask a question. It can be about anything that you are interested in or about something that you have observed. The best questions are something that can be measured with an experiment, but your question can be as simple as what is a rainbow?Some other example questions: How does the curve of an arch affect how much weight it can hold? How does the purity of water affect its surface tension?, After you have established a question to answer, you need to talk about how to go about answering that question. First, you must do some research and make some observations about your question. Go to the library or use the internet to research your question.If you want to learn more about rainbows, do some research about light, the sun, the sky, and rainbows themselves. Make some observations about when you tend to see a rainbow in the sky. Do you see rainbows at any other time or place?

, A hypothesis is an educated guess as to the answer of a question. It is based on research and what you already know. It is the statement that you will test in your experiment. Talk about how scientists are constantly making and testing their hypothesis based on experiments they and other scientists have done.To make your own hypothesis, make a guess to the answer to your question based on your research and observations. Your hypothesis does not have to be right or wrong, it just has to be testable.
Based on your observations, you might hypothesize that rainbows form when water “bends” light from the sun.

, Now that you have discussed and made a hypothesis, talk the kids through an experimental plan. Ask them how they would test their hypothesis and guide them to a doable experiment. A good experiment must have a dependent variable (the condition that you are measuring in the experiment), an independent variable (conditions that change during the experiment), and control variables (conditions that don’t change during the experiment).Talk about the types of variables and about writing down the procedure and results in a logbook or journal. It’s important to keep track of all of your data for when you need to make conclusions.
To test your hypothesis about rainbows, fill a glass with water and hold it up to the sun. Place a piece of white paper underneath the glass and see if a rainbow forms. Do the same thing with an empty glass. Write your results down., The final step of the scientific method is to draw conclusions based on the data you have collected. Discuss this process with the kids explaining that the conclusions will either support or disprove their initial hypothesis. Talk about what was learned and whether the hypothesis was correct or not.This is a good time to talk about more experiments that could be done to take the project a step further. This starts the scientific method once again with a question!
In more advanced experiments you may have to actually analyze the data before you can make conclusions.
For the rainbow example, you should have noticed that the glass without water did not form rainbows, but the glass with water did. This supports your hypothesis.

, The best way to teach the scientific method is to actually work through it. If your child has a question, talk them through the steps. Ask them guided questions to help them think through the process. Why do they think something is happening? What could be causing it? How can we test that idea? Is there something we can to do to prove what is happening?Kids are naturally curious and love to do things for themselves. Give them the opportunity to do this by asking them questions and showing them instead of just telling them.
For example: If it is raining outside, your child may ask you where rain comes from. First ask them where they think it’s coming from. They will probably say the sky or the clouds. This gives you the opportunity to talk about clouds and the water cycle.

, Use the scientific method to actually do experiments with kids. Asking a question, then developing and executing an experiment is the best way for them to truly learn about the scientific method and how it works. Be sure to ask questions every step of the way so that they get the most out of the experience.


You can search online for great ideas of experiments to do.Some example experiments you could do are: What metals are magnetic? What individual colors make up the colors of your markers? How much bacteria is in the food we eat/water we drink?

, When exploring something new, it is important to take lots of notes and write all observations down. You also want to write down exactly how you did an experiment (the procedure) so you can figure out an error if something went wrong or repeat the experiment later. Write down all results so you can draw accurate conclusions.Keep a notebook that is just for scientific questions and experiments. This can be referenced again and again if the kids want to repeat any experiments.

, Another aspect of the scientific method is actually communicating your results. This can be done in a written form or in an oral presentation. Poster boards are a great way to organize and present everything visually.If the kids are doing a science fair project, they’ll probably have to communicate their project both with an oral presentation and with a written poster board.
Talk about the project, the results, and the conclusion. Ask them what the most important findings of the experiment were. Discuss with them the best way to communicate these findings.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Chill the slide and super glue in the freezer.,
Collect snowflakes.,
Transfer the snowflake to the microscope slide.,
Squeeze a drop of superglue on top of the snowflake.,
Store the slides in a freezer for at least 48 hours.",How to Preserve Snowflakes1," In order to preserve a snowflake, you will need a microscope slide with a coverslip, liquid superglue, a small paintbrush, a magnifying glass, and a dark cloth or piece of cardboard. You will also need a snowy day!Microscope slides and coverslips can be purchased online.
The superglue must the liquid type. Gel superglue will not work for this.
The small paintbrush is optional, but it does make it easier to manipulate the snowflakes without breaking them.
Go snowflake hunting during a light snowfall; you are more likely to find unbroken, larger specimens as opposed to snowflakes ravaged in a snowstorm.;
, In order to prevent the snowflake from melting on contact with the slide or glue, you must chill them in the freezer before use. You want both to be very cold to keep the snowflake intact.Chill in the freezer for 30 minutes.
Avoid chilling the superglue for more than 30 minutes as it will freeze and then you will have to wait for it to thaw again.

, Once supplies are readied, go outside and find a cold, smooth surface free of snow. You can wipe off part of a table or even a small patch of concrete on the ground. Place the cardboard on the surface and set the slides and super glue down nearby. Let snow collect on the cardboard and examine the flakes with the magnifying glass.Choose the snowflakes you would like preserve and use the paintbrush to sweep away the ones you don’t want.
Try to use larger snowflakes as specimens since the detail is more pronounced.

, Using the paintbrush, pick up the snowflake and brush it onto the microscope slide. Position it where you would like. You can add more than one snowflake to each slide.


Handle the glass slides near the edges and avoid touching the surfaces directly. Handling the face of the slides too much could cause the glass to warm up.
If the snowflakes are melting, the day may be too warm. Days that are well below freezing are better for preserving the snowflakes., After you have acquired enough snowflakes for your liking, add a small drop of superglue to the center of each snowflake and immediately place the cover slide on top of the snowflakes pushing down very, very, gently.


Handle the thin cover-slips carefully as they have sharp edges and are fragile.

, Keeping the slides in the freezer allows the super glue to dry around the snowflakes while they are still frozen. Place the slides in location where they won’t be bumped or broken.


Note that it can take up to a week for the superglue to dry in the freezer. To be safe, leave them in for the whole week.Tell your family to be careful when they open the freezer to not break your slides.
Once the glue has dried, you can remove the slides from the freezer and examine the snowflakes under a microscope!

Fill up a graduated cylinder about 1/4 full with tap water and rubbing alcohol.,
Add in food coloring of your choice to the mixture.,
Insert a straw into the container.,
Cover the top of your container with modeling clay.,
Start finding temperatures!,
Watch the mixture rise and fall in the straw.",How to Make Your Own Thermometer," If you don't have a cylinder, find some clear container that's as narrow as possible. But anything from a soda bottle to a mason jar can work -- it's just a matter of how fast your thermometer starts working. The narrower it is, the faster it'll be.


When your jar is narrower, the liquid is forced to move more quickly -- it's why all the real thermometers you see are thin and narrow.
Don't have rubbing alcohol? Just water works too, but rubbing alcohol expands quicker (forcing movement) and water obviously doesn't move when it's frozen! Anything below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) can't be recorded.;
, Red will mimic mercury, making your thermometer seem more like a thermometer and less like a straw placed in liquid. But why aren't there blue thermometers anyway? Maybe there should be....

, It is recommended that you use a clear straw so you can see the liquid rise. If you'd like, put a drop of oil into the placed straw -- the oil will sit on top, preventing any water from evaporating.

, If it has a lid (like a soda bottle or mason jar), poke a hole into it just big enough so the straw can slide through; you want as few air holes to cover up as possible. Then, grab your clay and create an air-tight seal, molding it around the top of your container or hole you made for your straw. If any air can get in, it'll warp your findings.


Play-dough works, too, as does candle wax or petroleum jelly.

, Begin by leaving your completed thermometer alone. Where does the water sit when it's just at room temperature. Then, hold the bottle with both hands to make the mixture heat up. What does the water do now?


Place your thermometer in different places. In the sunlight, in the fridge, in the closet, on the windowsill. What is happening to the colored liquid?
Do note that this can take a bit of time, especially if you're dealing with a wide container or straw. Changes are harder to see when you're dealing with more area.

, In hotter temperatures, liquids expand. This forces the liquid up the straw, mimicking the mercury effect in thermometers. In colder temperatures, it contracts. So where's the hottest point in your school or home? What's the hottest point of the day?


Try calibrating your thermometer! Write down where the levels are for different spots around your home or school. Can you roughly figure out what levels correspond to what temperatures? Or do you want to make a new scale all your own? Fahrenheit and Celsius are overused, anyway. You have your own thermometer - might as well start using your own scale!

Start planning your presentation early.,
Make an outline.,
Consider writing out your presentation.,
Create notecards.,
Plan your demonstration.,
Practice making your presentation.,
Think of audience questions.",How to Present a Science Project1," The longer you have to prepare, the more comfortable you’ll be when you make your presentation. Try to start a few weeks before the day you present your project.Finish up your experiment, research, and other aspects of your project.
Get the materials you’ll need for your display board.
Start to imagine how you’ll organize your information.;
, Your outline should lay out the skeleton of your presentation. It should include these elements:An introduction to your topic or the problem you’ve addressed.
Your hypothesis, or what you expected to prove through your experiment.
The research you did to learn more about your topic.
Each step of your experiment’s procedure.
The results of your experiment.
Your conclusion, including whether you proved or disproved your hypothesis and what you learned.

, While you should avoid reading your presentation word for word, it’s a good idea to write out what you want to say. Writing your presentation will help you make sure you communicate clearly and avoid grammar mistakes.When writing your speech, try to keep it simple, and avoid using phrases that are more complicated than necessary. Try to tailor the presentation to your audience: will you be presenting to your class, judges, a higher grade than yours, or to an honors class?
Writing out your presentation can also help you manage your time. For example, if you’re supposed to talk for less than five minutes, try to shoot for less than two pages.

, It’s a good idea to make note cards with your presentation’s main points. However, keep in mind presentations are often scored based on your ability to speak about your topic without reading a report word for word. Use your notecards primarily to help you practice your presentation and keep them on hand to make sure your presentation stays on subject., Demonstrating your experiment or your research topic can help engage your audience with a visual example. If your presentation involves making a demonstration, practice it several times in advance to be sure everything goes as planned.


For example, if you've made a volcano, make sure you know the exact mix of chemicals that will create the eruption.

, First, practice by yourself or in a mirror. If you have a time limit, time yourself to make sure your presentation isn’t too long or short. Ask your parents or a friend if you can present your project to them, and ask if they have any pointers., Do your best to anticipate questions that your audience might ask, especially if you know there will be a Q&A component to your presentation. When you practice making your presentation to friends or family, have them ask you questions to help you prepare. This will help you avoid getting caught off-guard and to refine anything in your speech that's unclear.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Chill the microscope slide and spray adhesive.,
Spray the slide with the plastic spray.,
Catch snowflakes on the coated slide.,
Add another light coat of plastic spray.,
Examine the snowflakes with a magnifying glass.",How to Preserve Snowflakes2," This method is similar to the one above, but instead of using superglue, you will use a spray adhesive such as hairspray or plastic spray (Krylon spray coating). For this method, you will need microscope slides, hairspray or plastic spray (either will work), some toothpicks, a magnifying glass and a cold, snowy day.Microscope slides can easily be purchased online.
A light snowfall on a cold day are the best conditions to preserve a snowflake.

, To avoid melting the snowflake when it comes in contact with the slide and spray, you need to chill them before use. If it’s really cold outside, you can just put the supplies outside for at least 30 minutes.You can also place the slide and the spray in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to one hour.

, Lightly spray one side of the slide with the plastic spray. Spray enough so that there is a thin coat on the slide, about 1-2 seconds of spray. If you add too much, the liquid could melt the snowflake before it dries.If you spray too much on the slide, put that slide aside and try again with a new one.

, With the slide lightly coated, it will be quite sticky. As the snow falls, hold the slide out and catch some snowflakes on it. Put your hand above the slide once you have the flakes that you want so the slide doesn’t get overcrowded.You can use a toothpick to reposition the snowflake on the slide as you’d like., Keep the snowflake slide in a cold location and lightly spray it with another coat of plastic spray. This will seal the snowflake in place. The snowflake itself will melt, but as it melts the shape of the snowflake will be imprinted in the plastic spray.Let the adhesive dry in the cold.

, Once the adhesive has dried you can look at the snowflakes with a magnifying glass to see their detail. Each snowflake will look different and have a different structure. Compare the different snowflake shapes.Your snowflake will now be preserved forever. The slide is delicate so be careful not to break it.

Purchase your display board.,
Organize your board clearly.,
Use large, easy to read fonts in dark colors.,
Mount headings, text, and graphs with construction paper.,
Create a clear PowerPoint presentation.",How to Present a Science Project2," Science teachers often offer the opportunity to order display boards with them, ensuring that displays are uniform and cheaper. If you're responsible for providing your own board, think of how large it should be in order to include all of your information. Typically, the best choice is a tri-fold cardboard display that folds out to 3 by 4 feet (.91 by 1.22 meters).


When you purchase your board, you should also acquire other materials, like a gluestick, construction paper, a pencil, markers, and a ruler.

, Create an orderly flow for your display board that your audience will be able to follow. Put the title in an obvious place, like at the board’s top and center.Consider using the top left corner for your topic introduction, the section under that for your hypothesis, and the bottom left section to discuss your research.
Use the top right corner to outline your experiment’s procedure. List your results underneath, and finally, put the section with your conclusion under the results.

, Make sure your audience will be able to read your text, especially the section headings. Using a sans serif font, like Arial, will help make your text legible from a greater distance. Try to keep font sizes uniform, using one size for headings and a slightly smaller one for discussion.Be sure to use a dark font color that’s easy to see from a distance.
You can also write everything out by hand. Draft your lettering in pencil before using a pen or marker, and use a ruler to make sure everything is straight.

, You can add a little color and personality by mounting each section on a construction paper background. After you type and print each of your board’s sections, use a gluestick to attach it to a sheet of construction paper. Then, glue each construction paper sheet to the display board.Before gluing anything, make sure you plan out each section’s position and are sure everything will fit without looking cluttered. Use rulers to make sure everything is positioned evenly.

, If you’ve been assigned to make a PowerPoint presentation instead of a display board, the same organization principles still apply. Make clearly labeled slides for each section and use large and legible fonts. Avoid including too much text on each slide, as your audience might be overwhelmed by trying to read it or just won’t read it all.


Consider including one slide for each section, like one for your hypothesis and one that outlines your research. If a slide becomes too dense, break it down by concept. For example, include one slide for the first step of your experiment and another for the next step.

Dress to impress.,
Relax and breathe.,
Speak clearly and loudly.,
Engage your audience.,
Stay focused, even if you slip up.,
Ask for questions and feedback.",How to Present a Science Project3," If your school doesn't have a uniform, make sure you're dressed appropriately. Go for a nice skirt or dress that's not too short, dress slacks, khakis, and a button-up shirt. Don't just wear a t-shirt and jeans and avoid clothes that are ripped or make controversial statements.


Take the time to iron your clothes and tuck your shirt in to avoid looking sloppy.

, Try not to be nervous and stressed when it's your turn to present. If you’re speaking in front of your class, remember that everyone has to make a presentation and is probably a little nervous, too.


It’s a good idea to use the restroom before you have to present your project.

, Chances are, your teacher will be grading your presentation based in part on your public speaking. Try to pronounce words clearly and speak loudly enough for everyone in the room to hear you. Avoid mumbling and looking down.It can be really hard to resist, but try to avoid saying “um” or “uh” during your presentation.
Speaking when you have a dry mouth can be difficult, so it’s a good idea to keep a water bottle handy.

, Try to be both conversational and knowledgeable when you make your speech. Remember not to simply read off notecards, your display board, or your PowerPoint. Make eye contact, use hand gestures, and direct their attention to your display with your hand or a laser pointer when necessary., Even if you do trip up your words, keep calm and carry on. If necessary, use your notecards or your display board to get you back on track. Do your best to stay positive and enthusiastic instead of getting sidetracked or upset., When you're finished making your presentation, ask if anyone has questions or feedback. Be prepared to respond or clarify, and use any positive or negative feedback to improve your public speaking skills for future assignments.


Remember it’s better to be honest if you don't know how to answer a question instead of making something up. Ask the person who asked the question to repeat or rephrase it, or say something like, ""That's certainly an area I can explore in more detail in the future.""

Gather your materials.,
Label the side of each cup.,
Line your shoebox with foil.,
Fill each cup about ½ full of soil.,
Plant the seeds.,
Water each plant.,
Place the cups in the box by the window.,
Make a shoot cap.,
Make base caps.,
Let the plants grow.,
Cap the plants.,
Analyze the plant growth.",How to See if Flowers Lean Towards the Sun," You will need three cups, soil, tape, a marker, paper, a shoebox, seeds, aluminum foil, one straw, and water. Organize your materials on a table or desk for easy use. You can pick any seed. Some good options are corn, lima bean, or radish.
You can substitute a shoebox for another medium size box.;
, Use the marker to label each cup. You can use the labels “A, B, and C” or “1, 2, and 3”. These labels will help you identify the plants throughout your experiment., First, remove and discard the lid and one side of the shoebox. This will allow light to enter from an angle. Next, line the remainder of the shoebox with aluminum foil. This prevents it from getting wet when you water the plants. Place the shoebox on a windowsill or on a table in front of a window., Be sure to use the same kind of soil in each cup. Leave the soil loose. If you pack it too tightly, the seeds will not be able to grow well., Follow the planting instructions on the seed package. These instructions will differ depending on what plant you choose. For example, some plants might need to be an inch deep and others may need to be three inches deep., Turn a faucet or spigot on so that a small steady stream of water is flowing. Move the cup back and forth under the water until the soil looks wet. Do not overwater the soil. It should just be damp to the touch., The cups need to be side by side in the shoe box. This is how the light will be controlled for the experiment. Always keep the same cups in the same place. Moving them around will mess up your results.Once you place the cups in the box, you will not need to remove them. The seeds will sprout, and the plants will grow facing the direction they choose.

, The shoot cap will prevent light from shining on the tip of the plant. The cap can be made by surrounding the top half of an inch of a straw with aluminum foil. The cap should be a cylinder that is half an inch tall and has a covered top.One half inch equals 1.77 centimeters.

, Base caps will not cover the top of the plant, but will cover the stem instead. To make this kind of cap, you should wrap aluminum foil around a straw. Do not cover the top or bottom of the straw. The base cape should be a cylinder with no covered top or bottom, and should be roughly half an inch long., The plants will need to sprout before you cap them. This will take different amounts of time for different plants. Once the plants sprout, you should let them grow to be half an inch tall., Once the plants have grown about half an inch, you need to put the assigned caps on them. Place a shoot cap on plants in cup A (or 1). Use base caps for plants in cup B (or 2). Place no caps on plants in cup C (or 3). The third cup is a control group., As you monitor the plants over the next days and weeks, make note of which flowers lean toward the sun and which ones lean away from the sun. The flowers in cup A will likely grow straight up. The flowers in cups B and C will likely lean toward the sun. This happens because the light is detected at the top of the shoot, and the flower grows in the direction of the light. When you cover the top of the shoot with a shoot cap, the plant cannot detect the light and grows straight up."

Start with an empty tub.,
Tape alligator clips to the bottom of the tub.,
Connect the electrodes.",How to Prepare Hydrogen and Oxygen by Water Using Acetic Acid1," You can use a plastic or glass tub. Avoid using a metal tub since you will be running an electrical current through the water. The size of the tub does not matter, but a good starting point would be to use a 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) container., You will need two alligator clips. One will connect to your positive electrode (the anode) and the other will connect to your negative electrode (the cathode). Tape one end of each clip to the inside bottom of the tub. Make sure to leave enough space so that you can still open and close the clip., You will need two electrodes made from an non-reactive material that conducts electricity well. An optimum choice is platinum, but if you don’t have platinum electrodes lying around, you can use graphite. Shave the wood off of two pencils to make two graphite rods. These rods will make great electrodes. Clip one to each alligator clip inside the tub."

Shave an old candle.,Pour cold water in a large drinking glass.,
Place the wax in a science test tube.,
Heat the wax next to a bunsen burner by holding the test tube with tongs.,
Place the science test tube in the cold water.,
Understand why it happens.",How to Make Wax Explode," Find an old candle that is not used around the house. Peel and shave the candle into small shavings.
,, Pack it neatly with your fingers., Allow the wax to heat up and melt, but do not let the wax boil. Heat the wax until the test tube forms a small amount of vapor and smoke in the bottom of the tube., The wax will immediately explode., When the test tube is placed in the cold water, the drinking glass starts to create these tiny cracks, causing the water to enter and go in the tube. The water starts to vaporize which makes a micro explosion. When you place the hot wax in the cold water, oxygen supersedes from the tube. "
"
Mix a vinegar solution.,
Invert a test tube over each electrode.,
Connect the alligator clips to a power supply.",How to Prepare Hydrogen and Oxygen by Water Using Acetic Acid2," Add 5 tablespoons (74 ml) of vinegar to 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of water. The resulting solution will be slightly acidic and able to conduct a small amount of electricity. Pour the solution into the tub.You may or may not use all of the solution. Just fill the tub most of the way.

, First, fill two test tubes with water. You can fill them from the tap, or with the water in your tub. Invert each test tube over one of the graphite electrodes and into the water. Be sure not to get any air bubbles in the test tubes. These tubes are meant to collect any hydrogen or oxygen that is formed.You will need to use a clamp to hold the test tubes in place over the rods.

, Connect the alligator clips (the side opposite the electrodes) to either terminal of a 9V battery. This will complete the circuit and allow electricity to flow.However, the current will be limited by the inability of the vinegar solution to conduct well. This will confirm that the acetic acid in vinegar does not promote electrolysis of water.This limitation on current prohibits the water from being split into hydrogen and oxygen.

"
"
Fill the tub with a sodium bicarbonate solution.,
Cover the electrodes.,
Connect the power source.,
Watch bubbles collect at the anode and cathode.",How to Prepare Hydrogen and Oxygen by Water Using Acetic Acid3," Add 1 tbsp (21 g) of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), known as bicarbonate, to 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of water. The baking soda will dissolve into electrolytes in the solution. These electrolytes will increase the amount of current that the water can conduct. , Fill two test tubes up with water from the tap or from the tub. Flip each test tube upside down to cover each electrode. Be sure not to allow any air into the test tubes. The tubes will be collecting the gases that you produce during electrolysis.Use a clamp to hold the test tubes in place over the electrodes.

, Connect one alligator clip to the positive terminal of a 9V battery. Connect the other to the negative terminal. This will create a circuit that allows current to flow through the electrolyte solution., As the current flows through the solution, it will split some of the water molecules. The result will be hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2). The oxygen gas will be attracted to a positive charge and will collect on the anode. The hydrogen gas will be attracted to a negative charge and will collect at the cathode. As the gases collect, they will bubble out of the the water around their respective electrodes and be captured in the test tubes.You will notice that water is being displaced at the top of the test tube and replaced by the gases.
Take note that the tube covering the cathode displaces twice as much water as the tube covering the anode. This is because there are twice as many hydrogen molecules being formed as oxygen molecules.

Pour tonic water into a clear container.,
Shine a black light on the tonic water.,
Don't worry about drinking the tonic water.",How to Make Water Glow1," Believe it or not, plain old tonic water glows under a black light — quite brightly, as well.To get this effect, start by pouring some tonic water into a container where you can see it. You can add it by itself or dilute it with water. However, the more water you add, the dimmer it will glow.


Tonic water is available at most local stores and supermarkets for just a few dollars. Be sure to get tonic water, not club soda or soda water. The bottle should say ""with quinine"" or something similar.;
, All you need to do to get tonic water to glow bright is to illuminate it with a black light. Be sure to dim the lights in the room before you do this or it will be more difficult to see the glowing effect.


Black lights are available from specialty party stores (like Spencer's, etc.) or online. The price for the black light often depends on its size and brightness — basic lights can cost as little as $20 or less., Making tonic water glow with a black light makes it look very strange, but it doesn't make it poisonous, radioactive, or harmful to drink in any other way. However, tonic water is often high in calories and sugar, so enjoy it sparingly.Tonic water glows this way because of tiny chemicals called ""phosphors"" inside the liquid. When ultraviolet light from the black light (which humans can't see) hits the phosphors, they convert it into a form that humans can see, producing the glow."
"
Gather your materials.,
Wrap two pieces of each color cellophane around each flashlight.,
Prepare a white wall in a dark room.",How to Mix Light to Make Colors1," You will need three flashlights, colored cellophane (red, green, and blue), three rubber bands, and a white wall. Try to use similar flashlights. This will help keep the intensity of each light roughly the same.A large sheet of white posterboard or several pieces of white copy paper can be used in place of a white wall.;
, Be sure to cover the lit side of the flashlight and secure it with a rubberband. You should have a red, green, and blue flashlight when you are finished.Test each light to make sure that it is projecting color.

, If you do not have a white wall available, tape a large piece of white paper on the wall. You could also use several sheets of white copy paper taped to the wall. Be sure that the room’s lights are turned off and the windows are covered.The room should be as dark as possible.

Combine the ingredients in the container.,
Stir the ingredients.,
Place the container in the refrigerator.,
Check back on the container after about 3 hours.",How to Make Your Own Crystals1," Add about a half cup(120mL) of Epsom salt (magnesium sulfide) with equal parts hot water.This will create a saturated solution. A solution is considered saturated when no more solids can be dissolved into the liquid.
Add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture if you want your crystals to have some color.;
, Use a spoon to stir the mixture until the salt is dissolved. It should only take about a minute. If some of the salt crystals are left in the bottom it is still going to work so don't worry about it.

, Cooling the mixture rapidly will help the crystals to form more quickly. Water can dissolve more salt when the temperature of the water is higher.Since there is less room for the salt when the water cools, the salt will revert back to a crystal form as it cools. The salt molecules that are moving around in the liquid will try to stick together. When they do they will form together in a pattern. This is how crystals occur.

, You should have a nice collection of crystal needles forming. You can scoop the crystal out with a spoon and take a closer look, or pour out the remaining liquid. The crystals will be very fragile, so handle them with care.

Purchase and test out highlighters to see if they glow.,
Fill a clear container with water.,
Take the ink tube out of the highlighter.,
Place the felt stick and ink tube into the jar.,
Shine a black light at the water.",How to Make Water Glow2," Not all highlighters have the glow-in-the-dark quality produced under a blacklight, so draw with them on white paper first and run a black light over to see if they do.


You can use any color, but yellow is the most likely to glow in the dark consistently.
Any brand of highlighter should work, but you can try neon colored markers of a non-highlighter variety as well.
It is easiest to see if they glow in a room that is completely dark, allowing for no light pollution.

, Tonic water isn't the only substance that contains light-producing phosphors — plain old highlighter markers work in a similar way as well. Start (as before) by filling a clear container like a glass jar with water.


Note that this method will ruin your highlighter marker — it won't work when you're done.

, If you just drop a highlighter into a jar of water, it won't bleed ink very quickly through the strip of felt at the tip. Instead, you'll want to take the entire ink tube out. To do this:Uncap the highlighter.
Use a pair of pliers (or your hands if you don't mind getting messy) to pull the felt out of the tip.
Use pliers to pry off the bottom of the marker.
Carefully pull the ink tube out, taking care not to spill or mark your clothing.

, Drop the felt, the ink tube, and any other ink you can get out of the marker into the water. The ink should bleed into the water, changing its color. Cut or break the ink tube if needed to get the ink out. Mix the water well so that the color is even.


You can leave the ink tube and felt in the water when the ink is done mixing or you can fish them out — it's up to you.

, Just like with the tonic water method above, a dark room and a black light will make the highlighter ink in the water glow brightly. You can also tape a flashlight to the bottom of the container to make a colored light (however, the ""neon"" effect you'd get with a black light is lost.)Unlike tonic water, the glowing water from this method is not safe to drink.

Find fluorescent paint at a craft store.,
Pour the paint into a cup of water.,
Mix the paint thoroughly.,
Test the water.",How to Make Water Glow3," The paint must be a tempera or water-soluble base so that it will mix with the water. You can even purchase glow-in-the-dark craft paint for an added glow.


Similar to highlighters, any neon color of paint will work, but lemon yellow and lime green are the most effective.

, To increase the glow the water will put out, use as much paint as you are able. Several tablespoons can be used for a single cup of water.

, Use a stirring stick or a similar tool — not a kitchen spoon. Make sure that the paint is completely dissolved into your cup of water before proceeding.


Warm or hot water will help to dissolve the paint faster.
If you let the water sit for a long time, the paint may begin to separate. Prepare this glow water for use immediately after stirring.

, Turn off all the lights in the room and run a black light over your glow water. Be careful when handling this type of glowing water — since it contains paint, it can cause major stains in fabric.This mixture is not safe to drink.

Fill a container with water and grab your materials.,
Crack your glowstick(s).,
Pour the glowing contents into the water.,
Add hydrogen peroxide and dish soap (optional.),
Shake and enjoy!",How to Make Water Glow4," In this method, you'll use water, glow sticks, and several other common ingredients to make water that doesn't need a black light to glow. As in the methods above, start by filling a clear container, like a bottle or jar, with water. You'll also need a few other things before you get started:


One or more glow sticks
Scissors
Dish soap
Hydrogen peroxide
Waterproof gloves

, Take each glowstick, find the glass vial within, and bend the stick until you feel a ""crack."" The tube should immediately begin to glow — this will be easiest to see if the lights are off. Repeat this for each glow stick. The more glow sticks you use, the brighter your water will be.


Glow sticks are available at party stores and many department stores (especially around Halloween.) They are generally very cheap — a 100-pack can cost as little as $12.Try to find the largest glowsticks available, so that your water can offer the most luminescence as possible.

, Put your gloves on. Using your scissors, carefully cut off the tip of each glow stick and pour the glowing liquid within into the water. Mix the water and the glowing liquid.


Be careful — remember that each glow stick contains broken glass.

, Your water should now be glowing, but with a few extra ingredients, you can make it even better. Measure out a few capfuls of hydrogen peroxide and pour them into the mixture, then squirt in about a half-teaspoon of ordinary dish soap (e.g., Palmolive, Ajax, etc.)


The two chemicals in a glow stick are diphenyl oxalate (in the plastic tube) and hydrogen peroxide (in the inner glass vial.)When you crack the tube, the glass vial breaks and the two chemicals mix, producing light. Adding extra hydrogen peroxide is the same as adding more of the chemical in the glass vial, which makes the reaction brighter. Dish soap contains chemicals that reduce the surface tension of the water, making it easier for the hydrogen peroxide and the diphenyl oxalate to mix.

, When you're finished, seal your container and shake it (or just stir it) to make sure that all the ingredients have mixed. When you're done, your water will glow with or without a black light (though a black light can enhance the effect.)


This mixture is not safe to drink.

Tie a piece of sugarless puffed cereal to the end of a thread.,
Rub a comb or inflated balloon with a piece of wool.,
Bring the comb or balloon near the piece of cereal.,
Try the experiment with other materials.",How to Make Static Electricity1," You can actually test how well certain objects develop electrical charges (static) by making a homemade electroscope.To make a simple electroscope, tie a piece of puffed sugarless cereal to a thread and hang the thread off something such as a table or paper towel rack.;
, Plastic combs and wool are two of the more common household objects that hold a great static charge. Since wool is a great way to develop a charge with plastic materials, you can rub the wool against the comb or balloon to develop a charge. Rub the two materials together for ten to fifteen seconds.You may want to mark the portion of the plastic material you’re rubbing because the strongest ionization (movement of electrons in the atoms which is the cause of static) will be at this point., After charging the comb or balloon, slowly bring the spot you rubbed toward the cereal. When you get close enough, the material will start attracting the cereal.Since the materials are insulators, you can turn the object so the far side of the object from the charged side faces the cereal, and the attraction will cease.You can do this same test with a slow steady trickle of water such as with a faucet. Holding the charged spot of the balloon near the stream will pull the water slightly toward the balloon., Many other common things around the home are great for creating static. Dry human hair, dry human skin, leather, fur, glass, nylon, wool, and aluminum all shed electrons easily.Additionally, teflon, silicon, vinyl (PVC), polyurethane, styrene (styrofoam), polyester, gold, brass, silver, copper, and hard rubber all gather loose electrons easily.Try rubbing objects from the first category against objects from the second category, and then test which ones create the most static.


For instance, most people know that rubbing a balloon against your hair will create static. Notice that dry human hair comes from the first category and that rubber—which is the actual material from which latex balloons are made—is in the second category.

Position the flashlights so that they project all three colors.,
Turn off the red flashlight.,
Repeat the previous step by turning off the blue flashlight.,
Repeat a third time by turning off the green flashlight.",How to Mix Light to Make Colors2," The colors should overlap in a triangular fashion. Position one color as the top of the triangle and the other two colors as the base of the triangle. You should see each individual color and also a white center where the lights are mixed.


Your brain perceives light differently than pigments such as paint. When you mix primary pigments together you get a darker color. When you mix primary lights together you get a lighter color., You are now mixing just the blue and green lights. You should see a cyan color where the blue and green lights overlap., Remember to turn the red flashlight back on. You are now mixing the red and green lights. You should see a yellow color where the red and green lights overlap.You may not have expected that a mixture of red and green lights would create a yellow color. The same receptors in your eyes that see yellow are stimulated when you shine a red and green light., Remember to turn the blue flashlight back on. Now you are mixing the red and blue lights. You should see a magenta color where the red and blue lights overlap."
"
Alter the experiment by using different color paper.,
Use colored water instead of cellophane.,
Use stage lights to mix colors.,
Use glow sticks to mix colors.",How to Mix Light to Make Colors3," Instead of taping white paper to a wall, try taping blue paper to the wall. Repeat this experiment with red, green, and yellow paper., You can conduct the same light mixing experiment by shining the flashlights (without cellophane) through colored water. Use food coloring to make red, green, and blue water. Shine the flashlights through the side of the cups to project the light on a wall.Be sure to use glass or clear plastic cups.

, Stage lights allow you to adjust the brightness. Use red, green, and blue stage light filters to mix colors. Throughout this experiment, adjust the brightness of the light to create different hues., Cut off the tops of red, green, and blue glow sticks and pour the contents into three separate plastic cups. Lay down a black garbage bag. With a plastic pipette mix one drop of two of the colors on the garbage bag. Notice what happens when you mix red and green, green and blue, and blue and red.


This experiment works best in a darkened room.
The contents of glow sticks are not toxic, but general precautions should be taken to prevent ingestion or excessive skin contact."
"
Tie a string around a butter knife or similar object.,
Boil some water and add the ingredients.,
Pour the mixture into your container carefully.,
Balance the string over the opening of the container.,
Store the container.",How to Make Your Own Crystals2," Make the string so it hangs an inch or so above the bottom of the container or jar that you will use to make crystals.


You can also try to suspend a lollipop or popsicle stick. It makes a good handle if you plan to eat your project when it's done.

, Stir three cups (660g) of sugar into one cup (240mL) of boiling water.Add some food coloring to give your crystals some color.

, Be sure the container is completely clean so your sugar crystals do not latch on to any leftover food fragments or dirt in the container instead of your string.

, Place the knife over the top of the container so the string hangs down. The string should hang into the mixture, but do not let the string touch the bottom of the jar because the crystals with grow there instead of the string.

, Find a safe place to store the container for a couple weeks. You should look for someplace that is clean and where the container won't get knocked around. You can place it in a box on the top of your refrigerator, or an unused shelf of a kitchen cabinet.

Collect some hot water in a jar.,
Dissolve a crystal chemical in hot water until the solution is saturated.,
Filter the solution.,
Place a small amount of the saturated solution on a plate.,
Suspend the seed crystal in a clean jar.,
Pour the saturated solution into the container with crystal seed.,
Refresh the solution every two weeks.,
Coat the surface of the crystal with a lacquer.",How to Make Your Own Crystals3," Collect approximately 100mL (.44 cups) of hot water. The water doesn't need to be boiling. Tap water will work fine. Just leave the tap on for a minute until the water is very hot.


To get the purest crystals, begin with a hot solution and allow it to cool slowly by leaving it at room temperature. This slow process will allow the crystal to reject any impurities as the molecules are arranged., The solution will be saturated when it can no longer dissolve more crystals. You will probably need about 60 grams (2.1oz.) of chemical. Add more until the crystal no longer dissolve. There are a number of chemicals you can select depending on the color of crystal you want to make. Some of the chemicals, like borax, may be around your house or at the local grocery store. Other ingredients are available to order online.


Borax can be used to produce clear crystals. Copper sulfate can be used to create bright blue crystals.
Purple chrome alum can be used to create purple crystals., Pouring the solution through a filter will help to get rid of any excess crystals that could not be dissolved in the solution. Take a plastic funnel and place a coffee filter in the funnel.Then pour the solution into a separate container through the funnel. Now you should have a clear solution with no crystals floating around in the liquid.

, Leave it for 24 hours. Once you have some small crystals scrape them off the plate with a butter knife. You can use these small crystals as seeds to produce larger crystals.

, You can poke two small holes in the lid and tie one end around the seed crystal and tie the other end to the top of the jar.


The container should be clean so the crystals attach to your seed crystal and not the container.
Pick any container that has a good cover that seals. Or make a cover by suspending your crystal from a flat piece of cardboard.

, Watch and wait as the solution evaporates and your crystal grows larger.


Be patient. It can take weeks to grow a large crystal. Keep the object in a cool, shaded area. Make sure it is someplace where the container won't be moved or disturbed too often.

, Over time, small crystals will begin to form in the solution, so it will be necessary to put your seed crystals into a new container.


Remove the seed crystals and place them on a paper towel.
Pour the solution through a coffee filter into the new container.
Scrape out any crystals in the old container. You can save them and use them as seed crystals for the next time you want to grow a crystal.
If you need more solution, dissolve some more crystal powder in hot water and add the solution to your new container.

, To protect the crystal from being destroyed by exposure to moisture, cover the crystal with a coat of lacquer. Use a brush to apply an even coat over the entire surface.


You can also try coating the surface with a layer of nail polish to protect it."

Sit in a plastic desk chair.,
Avoid contact with steel components.,
Scoot back and forth in your chair for about thirty seconds.,
Stand up carefully without touching any metal.,
Reach out and touch your target.",How to Make Static Electricity2," Polyurethane is a popular material for many desk chairs, especially in classrooms, and the material quite easily gains a negative electric charge.Have a seat in one of these plastic desk chairs.


Though plastic chairs are some of the more common polyurethane items we interact with, you can achieve similar results by sliding down dry plastic slides in a park or other comparable interactions.

, Contact with components such as the steel legs of the chair will give you a ground, which means that as you try to build the charge, it will flow evenly out of you rather than building up. Avoiding contact with the grounded components will help you retain the charge.

, Friction between the objects transferring electrons will speed up the process, so start scooting around in the chair. For best results, also go side to side, keeping your back against the chair.

, After scooting around for several seconds, you will likely have a built-up electrical charge. If you feel the static attraction as you peel away from the chair and hear crackles as you stand up, this is a good sign!

, Now that you’re positively charged, you’re ready to reach out and zap something. If the target is yourself, you can touch any conductive material, such as a metal doorknob."

Find a carpet or rug.,
Rub your feet against it while wearing socks.,
Reach out and touch your victim.",How to Make Static Electricity3," Polypropylene and polyester are common materials in rugs and carpeting.This makes carpeting containing these materials great for gaining negative electrical charges., The same as with other methods, friction between the items will help you build up an electrical charge. Continue rubbing for approximately thirty seconds.


Socks made of materials that easily gain positive charges will work even better. Try wearing wool socks.As with most static experiments, this works even better during dry winter months because humidity helps to eliminate static.

, The closer your victim is to you, the better. You'll lose the charge if you have to move around too much. You should also avoid touching any metal, or you'll end up shocking yourself instead.

Understand atoms as the base units of elements.,
Learn what atoms are made of.,
Learn the electrical charge of atomic particles.,
Understand the structure of an atom.,
Learn what an ion is.,
Understand what causes the static electricity.,
Learn the objects most likely to transfer electrons.",How to Make Static Electricity4," Everything we interact with on a daily basis is made of atoms. Atoms are the base unit of every element on the periodic table—meaning breaking any pure element such as gold or oxygen into smaller pieces would make it no longer the respective element., Every atom from hydrogen to uranium is composed of atomic particles called electrons, protons, and neutrons. What makes each element different is simply the number of each particle inside the atom., One of the things that sets the types of atomic particles apart is the electrical charge of each. Electrons have a negative electrical charge, whereas protons have a positive charge and neutrons have a neutral charge.The charge of each particle is balanced such that atoms with equal numbers of protons and electrons have an overall neutral charge from the two having each other out., Another thing that sets the atomic particles apart is their location in the atom. Protons and neutrons are tightly bound together at the center of every atom is what is called the nucleus of the atom. Electrons, however, are arranged in rings that revolve in high speeds around the nucleus.This makes it much easier for an atom to lose electrons from the outermost ring encircling it than it does for the atom to lose the protons housed in the nucleus., When an atom sheds electrons, it’s always by losing them to another atom. When an atom loses electrons, that means the atom then has more protons in the nucleus than electrons around it. This results in an overall positive charge to the atom. Inversely, the atom that gains the electrons from the shedding atom then has more electrons revolving around it than protons in the nucleus, and this means an overall negative charge. Charged atoms are called ions., You can think of ions as similar to magnets. Oppositely charged ions attract (and ions of the same charge repel each other) the same way that opposite poles of magnets attract one another (and like poles repel one another). Static electricity is simply the discharge caused by the imbalance in the positive and negative charges in atoms.You can see examples of both the attraction and repulsion forces with the standard static balloon experiment. Blow up a balloon and rub a side of it against your hair for ten seconds. The rubbing causes your hair to shed electrons into the balloon. Your positively charged hair stands up because each positively charged atom in the cells of your hair repel one another. You can then take the negatively charged balloon and hold it to the wall. It will stick to the neutrally charged wall via forces of attraction until enough of the extra electrons have dispersed into the wall to negate the force., Now that you know the process that leads to the electrical imbalances which cause static electricity, you just need to know what objects mostly easily build such a charge.


Certain objects are much more prone to shedding electrons. As mentioned, dry human hair is one. Other materials in this category include: dry human skin, leather, fur, glass, nylon, wool, and aluminum.Materials that easily collect loose electrons include: teflon, silicon, vinyl (PVC), polyurethane, styrene (styrofoam), polyester, gold, brass, silver, copper, and hard rubber.This means that causing friction by rubbing items from the first category against items from the second category is a great way to charge each. This is why polyester clothing has so much static cling and why certain combs cause hair static."

Gather the necessary materials.,
Spray the bread with water.,
Seal the bread in the plastic bag.,
Store the bread in a damp, warm area.,
Observe the mold growth.,
Dispose of the bread properly.,
Make multiple samples of moistened bread.,
Vary the amount of moisture on each slice of bread.,
Place each bagged bread sample in a different temperature.,
Store each bagged sample in areas with different varying light levels.",How to Make Mold Grow on Bread," To grow mold on bread you will need to collect the following materials: a slice of bread (any kind), a sealable plastic bag, a spray bottle, and water. You can use any type of bread, but know that store-bought sandwich bread contains preservatives and will take longer to grow mold. Fresh bread will grow mold faster.A spray bottle is not entirely necessary, but it is an easy way to evenly coat the bread in a fine mist of water.
Fill the spray bottle with water before beginning the experiment.
If you don’t have a plastic bag, you can replace it with some other sealable clear container. You want it to be clear so you can observe the mold growth and sealable to contain the mold. An old plastic or glass jar would also work.;
, Using the spray bottle, lightly spray the piece of bread with a coat of mist. You don’t want the bread to be soaked, you just want there to be some moisture to stimulate the growth of the mold. One spray is sufficient.Alternative methods for keeping the environment moist include:

Placing a wet paper towel in the plastic bag with the bread.
Sprinkling some water over the top of the piece of bread.
Spraying the inside of the bag instead of directly on the bread.



, Place your moistened piece of bread into the plastic bag and seal it closed. For the remainder of the experiment you’ll want to keep this bag sealed to avoid exposing yourself to the mold spores that will grow on the bread.If you have allergies, you might not want to do this experiment as it may cause you difficulty.

, Mold thrives in warm environments with moisture in the air.Find a warm place in your home and store the sealed bread here. You’ve already supplied sufficient moisture to the bread for growth.


Mold does not need sunlight to create food; it gets food from the bread itself. This is why mold often grows in dark, damp areas such as basements.

, Make daily observations of your bread and track the growth of mold. It should take around 7-10 days before you will be able to see significant growth on the bread. You could see growth as soon as 5 days depending on the type of bread you used. Remember, fresh bread will mold faster than store-bought bread containing preservatives.If you notice the bread has dried out, you may need to add more water. If this is the case, wear rubber gloves and a mask to protect yourself from being exposed to the mold spores.

, When you are finished observing the growth of the mold, dispose of the sealed container in the garbage. Do not open the bag. Opening the bag can release mold spores into your environment that are not good for your health.


Wash your hands every time after you have handled the bag.

, To test various growth conditions for mold, you will need multiple samples. Moisten as many pieces of bread necessary to test your conditions. Place each one in a separate bag.


For example, if you want to test three different temperatures, make three samples.
Before each experiment, make some predictions about what will happen. Make a hypothesis about how quickly the mold will grow under each condition. Write down whether you think there will be more or less mold for each condition at the end of the experiment.

, Keep all other conditions the same (temperature and amount of light), but add different levels of moisture. Have one slice with no moisture, one slice that is just damp, and one slice that is soaked in water.

Check the samples daily to see if the growth of mold is different between the three.

, To test mold growth at different temperatures, store one sample at room temperature, one in the refrigerator, and one in the freezer.


Remember, to minimize variability, you will want to store the room temperature sample in the dark, as the samples in the fridge and the freezer will mostly be in darkness.Check each sample daily and see which piece of bread grows the most mold the fastest.

, If you want to test whether or not light has an effect on the growth of mold, store samples in different light environments. Place one bag in total darkness and another bag in light.


Again, to minimize variability, make sure the temperatures of both environments are the same. If the temperature is also different, you won’t know whether the difference in growth rate is due to the light or the temperature.
Observe your samples daily to check for differences in growth rate and amount.

Heat a pan of water.,
Choose your salt.,
Stir in as much salt as you can.,
Pour the water into a clean jar.,
Add food coloring (optional).,
Tie a string around a pencil.,
Cut the string the correct size to dangle in the water.,
Balance the pencil on top of the glass jar.,
Move the jar to a safe place.,
Wait for crystals to form.",How to Make Salt Crystals1," You only need a little water, about ½ cup (120mL). Heat the water until it just begins to bubble.


Kids should ask an adult for help handling the hot water.
Distilled water gives the best results, but tap water should work fine.;
, There are many kinds of salts. Each one will grow into a different shape of crystal. Try these and see what happens:


Table salt take a few days to grow. ""Iodized"" salt won't work as well, but will still form crystals.Epsom salt grows into smaller, needle-like crystals, but grows more quickly than table salt. Buy it at a pharmacy.
Alum grow quickly, sometimes making visible crystals within a few hours.Find it in the spice section of a grocery store.

, Take the pan off the heat. Pour in about ¼–½ cup (60–120mL) of your salt and stir until the water is clear. If you don't see any salt grains in the water, stir in another spoonful. Keep stirring in more salt until you see salt grains that won't dissolve when you stir.


You've just made a supersaturated solution. This means the solution (the liquid) contains more salt than water can usually hold.

, Carefully pour the hot water into a jar or another clear, heat-safe container. This should be as clean as possible, so nothing interferes with the crystal growth.


Pour slowly and stop before the salt grains fall into the jar. If there are undissolved salt grains in the jar, the crystals might grow around those grains instead of your string.

, A couple drops of food coloring will change the color of your crystals. It might make the crystals smaller or more lumpy as well, but usually not by much.

, The pencil should be long enough to lie across the top of the jar. You can use a popsicle stick or small stick instead.


The tiny grooves and rough edges of the string provide a place for salt to latch on and grow.A fishing line won't work, since it's too smooth.

, Only the part of the string underneath the water will grow crystals. Cut it short enough to avoid touching the base of the jar, or the crystals might end up lumpy and small.

, The string should hang inside the jar, extending into the water. If the pencil won't stay still, tape it against the jar.


Try not to have the string touch the side of the jar. This can make smaller, lumpier crystals grow against the side.

, Keep the container where animals and young children can't get to it. Here are some tips for choosing a location:


To grow a lumpy mass of crystals quickly, keep the jar in the sun and/or keep a fan blowing near it on the lowest setting. These crystals may stop growing at a fairly small size.
If you want a single, large crystal instead of a clump of crystals, keep the jar in a cool, shaded place.Keep it on a Styrofoam pad or similar material to absorb vibrations.(There's still a good chance you'll end up with a clump, but there should be larger individual crystals within it.)
Epsom salt (and a few less common salts) will grow faster in the refrigerator instead of the sun.

, Check back regularly to see if salt crystals have grown on the string. Epsom salt or alum crystals can start growing within a few hours, but might take a couple days. Table salt usually takes a day or two to get started, and sometimes up to a week. Once you see little crystals on the string, those will usually keep growing bigger and bigger over the next couple weeks.


When the water cools, it has way more salt than cold water can normally hold. This makes it very unstable, so the dissolved salt will leave the water and grab onto the string if it gets a tiny push.As the water evaporates, the salt stays behind, making it even more unstable and encouraging the crystal to grow.

Grow a cupful of salt crystals.,
Choose a seed crystal.,
Attach fishing line or smooth wire.,
Create a new solution.,
Add the crystal and solution to a clean container.,
Check on the crystal regularly.,
Protect the finished crystal with nail polish.",How to Make Salt Crystals2," Follow the instructions for the easy method, but use distilled water and do not use a string or pencil. Just leave the salt water in the container. Over the next few days, a layer of small crystals will grow over the base of the container.


Use a flat, shallow, wide container instead of a jar. This makes it easy to get a single crystal that hasn't merged with any others.Epsom salts do not work well for this method. Try alum or table salt instead, or see variations below for more ideas.

, Once the crystals are ready, pour out the liquid and look at the crystals. Pick them up and examine them with a pair of tweezers. Select a ""seed crystal"" that will form the core of your new, larger one. Look for crystals that fit this description (from most to least important):Choose a lone crystal, not in contact with any others.
Choose a crystal with flat, even surfaces and straight edges.
Choose a large crystal (at least the size of a pea).Ideally, find several crystals and set each one up in a separate jar as described below. Crystals often dissolve or fail to grow, so having backups is a good idea.

, Super glue this to one side of the crystal, or tie it around the crystal.


Do not use string or rough wire. You need a smooth surface so the crystals can't grow on the string instead of the crystal.

, Select distilled water and the same type of salt. This time, warm the water only slightly above room temperature. The goal is to make a perfectly saturated solution. An under-saturated solution may dissolve your crystal, while an over-saturated solution will cover the crystal in salt grains and cause a lumpy mass to grow.There are several faster ways to solve this problem, but they are more difficult and may require some knowledge of chemistry., Clean a jar, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water. Pour the new solution into this jar, then hang the crystal into the center. Store it as follows:


Place the jar in a cool, dark location, such as in a low cupboard.
Keep it on a Styrofoam pad or other material that absorbs vibration.
Keep a coffee filter, paper, or thin cloth over the jar to block dust. Do not use an airtight seal.

, The crystal will grow more slowly this time, since a little water will need to evaporate before the salt grains are forced to attach to the crystal. If everything works out, the crystal will keep the same shape as it grows. You can take it out whenever you like, but it will most likely keep growing for several weeks.


About every two weeks, pour the solution through a coffee filter to remove impurities.This is a difficult process. Even experienced crystal growers sometimes have a crystal dissolve or become lumpy. If you have a perfect seed crystal, you might want to test a worse seed crystal first to make sure the solution works out.

, Once your crystal is large enough, remove it from the solution and dry it. Brush a coat or clear nail polish onto all sides to prevent it wearing apart over time."

Try different substances.,
Make a snowflake.,
Create a crystal garden.",How to Make Salt Crystals3," There are many substances that will crystallize using the techniques above. You can buy many of them from chemical supply stores. Here are a few options:


Copper sulfate for blue crystalsChrome alum for purple crystalsCopper acetate monohydrate for dark, blue-green crystalsWarning: These chemicals may cause harm when inhaled, ingested, or handled with bare hands. Read the safety information on the label and do not allow children to handle them unsupervised.

, Tie several pipe cleaners or rough wires together in a star shape. Lower these into your salt solution, and watch small crystals coat the star and turn it into a sparkling snowflake., Instead of making a single crystal, why not create a cupful? Make your salt solution, then pour over cut up sponges or charcoal briquettes in the base of the container. Stir in a little vinegar, and watch crystal formations grow overnight.Pour enough to saturate the sponges without submerging them.
To make different colors of crystals, add a drop of food coloring to each sponge.

Suspend the mobile.",How to Make a Solar System Mobile," If you want to use this for a school project, you cannot just turn in a mobile and barely know the names of the planets.


Learn the planet's names and order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Some models may include Pluto as a planet, but scientists have recently classified this celestial body as a Dwarf Planet. Make sure you have some information on the sun, which is the center of our solar system.;
, It is best to have everything laid out in front of you as you are doing this project. You will need styrofoam balls in the following sizes: 5, 4, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, and 1.25 inches. You will need two each of the 1.5 and 1.25 inch balls.
You will also need a styrofoam sheet that is .5 inches and 5 x 5 inches. This is what you will use to make Saturn's rings.
Get acrylic craft paints in the following colors: Red, orange, yellow, green, blue-green, dark blue, cobalt blue, light blue, white and black. You will paint your planets with these colors.

, You can find these items at the craft store along with your other materials. You will need a wooden dowel that is 1/4 inch in diameter and 30 inches long. You will suspend your planets from this using string.
Obtain a skein of black yarn or string. This is what you will use to hang your planets from the dowel.
Get some thick white craft glue to help secure the planets onto the strings.
If you don't have a hook to screw into the ceiling to suspend your mobile, you will need to get one as well.

, You will also want to have these readily available during construction. Get a pair of scissors and a serrated or x-acto knife. You will need the scissors to cut string and the x-acto knife to cut out the rings for Saturn.
Warning: never let a child use the x-acto knife. An adult should help with this.
Get a jar or cup with a 3 inch diameter, and another with a 4 inch diameter. You will need to use these to trace onto the styrofoam sheet to make Saturn's rings.
You will need a teaspoon to help smooth out the styrofoam.

, These will help you in painting the planets. Get at least 8 wood skewers. These can be the kind you use for kebabs.
You will stick these into the styrofoam balls to act as a handle for less messy painting of your planets.
Find a couple of plastic cups for water and paint.
Obtain a stiff paintbrush for painting the planets.

, This will help you paint them. Don't stick the skewer all the way through the ball.
Just put it through about halfway.
Set them aside in the following order: 5 inch, 1.25 inch, 1.5 inch, 1.5 inch, 1.25 inch, 4 inch, 3 inch, 2.5 inch, and 2 inch.

, You will need to trace circles on the styrofoam sheet to do this. Trace the diameter of the 4 inch jar onto the center of the styrofoam sheet with a pencil or pen.
Center the 3 inch jar in the 4 inch ring you just traced. Trace around the edge of the 3 inch jar with a pencil or pen.
Cut the styrofoam ring out, using an x-acto knife by following along your traced lines.
Never let a child use the x-acto or serrated knife. An adult should always do this step.
Smooth out the edges of the rings using the rounded side of the teaspoon.

, You can do this by painting the styrofoam balls with the craft paint. Hold each planet by the skewer handle as you do this for a less messy craft.Put out your paints in plastic cups, and fill a cup halfway with water to rinse your paintbrush.
Paint the 5 inch ball bright yellow. This will be the sun.






Pick up your next ball. It should be 1.25 inches and will represent Mercury. Paint this one orange.






Paint the next ball (1.5 inches) blue-green. This will represent Venus.






Paint the next ball (1.5 inches) dark blue, and add green continents. This will be Earth.






Mars should be painted red. This will be the next 1.25 inch ball.







, These planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. Paint the 4 inch ball with orange with red and white stripes. This will be Jupiter. Add the Great Red Spot on Jupiter in the correct area with red paint.
Paint the 3 inch ball yellow and the styrofoam ring orange. This will be Saturn.






Get the 2.5 inch ball and paint it light blue. This will represent Neptune.






Get the 2 inch ball and paint it cobalt blue to represent Uranus.






Paint the dowel rod black.







, They will need to be 100% dry before you hang them on the mobile. Stick the pointed end of the skewer handles from the planets in a large jar and let the planets dry without touching.
Clean up your area a little bit while they dry.
You can clean your paintbrush, get rid of your paint cups and water, and scraps from cutting the rings from Saturn.

, Saturn is more complicated than the other planets due to its rings. Line the inner rim of the orange painted ring with craft glue.
Push the yellow painted 3 inch styrofoam ball into the ring, taking care not to split the styrofoam ring.
Set it aside to dry while you construct the rest of the mobile.

, You will need to cut these at different lengths so the planets hang at different levels. Cut the string for the sun the shortest. Make it about 4 inches.
Cut the next string two inches longer so the planet will hang a little bit lower. If you cut the string for the sun at 4 inches you would cut the string for Mercury at 6 inches.
As you go along, cut each string 2 inches longer. Uranus should thus hang the lowest of all the planets on the mobile.

, You will need to do this to hang the planets from the dowel rod. Remove the skewer from each planet.
Tie a knot at the end of each string.
Glue the knotted end of each string into the skewer hole on the planet.
Remember to glue the smallest string into the sun and the next longest into Mercury and so on. The longest string goes with Uranus.
Let the glue dry.

, The sun should be first on the left end of the dowel. Keep the planets a good distance apart. You don't want them to touch as they hang.
Secure the string or yarn on the dowel with a dot of glue.
Let this dry.

, You will hang it using more of the black yarn or string. Tie a long piece of string to each end of the dowel rod and secure with glue.
Suspend the dowel from the strings, playing with the lengths on either end.
Make sure the dowel is suspended horizontally, then tie the two strings attached to the ends of the dowel together tightly.
Use the remaining ends of the strings to tie the mobile to a hook in the ceiling.

Dab a small brush or cotton swab into the solution.,
Write your message on white paper.,
Allow the “ink” to dry.,
Consider steaming the page.When you write your message on the page, the watery “ink” will warp the paper, leaving marks that are visible even after the paper dries.,
Consider writing a decoy message on the dry paper in pen or pencil.If your message is intercepted before delivery, an empty page would look suspicious.",How to Make Invisible Ink with Baking Soda1," Making a solution suitable for invisible ink will take almost equal parts baking soda and water. For the best results, you want to mix as much baking soda as you can into a small bowl of water. Add a little baking soda at a time and mix slowly to fully saturate the water.


1/4 cup (60 mL) of water will hold 3 tbsp. (45 mL) of baking soda.If your “ink” has deposits of baking soda that won’t dissolve, the solution is over saturated. Just work backwards: add a little water at a time until the baking soda dissolves completely.;
, Treat the baking soda mixture as you would ink or watercolor paint and load up only a little of the solution at a time.

, Using the brush or swab, write your message in clear block letters on a piece of paper. Make sure you write your letters large enough to be legible. The water will bleed into the paper, distorting the letters, so practice using your brush or swab ahead of time.


Consider writing your message in code for added security. For example, a simple substitution code replaces each letter of the alphabet with another letter or a number in a pattern set ahead of time.
A regular index card makes a great surface for short messages.

, You want the message to dry without leaving signs that the paper has been tampered with. For better results, try the following:


Press the page between heavy books or other weights. Add a few pieces of paper above and below the page carrying the message so excess moisture does not ruin the books that you use for weight.
Hang the paper. Photographers hang developing prints to let them dry because gravity will help keep the paper from warping. You can use the same trick by using clothes pegs to hang your message.
If you use a heavy, high-quality paper or card stock to carry your message, the thicker paper will warp less than standard copier paper.

, By lightly steaming the page, you can hide all evidence that the paper has been tampered with, which increases the chance your message will go undetected. There are two good methods for steaming your secret message:


Boil water in an electric kettle or a large pot and hold the page near the rising steam. Steam is extremely hot (hotter than boiling water) so use kitchen tongs or a similar utensil to hold the page.
Use an iron on the lowest steam setting. Keep your fingers safe from the steam and lightly iron the page.
If you do steam the page, be sure to use one of the advanced drying methods listed above.

, After all, who would go through the trouble of delivering a blank piece of paper? By writing a decoy message on the page, you can throw enemies off your trail. For instance:


Writing a grocery list over your secret message is a classic spy trick. Nobody suspects the humble shopping list.
If you plan on revealing your secret message with a liquid method (grape or red cabbage juice), don’t write your decoy message in pen! The ink from the pen will bleed across the page when you apply the wash.

Swirl the water-filled bottle in circles.",How to Make a Tornado in a Bottle," Leave two inches of air at the top of the bottle. The size of the bottle doesn't matter – but the bigger the bottle, the bigger the tornado. The bigger the tornado, the easier it will be to observe the effects on the water.If you are only making a one-bottle tornado, you can use a plastic water bottle or a clear glass canning jar.If you are making a larger two-bottle tornado, try using a pair of two-liter soda bottles.
Try experimenting with more or less water. Record whether the amount of water has any effect on the size and speed of the tornado.;
, Two squirts from a bottle of concentrated soap will do. You can also use oil, or anything hydrophilic (that repels water).Don't try to use other cleaning products like bleach or non-liquid soap. Do not use laundry detergent: it is designed to interact differently with water than dish soap.Try experimenting the amount of dish-washing soap, or the brand of dish-washing soap. See if a particular brand works better than another, or if more or less soap makes a difference.

, This step is optional, but it may make it easier to see the tornado in action. Alternately, add food coloring for flair. If you're using a large bottle, try putting a few plastic Monopoly houses into the water to simulate the ""houses"" that are being picked up the tornado., If you are making a one-bottle tornado, you just need to twist the cap and seal it shut. If you are making a two-bottle tornado, you'll need to find a watertight way to fix the openings so that they face one another. Try using superglue, caulk, duct tape, or a large rubber band., The trick won't work well unless the container is completely airtight. Test the cap with your hand.

, Hold it by the top or the bottom, and use your wrist to shake the water in a loose circular vortex. After a few seconds of spinning, you should see the water begin to swirl in the center. This is your ""tornado."" Ask questions:


Why is it spinning?Is the tornado spinning clockwise or counterclockwise?
How does the glitter interact with the tornado?

, Try spinning the bottle slower or faster. Try spinning it upside down. Observe whether changing the spin pattern has any effect on how the tornado looks.

, It is responding to ""centripetal force"" – an inward-facing force that pulls an object or liquid toward the center of its circular path.In this case, the water is spinning around the ""center"" of the vortex, which happens to be the center of the bottle because the bottle defines the size of the ""body of water."", The connection should be airtight and watertight. Set the bottles upright so that the bottom of the full bottle is sitting on the ground or table, and the bottom of the empty bottle is sticking straight up into the air. Be sure to leave an inch or two of air at the top of the ""full"" bottle.

, Think of it like the motion of flipping an hourglass. The bottom bottle should now be empty of water, and the top bottle should be full of water. Hold the bottles for support – the contraption will be top-heavy!

, The air pressure in the now-top bottle is lower than the air pressure in the now-bottom bottle, so there should not be much water flowing between the mouths of the bottles.

, If you gently spin the water-filled bottle on top, water should begin to pour again. This should create a vortex or ""tornado"" in the center of the water-filled bottle as the liquid flows from a space of low pressure to a space of high pressure.

, You will want to use several potatoes in order to make enough magic mud. However, there is not set amount of potatoes that need to be used. Use the food processor to chop the potatoes into very small pieces. If a food processor is not available, use a knife to cut the potatoes into very small pieces.Make sure that an adult is available to help with the chopping.
The potatoes may be peeled or unpeeled. Either way will work.

, Using the saucepan or kettle, heat up about six cups of water. Make sure that it is enough water to cover the potatoes that you just chopped. You can add more water later if necessary., Using a large spoon, stir the potatoes around in the water. You will notice that the water starts to change colors. Stir the potatoes for about two minutes., Place the strainer over another large mixing bowl. Pour the potato water mixture into the strainer. The water will fall into the bowl below the strainer and the potatoes will remain in the strainer. Let the water set for ten minutes. You can now discard the potatoes, or better yet, use them in a recipe.You will notice that the water will start to separate into a white layer on the bottom and a water layer on top.

, You can discard this water into the sink or the dirty mixing bowl. You will be left with the white layer in the mixing bowl. You can repeat this rinsing process by adding fresh water to the white goop, letting it set for ten minutes, and then discarding the water from the top of the white goop., The white goop that you are left with is potato starch. It will act a lot like the cornstarch mixture. It will act firm when you try to mold it but will be liquidy when you apply pressure."

Avoid eating the magic mud.,
Designate a space for magic mud.,
Use all tools cautiously.",How to Make Magic Mud4," Even though some recipes use kitchen ingredients, they are not being prepared for consumption. Magic mud is meant to be used as an experiment and a toy, not a snack. Supervise young children so that they do not consume the magic mud.

, Ideally, you will do these experiments outside. Magic mud can get rather messy. If doing the experiment outside isn’t an option, lay down a piece of plastic or cardboard to do the experiment on. This will make cleanup much easier., When cutting potatoes, be cautious. Knives and food processors are both dangerous if they aren’t used properly. Let an adult do the cutting, or do the cutting under the supervision of an adult."

Expose your message to a source of heat.,
Be careful to avoid catching your page on fire.Paper is flammable, and holding your page close to direct heat means a chance for accidental flames.,
Slowly heat your page carrying the secret message.,
Read the message that appears in brown letters on the page.",How to Make Invisible Ink with Baking Soda2," It takes a good amount of heat to oxidize the carbon in the baking soda enough to reveal your message, which means you need a safe but strong source of direct heat. Several household heating elements can work.For example:


An incandescent light bulb works. You will need to hold the message near a hot bulb for several minutes to heat the baking soda enough.
A traditional stove is another idea. Be careful holding a piece of paper too close to hot coils, which could also start a fire.
Hair dryers can be turned up to a high heat and waved evenly over the page.
A dry iron can reveal the letters of your message as well. Avoid using a steam setting and draw the hot iron over your paper slowly and evenly.You could place your message on a baking try and put it in an oven set to 250 degrees, checking every few minutes for your letters to appear.
Laying your page on an old-fashioned radiator or the top of a toaster can work too.Pay attention to the paper at all times to reduce the risk of accidental flames.

, Choose the method of heating you feel safest with and avoid using any open flames if possible.


Halogen bulbs emit more heat than standard incandescent bulbs and increase the risk of fire.
Stoves will heat up slowly but eventually become very hot. Use kitchen tongs to hold your message and avoid getting the paper too close to the coils.

, Whatever method you use for heating the page containing the invisible ink, work slowly to ensure you heat the paper only as much as necessary.


Move your page over the heat source to avoid one place on the paper from getting too hot.It can take several minutes for your letters to appear, depending on the amount of heat you apply, the thickness and texture of the paper, and the saturation of the ""ink"" you made., As the paper warms up, your message will reappear on the page as though being burned into the paper itself. The letters appear brown because the carbon in the baking soda is oxidized more rapidly than normal by the heat.Oxidation is the same reason the flesh of an apple turns brown after sitting out.

Thaw grape juice concentrate in a bowl.,
Dab or wash the grape juice concentrate over the page.Dip a sponge or paintbrush into the concentrate and wash the new “decoder ink” evenly over the page that contains your message.,
Read the message that appears in gray letters on the page.",How to Make Invisible Ink with Baking Soda3," The best grape juice to use for revealing your invisible ink is the concentrated kind, which often comes frozen.Concentrated juice contains more acid and will create a stronger reaction with the baking soda in the invisible ink.


You can use any dark, acidic liquid such as cherry or blackcurrant juice or balsamic vinegar to reveal your message.,


Be careful painting with grape juice; it stains.
Don’t use the same cotton swab or paintbrush you used to write the message.

, As you paint over the surface of the paper, your letters will reappear before your eyes. The letters appear gray because a chemical reaction occurs between the basic baking soda and acidic grape juice."

Boil two cups of water.,
Soak red cabbage leaves in the hot water.,
Strain out the cabbage leaves.,
Dab or wash the red cabbage juice over the page.,
Read the message that appears in blue letters.",How to Make Invisible Ink with Baking Soda4," Using a stovetop kettle, electric teapot, or microwave, heat up around two cups of water. The water does not need to be boiling hot; however, the hotter the water is, the better your concentrated “decoder ink” will work.

, Place 10-15 cabbage leaves in a large bowl and pour the hot water over them. Let the leaves soak for a full hour as the water cools. You should see the pigment of the cabbage bleeding into the water over time.


For the best results, all of the leaves should be submerged in the water.

, After the water has cooled, use kitchen tongs or a colander to separate the leaves from the juice.


Store your red cabbage “decoding ink” in the freezer. If you let cabbage juice sit in the fridge, it will rot and smell awful., Dip a sponge or paintbrush into the bowl of red cabbage juice and wash the liquid evenly over the paper that contains your message.

, As you coat the paper, your letters will appear in a greenish-blue color on the page. The letters appear this color because red cabbage juice works as a pH indicator and detects the basic baking soda.If the message had been written with lemon juice, which is an acid, the letters would have appeared pink instead of greenish-blue."

Light the candle.",How to Make a Steam Engine1," Use tin snips or shop scissors to make a smooth horizontal cut about 1/3 of the way up from its base.;
, Fold the rim of the can in on itself to eliminate its sharp edges. Take care not to cut yourself as you do so.

, Most soda cans have a circular base that curves into the interior of the can. Push this out by flattening it with your fingers or using the bottom of a small glass or jar to smooth it.

, You can use a paper punch for this, or you can make the holes with a nail and hammer. You will need a hole slightly larger than 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) in diameter.

, Crumple foil and place it under and around the candle to hold it in place. Tea light candles come in small tins, so the wax should not melt and spill into your aluminum can.

, The 1/8-inch tubing should bend easily around the pencil. You will need enough coiled tubing to stretch across the top of the can, plus about 2 extra inches (5.08 cm) of straight tubing on each side.

, Center the coil over the wick of the candle. Try to have about the same length of straight tubing sticking out of each side of the can.

, Bend the straight sections of the tubing so that they go in opposite directions on each side of the can. Then, bend them again so that they reach below the base of the can. When you're done, you should have a coiled section of tubing in the middle over your candle that stretches downward into two opposite-facing ""jets"" on either side of the can.

, Your ""boat"" should float comfortably. If the tubing ends don't quite sit below the water line, try weighing the can down slightly, but be careful not to sink it.

, The easiest way to do this is to place one end in the bowl of water and suck through the other like a straw. Alternately, you can hold your finger over one end and hold the open end under a running faucet.

, Over time, the water in the tubing will heat up and begin to boil. As it evaporates into steam, it will shoot out of the the ""jets"" of the tubing, causing the entire can to spin in the bowl.

Brainstorm ideas and phrases.,
Match the project content to the title.,
Use what you have.,
Add a creative element.,
Take some time to play with the title.,
Divide the title.,
Make sure you include your main point.,
Don't use uncommon abbreviations.,
Make it readable.,
Make sure it is spelled correctly.,
Stick it in the center.,
Map it out first.,
Put it on the board.",How to Make a Science Fair Title," Take out a piece of paper. To brainstorm ideas, you'll need something to work on. Have a piece of paper and pen on hand to work. You can use a computer, but it will probably be easier to see your progress on paper. Start writing down some thoughts and ideas about what your title could be.;
, First and foremost, your title has to be descriptive. That is, it has to clue your audience in to what your project is about. You are going to tell them what your project is with the title, then show them the project with the board.If you haven't already, take a minute to write a sentence describing your project.
Use that information to guide your title. For instance, if your project is about water, you don't want a title about frogs. You need it to be about water. So ""Where the Frogs Swim"" isn't as good as ""Kansas City Water."" The second tells more about what your project is.
If you're title makes a reference to something too obscure, your teacher probably won't get it.

, Sometimes, you can find a title buried in your project. You may have already written something that will work as it is for title or will work if you change it up a little.Try reading through the text you wrote for your project.
Copy down any sentence that may work for a title. Look for sentences that cover the main areas of your project. For instance, the sentence ""Water in our city is not filtered properly and contains contaminates."" may be a good descriptor of your project.
Shorten it to make it more useful as a title: ""Kansas City Water Is Contaminated."" You could also rephrase it to ""Determining if Kansas City Water is Contaminated.""

, While you want your title to be informative, it's also good to make it creative. A creative tittle can draw your audience in, making them want to read more about your project. This element is sometimes called a ""hook.""For example, one option is to pick out concrete images to use. A concrete image is something that you can see, smell, taste, hear, or feel. For instance, something like, ""Brown water came out of the faucet."" is concrete.Another way to add a creative element is to use a famous saying, poem, or song to play into your title. You can use the quote straight (with quotation marks) or twist it to make it work with your project. For instance, ""Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink"" is a famous quotation Samuel Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner that would work for a paper on contaminated water.

, Don't just go with the first title you think of. Try to rearrange and play around with it to get the best title for your project.Also, consider trading in less specific words for more specific words. For instance, ""water"" in ""Kansas City Water Is Contaminated"" could be more specific. you could write ""Kansas City Tap Water Is Contaminated.""
""Tap"" indicates the water is coming out of everyone's tap, and it would certainly grab people's attention.

, One way to include both a creative element and a informative element is to split the title into two parts. In other words, you have a main title and a subtitle.This technique helps you use a creative title, but it also gives your reader the description they need to be informed about your project.
For instance, you could write: ""Water, Water Everywhere, And Not a Drop to Drink: The Contamination of Kansas City Tap Water."" Generally, you put the subtitle on a second line. If it's included on the same line, you use a semi-colon to separate them.

, That is, with a science fair project, you've come to some conclusion. When you're writing your title, it's good to include at least an indication of that conclusion in your title. For instance, ""Kansas City Water Is Contaminated"" already indicates your conclusion, that the water is contaminated.Also, make sure you include the keywords. Think of the main words that describe your topic. For instance, when writing a title for a project about contaminated water supply, obviously words like ""water"" and ""contaminated"" are crucial.

, Unless an abbreviations or acronym is commonly known, you shouldn't use it in your title. For instance, ""AIDS"" and ""radar"" are commonly accepted abbreviations/acronyms. However, using ""CW"" for ""contaminated water"" in your title will just confuse people., When your teacher is walking around the room looking at boards, your title needs to be readable. That means that it's in a good font, or that it is legible if you are writing it yourself.In other words, don't choose fonts that are too fancy or have so many swirls that you can't read it.
Also, make the lettering large enough to read it from four feet away. Ask a parent to test it out, as you probably have better eyesight than them.
Stick to a single color. Choose a dark color for a light background or a light color for a dark background. Also, putting it in bold can help. You can make the subtitle in another color or smaller font to help people tell it is different from the main title.

, The title is the first thing your teacher will see. If it's not spelled correctly, it can affect how she views your whole project. Use spellcheck, and ask a parent to look it over for spelling.Mixing up ""affect"" and ""effect"" is a common mistake on science projects. ""Affect"" is a verb that creates ""effects"" (noun). For instance, ""The scent affected the girl. The effect was her sneezing.""

, While it may seem like a good idea to stretch your title across your project board, a title in the center is more readable. Try to fit the whole title in the center panel, so that your audience won't get confused.In other words, if you have a trifold, skip putting parts of the title on the side panels.
Your title may not fit all on one line in the center, and that's okay. Just go go the next line.

, You don't want to write your title in ink the first time. Write it out in pencil to make sure it looks okay. If you're using a printed title, make sure it fits before you start gluing it down.It can be helpful to try it several ways before writing or gluing. You may decide you like another arrangement better.Remember to center your title. That is, you probably don't want it all the way over to the left, unless you are running it down the board instead of across.
Line it up. Make sure your title is straight across the board. Use a ruler to draw in lines in pencil if that will help. Just be sure to do draw them in lightly so you can erase them when you're done putting the title in., Once you've determined that everything is perfect, it's time to put on the board. Draw out your letters or glue on the font to create your title. Stick to glue sticks, as tape looks messy and regular glue can wrinkle your paper."

Gather your supplies.,
Build your volcano.,
Set up your play area.,
Place a funnel over the bottle or volcano.,
Pour some baking soda into your container.,
Mix your liquid ingredients.,
Consider making colored or glowing lava.,
Pour the vinegar into the jar and quickly remove the funnel.,
Watch the ""lava"" ooze out of the jar.",How to Make Lava1," In this project, you will be combining baking soda and vinegar to create a foaming, frothy lava. This lava does not last very long, but it is fun and exciting to watch as it foams out of your volcano. Here is what you will need:

A homemade volcano, plastic bottle, bowl, cup, or jar
½ cup (64 grams) baking soda
½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of vinegar
Food coloring, glow-in-the-dark paint, or fluorescent paint
Dish soap
Water;
, Find a plastic bottle and take the cap off. Set the bottle down on a flat surface and wrap clay around it until you get a cone shape. You can do this by putting more clay on the base of the bottle and less clay at the top. Do not cover the top of the bottle; leave it open so that you can pour the ingredients inside. You can then decorate your volcano with fake plants, rocks, paint, and plastic animals. Let the clay dry before making the lava.

You can use any type of clay you want. You can also use plasticine or paper mache.
You can also make a simple ""volcano"" by using a tall glass or an empty bottle.

, This volcano can get messy. Find a large, shallow bin or tray, and place your bottle or volcano inside it. The bin or tray will catch any lava that flows out of your ""volcano."", This will make it easier to pour in all of your ingredients. If you are using something with a wide mouth, such as a bowl, cup, or jar, then you probably will not need the funnel., If the baking soda has clumped up, then place a sieve over the funnel first. The tight netting of the sieve will help break up any clumps of baking soda., You will need at least ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of vinegar, a few drops of liquid dish soap, and a few drops of water. The more vinegar you use, the more dish soap you will need. The dish soap will not only make the lava fuller, but also make it last longer., You can make your lava look like real lava by adding a few drops of food coloring to the vinegar. You can also make glowing lava by adding 1 teaspoon of glow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint to the vinegar. Be sure to stir the vinegar well to make sure that the food coloring or paint is completely mixed.If you are using glow-in-the-dark paint, you will need to ""charge"" it by setting it in the sun or under a bright lamp for a few minutes. Once the paint is charged, you will need to turn off the lights in order to make it glow.
If you are using fluorescent paint, you will need a black light. Once you have the paint and vinegar all mixed, you will need to turn off the regular lights and turn on the black light. You can purchase a black light online or in an arts and crafts store, and switch out one of the light bulbs at home with the black light. If you are a child, please ask an adult to help you with this step.
You can make your lava any color you want, but red, orange, and yellow will give you the most realistic-looking lava.
You can make the lava even more exciting by adding in some sparkly glitter!

, You do not need to pour it all in all at once. Even a little bit of vinegar is enough to make the baking soda fizz. Take the funnel off the volcano quickly, or it will stop the lava from coming out!

If you are using glow-in-the-dark lava, turn off the lights first
If you are using fluorescent lava, turn off the lights and switch on the black light.

, You can keep adding more vinegar to make the volcano continue ""exploding."" When the volcano stops exploding, that means you have run out of baking soda."

Prepare the engine for operation.,
Run the engine!,
Be safe.",How to Make a Steam Engine2," Mark a 15 x 5 cm rectangle horizontally on the side of the can near the base.


Note that for this paint can (and the other one you'll use), you'll want to ensure that the can contained only latex-based paint and that it has been thoroughly washed with soap and water before use.

, Bend 6 cm (about 2 & 1/3 inches) at either end of the 24 cm side down at a 90o angle. This should create a 12 x 12 cm square ""platform"" with two 6 cm ""legs"". Place this mesh inside the paint can, ""legs"" down, lining it up with the edges of the hole you cut.

, Eventually, you'll burn coals inside this paint can to provide the heat for your steam engine. If these coals don't have a steady supply of oxygen, they won't be able to burn well. Allow ventilation by drilling or punching a series of holes in a half-circle pattern along edge of the can's lid.


These ventilation holes should ideally be bout 1 cm (4/10 in) in diameter.

, Take about 6 m (about 19 & 1/2 feet) of soft copper tubing 1/4 inch (.64 cm) in diameter and measure 30 cm (11 & 8/10 inches) from one end. Starting from this point, wrap the tubing into five coils 12 cm (4 &3/4 inches) in diameter. Wind the remaining length of the tubing into about 15 coils 8 cm (3 & 1/6 in) in diameter. You should be left with about 20 cm (7 & 5/6 in) extra.

, Bend both ends of the coil so that they're pointing upwards and insert each through one of the holes in the lid. If you don't quite have enough length in the tubing, you may need to unwind one of the coils slightly.

, Place the coil on top of the mesh platform. Fill the space around and inside the coil with charcoal briquettes. Close the lid tightly.

, In the center of the quart-sized paint can's lid, drill a hole 1 cm (4/10 in) in diameter. On the side of the can, drill two 1 cm holes - one near the base and one above it near the lid.

, Use the ends of the copper tubing to bore holes in the center of two corks. Insert one 25 cm (9 & 5/6 in) piece of hard plastic tubing into one cork and one 10 cm (3 & 11/12 in) piece into the other so that they fit snugly and extend slightly from the other end of the cork. Insert the cork with the longer tubing into the bottom hole on the small can and the cork with the shorter tubing into the top hole. Secure the tubing in each cork with hose clamps.

, Place the smaller can above the larger can with the corked tubing facing away from the larger can's ventilation holes. Use metallic tape to secure the tubing from the bottom cork to the tubing extending from the bottom of the copper coil. Then, secure the tubing from the upper cork to the tubing extending from the top of the coil in the same way.

, Use a hammer and screwdriver to remove the center portion of a circular metallic electrical junction box. Secure an electrical cable clamp to the junction box with the retaining ring inside. Insert 15 cm (5 & 9/10 in) copper pipe 1/2 in (1.27 cm) in diameter through the cable clamp connector so that the tubing protrudes a few cm below the hole in the junction box. Blunt the edges of this end inward with a hammer. Insert this end of the pipe into the hole in the lid of the smaller can.

, Take a standard wooden barbecue skewer and insert it into one end of a 1.5 cm (6/10 in) hollow wooden dowel rod 3/8 in (.95 cm) in diameter. Place the dowel rod and skewer inside the copper pipe in the metal junction box so that the skewer points up.


The skewer and dowel rod will act as the ""piston"" when the engine is running. To make the motion of the piston easier to see, you might want to attach a small paper ""flag"" to the top.

, Remove the junction box assembly from the small upper can and fill the upper can with water, allowing it to drain into the copper coil until the can is about 2/3 full of water. Check all connectors for leaks and ensure all seals are tight. Secure the lids of both cans by tapping them with a hammer. Replace the junction box in its spot above the small upper can.

, Crumple up pieces of newspaper and place them in the space enclosed by mesh at the bottom of the engine. When the charcoal has caught fire, allow the briquettes to burn for about 20-30 minutes. As they heat the water in the coil, steam should begin to build up in the upper can. When this steam reaches sufficient pressure, it will push the dowel and skewer piston upwards. Once sufficient pressure has been released, the piston will be pulled back down by gravity. Trim pieces off of the skewer as needed to reduce the weight of the piston - the lighter it is, the more frequently it will ""pop"" up. Try to whittle the skewer down to a weight such that the piston ""runs"" at a constant clip.


You can speed up the burning process by using a hair dryer to blow through the ventilation holes.

, It probably goes without saying that this DIY steam engine requires careful handling and operation. Never run the steam engine indoors. Never run it around flammable material like dry leaves or overhanging trees. Only run it on a tough, non-flammable surface like concrete. If you're working with children, ensure an adult is present to supervise at all times. Do not children or teenagers approach the engine while the charcoal is burning. If you're ever not sure how hot the engine is, assume that it's too hot to touch.


Also, be sure that the steam is able to escape from the upper ""boiler"". If the piston becomes stuck for some reason, pressure can build up inside the small can. In a worst case scenario, this can cause the can to explode, which can be very dangerous.

Gather your supplies.,
Pour baby oil into the Ziploc bag.,
Prepare your lava.,
Add the lava to the bag.,
Seal the bag tightly.,
Play with your lava.",How to Make Lava2," Combining water and oil in a bag will create a lava that is fun to squish around. It can last a long time, as long as you keep the bag sealed. Here is what you will need:

Ziploc bag (or similar re-sealable bag)
Baby oil
Glow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint
Water

, How much oil you use will depend on the size of your Ziploc bag. You will need to fill the bag ¼ to 1/3 full. Do not fill the bag all the way.

You can also use olive oil or another pale-colored oil. Baby oil, however, is clear and will allow you to see the lava's colors at their best.

, In a small cup, combine 1 part paint and 1 part hot water. Stir until everything is combined. You can use glow-in-the-dark paint or fluorescent paint.This will make your lava. You can use any color you like, but reds, oranges, yellows, and pinks will create the most realistic-looking lava.

Consider adding some glitter to make your lava sparkly.

, You will need 1 to 4 tablespoons of lava. Simply measure out the lava and add it to the bag. The lava will not mix with the oil, but form globs instead., Close the bag partway, and squeeze out as much air as possible before closing the bag the rest of the way. There should be little to no air inside the bag. Make sure that the bag is tightly sealed.

You can put clear packaging tape over the top of the bag so that it does not open.

, You can play with your lava by taking the bag into a dark room, and squishing the bag around with your fingers. The globs of paint will move around! Do not open the bag, or the lava will escape!

If you made glow-in-the-dark lava, you will need to charge your lava by leaving it in the sun or under a bright lamp for a few minutes.
If you made fluorescent lava, you will need to use a black light. Simply turn off the regular lights and switch on your black light. The fluorescent lava will then glow.

A bottle, jar, or tall glass
Baby oil
Water
Food coloring
Alka-Seltzer or an antacid tablet

, You can make your lava lamp in a bottle, jar, or a tall glass. If you use a bottle or jar, however, you will be able to seal your lava lamp and use it again and again by swirling the liquid around inside., If you do not have baby oil, you can use olive oil or another pale-colored oil instead. Baby oil, however, is clear and will let you see the colors of the lava better., Do not fill your container all the way. Instead, leave about 1 inch of space between the water and the top of the jar., This will make the lava more visible. You can use any color you want, but reds, oranges, and yellows will create the most lava-like effect. You can only use one color however; if you use all three colors, they will mix together and make orange., After a few minutes, the water and food coloring will sink to the bottom of the jar, and the oil will float to the top. The food coloring will mix into the water by itself when it sinks to the bottom of the jar., You can break the tablet in half, or you can break it into fourths., The Alka-Seltzer will sink to the bottom, and cause the colored water to bubble and fizz. The bubbles will float to the top of the jar, creating a lava lamp-like effect. You can drop another piece of Alka-Seltzer to create more bubbles., When you have run out of Alka-Seltzer, you can still continue using your lava by putting the lid on the jar or a cap on the bottle. If you used a glass, you can pour everything into a jar or bottle. Gently turn the jar upside down and back and forth. The colored water will come together into a large glob (o several smaller goblets) and float in the oil. It will look like lava!If you used a bottle, simply twist the cap onto the bottle.
If you made your lava lamp in a cup, you can pour the liquid into a jar of bottle using a funnel, and then close the jar or bottle tightly.

Choose the plasticine.,
Make a construction paper or thin cardboard base for shaping the volcano.,
Using the cone as the base for the volcano.,
Add a snow layer to the top of the volcano.,
Add some lava.,
Done.,
Find a plastic bottle that is able to sit underneath the volcano, with its mouth sitting in the open mouth of the volcano.,
Add baking soda to the bottle.,
In a separate container, mix the lava ingredients together.,
Place the volcano onto a safe surface.,
When you're ready, add the lava mix to the bottle of baking soda.,
To clean up, wipe down the sides of the plasticine volcano with a wet cloth or wipe.",How to Make a Plasticine Volcano," You'll need brown plasticine for the bulk of the volcano, white plasticine for the snow cap and red or orange plasticine for the lava. If you want a green landscape around the base of the volcano, you'll also need some green plasticine.;
, You'll need a basic cone shape for the volcano, so make a basic cone with a large opening from either construction paper or thin cardboard. This can be taped together or stapled. The cone is probably best then sitting around a bowl, to provide something firm underneath for you to press into when adding the plasticine.

, Start adding the brown plasticine to the cone, smoothing it around the cone shape from the base to the top. Aim for the same thickness all the way around, with more plasticine layered at the base and finer layering at the top.

, Use the white plasticine to make a snow cap around the top of the volcano, using a wavy line around its base area.

, Stick some lengths of red or orange plasticine running down one side of the volcano, to give the effect of lava.

, You can stop here; the volcano is good for a diorama or display model as it is. Or, you can go ahead to the next phase and add materials that will allow the volcano to explode for real.


If adding vegetation, place the volcano on its display base, then shape some trees, fields, and perhaps add some small houses, model farm animals, etc.

, If you do want the volcano to work this way, design the volcano according to the size of the bottle from the start, to save you having to hunt high and low for a bottle of the right size.

, Fill it about halfway with baking soda. This will be the substance that reacts with the vinegar, to create the ""lava"".

, This consists of a good squirt of washing up liquid and a few drops of red food coloring. Then add 2 tablespoons or so of white vinegar. This is now known as your ""lava mix"".

, When the lava flows, it is going to make a mess, so that volcano must be on a surface that won't stain and can be cleaned with ease. A good surface is a portable plastic tray with high edges, or a bowl, allowing you to transport the volcano with ease and perform the explosion.

, Stand back as it bubbles up and bursts forth with red lava, which will cascade down the side of the plasticine volcano.

, Dab up any liquid around the base of the volcano. Remove the bottle and wash the contents out. The plasticine volcano can be kept for another explosion some other time.

Understand the homopolar motor.,
Understand the electric motor.,
Gather supplies for a homopolar motor.,
Assemble supplies for the electric motor.",How to Make a Motor1," The homopolar motor is one of the simplest techniques for creating an operational motor. This is a good motor to introduce the functionality of a motor to young engineers. Homopolar motors were initially conducted as experiments to further the development of electromagnetic technology.;
, The electric motor is a device that runs on electricity to make something move. The object that rotates is called the electromagnet; this is where the electric current runs through.The electric motor is more flashy than the homopolar motor. It requires more effort but offers more of a spectacle.

, For this type of motor, you’ll only need four supplies: a few inches of copper wire, ferromagnetic screw, D battery, and a neodymium magnetic,


You could also use a drywall screw. The important thing is that you’ll be able to detect when it is turning.These supplies can be found at a hardware or hobbyist store.

, This type of motor requires more parts and labor. The supplies for an electric motor can be found at a hardware shop, hobbyist shop, or online. You’ll need the following supplies:


Three circular magnets
Insulated wire (four feet)
D battery
Two large paper clips
Tape

"
"
Position the screw.,
Prepare the wire.,
Attach the screw and battery.,
Attach the wires.",How to Make a Motor2," Set the head of a drywall screw on a disk magnet. The head is the flat part of the screw where the screwdriver attaches. This will give the screw magnetic properties and keep the screw in place.

, Strip 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of the insulation from the wire and tape it to the flat, negative end of the battery. Use wire strippers for an efficient strip, but you can also use scissors.


Add pressure to the wire cutters like you would with scissors. Press down and move the wire so that the wire stripper takes off the tip part of the wire's casing.
If you're using scissors, cut down just enough to penetrate the wire's casing. Then move the wire while holding pressure on the scissors. It might take you a few times until you create a clean strip.

, Touch the tip (the point) of the screw to the top of the positive side of the battery. The magnet will hold it in place.

, Finish constructing the motor by touching the side of the magnet with the other end of the wire to start the motor. The screw should start to rotate.

Prepare and cut the wire.,
Wrap the large wire.,
Prepare the paper clips.,
Attach the short wire.,
Stack the magnets.,
Attach the coil.,
Attach the battery.",How to Make a Motor3," You’ll need to first cut out three strands of wire. One needs to be long, about 18 inches while the other two should be 12 inches. Using your wire cutters, strip about an inch of insulation from each end of the strips of wire.


Clamp the wire cutters like you would use scissors. Press down and move the wire so that the wire stripper takes off the tip part of the wire's casing.
If you're using scissors, cut down just enough to penetrate the wire's casing. Then move the wire while keeping pressure on the scissors. It might take you a few times until you create a clean strip.

, Take the large wire (18 inches) and begin wrapping it around the battery. Begin wrapping two inches from the end of the battery. Be careful with each wrap keep the strands close to each other. When most of the wire is wrapped around the battery, carefully slide it from the battery.


Wrap the longer strand across the coil and secure it around wrapped wire. Wrap the remaining wire around the opposite side’s wire. The result should be two “arms” of stripped wire protruding from opposite sides.
The coil should be about the size of a quarter.

, Unfold the paper clip so that the smaller bend acts as the base. Create a loop out of the larger bend. This will act as a holder for the coils created earlier. Do this for both of the paper clips.

, Once the paper clips are prepared, attach the smaller wire around the base of the paper clip. Do this by wrapping the exposed wire around the paper clip. Do this for both paper clips and be sure to use the different wires for each.


Use a piece of tape to secure both the wire and the paper clip bases to a surface.

, Position the two paper clip bases so that they are close to each other with about three inches in between them. Stack the magnets in between the two paper clip bases. Make sure the loops made from the paper clips are facing each other.

, Place the exposed “arms” of the coil created earlier through the loops of the paper clips. Having the bases taped to a surface will help secure the coil. The coil should now be directly above the magnets.

, Finish up your motor by attaching the exposed wires of the paper clip base to the battery. Position one end of the wire to the positive side of the battery and tape it. Then attach the other wire to the negative side of the battery and tape it.


Batteries can get hot when wires are attached to them.
Give the coil a gentle spin and observe the motor you constructed.

Collect the materials that you will need for the project.,
Cut the piece of paper and cardboard into equal size circles.,
Glue the piece of paper to the cardboard.,
Divide the circle into seven equal triangles.,
Color each of the seven sections a different color.,
Fasten the disc to the pencil.,
Hold the disc in place.,
Spin the disc like a top.,
Adjust your technique.,
Look at a prism.,
Study the visible spectrum.,
Consider color combinations.",How to Make a Newton Disc," You will need a piece of paper, an equivalent sized piece of cardboard, glue, tape, scissors, hole punch, ruler, pencil, and a coloring source. Choose your coloring source. You can choose to color your disc with crayons, markers, colored pencils, or paint. You will need all of the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.Alternatively, you could choose to print a color wheel from the internet.;
, To do this you could trace something round with a pencil, use a compass, or print a circle off of the computer. Though it does not matter what size circle you use, it is best to use a circle that would comfortably fit on a standard sheet of notebook paper. The larger your circle is the harder it will be to create the effects of the disc.

, If you printed a color wheel from the internet, be sure to glue the color side up. Let the glue dry completely before moving on to the next step.

, Use the ruler and pencil to make the lines on the circle. Think about this step as though you are “cutting into a pie.” You are creating a color wheel.It does not matter if your triangles are perfectly equal in size.

, Start at the top of the circle and work clockwise. You will color the sections red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet., You will need to punch a hole in the middle of the disc. Slide the disc onto pencil. This will give you a way to hold the disc and spin it rapidly.

, Put tape around the pencil an inch above and below the disc. This will prevent the wheel from wobbling off of the pencil as it spins. This way, you can spin the disc faster without it flying off of the pencil.

, At first you will see the colors quickly spinning. As you spin the disc faster, you will start to see the colors blending, and they will blend together and appear white. If you aren’t seeing this happen, try spinning the disc even faster.

, If you are still able to see mostly colors, try spinning the wheel faster. Be aware that you may not see a perfectly white wheel. You are trying to spin the wheel faster than your eyes can process the colors.

, A prism is used to split visible light. It separates the light by different frequencies, which appear different in color. Shining a white light through a prism will yield all of the colors of the rainbow (the visible light spectrum).If you do not have access to a prism, water can also split light. This can be observed in rainbows.

, Visible light is the small range of electromagnetic energy that the human eye can detect and translate into an image. When the entire spectrum is present, the light appears white in color. When particular frequencies are absorbed, reflected, or otherwise not present, the eye sees different colors, for example red or green., The frequencies that make up the visible spectrum are present on your color wheel. This is why spinning the wheel fast enough to blur those colors together makes them appear white. The light from all of the colors is hitting your eye at almost the exact same time. This tricks the eye into thinking you are seeing white light."

Add ash or soot to the chamber.,
Take the volcano to a safe place.,
Run leads from the ignitor.,
Touch the leads to a nine volt battery.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Model Volcano Pyroclastic Flow," Use a metal soup can to make a reaction chamber. Peel all of the labeling off of the can so that it doesn’t catch on fire. Open the can at the top, empty out any soup, and clean the can.;
, Sugar will be the fuel source for your reaction. It will burn, producing heat and smoke. Fill one third of the chamber with sugar to leave room for other reactants., Saltpeter, also known as potassium nitrate, serves as a good oxidizer. This means it helps enable the sugar to burn faster, producing a more realistic pyroclastic model. You can use different ratios of potassium nitrate to sugar for different results. Start with a 1:1 mixture by adding the same amount of potassium nitrate as you did sugar. Mix the reactants thoroughly, but do not heat them.You can change the ratio to have more or less potassium nitrate and see which explosions you prefer. More potassium nitrate will oxidize the sugar faster, resulting in in a faster reaction. Less potassium nitrate will result in a slower reaction.
Your fuel is now live and can be ignited. Keep it away from any heat source, flame, or spark.
You can purchase saltpeter at most local hardware stores or online.

, If you have made a model volcano, you can place the can inside the opening of the volcano. Another option is to build a volcano around the soup can. Either way, be absolutely sure that your volcano is not made with any flammable materials. The reaction gets very hot.Do NOT use paper mache volcanoes. If you have a paper mache volcano you need to do the baking soda and vinegar reaction.
Volcanoes made of clay, stones, or metal will not catch fire.

, You can get a model rocket ignitor at a hobby store like Hobby Lobby. You can also order them online. This ignitor will allow you to set off the reaction from a safe distance using a small electrical current. Simply put the end of the ignitor into fuel mixture, and make sure that the end of the ignitor is buried into the fuel mixture.If you want to hide the ignitor leads, you can cut two small holes in the side of the can to feed the leads through, but this is not necessary.

, Fill any remaining chamber space with ash or soot. While this does nothing for the chemical reaction, it will be thrown into the air. This will make your model resemble a pyroclastic event more accurately.

, This experiment can be very dangerous if it is done in the wrong place. If you do this inside, you are likely to burn down the building. Take the volcano to an open place outside. Get away from any buildings, trees or power lines., The ignitor will have two leads coming off of it. Connect a piece of stereo wire to each lead. Each length of wire should be at least 25 feet (8 1/3 meters) long to keep you a safe distance from the volcano., Touch one lead to the positive end of a nine volt battery and another lead to negative side. It doesn’t matter which lead touches which end of the battery. This will send current to the ignitor and ignite the fuel. The resulting explosion will send heat, smoke, and ash up into the air in true volcanic style.,"

Decide on the size of your igloo.,
Find a building platform.,
Outline your foundation.,
Re-adjust as you build.,
Don’t expect perfection.,
Add any extra decorations.",How to Make a Model Igloo1," You’ll want to determine the final size of your igloo before you start building. If this is for a class project, make sure to read your instructions carefully in case your teacher wants a certain size igloo. Otherwise, consider how much time or how many materials you are willing to use to build.
, It is important that you build your igloo on a firm foundation, otherwise it may shift around and break, especially if you’ll need to move it. Make sure to consider the weight of the final igloo as well. For a lighter igloo, such as one built from marshmallows, a foam board may be sufficient. For a heavier igloo, you may need a light wooden board.


If you want to change the color of your platform, it is easier to do so before you start building. Go ahead and use markers or paint to create a snowy, white setting to build upon.

, Take a marker or pen and lightly outline the base of your igloo. You will want it to be roughly circular. To get that perfect circle, it might help to trace around the base of a large bowl or perhaps a half-circle of Styrofoam. Make sure that you are happy with the size of your foundation as it will also set the final size of your igloo.You can also cut a Styrofoam ball in half and then hot glue it onto your base. This will allow you to then build on top of the Styrofoam, guaranteeing an even, circular-shaped igloo.

, Plans can always go a bit awry. If you start to build your igloo and it is not turning out as you’d like, then stop and reassess the situation. You may need to place an entire extra layer of building materials on top of your partially constructed dome. You may need to tear it down to the foundation and start over., As you add layers onto your igloo, you will notice that more cracks and spaces will become visible. This is perfectly normal. You can try to fill these gaps with mortar, but you may end up creating a messy look. Instead, it is better to keep tightening your structure with each layer, realizing that it won’t be absolutely gap-free., Sprinkle powdered sugar or white glitter over the entire finished product. Add battery-powered lights on top of, around, or even inside your igloo. Place small figures inside or around your igloo.You can even build a series of smaller igloos around your main one, creating an igloo village.

Assemble the items listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section below.,
Place the lemons on a plate or any flat surface.,Label your lemons 1 and 2.,
Push one nail into each lemon.,
Open up the clock's battery compartment.,
Remove the battery.,
Use the electrician's clip on lemon number 1 to connect the copper wire to the positive point in the clock.,
Look inside the clock.,
Connect the nail to the clock's negative point on lemon number 2.,
Link the copper wire from lemon number two to the nail sticking out of lemon number one.

",How to Make a Lemon Powered Clock,";
, Although this step is optional, it's a good idea.

,, Find the farthest spot away from the nail and push a copper wire into it. What you're doing now is creating a closed circuit, so energy can flow from the lemon and back again.

, Depending on your clock, there are two AA batteries or one cell battery.

, You'll be replacing its energy with the lemon, nail and copper connection you just created.

, This is easier said than done. If you can't connect your wire to the positive point in the battery compartment, you should remove the plastic backing and open up the clock. An adult should help you with this, and the clock may not go back together.

, You'll see the positive and negative points are connected to wires on the inside of the clock. Remove the wires from the back of the battery compartment and then use them to make your connections.


If you have a two-AA battery clock and inside you find two positive wires, make sure you un-connect your copper wire with both.

, You may need to move the lemon into a new position so you can clip the nail to the clock.

Create your mortar.,
Lay out your cube base.,
Keep adding layers.,
Let it dry completely.",How to Make a Model Igloo2," Mix two egg whites and three cups of powder sugar together in a medium bowl. Keep stirring until the mixture takes on a glue-like consistency. Make sure that you’ve stirred away all of the major lumps. Set your mortar aside.

, Place a single row of sugar cubes on top of the circle you’ve drawn for your foundation. Try to make it so that the cubes are angled in the same direction slightly inward. Once you are happy with the placement of the cubes, secure each of them to the platform with mortar.Be aware that you can also use a hot glue gun to connect the cubes to the platform and to one another. However, you’ll want to be very careful or you could accidently melt the cubes in the process.
If you are building on top of a Styrofoam ball, it is possible to reverse this process and build from the top down.

, Add another layer of sugar cubes on top of the first one and continue on. You will also want to gradually decrease the circumference of the layer circles. For a smaller igloo, five or so layers may be sufficient. Keep going until the igloo is closed at the top., Since you used a liquid mixture to attach the cubes, you’ll want to leave your igloo alone for a number of hours in order to let it fully dry out. Then, if you move it, be careful not to jolt it too much or pieces might break away."

Build a Lego igloo.,
Build an ice cube igloo.,
Build a milk jug igloo.,
Build a marshmallow igloo.,
Build a packing peanut igloo.,
Build a large foam or cardboard igloo.",How to Make a Model Igloo3," Get a bunch of white, rectangular Lego blocks. They can be whatever size you choose. Build your igloo on top of a corresponding white Lego mat. Create a circle base and then gradually move the cubes inward until you have a dome. No adhesive is necessary unless you are worried about stability., Freeze an assortment of ice cubes from full-size to quarter-size in an ice tray. Remove the cubes and position them in a circle on your platform. Use a combination of salt and water to make the cubes adhere to one another as you build upwards. Periodically freeze the entire structure for added stability. When the structure is completed, coat it with a thin layer of a salt-water mixture. Re-freeze.The salt works as an adhesive by partially melting the cubes together. Then, by placing them in the freezer, you freeze them together.

, Collect a number of clean, plastic milk jugs. Using a hot glue gun, attach the jugs by the handles on top of the circle that you’ve drawn as your foundation. Then, continue to stagger the jugs as you make your way towards the top of your dome. You can also cut the jugs and place them together like puzzle-pieces for added stability.It isn’t necessary to throw the milk caps away. You can use them as decorations either on top of your dome or around it.

, Get a bag of mini, regular, or jumbo-sized marshmallows. Start building up from the base by creating a marshmallow ring. Connect the marshmallows using frosting or cold glue. If you use frosting, it is a good idea to freeze your final creation for added stability. You can also insert toothpicks at various points in the structure to serve as an added framework.If you want your igloo to be edible, stick with marshmallows, icing, and straight pretzel sticks for support.

, Gather a number of intact packing peanuts. Dip each peanut on the side in water before attaching it to the igloo. The water serves as an adhesive. However, be careful as too much water will also break down the peanuts and reduce them to mush., To create this type of igloo, you will want to cut out rectangular “blocks” beforehand. Make sure that the blocks are relatively uniform in shape and size. You may want a number of smaller blocks to use around the door area. Build up the igloo by layering the blocks on top of one another and connecting them using hot glue or heavy tape."

Fill a container with two cups of hot water.For the best effect, choose a clear glass, bowl, or bottle.,
Put on rubber or latex gloves and remove the felt ink tube from a yellow highlighter.Pry off the bottom of the highlighter; you may want to use a knife or a pair of needle-nose pliers to get it open.,
Place the ink tube in the glass of hot water and allow it to sit.,
Turn on a blacklight and light up your bottles.",How to Make a Glow in the Dark Fluid1,"


You can vary the amount of water, but that will effect how strong your water glows. More water will dilute the glow, and less water may make it shine more intensely.;
, Once the highlighter is open you can remove the felt ink tube from inside.


The gloves will protect your hands from getting stained with ink.
Not all highlighters work. Even if you test them under a blacklight and the ink appears to glow when you write, they may not work once diluted in the water. Your best bet is to use a standard yellow highlighter.

, It will only take a few minutes for the ink to begin mixing with the water. If allowed to soak for several hours, the water should glow very bright.


Use gloved hands to twist and squeeze ink out of the tube when you are finished.
When the ink tube is whitish, it means most or all of the ink is now in the water.

, The water will only glow in the presence of a UV light. Blacklights and blacklight bulbs can be found at party stores, lighting stores, or online.

Prepare your baked goods and chill until firm.,
Pour one 3-ounce package of Jell-O to a bowl and add one cup boiling water.,
Add 1 cup chilled tonic water and continue mixing.,
Allow the mixture to cool, but not set.,
Brush the glaze onto your frosting.,
Repeat six times, placing your baked goods in the freezer between each application.,
Serve under a blacklight.",How to Make a Glow in the Dark Fluid2," If you want to use the glaze on a cake, you'll need to bake, assemble, and frost the cake. Same goes for cupcakes. If you want to glaze cookies, follow your recipe and allow them to cool before attempting to glaze.


If you are using the glaze on frosting, it is important the frosting is cold and firm to the touch. The glaze can soften or make the frosting watery if it is not hard., Though you can experiment with other flavors and colors, green (lime) Jell-O is the most effective and will give off the strongest glow.Whisk the powder for about one minute, or until thoroughly combined with the boiling water.

, Tonic water contains and ingredient called quinine, which is what gives it that bitter taste. The quinine responds to UV lights and will have a blue-white appearance.For extra glow-power, you could incorporate tonic water into your baked goods recipe. Try stirring five tablespoons into your frosting before using it on your cake or cupcakes., The mixture shouldn't be hot to the touch, or it will melt your frosting, but it shouldn't be so cold that it begins to solidify. Wait until you can safely touch the mixture before you start glazing.You can use an ice bath to hasten the process, just make sure you don't cool the mixture so much that it begins to set., Use a pastry brush to brush the mixture onto your cake or cupcakes. If your frosting is frozen in place, you can even hold the cupcakes upside-down and dip them into the bowl.


Try not to drip any of the glaze on the cake or pastry part of your baked goods, focusing only on the icing. Allow any excess glaze to drip off., To keep the frosting stiff, you need to put your cake or cupcakes back in the freezer to ensure it won't soften or melt.Six coats of glaze should give you total coverage (no missed spots) and be enough to get the desired glowing effect.Once all six coats have been applied, place your baked goods in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes so the glaze can set., To really emphasize the effect, you may want to use several blacklights and place your baked goods as close to the lamps as possible. The green glaze may give your baked goods a slight green tint (especially if you used white frosting).


Your frosting may have the slight taste of lime or tonic. Add a little flavoring to the frosting, like vanilla or almond, to cover the flavor if desired.

Purchase vitamins that contain fluorescent molecules.,
Put two vitamin pills in a resealable freezer bag and crush them with a kitchen mallet.Pound the vitamins into a fine powder by hammering them with the mallet or another heavy object, like a rolling pin or unopened bottle of wine.,
Pour the crushed vitamins into a container of warm water, about two cups.,
Add the cup of vitamin water to a warm bath, using a blacklight to make your bath glow.",How to Make a Glow in the Dark Fluid3," Vitamin A, thiamine (vitamin B), niacin, and riboflavin all fluoresce strongly, giving off a bright yellow glow.Most people choose a B Vitamin complex that contains a lot of thiamine and different B Vitamins. (Look for something called Vitamin B 50 complex or something similar).,


The bag will keep the powder contained so you don't lose any. Be aware that the pounding may cause tiny tears in the bag.

, Stir the powder until it is mostly dissolved in the water. While this is a safe solution, you definitely don't want to drink any of this water.

, The fluorescent molecules in the vitamin won't glow in the dark, but they will glow in the presence of a blacklight.


Use extreme caution when using a blacklight around water. Keep the light a safe distance from the water so there is no possibility that it might fall in.

Purchase glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent paint from a craft store.,
Set up containers for your different colors, filling each container with hot water.,
Add a dollop of paint to the water and stir.,
Turn out the lights and turn on a blacklight if you are using fluorescent paints.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Glow in the Dark Fluid4," If you want water that glows in different colors (instead of the yellow that is produced by almost all other methods), buy paint in different shades. Try blue, red, and yellow, which you can mix up to create more shades.


Glow-in-the-dark paints will glow without the presence of a blacklight--they can be charged by exposure to regular light. The fluorescent paints will only respond to the UV rays from a blacklight.
Look for paints that are designed for kids and are 100% non-toxic.

, Using clear glasses or bottles will allow your glowing fluid to be bright and visible.


Using hot water will dilute the paint faster, so you will see faster results.

, There's not a precise measurement for the paint--just add a little and, if you need more, mix in another few drops. Stir the paint vigorously until it mixes into the water., If you are using glow-in-the-dark paint, check the instructions on how to ""charge"" them so they glow. Usually you need to expose the paint to sunlight for several minutes before it will glow. The fluorescent paints will only glow if you have a blacklight.


Have fun painting with these colors, mixing water to create new shades, or doing other crafts.

Choose a jar.,
Place foil inside the jar.,
Insert an electrode into the lid.,
Wrap foil around the outside of the jar.",How to Make a Leyden Jar1," You have to be careful about what materials you use to construct your Leyden jar. The material must serve as an insulator between the inner charge (+) and the outer charge (-). Choose a glass jar or a plastic bottle with a lid., You will need a conductive material inside the jar in order to charge it. Traditionally, water was used inside the jar. To build a more modern Leyden jar, you should line the inside of the jar with metal foil (tin foil, aluminum foil, etc). Your conductive material will become positively charged when you charge the Leyden jar., You will need an electrode protruding from the jar to charge the inside of the jar. You can do this by hammering a nail through the lid of the jar. Make sure that the nail goes far enough into the jar to contact the conducting surface inside the jar (water, foil, etc.).You can also connect a chain or other conductive material to the nail and allow it to hang down and touch the inner conducting surface.

, Wrap only the bottom and part of the sides of the jar. Stop short of the mouth of the jar. The foil on the outside of the jar should not contact the foil on the inside of the jar. The outer foil will have a negative charge with respect to the inner foil."

Tape a styrofoam cup to a pie pan.,
Obtain a foam plate.,
Rub the foam plate with wool.,
Touch the pie pan to the foam plate.,
Touch the pie pan with your finger.,
Touch the nail with the pie pan.",How to Make a Leyden Jar2," The styrofoam cup will act as an insulator that allows you to pick up the pie pan without touching it. This will be important for charging the Leyden jar effectively. Tape the cup in the center of the pie pan, on the inside of the pan (where the pie would go).The pie pan is functioning as a electro-porous, or charge carrier.

, You will use the foam plate because foam is an insulator. When you add or remove electrons from the foam, the charge will not travel. Instead, the foam will hold it’s charge until the charge is dissipated by things like moisture in the air., Rub wool on the foam plate to deposit electrons onto the plate. The electrons from the wool are attracted to the foam and “stick” to it. This gives the foam a negative charge., Pick the pie pan up by touching only the styrofoam cup. Rest the pie pan on top of the foam plate. This will allow the negative charge of the foam plate to push against the electrons on the pie pan., Touching the pie pan creates a path for the electrons on the pie pan to move away from the electrons on the styrofoam. This happens because electrons are all negatively charged, and thus repel one another. When you touch the pan, you are likely to see, hear, or feel a spark. This spark is the result of electrons moving from the pie pan to your finger, leaving the pan with a positive charge., When you touch the positively charged pie pan to the nail you will pull electrons from the inner electrode (the nail and conductive material inside the jar). This balances the charge on the pie pan, but leaves a positive charge on the inner electrode. Be sure hold the jar by the outer electrode (the foil on the outside of the jar) and not to touch the inner electrode with anything but the pie pan (e.g. your finger).You can repeat this process several times to build a stronger charge in the Leyden jar.
As electrons move from the inner electrode to the pie pan, you are likely to hear or see a spark.

Put one hand on the foil.,
Hold hands in a circle.,
Touch the nail.",How to Make a Leyden Jar3," By putting one hand on the outer electrode, you create a bridge to the negatively charged surface. Make sure that you are not touching the inner electrode, or any other charged surface. No spark or movement of charge will happen when you touch only the outer electrode., If you are doing this experiment as part of a group, everyone should join hands in a circle. The first person in the circle should be holding the Leyden jar and contacting only the outer electrode with one hand. They should hold the hand of the person beside of them with their other hand. The last person in the circle will only be holding one hand. Every other person will be holding the hand of the person to either side of them., Once everyone in the group is holding hands, with one person touching the outer electrode, the last person in the circle should touch their finger to the inner electrode. When they place their finger on the nail, a circuit will be created that allows electrons to move from the negatively charged outer electrode to the positively charged inner electrode. Everyone in the circle should feel a shock and you may see or hear a spark.If you are building your Leyden jar alone, touch one hand to the outer electrode and the other hand to the inner electrode to discharge the jar. You will likely see, hear, and feel a spark when you do this.

Collect your materials.,
Mix your ingredients.,
Pour onto your sponges or cotton balls.,
Leave out overnight.",How to Make a Crystal Garden1," You’ll need a plastic container (a to-go dish works well) to hold your sponge pieces or cotton balls. To make the crystals you’ll need salt, water, ammonia, and laundry bluing (one brand, “Mrs. Stewart's Laundry Bluing,” is usually recommended). Food coloring can also be added, but is not necessary., The crystals that will be grown will be made from a solution of salt, water, ammonia, and laundry bluing. The ammonia is included to speed the evaporation of the solution and thus also the growth of the crystals.


In a separate container, mix two tablespoons of salt with four tablespoons of water. Stir for two minutes to dissolve as much salt as you can.
Then, add two tablespoons of ammonia and two tablespoons of laundry bluing; continue mixing. The mixture will now be fairly viscous and blue in color.

, Some salt may remain undissolved at the bottom of the mixture, be sure to include this when pouring over your sponges or cotton balls. The salt which is topmost on each piece may begin to turn back to a white color, but this is nothing to worry about.


If using sponge pieces, wet them first and then ring them out so that the mixture sticks better.
If using cotton balls, try not to drown any of the pieces to avoid deflating the balls; use enough on cotton balls to cover the top only.
If using food coloring, place one drop on top of each sponge piece or cotton ball after the mixture has been poured on top.

, Have the container sit uncovered in a room temperature environment overnight. By the next day, your crystal garden should be fully formed.


If you’d like to have it continue growing, you can re-make the mixture just described at a lower ratio. Add this mixture to the base of the crystals already formed (not on top to avoid damage) to encourage extra growth."
"
Gather your ingredients.,
Measure out your salt and water.,
Heat water and add color.,
Add water to salt.,
Cool the mixture overnight.,
Remove the mixture from the refrigerator and clean.",How to Make a Crystal Garden2," Besides the glass (large drinking glass or jar will work) that will house the garden eventually, you’ll need epsom salt, water, and any food coloring you’d like to add (though it’s optional).


Access to a microwave helps to heat the water you’ll use, but especially warm tap water will work as well.

, To make the garden, you’ll be using equal parts water and salt. You’ll want to gauge how much to use based on the container that will house the crystal garden.


For a regular-sized drinking glass about five inches tall, use ⅓ cup water and salt.

, Having the water be on the warm side will aid in dissolving the salt, which is crucial to the formation of the crystals later on.


If you have a microwave on hand, put however much water you’re using in a microwave-safe container and heat for 45 seconds. As mentioned above, warm tap water will work fine.
After heated, add your food coloring if using any, no more than a dash should be required.

, Have your measured salt in the container which will house the garden. Add the heated water immediately after heating it or retrieving it from the tap.


Stir the mixture for about two minutes to dissolve the salt into the water. Some salt may still be resting at the bottom, it’s alright to ignore this.
Be sure to have oven mitts or some other heat-resistant glove if you're handling water just microwaved.

, Provided you have a refrigerator and freezer on hand, place the mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes. After the time has elapsed, move it from the freezer into the refrigerator.


If you have no freezer, it will work if put straight into the refrigerator.
Leave the mixture in the refrigerator overnight to allow the crystals to grow.

, There may be some additional liquid left in the jar, pour this out into the sink.


Using a damp paper towel, wipe the upper portions of the glass to allow a better view of the crystals towards the bottom.
Be careful not to nudge any of the crystals, they are very fragile."
"
Have your material at hand.,
Tie and cut your string.,
Boil the water and stir in the sugar.,
Transfer the solution into the glass container.,
Find a safe place and leave it to grow.,
Enjoy your crystals.",How to Make a Crystal Garden3," You'll need sugar, a tall glass container (a jar works best), a pencil or dull knife, string (not nylon), a saucepan to boil water, and food coloring if you choose to use it.


Gather these and place them nearby, preferably close to your stove for ease of use once the solution is made.

, You'll need to tie your string to the middle of your pencil or knife. Once done, place the pencil or knife flat over the top of the glass jar so that the string will drape down inside.


Cut the string where it reaches the bottom of the glass so that it doesn't spool at the bottom.
Be sure the string hangs as best it can in the very center of the container, to avoid uneven crystal growth.

, Now you'll make your solute using 1 cup of water and 3 cups of sugar. It is important in this step to be sure the sugar is dissolved.


Put the water over high heat until it begins to boil (bubbles should cause the water to roil). Keep on high heat once boiling.
Using spoonfuls, mix the 3 cups of sugar in until they are totally dissolved. The water may become murky, but you should see no visible sugar crystals.
If using food coloring, include it in the solution after dissolving the sugar. A few dashes should be enough.

, Here is where the crystals will be left to grow along the length of the string. If the knife/pencil is disturbed when pouring, be sure to replace it to its original position once done.


Be careful when moving boiling water; use oven mitts and walk slowly.

, Look for a place where most people don't go like a guest bathroom or closet. Keep it high enough off the ground so that it doesn't get any dust in the solution.Crystals should appear as soon as the next day, but will continue to grow until the solution has evaporated entirely.

, Since these are made of sugar, they are essentially rock candy and can be eaten without worry. If your aim is still to decorate or make a garden with them, consider hanging them where they can catch the sunlight. Or find a container in which to display a number of them (try with different colors) in attractive patterns.

Gather your materials to begin the experiment.
,
Stretch out the balloon.,Pour the water into a soft drink bottle.,
Pour the baking soda into the water.,Pour in the lemon juice and immediately attach the stretch balloon on the mouth of the bottle.,
Watch what happens.",How to Make a Lemon Powered Balloon,", Get the balloon and stretch it out as much as possible using your hands to make it easier to inflate. ,, Stir it around with a straw until the baking soda dissolves into the water.,, You will notice that your balloon will start to inflate. When you add the lemon juice to the baking soda it creates a chemical reaction. The baking soda is known a a a base, while the lemon juice is an acid. when the two combine together they create carbon dioxide (CO2). The gas rises escapes through the bottle, but doesn't escape the balloon, so it pushes it outwards and blows the balloon up. "

Add the capsule to the bag.,
Try a new bag.,
Dilute the vinegar.,
Change the capsule.,
Add some color.,
Learn about acid-base reactions.,
Study how gases act under pressure.,
Consider the elastic limits of plastic bags.",How to Make a Plastic Bag Explode," You can use any plastic bag for this experiment. The preferred method is to use a resealable bag so that you don’t have any air leaks. This will effectively build the pressure inside the bag, eventually causing it to explode.You can use other bags and tie them shut, but this can lead to air leaks that bleed off pressure and prevent your bag from exploding.;
, Add one cup of white vinegar to the bag. Vinegar is diluted acetic acid, which is a key ingredient in our explosion. Even though it’s a weak acid, you should still avoid getting it in your eyes or on your skin.








It is always best practice to wear gloves and goggles when working with any chemicals.

, The moment that baking soda comes in contact with vinegar, a reaction will start. By packing two tablespoons of baking soda tightly into a piece of tissue paper and then rolling it up, you create an obstacle between the baking soda and vinegar. This gives you enough time seal the bag and back up a bit.







, Drop the capsule in the bag, seal the bag, and step away. The moment the capsule goes in, vinegar starts to saturate the tissue paper and contact baking soda. As this happens the paper will degrade and unravel until more and more baking soda reacts. This reaction produces carbon dioxide, which builds up pressure in the bag until the bag explodes.








You can use these same chemicals to make a cool volcano.

, If you change any aspect of the bag, you change the experiment altogether. See what happens if you use a thicker bag, or a bigger bag. Try using a bag without a seal. Record the differences in each variation in a lab notebook that you can review later.







, Another parameter you can change is the strength of the acid. Try adding half a cup of vinegar and half a cup of water. Notice how it affects the speed of the reaction. You can reduce the strength of the vinegar even more by adding more water. Write each variation down in your notebook for later comparison.







, The reaction cannot start until the vinegar gets to the baking soda. You can change how quickly this happens by changing your capsule. Try a capsule made out of a paper bag, or notebook paper. Write down any ways that the experiment changes as a result.Try wrapping the baking soda in plastic wrap and sealing it well. How does this affect the experiment?

, An exploding bag is always more fun if it slings color into the air. If you want to make your bag pop with different colors, add a few drops of food coloring to the vinegar. This will change the color of the foam that oozes out of the bag after it explodes.








It's best for cleanup purposes to do this experiment outside, especially if you're adding food coloring.

, When acids and bases come in contact with each other, they undergo what is called a neutralization reaction. Since acids have plenty of extra protons, and bases readily accept protons, they balance each other out chemically. This is precisely what happens when vinegar and baking soda interact. The result is salty water and a release of carbon dioxide., When more gas is created in a closed system, the pressure increases. What this means is that the gases push harder and harder on the outside walls of the container. Higher temperatures will also increase the pressure of the gas by exciting the gas molecules and causing them to bounce more rapidly against the container.







, With more and more gas being created by the vinegar and baking soda reaction, the pressure inside the bag keeps building. Eventually, the force that the gas exerts on its container (the bag) will reach what is known as the elastic limit. This is the point at which the bag can no longer return to its previous state (the force it takes to break the bag). When the bag reaches that limit, the weakest part of the bag tears open to allow the gas to escape and relieve the pressure."

Submerge the hydrometer in liquid.,
Mark the level of the liquid.,
Derive the relative density.",How to Make a Hydrometer," Use a pencil to mark down the edge of a piece of paper. You should have a mark every two millimeters. You will need to use a ruler to accurately measure out two millimeters.Make enough marks to be roughly the length of your index finger.;
, Cut the side of the paper that you marked on into a long, thin strip. This will allow you to slide the paper into a piece of glass tubing. The tubing should be open on both ends.

, Use a tube roughly the size of a drinking straw. If you are doing this at home and do not have a glass tube, you can substitute the glass tube with a clear straw. A colored straw would make it difficult to read the markings on your paper., Melt wax or glue to secure the paper on one side of the tube. Then, use the glue or wax to make an airtight seal on that side of the tube. Leave the other end open., The paper strip should be flush with the bottom of the tube. Use scissors to cut the strip. Be careful not to pull or tug on the strip or you might break it.

, It does not matter how much water you add to the cylinder. Roughly 100 milliliters (3  fl oz) will do fine. Make sure the water is as pure and free of contaminants as possible.Any clear bottle, such as a pop bottle, will work as well.

, Place four to five grams of metal in the tube. This will reduce the buoyancy of the tube enough for part of the tube to sink. This is necessary to use the instrument for measurements.One source of metal that is readily available is a small nail.

, The sealed side should go into the water first. Avoid getting water in the tubing. This will change the buoyancy of the tube and get your paper wet.


You can change how much the tube sinks or floats by removing or adding weight (metal).

, Use a permanent marker to make a line on the side of your glass tube at exactly the level of the water. This will serve as a point of reference for the instrument and be designated as 1.0. This mark shows how far the tube sinks in a liquid that has the exact density of water., Choose a liquid to test. Put roughly 100 milliliters (3  fl oz) into a beaker. Place the hydrometer into the beaker.

, Just as you marked the surface of the water level, make a mark to show how high the liquid in question comes on the hydrometer. You can tell a little about the relative density just by this initial mark. For example, if this mark is above the 1.0 mark, the liquid is less dense than water and if it is below the 1.0 mark it is more dense than water.


Less dense liquids will allow the tube to sink farther and more dense liquids will allow the tube to sink less.

, If you want a more specific relative density, you can derive it mathematically. Measure the distance from the bottom of the tube to the 1.0 mark and the distance to the new mark. Divide the distance of the 1.0 mark by the distance of the new mark. This will give you the relative density of the liquid to water.


For example, if your 1.0 mark is 5 millimeters from the bottom and your new mark is 4.5 millimeters from the bottom, you would divide 5 by 4.5. This gives you a relative density of roughly 1.1. Your liquid is 1.1 times as dense as water.
In the other direction, if your 1.0 mark is 5 millimeters from the bottom and your new mark is 5.5 millimeters from the bottom, you would divide 5 by 5.5. This gives you a relative density of roughly 0.9. Your liquid is 0.9 times as dense as water.

Add your primary consumers to your food web.,
Add your secondary consumers to your food web.,
Add your tertiary consumers to your food web.,
Determine your top predator.,
Include your decomposers.,
Finish your web.",How to Make a Food Web," Each different ecosystem has a food chain. Once you figure out which animals and plants are in your ecosystem, you can begin organizing them into a food web.


Categorize the organisms into groups based on what they eat. For instance, all plants go together, all animals that eat plants go together, and all animals that eat animals go together. You will use these groups to draw your web later.
Your food chain could start with grass that grows through photosynthesis, which is eaten by a rabbit. A fox eats the rabbit and then dies. Once the fox dies, decomposers, like worms, eat the fox, returning the energy to the soil for the grass.;
, All the energy in an ecosystem is recycled through the food chain. This energy is called biomass.Grass contains biomass, which the rabbit gains upon eating it.


Your food web should work up to a pyramid-like structure.
There are always more autotrophs (who gain energy from the sun) than herbivores (who eat plants) in a healthy food web. There are more herbivores than carnivores (who eat animals). An ecosystem cannot support a large number of omnivores (who eat both plants and animals) without supporting an even larger number of herbivores (who eat only plants), and an even larger number of autotrophs.
Smaller animals are always more abundant than larger ones. It takes much more biomass to support a population of lions than it takes a colony of ants.

, In a food web, organisms are grouped together into categories called trophic levels.These levels are then divided into three subcategories: producers, consumers, and decomposers.


All the organisms that gain energy from the sun are your producers. Place these on the bottom of your web. You can write the name of the organism in a box or draw a picture of it.
You may want to use colors to make your tree easier to distinguish.
Plants are the most common type of producers, but you also have algae, phytoplankton, and some types of bacteria in this group.
It may be difficult to determine what trophic level an organism belongs on. Think about the diet of the organism. If it eat another organism, it shouldn't be on the bottom trophic level.

, After your producers, you may have just a few, or several levels of consumers. Consumers can be carnivores (animals that eat other animals) or omnivores (animals that eat both plants and animals).


Consumers are divided into additional categories: Primary consumers, secondary consumers and tertiary consumers.
Rabbits are consumers, so are cows, and birds. Foxes are secondary consumers, and lions are tertiary consumers.

, These are herbivores and eat primary producers exclusively. Herbivores eat plants, algae, and other producers. Primary consumers make up the second level of the food web. Your primary consumers will be different animals depending on the ecosystem that you are working with.


If you are working with a desert ecosystem, your primary consumers would be mice and other rodents.
If you are working with a grassland ecosystem, your primary consumers would be animals like deer, rabbits, and elephants.
If you are working with an aquatic ecosystem, your primary consumers would be turtles and fish that eat algae and seagrass, and urchins that eat giant kelp.

, These creatures eat herbivores (primary consumers). They are the third trophic level.


In a desert ecosystem for example, your secondary consumer would be a snake that eats a mouse.
In a kelp forest, your secondary consumers would be the sea otter that hunts the urchins.

, Tertiary consumers are on the fourth trophic level and eat the secondary consumers. In a desert ecosystem for example, a tertiary consumer would be an owl that hunts a snake.


There may be several tertiary consumers on a food web depending on what type of ecosystem you are working with.

, Also called apex predators, these animals eat other consumers. They may be on the fourth or fifth level depending on the ecosystem you are working with.


Top predators are distinguished by having no natural enemies except humans. Lions are apex predators and so are sharks.

, Also known as detritivores, they make up the final part of the food chain, completing your web. Decomposers are all organisms that eat nothing but nonliving plant and animal remains.


Scavengers like vultures, are decomposers. Dung beetles, fungi, and bacteria are decomposers as well.
All decomposers turn organic waste into nutrient rich soil that feeds primary producers.

, Once you have placed all your organisms on your food web you may like to decorate it. You can use your ecosystem as inspiration and draw a desert, marine, forest, or other background in the empty space around your organisms.


If this is a class assignment, be sure to include your name and all other relevant information.

Grab a clean, empty 2 liter (0.5 US gal) soda bottle.,

Place your diver in the bottle and seal the top tightly.,
Gently squeeze the bottle to make the diver drop.,
Troubleshoot the diver if it is not working.",How to Make a Cartesian Diver1," This will be the ""ocean"" your diver dives in. It doesn't matter what is on the outside, so long as the inside is clean.

, You want as much water as you can get in.
, An eyedropper is a natural Cartesian diver. All you need to do is fill it up roughly 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the way with water. However, in a pinch, you have other options for your diver that don't need to be filled with water:


Find a pen cap, one that has no holes in it. Place a pea-sized bit of modeling clay around the bottom part, the stick coming off the cap. Leave the opening at the bottom of the cap uninhibited.Cut a bendy-straw in half 2-3 inches below the bed. Roll some clay between your hands to make a snake about the width of your straw. Stuff the clay in one end of the straw to stop it up, then wrap the rest around the other side of the straw so it stays in a U-shape, with the bend on top.Packets of ketchup or soy sauce work as well, as do unopened mini-candies, like Milk Ways. To check if the foods will work, first place them in a bowl of water. They should barely float., Remember, you want the water level to be near the very tip so that there is not a lot of air in the bottle.
, If you squeeze the sides of the bottle, the diver should plummet to the bottom. Try to find the pressure needed to make it stay in one place. You could also try and trick your friends by squeezing as gently as possible, so it looks like you're doing it by magic.
, Place the diver into a normal bowl of water. It should just barely float, with the air bubble (the top of the dropper, the bend in the straw, etc.) just above the water. Make sure that the bottom is sealed for homemade divers, and add a little more or less water to the eyedropper to get the right balance.
"
"
Think about density to explain why the ""magic"" diver floats at first.,
Increase density when you squeeze the bottle.,
Watch as the denser air inside your diver causes it to sink.,
Think about practical applications of the diver.",How to Make a Cartesian Diver2," The Cartesian diver was invented by Renee Descartes to explain properties of gasses. But it only makes sense when you remember how density works. In short, objects only float in water if they are less dense than water. Air is much less dense, so your airy diver starts at the top.Density is basically how heavy something is per square inch. A box filled with feathers, for example, is much lighter than the same box filled with metal. Since they are the same sizes, but different weights, you'd say the metal box is much more ""dense."", When you squeeze the bottle, none of the water escapes. But the area it is in gets smaller, so it pushes together against the air bubbles nearby, compressing them into smaller packets of air. But this is like squeezing a sleeping bag together -- it gets smaller, but it still weighs the same amount. The air, thus, gets denser., Squeeze the bottle enough and, eventually, the size of the air inside your diver gets so small that is it denser than the water surrounding it. This causes the diver to sink because it has too much density to keep floating.
, The obvious parallel is to scuba divers, who wear heavy metal belts to help them sink. But they also have ""buoyancy compensators,"" small bags they can fill with low-density oxygen from the tank to help them surface again. Submarines have ballast tanks that are filled with water to help them dive. When they need to go up, air is pumped in to push the water out, bringing the sub back to the surface."
"
Use salt water and predict if there is going to be a change.,
Don't fill the bottle all the way and test again.,
Try a different sized bottle.,
Try changing the temperature of the water.",How to Make a Cartesian Diver3," Do you need more water in your eye-dropper? Does it take more pressure to make the diver drop? Predict what will happen in advance. Then make two bottles and compare the two.


Hint: Salt water is more dense than fresh water., Leave some air in the top of the bottle and then give it another shot. How much can you take out and still keep the diver working? Any? Half? None? Make a prediction first using your knowledge of the divers.


Hint: When you squeeze the bottle, you're compressing everything, not just the air in the diver., Use a small 1-litre personal soda, then try it with a gallon jug. Do you have to squeeze any harder to make the diver work?


Hint: Is it easier or harder to compress a big metal spring compared to a small one?


, What happens if you use cold water? What about hot? Make sure it is not so hot it melts the plastic, but sticking it in the fridge for an hour or microwaving for a minute or so should do the trick.


Hint: Warmer water has a lower density than cooler water."

Add a tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda to a sandwich bag.,
Add ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a snack bag.,
Place the snack bag inside the sandwich bag.,
Punch the snack bag to release the vinegar.,
Jiggle the bag and toss it down.,
Watch the explosion.",How to Make a Bomb Bag1," A two-bag bomb bag is a quick and basic way to make an effective bomb bag. To begin, place one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda in a Ziploc sandwich bag or a similar small, completely sealable bag., After adding the baking soda to the larger sandwich bag, pour ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to a smaller sealable bag like a snack size Ziploc bag. Then seal the zip on the bag completely.Make sure that the snack size bag in which you put the vinegar is smaller than the bag that you put the baking soda in.
Leave a little bit of air inside the snack bag of vinegar, as opposed to pressing it before sealing and letting the air escape.
You need to initially separate the vinegar and baking soda because they react almost instantly, which means that if you poured them in together, you wouldn’t have time to seal the bag before the pressure builds. Adding them in separately ensures that the reaction in the bag will be able to build up to an explosion.

, Once you seal the snack bag, place the snack bag of vinegar inside the larger bag of baking soda. Seal the zip on the sandwich bag., Once you seal the larger bag, place the bag on a surface that is either outside or can be easily cleaned. Then hit or punch the snack bag inside the sandwich bag. Because you left some air inside the snack bag, the pressure of your punch should open up the seal of the bag slightly to let the vinegar escape into the larger sandwich bag.If punching the bag doesn’t partially open the seal, use your fingers to try to pinch the sides of the snack bag of vinegar and pull the seal partially open without opening the larger sandwich bag.

, Once you have partially opened the seal of the snack bag of vinegar, give the bag a good shake to allow some of the vinegar to escape into the larger, sealed sandwich bag of baking soda. Once you have jiggled the bag and see the vinegar touch the baking soda, toss the bag down onto an easily cleanable surface., After shaking the bag, the vinegar will collide with the baking soda, and you should see the reaction start and the bag start to expand. When the bag has expanded to its fullest extent, it will explode with a loud pop!"

Toss down the bag and watch the explosion.",How to Make a Bomb Bag2," Another good way of making a bomb bag is to wrap baking soda inside paper towel and place it in a sandwich bag of vinegar. The baking soda gradually mixes with the vinegar, working in a similar way as using two bags, though easier to activate. To begin, place ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar and ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of warm water inside a snack sized bag., To make the small pack of baking soda, place one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda in the middle of a 6 by 6 inch (15.24 by 15.24 cm) square of paper towel. Then fold the sides of the paper towel in to make a sort of parcel that holds the baking soda.The satchel of baking soda doesn’t have to be completely foolproof, but it should be able to sit without the sides folding down and the baking soda pouring out.

, Once you make the parcel of baking soda, place it carefully inside the sandwich bag, making sure that no baking soda falls out of the satchel before you have time to seal the bag., After you place the satchel inside the sandwich bag, immediately seal the zip on the sandwich bag. Then give the bag a shake until you see the satchel coming undone and the baking soda pouring out., Once you see that the satchel has unfolded and the baking soda is mixing with the vinegar, toss the bag down somewhere outside or on an easily cleanable surface. Watch the bag expand and then explode like a bomb."
"
Add a tablespoon (14.78 ml) of baking soda to a sandwich bag.,
Pour in a tablespoon (14.8 ml) of dish detergent.,
Add ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar to the sandwich bag.,
Seal the bag immediately.,
Place the bag down and watch the explosion.",How to Make a Bomb Bag3," An easy way to make an effective bomb bag is to add detergent to the baking soda in the bomb bag, which acts as a retardant for the chemical reaction so that you have time to seal the bag before the baking soda and vinegar react. Begin making the bomb bag by adding ¼ cup (4.78 ml) of baking soda to a sealable sandwich bag., Once you have added the baking soda, add one tablespoon (14.78 ml) of dishwashing detergent into the sandwich bag. Shake the bag slightly to allow the detergent to combine with the baking soda., After adding in the dishwashing detergent, pour in ¼ cup (59.14 ml) of vinegar into the sandwich bag of baking soda and detergent., Once you add the vinegar, immediately zip the seal of the bag. Even though the detergent slows down the chemical reaction, it’s still essential to zip the bag at once so that the pressure can build inside the bag.Not closing the bag in time can cause a significantly smaller explosion or it can cause the fizzing reaction to happen before the closing of the bag, so that even when you close the bag it won’t explode.

, Once you seal the bag, place or toss it down onto a easily cleanable surface. Then watch the pressure build and the bag explode!"

If you want to make more plastic or do this experiment more than once, you will need more milk and vinegar.Any type of animal milk will work: nonfat, 1%, 2%, and whole milk.
An old t-shirt will work fine as the cotton cloth.
You will be working with hot liquid so adult supervision is recommended.
Whole milk or heavy cream will work best. 1% or 2% may not work well.;
, Measure out 1 cup (8 ounces or 250 mL) of milk. This experiment can be done using either the microwave or heating the milk on the stove. Use a microwave safe container if using the microwave. Pour the milk into a cookpot if using the stove. Heat the milk until it is just under boiling.If you have a candy thermometer, make sure the temperature is at least 120°F (49°C).Stir the milk continuously if heating on the stove.
Have an adult help you with this step.
To microwave milk, put your microwave on 50% power for about two minutes. After two minutes, microwave in 30 second increments until the milk is hot., While the milk is still hot, add all of the vinegar to the container and stir for about one minute.As you stir, you should notice that clumps will start to form. If no clumps form, the milk was probably not hot enough for the reaction to occur. Try again with hotter milk.


When the hot milk comes into contact with the vinegar, the protein casein gets pulled out of the milk. The casein all sticks together and forms clumps or curds., If you’re using an old t-shirt, wrap the t-shirt around the mouth of a jar or over a bowl. Rubber band it in place so it doesn’t move around. If you’re using a mesh strainer, simply place the strainer on top of the bowl. Let the milk cool for a bit and then pour it over the strainer and let it drain.As the milk drains through the strainer, you will see the clumps remaining on top of the strainer.

, If you’re using a cloth, remove the rubber band and wrap up the curds. Squeeze the bag until you get as much of the liquid out as possible. If using a strainer, scoop out the curds onto paper towels using your hands or a spoon.


Squeeze the curds on the paper towel to get out any extra moisture.

, If you’d like to make something out of your plastic, it needs to be done in the first hour while the curds are still moldable. You can use cookies cutters, molds, food coloring, glitter, or any other decorative materials you would like.If you want to get really into it, you can use sculpting tools.
Paint and markers can also be used once the plastic is completely dry.

, Before you begin, you will need to squeeze all of your curds together into a dough-like substance. Once it’s clumped into one blob, knead the dough well. Work it with your hands for a few minutes until it is easy to shape and form.Wait until the curds have cooled completely before handling them.

, Once the dough has been well kneaded, you can roll it out and cut shapes using cookie cutters. You can also press the dough into a mold to form a shape. Remove it from the mold and set it aside to dry. Alternatively, you can sculpt the dough as you would with clay or play dough into any form you’d like.You can add food coloring if you’d like all your shapes to be the same color or you can wait for them to dry and paint them later. Add some food coloring to the dough and work it until the color is even throughout the dough. Gel food coloring works better than liquid.

, Roll the dough into round beads and poke a hole through the center using a straw. This will make beads that you can string into a necklace or bracelet. Add glitter while the beads are still wet and it will stick as it dries.Set the beads aside to dry. Check on them in a few days to make sure they are completely dry.

, The plastic will take a few days to dry out completely. If you don’t want to do anything else with the plastic, simply leave it alone for a few days until it is dry. If you have molded it into something, you’ll need to wait until it is dry to use it.Once it’s dry, you can paint it or decorate it however you would like.

, Using craft paint or permanent markers, color your creations however you’d like. You have to wait until the plastic is completely dry before you add paint or color with markers.Once the paint is dry, you can make jewelry or play with your sculpted creations!

Get a large beaker or substantial glass container.,
Make sure you have appropriate safety gear.,
Gather the chemicals you will need.,
Prepare an area for assembly.,
Make the silica solution.,
Drop the metal salts into the solution.,
Watch the crystals grow.,
Give your garden time to grow.,
Clean up the experiment properly.",How to Make a Chemical Garden," You will need a large beaker or glass container that can be heated slightly without breaking. A beaker between 200 milliliters (6.8  fl oz) and 500mL should work well.This will allow you to make the silica solution and assemble the chemical garden all in the same container.


A chemistry beaker works well because it can be heated and because it may have measurements on the side that allow you to measure the correct amount of water to start your solution.;
, You will need to wear goggles and gloves during the project.This will help protect you from the potential chemical burns or contact with known carcinogens that can come from skin contact with certain metal.You may also want to wear something to cover your clothes. This could be either an apron or a lab coat.
You will also need a pair of forceps or tweezers that you can use to handle the metal salts. Even though you will be wearing gloves, it is best to use forceps to avoid the risk of contact.

, First, you will need the chemicals required to make the sodium silicate solution. This consists of 32 grams (1.1 oz) of sodium hydroxide and 48 grams (1.7 oz) of crushed silica gel beads. You will also need metal salts to add to the solution. These can vary widely, depending on what you want to use and what is available to you.


Metals salts to use include copper sulphate (produces blue), nickel nitrate (produces green), iron chloride (produces orange), manganese chloride (produces purple), cobalt chloride (produces red), and magnesium sulfate (produces pink). Each one will produce a different color and will grow at a different rate.You can purchase all of these chemicals online. They are usually distributed by chemical companies that provide chemicals for school or business chemistry labs.

, You will want to create your chemical garden in a spot where the beaker can sit for a few days undisturbed. You also want to assure that the area is clear of clutter and can be cleaned if you happen to accidentally drop any of the metal salts outside of the beaker.


If are doing this project on a table that you don't want accidentally damaged, consider covering it with newspaper. This paper should be taped down, so that it doesn't move and cause your beaker to move as well.
When doing a chemistry project, it's a good idea to do it in an area that has good ventilation. This will allow you to avoid the dangers of chemicals mixing and producing fumes. However, this project, as described, should not produce any toxic fumes or gases.

, To make the silica silicate solution, also known as water glass, you will need to combine the sodium hydroxide and silica beads with water. Begin by filling the beaker with 80 milliliters (2.7  fl oz) of water. Heat the water slightly, as this will help the chemicals you are adding dissolve into the water.Add 32 grams of sodium hydroxide and mix until thoroughly combined.
Then add 48 grams (1.7 oz) of crushed silica gel beads to the solution and stir until combined.
Make sure the silica solution is at room temperature before moving on with the project. The chemical reaction you are looking for with a chemical garden does not require heat, so you may need to let the solution cool for awhile before it is used.

, Use the forceps or tweezers you got to handle the chemicals. Remember, you should also be wearing gloves while doing this, just to be safe.


Try to drop the metal salts so they are scattered evenly across the bottom of the beaker. This will allow each piece to grow unblocked by other pieces sitting on top of them.Using a variety of metal salts creates a more visually interesting garden. This is because the salts are colored differently, grow at different rates, and grow in different shapes., The crystal tubes grow because the metal salts interact with the silica solution. More specifically, the metal ions are interacting with the silicate ions. , You should allow the garden to grow for several days without moving it around very much. Moving it around could break the growing tubes.


Giving it several days to grow will make for a spectacular garden.

, When you are done with the experiment, it should be disposed of properly. Consult local regulations about disposal of the chemicals you used.In a few cases, the whole garden can simply be washed down the drain, but many of the salts that can be used are hazardous to the environment. Because of this, you need to look up the regulations about disposal of the specific metal salts you used.

Leave the top and bottom of the carton intact.Save the panel that you cut out for later.
You can also use a plastic juice carton instead.
If the carton is dirty, take a moment to clean it.

, Place the plastic tube against the bottom of your carton. Make sure that it is centered, then trace around the plastic tube using a pen, the set the tube aside. Cut the hole out just inside the outline using a craft blade., Place the tube, along with the balloon, into the carton. Push the end of the tube out through the hole you just cut out. The balloon should be on the inside of the carton., Push the tube downward as far as it can go without actually bending anything. Draw a ring of hot glue around the seams both on the inside and outside of the boat. This will also help create an airtight seal and prevent any water from getting into the boat., Straighten out a paper clip, but leave one of the ends bent at a 90-degree angle. Duct tape the paper clip to the bottom of your boat, just below the plastic tube. Make sure that the bent part is flat against the bottom of your carton.You will attach the rudder to this, which will help make you boat go straight., Cut a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) square out of the plastic panel you cut out earlier. Place it against the paper clip, just below the bottom edge of the carton. Make sure that it is perpendicular to the bottom of the carton, then wrap a piece of duct tape around the paper clip and the plastic square.If there is ay paper clip sticking out from under the rudder, you can cut it off with a pair of wire cutters. You can also fold it up against the rudder instead. 


, Hold the balloon's tail firmly against the plastic tube.

Find a tube that fits around the neck of the bottle.,
Cut the tube to size.,
Attach the tube to a base.,
Place the launcher in a good location.",How to Make a Baking Soda and Vinegar Rocket2," A toilet paper or paper towel tube will work in a pinch but probably can’t be used more than once because the cardboard will get soggy when the rocket launches. A more durable option is to use a piece of PVC pipe.








, Since it will sit underneath the bottle to hold it up, it should be long enough to keep the mouth of the bottle off the ground but not so long that the rocket doesn’t sit stably inside it.










Get an adult to help you cut the PVC pipe if necessary.

, Gluing it to a wide piece of wood will work well.








, Ideally, place it on a hill (for extra height), on a slight slope (so that the rocket will launch at an angle), and pointing with the wind.

Wait for the rocket to launch.",How to Make a Baking Soda and Vinegar Rocket3," Any kind/type will work, but white vinegar will make the least mess.








, This will allow you to add the baking soda to the vinegar without having it explode immediately. You will need several large spoonfuls of baking soda to make the rocket powerful. The easiest way to do this is to put baking soda on a square of cling wrap, fold the corners up, and twist the wrap several times to hold the powder. When you put this in the vinegar later, it will unravel slowly.








, When the time comes, you’ll need to cover the mouth of the rocket to hold the fuel inside. Of course, you don’t want to cover it so well that nothing comes out. The best way to do this is with a balloon:










Cut a piece of balloon that fits over the mouth and neck of the bottle. Make sure it’s big enough to cover the whole neck, but don’t use the whole balloon; save the extra for other launches.

With a marker, draw a dot in the center of the piece of balloon.

Poke a tiny hole in the center of the dot with a pin. The dot will let you know where the hole is later.

Set the balloon aside (along with a rubber band). You’ll need quick access to these when you launch, so don’t lose them.

, Try not to agitate the bottle, which will make the cling wrap unravel faster.








, The dot help you make sure the hole is centered. The hole may drip a bit, but when the rocket launches, it will allow the fuel to shoot out.








, Placing fins on your rocket that sit lower than the mouth will allow you to use the fins as a stand. (See Rocket Body below for tips.) If you don’t want to add fins to your rocket, see Rocket Launcher below for design instructions.










To make a faster, easier rocket launcher, shove a straight stick / thin piece of wood into the ground (a bamboo skewer might work, tape a narrow tube (a rolled up piece of paper or even a drinking straw might work) to the side of the rocket, and simply slip the tube over the stick to hold the rocket up. Make sure the stick sits firmly in the ground. Insert it at a 45-degree angle if you want the rocket to go farther.

, If you’ve made the baking-soda container properly, it should take at least a few seconds for the baking soda to release into and react with the vinegar.

Understand what an ecosystem consists of.,
Learn about the concept of ecosystem services.,
Make a class project on learning more about ecosystems.",How to Learn About the Biodiversity Benefits of Ecosystems," Ecosystems are made up of many different species. Just as human beings live in communities, so do animals, plants and microorganisms. An ecosystem exists where a community of plants, animals or microorganisms co-exist. There is a wide range of possible ecosystems, which can be as small as a puddle or as large as a desert, forest, wetland, mountain, lake or river.;
, Ecosystems are homes to the animals, plants and microorganisms. In addition, ecosystems provide ""services"" in the way of natural resources and processes that maintain the conditions for life on Earth. The types of ecosystem services include:


Food provision

Pollination of plants for food production and plant products
Clean air

Water for drinking and using
Fuel
Regulation of water to prevent flooding - for example, mangrove swamps help prevent flooding
Waste removal - breaking down of wastes and recycling nutrients; this is important for growing food
""Natural insurance"" - insurance against future unknown conditions brought about by climate change or other events
Cultural value of natural landscapes to people's religious beliefs and leisure activities such as camping and hiking

Aesthetics - this means enjoying the natural environment for its own sake.

, As a class, in groups or individually, prepare projects on different types of ecosystems and demonstrate the benefits derived from each ecosystem. Some ways of doing this include:


Preparing a model of an ecosystem (desert, mountain, forest etc.) and highlighting the ecosystem services that can be found in this ecosystem; use arrows, yarn or other indicators to make it clear which services you are highlighting
Prepare an ecosystem life-cycle chart. It can be visually helpful to draw large posters of ecosystems with feedback arrows to show the class how ecosystem services work. Leave this on the wall for several weeks so that everyone in the class has an opportunity to see the charts. Ecosystem cycles to consider include water, nitrogen, solar, carbon etc. See the image accompanying this step for an idea of how to put the chart together.
Writing small presentation papers on ecosystems and their benefits; perhaps accompany with a slide show (computer or slide projector), photos, images or illustrations
Writing a play about living in a certain type of ecosystem and presenting all the negative things about life when the ecosystem services break down. For example, a play set in a village in a deforested environment might show the impacts on a family unable to get clean drinking water, suffering from food shortages and relying on monotype crops. End the play with positive actions for remedying the damage; for example, show the village planting more trees again, putting in a ground well to get underground water supplies and re-introduction of native species of plants and animals.

Prepare the agar.,
Prepare the petri dishes.,
Refrigerate the petri dishes until ready to use.,
Introduce bacteria to the petri dishes.,
Label and seal the petri dishes.,
Place the petri dishes in a warm, dark place.,
Record your results.,
Test the effectiveness of antibacterial agents.,
Take the proper safety precautions.,
Pour bleach into the petri dishes.",How to Grow Bacteria in a Petri Dish," Agar is the jelly-like substance used to culture bacteria. It is made from a type of red algae which provides an ideal growing surface for many different types of bacteria. Some types of agar contain added nutrients (such as sheep's blood) which help to promote more vigorous bacterial growth.


The easiest type of agar to use for this experiment is a nutrient agar which comes in powder form. You will need as much agar as you need, but don't use less than 1.2 grams (approximately half a teaspoon) of agar powder for every 4-inch petri dish you wish to use.
In a heat proof dish or bowl, stir half a teaspoon of the nutrient agar powder into 60 ml (approximately 1/4 cup) of hot water. Multiply these quantities for however many petri dishes you plan on using.
Place the bowl or dish in the microwave and begin to boil for one minute, watching to make sure that the agar solution doesn't boil over.
When the solution is ready, the agar powder should be completely dissolved and the liquid should be clear in color.
Allow the agar solution to cool for several minutes before proceeding.;
, Petri dishes are small flat-bottomed containers made from clear glass or plastic. They have two halves - a top and a bottom - which slot into one another. This protects the contents from any unwanted contaminated air, but also allows any gasses produced by the bacteria to escape.


Petri dishes must be completely sterilized before they are used for growing bacteria, otherwise the results of the experiment could be affected. Newly purchased petri dishes should come pre-sterilized and sealed in plastic packaging.
Remove the petri dish from its packaging and separate the two halves. Very carefully, pour the warm agar solution into the bottom half of the petri dish - just enough to form a layer over the bottom of the dish.
Quickly replace the top half of the petri dish to prevent any airborne bacteria from contaminating the experiment. Set the petri dishes aside for 30 minutes to 2 hours, until the agar solution cools and hardens (when its ready it will resemble set Jell-O)., If you don't plan on using the agar-filled petri dishes immediately, they should be stored in the refrigerator until you are ready to proceed with the experiment.


Storing the petri dishes in the refrigerator prevents the water inside the dishes from evaporating (bacteria need a moist environment to grow). It also allows the surface of the agar to harden slightly, which prevents any tearing or gouging when you transfer your bacteria samples.
When storing petri dishes in the refrigerator, the dishes should be placed upside down. This helps to prevent any condensation on the lid from dropping down and disrupting the growing surface.
Agar-filled petri dishes will keep in the refrigerator for as long as a couple of months. When you are ready to use them, remove them from the refrigerator and allow them to reach room temperature before introducing your samples.

, Once the agar solution has hardened and the petri dishes are at room temperature, you are ready for the fun part - introducing the bacteria. There a couple of methods of doing this - through direct contact or through sample collection.



Direct contact: This is when bacteria is transferred to the petri dish using direct contact, i.e. touching the agar. One of the most common ways of doing this is to simply press your fingertip (either before or after washing your hands) lightly onto the surface of the agar. However, you could also try pressing a fingernail or the surface of an old coin into the agar, or even placing a small hair or drop of milk into the dish. Use your imagination!

Sample collection: With this method, you can collect bacteria from almost any surface and transfer it to the petri dish, all you need are some clean cotton swabs. Simply grab a swab and swipe it over of any surface you can think of - the inside of your mouth, a door handle, the keys on your computer keyboard or the buttons of your remote control - then use it streak the surface of the agar (without tearing it). These places harbor a lot of bacteria, and should provide some interesting (and disgusting) results in a couple days time.
If you like, you can place more than one sample of bacteria in each petri dish - all you need to do is divide the dish into quadrants (quarters) and swipe a different sample of bacteria in each of them.
It is recommended that you keep one quadrant of the petri dish free of bacteria sample to use as a control group. This allows you to know if the agar had been contaminated prior to the introduction of bacterial samples.

, Once you have introduced the bacteria, you should replace the lid on the petri dish and seal it with some tape.


Make sure to label each petri dish with the source of the bacteria it contains, otherwise you won't be able to tell which is which. You can do this using some tape and a marker.
As an extra precaution, you can place each petri dish in a zipper-lock bag. This will provide an extra layer of protection against any hazardous bacteria colonies that may develop, but will still allow you to view the contents of the petri dish.

, Leave the petri dishes in a warm, dark place where the bacteria can develop, undisturbed, for several days. Remember to store the dishes upside down, so the bacterial growth remains undisturbed by any water droplets.


The ideal temperature for growing bacteria is between 70 and 98 degrees F (20-37 degrees C). If necessary, you can place the petri dishes in a cooler location, but the bacteria will grow a lot more slowly.
Leave the bacteria to develop for 4-6 days, as this will give the cultures enough time to grow. Once the bacteria begins to grow, you may notice a smell coming from the dishes.

, After a couple of days, you will notice an amazing variety of bacteria, molds and fungi growing inside each petri dish.


Use a notebook to record your observations on the contents of each dish and perhaps come to a conclusion about which locations had the most bacteria.
Was it the inside of your mouth? The door handle? The buttons on your remote control? The results may surprise you!
If you like, you can measure the daily growth of the bacteria colonies by using a felt-tip marker to trace a circle around each colony on the bottom of the petri dish. After several days, you should have a collection of concentric rings on the bottom of each dish.

, An interesting variation on this experiment is to introduce an antibacterial agent (hand sanitizer, soap, etc.) to the petri dish in order to test its effectiveness.


Once you have introduced bacteria to the petri dish, use a cotton swab to place a small drop of hand sanitizing gel, disinfectant soap or household bleach into the center of the bacteria sample, then continue the experiment as normal.
As the bacteria in the dish grows, you should see a ring or ""halo"" around the spot where you placed the antibacterial agent where no bacteria is growing. This is known as the ""kill zone"" (or more accurately, the ""zone of inhibition"").
You can measure the effectiveness of different antibacterial agents by comparing the size of the kill zones in each petri dish. The wider the kill zone, the more effective the antibacterial agent.

, Before you attempt to dispose of your petri dishes, you first need to take the proper safety precautions.


Although most of the bacteria you grow will not be hazardous, large bacteria colonies may pose more of a risk - so you will need to kill them before disposal using household bleach.
Protect your hands from the bleach by wearing rubber gloves, protect your eyes with plastic goggles and protect your clothes by wearing an apron.

, Open the petri dish and carefully pour a small amount of bleach on top of the bacteria colonies, holding the dish over a sink. This will destroy the bacteria.


Be very careful not to let any of the bleach touch your skin, as it will burn.
Then place the disinfected petri dish into a ziplock plastic back and dispose of the bag in the trash.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Make a saturated alum solution.,
Transfer the saturated solution into the clean jar.,
Cover the lid of the jar.,
Leave the jar alone for at least 24 hours.,
Pour the solution only into a clean jar.,
Choose a seed crystal.",How to Grow Alum Crystals1," To grow crystals using this method, you will need alum, two jars, a spoon, hot water, a pencil, some clear string, plastic wrap, and food coloring (optional).The food coloring can be used to alter the color of the crystal if you wish, but is not necessary to the creation of the crystal.


Alum can be found in the spice aisle at the grocery store. It is generally used for pickling vegetables.Alum is nontoxic, but can cause irritation to the eyes. Avoid touching your eyes or wear protective glasses.Glass jars are recommended because you will be using hot water. Also, it is easier to see the crystals form.
The pencil needs to be long enough to sit on top of the jar.;
, In order to start growing your crystal, you need to make a solution of hot water and alum. A saturated solution means that you add enough alum that it can no longer dissolve in the water.The water does not have to be boiling, but the alum will dissolve in warm water faster than in cold water.


Add a cup of hot water to one jar. Stir in a tablespoon of alum until it dissolves. Keep adding alum and stirring until the alum no longer dissolves. You may see a small amount of alum powder at the bottom of the jar.
Add food coloring at this stage to color the water.

, If there is no powder at the bottom of the jar, you can skip this step. If there is powder, pour the alum solution into a new jar, making sure none of the powder gets into the new jar.


In order to grow good crystals, you don’t want any particles in the solution.
Wash the original jar, you will use it again later for the second stage of growing.

, You want to keep any dust or dirt particles out of the jar. Do this by covering the lid with plastic wrap, foil, or placing a piece of cardboard over the top. Plastic wrap or foil are preferable because you can make a tighter seal.For a strong seal, wrap a rubber band around the plastic wrap or foil.

, Store the jar in a place that is out of the way and won’t be bumped by anyone. If the jar gets jostled, no crystals will form. Locations with warmer air will help the crystals grow faster. Let the jar sit for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours check for crystal formation.You can leave the jar for longer, but if you have crystals at the bottom, you can use these as seeds to grow larger crystals.

, Once you have crystals formed at the bottom of the jar, you need to transfer the solution to a new jar so you can choose your seed crystals. When you pour, take care not to let any crystals fall into the new jar. You want only the alum solution to be in the new jar.


You can also add another spoonful of alum to the jar to replace the alum that formed into crystals.

, Pour the crystals out of the bottom of the jar and dry them off with a paper towel. Examine them and choose the largest transparent crystal with flat sides. This crystal will serve as the base to grow your larger crystal.You may notice that some of the crystals are overlapping. These will not work well to grow larger crystals. Choose a single crystal to use as a seed.

"
"
Tie a piece of clear string around the seed crystal.,
Suspend the crystal in the saturated alum solution.,
Cover the top of the jar.,
Leave the jar alone for at least 24 hours.,
Add more alum to the solution to grow the crystal larger.,
Admire your crystal.",How to Grow Alum Crystals2," Take your piece of clear string and make a loop around the crystal tying it in place. The string needs to be tight enough to hold the crystal in place once it is suspended. Alternatively, you can glue the string to the crystal with a dab of superglue.Clear string is recommended because the crystal will grow around it. Darker colors will be seen in the crystal.
Tie the other end of the string around a pencil or popsicle stick.
Use caution if you choose to use superglue to attach the string.

, Use the original solution that you used to grow the seed crystals. Place the pencil across the mouth of the jar so that the crystal hangs down into the solution.If you didn’t already, you can add more alum to the solution to replace what formed into crystals during the seed formation stage.
Make sure the solution is cooled to room temperature before placing the seed crystal into it. If the water is warm, it will dissolve., To keep out dust and dirt, tightly cover the jar. Dust and dirt particles can mess up the crystal formation. Cover the top of the jar with plastic wrap or foil. Even placing a napkin or piece of paper over the top will be sufficient to cover it.


You can make a tighter seal by placing a rubber band around the plastic wrap or foil.

, Store the jar in a place that it will remain undisturbed. If the jar gets bumped or moved around, the crystals will not grow. It may take a few days for the crystal to start to grow in size.Keep the crystal in a cool place so it doesn’t dissolve.
After a few days, check on the crystal. You can tell how much it has grown by the location of the clear string within the crystal.

, After a few days, you may notice that the crystal doesn’t seem to be growing. This is likely due to the fact the solution is no longer saturated. As the crystal grows, alum is taken out of the solution and added to the crystal. To keep the crystal growing, simply add more alum.Remove the crystal, add a spoonful of alum and stir until dissolved. Replace the crystal and let it grow for a few more days.
You can repeat this process until your crystal is at the desired size.

, You can keep it in a glass case or out in the open. Make sure you don't get it wet as it can dissolve the crystal. To clean off dust, take a dry, soft rag and carefully pat the crystal.


Try making crystals of different sizes and colors.
If you do accidentally get your finished crystal wet, quickly take a paper towel or a cloth and pat dry until the water is mostly dry. It might dissolve, but it won't dissolve as much.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Paint glue on the eggshells.,
Sprinkle alum on the glue before it dries.,
Make a saturated alum solution.,
Place the egg in the saturated alum solution.,
Let the container sit for at least 24 hours.",How to Grow Alum Crystals3," To make fake geodes you will need eggshells, a glass container, alum, hot water, craft glue, a small paintbrush, and food coloring. All of these items are readily available at the grocery store. You can find alum in the spice aisle as it is used for pickling vegetables.The eggshells need to be cut in half, washed out, and dried before use.
The food coloring is optional, but it allows you to color the crystals of the geode.
The glass container needs to be large enough for the eggshell to be completely immersed in water.

, Pour some craft glue onto a piece of newspaper and use a paintbrush to coat the inside of the eggshell. You only need a thin layer of glue; just enough for the alum to stick to the surface.Don’t let the glue dry between this step and the next.

, While the glue is still wet, sprinkle some alum powder onto the glue. The powdered alum will serve as a starting point for a crystal to grow. If you want smaller crystals, completely coat the inside of the egg with alum because the crystals will not be able to grow very large when they are close together.If you want larger crystals, lightly sprinkle the alum making sure there is some space between the powder granules.
Leave the eggshell to dry overnight.

, Use hot water to make a solution that is completely saturated with alum (no more alum will dissolve). Use enough water to fill your container so that the eggshell will be completely immersed. Add a tablespoon of alum and stir to dissolve. Keep adding alum until no more dissolves in the water. At this point, the solution is saturated.Add food coloring to change the color of the geode.
Cool the solution to room temperature.

, Once the solution is cooled, transfer it to the container you will use for the growth phase. Gently place the egg into the container and make sure it is completely covered by the solution.Cover the top of the container with plastic wrap or foil to keep dust out.

, As time passes, the alum crystals will grow larger from the starting points on the eggshell. It can take a few days for the crystals to grow to a respectable size. Check on the eggshell geode each day and remove it from the solution when you are satisfied with the growth of the crystals.Store the experiment in a place where it will not be bumped. If it gets bumped or moved around, the crystals will not form properly.
Once you remove the eggshell from the solution, you will have made an alum crystal geode!

Heat some water.,
Add Epsom salt to the water.,
Stir the solution.,
Chill the solution.,
Leave the solution overnight.,
Pour off the excess liquid.,
Observe the crystals.,
Try it with food coloring.,
Leave the solution longer.",How to Grow Crystals from Epsom Salt," You can heat the water on the stove, but do not bring it to a boil. You can also simplify this step by using hot tap water.If your tap water does not get very hot, you can microwave the water for 45 seconds.Do not boil water without adult supervision.
Try the experiment with one cup of water.;
, You should add Epsom salt in a 1:1 ratio. This will allow the solution to become fully saturated. You will notice that a small amount of Epsom salt remains in the bottom of the container undissolved.Epsom salts will not react with traditional pots or stir sticks in any meaningful way.
For one cup of water, add one cup of Epsom salt.

, You should stir the solution for about two minutes. This will allow as much salt as possible to dissolve. If you dissolve too little salt, the crystals will not form correctly., Place the solution in the freezer for ten minutes. This allows the temperature of the solution to drop rapidly for the first few minutes. This will prepare the solution to go into the refrigerator, and will typically yield better crystals., Place the solution in the refrigerator and leave it overnight. Two things will happen. First, the decreased humidity in the refrigerator will allow some of the water to evaporate from the container. Second, the cooler temperature will force the water molecules to contract and get closer together. This makes less space in the solution for salt molecules and forces them to come together as a solid (crystals).You can leave the jar covered or uncovered while sitting. Just be sure not to tip it over.

, When you remove the solution, pour off the excess liquid immediately. Be careful not to upset any crystals that have formed. If you allow the crystals to remain in the water, they will redissolve as the water heats up., Once you have poured off the excess liquid, you can look at your crystals. If you do the experiment more than once, or in multiple containers, you’ll notice that all of the crystals have a similar shape and structure. That’s because the same chemicals (in this case magnesium and chlorine) will always form the same kind of crystal., Magnesium chloride forms a white crystal. If you want colorful crystals to observe, try adding food coloring to the solution. You can also add watercolor paints for a splash of color., Overnight crystals are a great way to get kids started with a science experiment. If you want to take it a step further, leave the crystals in the refrigerator for several days, or longer. This will allow them more time to grow and result in larger, more developed crystals."

Fill a jar halfway with warm water.,
Stir in some alum.,
Extract a seed crystal.,
Tie a string around the crystal and suspend it in the second jar.,
Wait a week for the crystal to grow.",How to Grow Crystals1," Make sure the jar is clean, since you don't want other substances interfering with your crystals. It's best to use a clear jar so you can see the formation process of the crystals.;
, Pour a few tablespoons of alum into the jar and use a spoon to stir the mixture until the alum dissolves. Pour more alum in and continue stirring. Keep doing this until no more alum will dissolve in the water. Let the mixture sit for a few hours. As the water begins to evaporate, crystals will form on the bottom of the jar.


Alum is a mineral used for pickling cucumbers and other vegetables, and can be found in the spice aisle of your grocery store.
You'll know you've reached the point where no more alum will dissolve when it begins to accumulate at the bottom of the jar.

, Choose the biggest, best looking newly formed crystal to extract. Then pour the liquid from the jar into a clean jar (try not to fill the clean jar with undissolved alum) and use a tweezers to reach down into the jar and extract the crystal from the bottom.


If the crystals are still quite small, wait a few hours before extracting a seed crystal.
If you would prefer to keep growing the crystals in the first jar, let them sit for a week or so. At that point the bottom and sides of the jars should be lined with crystals.

, Use a thin nylon string or a piece of floss. Secure it around the crystal, then secure the other end around a pencil. Rest the pencil on the rim of the second jar and suspend the crystal in the solution.

, When the crystal has grown to a shape and size that you like, remove it from the water. Untie the string and enjoy the crystal you have made.

Make a water and alum solution.,
Stir food coloring into the jar.,
Bend pipe cleaners into ornament shapes.,
Hook the pipe cleaners over the edge of the jar.,
Wait for the crystals to form.",How to Grow Crystals2," Fill a jar halfway with water, then dissolve several spoonfuls of alum in the water. Continue adding alum until no more will dissolve.


You may also use salt or borax instead of alum.
If you would like to make ornaments in several different colors, divide the solution among more than one jar.

, Add a few drops of red, blue, yellow, green, or any color of your choice to the solution in the jar. If you prepared several jars of solution, add different colored drops to each jar.


Mix different drops of food coloring to make a unique color. For example, combine 4 drops of yellow with one drop of blue to make a pale green color, or mix red and blue to make purple.
For festive holiday ornaments, dye the solutions colors that match your holiday decorations.

, Shape them into trees, stars, snowflakes, pumpkins, or any other shape you'd like to make. Make the shapes clear and recognizable, keeping in mind that the pipe cleaners will be covered with crystals, so the outlines of the different shapes will be thick.

, Submerge the shaped part of the each pipe cleaner in the jar so that the shape is suspended in the center of the jar, not touching the sides or bottom. Hook the other end of the pipe cleaner over the edge of the jar, bending it a little to keep it in place.


If you have jars with solution dyed more than one color, choose colors that match the shapes you created with the pipe cleaner. For example, if you made a tree pipe cleaner you could suspend it in a jar with green solution.
If you suspend more than one pipe cleaner in the same jar, don't let them touch each other.

, Let the pipe cleaners sit in the jar or jars for a week or two, until you like the size of the crystals. When you're satisfied with the way they look, remove your new crystal ornaments from the jars. Pat them dry with paper towels. The ornaments are now ready to hang.

Make a water and sugar solution.,
Add color and flavor.,
Suspend wooden chopsticks in the solution.,
Cover the jar with plastic wrap.,
Wait for the crystals to form.",How to Grow Crystals3," To make rock candy, use sugar as your crystal base, rather than alum or salt. Fill a jar halfway with warm water and stir in as much sugar as you can until it dissolves.


The most common type of sugar to use is white granulated sugar, but you can experiment with brown sugar, raw sugar, and other types of sugar.
Don't use artificial sweeteners in place of sugar.

, Make your rock candy more appetizing by adding a few drops of food coloring and natural flavoring to the solution. Try these different flavor and color combinations, or create your own:


Red food coloring with cinnamon flavoring.
Yellow food coloring with lemon flavoring.
Green food coloring with spearmint flavoring.
Blue food coloring with raspberry flavoring.

, Place a few wooden chopsticks in the jar and lean their ends against the rim. If you don't have chopsticks, you can use wooden skewers or popsicle sticks.

, Since you're working with sugar, the solution may attract bugs while the crystals are forming. Cover the jars with plastic wrap to prevent bugs from getting inside.

, After one or two weeks, the sticks will be covered with pretty crystals. Remove them from the jar, let them dry, then enjoy and share them with your friends.

Gather your supplies.,
Build your crystal sphere.,
Suspend the sphere.,
Boil and dye water.,
Stir in borax.,
Dunk and suspend.,
Cover and leave.,
Celebrate or try again.",How to Grow a Round Crystal1," You will need Powdered Borax, a packet of fuzzy pipe cleaners, a heat proof glass container (such as a beaker), neon food coloring, a pencil or skewer, a measuring spoon, scissors, and thread. Your pipe cleaners should either be white, or the color of the crystal you wish to grow.The pipe cleaners are the bones of your crystal. Your crystal will be translucent, so the pipe cleaners will show through if they are a different color than the crystal.;
, Take your pipe cleaners and weave 2-3 into a large, loose sphere. The crystals will grow around the pipe cleaners, so leave plenty of space between the pipe cleaners. Try weaving basic geodesic domes, or just bending and criss-crossing the pipe cleaners until you get a rough sphere. To visualize what your sphere will look like when finished, imagine that each pipe cleaner will ""thicken"" by growing crystals.


Make a few, as you can't predict how the crystals will grow, and some might fare better than others.Weave the pipe cleaners around one another so that the shape is structurally sound.
You can make your sphere whatever size you want, but make sure it will fit easily within the glass container.
For a smaller sphere, pretzel up a single pipe cleaner.

, Take your pencil or skewer, and lay it across the top of your glass container. Cut a piece of string and tie it to your pipe cleaner. Tie the other end to the pencil or skewer, so that your sphere dangles near the bottom of the glass but does not touch the bottom or the sides.Put aside for now.

, Boil 2 liters or so of water, enough to fill half the glass container—if you are using a beaker, you can remove your sphere for now and boil the water in it on the stove. Stir in a few drops of food coloring.

, While the water is still hot, add about nine tablespoons of borax and stir till it dissolves. Keep adding tablespoons of borax until you add a tablespoon of borax that does not entirely dissolve.


Your crystals will be biggest if you add the maximum amount of borax that your water can dissolve.

, While the borax solution is still very hot, add it to the glass container. Dunk your sphere in and out of the solution several times, to shake off air bubbles. Next, suspend the sphere by placing the skewer or pencil atop the glass container.


Reheat the solution if it has cooled.

, Put a magazine, a piece of cardboard, or some other light flat object over the beaker, and leave the whole shebang out on the counter overnight. If you are using a beaker, you can leave it on the stove so that it cools slowly.

, After at least eight hours have passed, lift your crystal from the solution. You should have a sphere covered evenly in translucent lumpy crystals. If you like how it turned out, consider spraying it with a clear acrylic coat, as borax crystals can dissolve if handled or dampened. If you don't like it, simply reheat the solution and try again.Your pipe cleaner structure should be completely obscured by crystals. If it is not, it needs more time in the solution.
If you like it but can see too much space between the pipe cleaners, you can return your structure to the solution so the crystals can continue to grow.

Gather your materials.,
Blow out the egg.,
Cut the shell in half.,
Glue alum powder inside.,
Make your solution.,
Saturate.,
Cool and dip.,
Remove gently and dry.",How to Grow a Round Crystal2," You will need a large white egg, a needle, a paper clip, a drinking straw, scissors, alum powder, white glue, a small paintbrush, a glass container, food coloring or easter egg dye, a spoon, latex gloves, and a drying rack or newspaper., Take the needle and poke a small hole in one end of the egg. Unfold the paper clip and poke it into the egg. Stir to mix the yolk with the egg whites. Poke a hole in the other end of the egg that is large enough to contain a drinking straw. Position the egg above the sink or a bowl, and gently blow through the straw until the egg is empty., Use a small pair of scissors to cut the shell into two tidy halves. If you are having trouble splitting the eggshell, tap it lightly on the counter to crack it. Clean any remaining egg yolk from the shell., Use your small paintbrush to apply white glue to the inside and the edges of each eggshell half. Sprinkle the wet glue with alum powder until the eggshell's inside surface is entirely coated.Leave to dry overnight.

, Boil water and let sit while you get your glass container. Mix two cups of the hot water with 30 drops of food coloring or an entire packet of egg dye in the container. Wear latex gloves to protect your hands from the dye., Add ¾ a cup of alum powder to the hot dye solution. Stir until completely dissolved. If they are not all dissolved, place the solution in the microwave for a few seconds. Otherwise, the alum might not attach to the geode., Let the mixture cool for about half an hour. Then dip one of the dry eggshell into the mixture. Position it at the bottom of the container so that its hollow faces up. Leave for 12-15 hours., Put on your latex gloves and remove the geode very carefully. If you are pleased with the crystals, dry your geode on the rack. If not, return it to the solution for another day or so.You can re-use the solution to geodify the other half of the eggshell! Just the solution in the microwave first, so that the spare crystals dissolve.
The egg shell is part of the geode. Do not attempt to remove it.

The crystals will grow even if your cup is not round.Your crystals will not leave the container you grow them in, so make sure the container is transparent.

, Boil water, or use very hot tap water. Stir a half cup of Epsom salts with a half cup of the hot water. Stir until almost all of the salt dissolves., Add a couple of drops of food coloring. If you do not, your crystals will grow whitish-clear, like ice., Pour your solution into your round cup. Store it in the refrigerator for several hours. Cover with a lid or plastic wrap if you wish. After a few hours, you should have a cup of delicate, fibrous crystals. If you leave it, it may last for months.Display your cup of crystals in a window so that the light shines through.

Teach your child about atoms and molecules.,
Explain acids and bases.,
Show your child the pH scale.,
Teach the concept of neutrality.,
Emphasize safety.,
Introduce your child to litmus paper.,
Teach the properties of acids and bases.,
Gather safe examples for a taste test.,
Ask your child to taste items and guess whether they are acids or bases.,
Gather your materials.,
Make an indicator with cabbage leaves.,
Look at your substances.,
Perform the experiment.,
Experiment with neutralization.,
Review the results.",How to Explain Acids and Bases to Kids," Tell your child that everything around us is made up of elements and atoms and molecules.


As an example, use water. Explain to your child that water’s symbol is H2O. The “H” stands for hydrogen; the “O” stands for oxygen. Therefore, “H2O” indicates that there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bound together. A water molecule may be broken into parts, each with one OH and one H element.;
, If a liquid produces more hydroxide (OH), it is a base; if it produces more hydrogen (H), it is an acid.


It helps, when explaining complex concepts, to know your child’s learning style. Does your child learn best through watching, listening, or physically doing something? When it doubt, use a combination of visual, auditory, and practical methods: most kids respond well to pictures, sounds, experiments, and things that engage their senses.

, Tell your child that scientists came up with a way of telling how acidic or basic various substances were by assigning them a number on a pH scale. The scale of acids and bases is fourteen degrees. Draw the scale (or print one from the internet) and explain to your child that substances with a value of one to seven (having a low pH value) are acidic, while substances with a value of seven to fourteen (having a high pH value) are basic.


It might help to label your pH scale with names or pictures of everyday items that are either acidic or basic, in their proper places on the scale.

, Substances with a pH of seven are neutral; they are neither acids or bases. Distilled water is an example. Acids and bases can neutralize one another when combined.

, Very acidic substances (around one or below on the pH scale) are dangerous, as are very basic substances (around thirteen or above on the pH scale). Tell your child that he or she should never experiment with such substances.

, Litmus paper reveals whether a substance is an acid or a base. It turns red for acids and blue for bases.


Dip the litmus paper in vinegar. It should turn red to show acidity.
Dip the litmus paper in a solution of baking soda and water. It should turn blue to show that the solution is a base.
Alternatively, you can create homemade test strips. To do that, heat cabbage leaves in water or the microwave until they are soft, then cut them in small pieces, press them onto a coffee filter until the color is absorbed, then remove the cabbage and cut into strips. These strips can be dipped into acids or bases as well.

, In general, acids and bases have certain recognizable characteristics, which your child can notice even without litmus paper.


Acids have a sour taste and can dissolve many materials. Citric acid, vinegar, and battery acid are all examples, as is the gastric acid that breaks down the food we eat.
Bases have a bitter taste and tend to be slimy or slippery. They can break down dirt and plaque by forming hydroxide bubbles and are therefore often used for cleaning. Soaps, dishwashing liquids, detergents, bleaches, hair conditioners, and baking soda are all examples.

, You can grab many acidic and basic items from your kitchen: orange juice, milk, baking soda, lemons, whatever you have on hand.

, Remind your child that acids will taste sour, while bases will taste bitter.

, Kids love experiments and tend to remember concepts better when they have experimented with them themselves. Get your child involved right away by having him or her gather the necessary materials for an experiment: cabbage leaves, a blender, a strainer, water, five plastic gelatin cups, vinegar, baking soda, dish soap, lemon or lime juice, and milk.

, Place four or five leaves in the blender, fill it halfway with water, and puree. Strain the solids out of the blended mixture, and pour the purple liquid into the five plastic gelation cups (putting roughly equal amounts into each cup).


Alternatively, you can make an indicator by filling a saucepan with water, boiling it, and then placing sliced red cabbage leaves into the pan. Let it stand for ten minutes, until the water turns red. Cool to room temperature.

, The five substances you’ve gathered are chemical reagents. If they are acidic, they will turn the purple liquid a bright neon pink; if they are basic, they will turn it a dark blue-green color. Ask your child to make predictions based on how the substances (except for the dish soap, of course) taste.

, Have your child drop a teaspoon of each reagent into one of the five cups. Be sure to save the milk for last. Record all findings as you go, having your child note the particular reagent, its taste, his or her prediction, and the color that results from the experiment.


When your child gets to the milk, you should note that the indicator turns neither bright pink nor dark blue; it becomes a creamy violet color instead. This is because milk is neutral; it sits at the middle of the pH scale and does not taste either sour or bitter. Remind your child of the pH scale and explain that substances get increasingly sour as they get lower on the scale and increasingly bitter as they get higher.

, You can also see what happens when your child adds a base to an acid (or vice versa). Note the fact that you can create a neutral substance by combining reagents.

, Your child should have grasped the concept of pH through the experiment, but review to be sure. Ask him to go over his data and explain to you why substances behaved as they did, then ask follow-up questions to challenge his ability to comprehend the information.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Add 3 tablespoons of vinegar to the bottle.,
Spoon 2 tablespoons of baking soda into the bottle.,
Turn the bottle upside down and position over the plate.",How to Get a Hard Boiled Egg out of a Bottle1," To get the egg out of the bottle using this method, you will need baking soda, vinegar, and a plate. This method uses a chemical reaction to increase the air pressure inside the bottle. The increased air pressure will push the egg out of the bottle.You need about 3 tablespoons of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of baking soda for this.
The plate is just used to catch the egg. You can also do this over a sink if you’d prefer.;
, Pour the vinegar into the bottle, taking care to avoid the egg itself. Exact measurements aren’t necessary, but three tablespoons should be more than enough. Keep the bottle upright during this step., Again, exact measurements aren’t necessary, you just need to add enough baking soda to react with the vinegar. Swirl the bottle to make sure the baking soda and vinegar mix together and start reacting.The baking soda and vinegar react together to form a carbon dioxide gas. As the gas continues to form, the air pressure inside the bottle will increase.

, Immediately after swirling the bottle, flip it upside down so that the egg is blocking the mouth of the bottle. Try to avoid pouring out the baking soda and vinegar mixture.Once the pressure inside the bottle gets high enough, you should see the egg get pushed through the mouth of the bottle onto the plate.

"
"
Turn the bottle upside down.,
Put your mouth around the mouth of the bottle.,
Blow hard into the bottle.",How to Get a Hard Boiled Egg out of a Bottle2," First, you want to turn the bottle upside down until the egg is positioned in the mouth of the bottle. This technique relies on you building up the air pressure behind the egg so it will come back out of the bottle.Make sure the egg is in the mouth of the bottle and the bottle remains upside down for the whole time.

, Keeping the bottle upside down, bring it above your head so that you can put your mouth around the opening of the bottle.Try to avoid pushing on the egg because it needs to remain in the opening of the bottle.


Keep the bottle upside during this whole process.

, With your mouth around the bottle, start blowing as hard as you can into the bottle. The air will go past the egg and build up the pressure behind it. As the pressure builds, the egg will be pushed back out of the bottle.Depending on how much pressure you build, the egg will either slide out slowly or pop out rather quickly. Take care not to get hit in the face with the egg when you take your mouth off the bottle.If the egg doesn’t come out, you need to blow into the bottle harder.
The egg may land in your mouth, but it should remain intact. Take care not to choke on the egg.

"
"
Obtain a knife.,
Cut the egg into small pieces.Reach into the bottle with the knife and cut the egg into pieces that will be small enough to fit through the mouth of the bottle.,
Remove the egg pieces from the bottle.,
Rinse out the bottle to reuse.",How to Get a Hard Boiled Egg out of a Bottle3," This method requires adult supervision because working with the knife can be dangerous. Because you are working with a hard-boiled egg, you do not need a sharp knife. It needs to be slender enough to fit through the mouth of the bottle.


Make sure the knife is long enough to reach into the bottle and cut the egg.
This method does not keep the egg intact after removal.

, The smaller the pieces, the easier it will be to remove them from the bottle.


If you don’t have a knife, you can also use a spoon to break up the egg into pieces.

, Turn the bottle upside down and shake out the pieces. Hit the bottom of the bottle to get as much out as possible. Hold the bottle over a garbage can during this process to make clean-up easier.


You may not be able to get every little bit out, but this will get the larger pieces out. You can get the rest out by washing the bottle.

, If you want to use this bottle for anything in the future, you will need to rinse it out. There will likely be residue from the egg stuck to the sides of the bottle. Fill the bottle with warm water and swirl it around to remove the remaining egg.


Add some dish soap to really get the bottle clean.

Stimulate their curiosity early.,
Provide stimulating activities that involve the child.,
Choose a variety of educational toys.,
Share in your child's science interests as they develop.,
Share your own science interests, as well.,
Look for opportunities to teach your child science.,
Support your child's interests with age-appropriate books.,
Use the media to your advantage.,
Make time for discussion.",How to Get Children Involved With Science," Interesting children in science can begin as early as infancy, by providing stimulating crib toys, such as mobiles and activity boards. Giving them the chance to touch and then move things will encourage their curiosity about things.;
, Visits to the park, the zoo, local museums, the airport, and drives to more distant locations such as lakes, swamps, and the ocean are all good ways to stimulate your child's interest in his or her environment. You don't have to go outside the house to provide stimulating activities, however; you can stimulate your child's curiosity by pointing out certain things around the house.


When gardening, have your child help you. You can point out the various flowers and plants, as well as worms, caterpillars, and insects.






When you drain water from your kitchen or bathroom sink, let your child watch the water and notice how it swirls as it goes down the drain.

, Toys that children can do a number of things with are the best kinds of toys to provide to stimulate their curiosity and creativity. Simple toys such as blocks are appropriate for very young children; as they get older, you can introduce them to simple jigsaw puzzles and construction toys such as Tinkertoys, Lincoln Logs, and Legos, then follow with toys related to their particular science interests, such as a telescope, microscope, or electronics kit.

, When your child shows an interest in a particular science, take the time to learn something about it yourself. If your child becomes interested in dinosaurs, read about dinosaurs yourself so you can talk about velociraptors and stegosauruses. If your child takes an interest in astronomy, visit the local planetarium or astronomy club with him or her.

, If you have a science-related passion of your own, share it with your child. If you work in a science lab, arrange for your child to visit you at work, either alone or with the rest of his or her class. If you keep an aquarium, let your child help feed the fish. Present your interest in a way that gets your child involved, and your child may learn to like it, too.

, Build on the related interests your child has developed. If your child asks about certain types of flowers, use the opportunity to talk about seeds and bulbs and encourage him or her to plant some and watch the flowers grow. If your child notices how the moon is brighter one night than the next, spend the next month observing the moon's phases with him or her. If your child likes to cook, point out how sugar melts into syrup or how vinegar makes milk curdle.

, Good science books should present accurate information in an entertaining manner with appropriate language, sufficient pictures, and charts. Small children will be happier with thinner books with mostly pictures, while older children can handle thicker, more detailed books. If you can't afford to buy many books, you can check them out of the local public library; your librarian can help you select books appropriate for your child.


Look for books with as recent a copyright date as possible, particularly in those sciences where new discoveries seem to be made frequently, such as in astronomy.






Many recent books include a list of websites as further reading sources and include pictures that can be found on those websites.

, Point out newspaper and magazine articles and television news stories that mention science, particularly those sciences your child is interested in. Watch television programs and movies that deal with science, in either a real or fictional setting, and ask afterward what interested him or her most. Look for science-related computer programs and games.

, Talking about a science-related activity with your child � before, during, or afterward � will help your child think about what he or she is learning. Discussion should be focused more on getting the child to think, not explaining a particular scientific concept to the child.


In addition to talking during the outing or activity, a good place to talk is at the dinner table. Studies have shown that families who eat dinner together in an environment that promotes open conversation are more likely to have children who do well in school and go on to college.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Make a super saturated sodium carbonate solution.,
Pour half of the saturated solution into each jar.,
Place a piece of yarn between the two jars.,
Leave the jars for 2 to 3 days to allow the crystals to form.",How to Grow Crystals from Washing Soda1," This experiment uses two separate jars and results in a crystal formation similar to a cave stalagmite; the crystal will grow by dripping on top of itself.To use this method for crystal growth, you will need: two glass jars, wool yarn, distilled water, a plate, two paperclips, washing soda (sodium carbonate), and a spoon.


Natural fibers such as wool work better than synthetics like acrylic.Distilled water has fewer impurities in it and is better for crystal formation.
Call the store to ask if they have washing soda. Some large chains do not carry it, but neighborhood stores often do. It was a common washing detergent in the early 20th century and it is gaining a following for being environmentally-friendly now.;
, Boil 2 cups of distilled water. Add 1 tablespoon of sodium carbonate and stir to dissolve. Continue adding the washing soda, a spoonful at a time, while stirring continuously. Add the soda until it stops dissolving. Despite stirring, you will see the washing soda sink to the bottom instead of dissolving.Once the washing soda stops dissolving, remove the solution from heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.

, Once the solution has cooled, add half to one jar and half to the other jar. Set the jars apart and put a plate between them. This will be your final experimental setup.Put your experimental setup in a place where it won’t be disturbed during the crystal growing process. A windowsill is a good option because it won’t be accidentally knocked.
Moving the crystals, even slightly, may cause the experiment to fail.

, Cut a piece of yarn long enough to be submerged in the liquid of the jars, but also hang below the solution line between the two jars. Tie a paperclip to each end of the string to serve as a weight and hold the strings in the solution of the jars.


To speed up the crystal growth process, you can soak the string in the saturated solution before stringing it between the jars.
Make sure the string hangs below the liquid or the experiment won’t work.Position everything so that the string hangs above the plate between the two jars.

, The yarn will wick the solution until it is saturated. It will drop into the saucer, eventually creating a column of crystals from the saucer to the yarn.The longer you leave the solution, the higher your crystal “stalagmite” will grow.

Play science games.,
Make a group.,
Perform experiments.,
Draw a picture.,
Learn with 3D models.,
Use mnemonic devices.,
Find real-world examples.",How to Enjoy Studying Science1," Talk to your teacher about science games you can play with your classmates to learn and help reinforce scientific concepts. You can make up your own games, or buy some online or direct from an educational store.Help reinforce basic concepts and vocabulary with crossword puzzles, which are easily downloaded online.
Create a boardgame with science trivia, asking questions such as “What are the states of matter?” “What are the names of the Noble Gases?” or anything that pertains to what you are studying in class.;
, Try forming a club or group that meets once or twice a week before school or during lunch for science-related activities. Use its as a form of group study.


Use club time to play scientific games, watch documentaries, and try different experiments.
Have competitions between club members or participate in events like the Science Olympiad as a team.Ask your science teacher if they would be willing to supervise your club.

, Simple experiments such as making a papier mache volcano or the Cartesian Diver are easily done at home in your spare time. More complicated experiments can be undertaken for class projects and science fairs.


Work with a subject that is meaningful to you. If you care about conservation, for instance, try making your own solar-powered phone charger at home.
Ask yourself “Why?” questions frequently. Learning how to do something isn’t the same as knowing what makes that something work. Look up information on the sort of results you want to see, and ask yourself “Why did my experiment produce these results rather than the predicted ones?”
Follow the scientific method. If you are doing your experiment for class or a science fair, it is important to follow the scientific method so that you can properly record and report your experiment. Remember to include background research, a hypothesis, and an analysis along with your methods., If you are a visual learner, turn your studies into art. Draw pictures and diagrams to help you follow your course material, and use these to supplement your notes.


Be detailed and include labels. If, for example, you are drawing a plant cell, identify the chloroplast, nucleus, mitochondria, ER, vacuole, Golgi body, cell wall, etc. Make sure there is information to match the visual.
Be colorful. Creativity has been shown to help students actively engage in the learning process.Get creative and colorful with your drawings, even if it doesn’t exactly match the models in the text books.

, Use interactive 3D models of topics like molecules, organs, or the solar system.


Ask your teacher if any models are available to the class. If not, create your own. There are a number of tutorials and DIY instructions for scientific models online.
Use your notes and drawings to help you take the models apart, identify their components, and put them back together.
Test yourself by seeing if you can name and describe individual components of the model. Try throwing all the pieces into a bag, pulling one out at a time, and listing all the information you know about that piece.

, Make memorizing facts easier with little memory tricks, a rhyme, or an acronym. These are meant to help you remember confusing concepts, difficult terms, and hard-to-remember facts.For example, HOMES is an acronym for the 5 great lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).
This mnemonic device might be of big help for you to remember the planets of the solar system: My Very Energetic Mother Jumps Straight Up North (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
Be as creative and as funny as you want as long as the facts can be easily remembered.

, Science becomes more meaningful when you understand how it impacts your daily life and the larger world around you.


Tie basic experiments back into real-world examples. If, for example, you do a demonstration showing oil is lighter than water, pair it with a discussion of oil spills and what sort of impact floating oil could have on the environment.
Engage yourself in your surroundings by identifying hazards in local environments. Use rising sea levels or extreme storms to help learn about earth science and climate change. If you are in an earthquake-prone area, use that to study plate tectonics.Integrate chemistry with environmental studies by testing local water and soil samples.
Taste test more acidic and more alkaline foods to see how chemistry impacts what you eat.

Create a standout title.,
Keep all lines straight.,
Add pictures, charts, and graphs.,
Use the right font sizes.,
Layout the content so that it flows.,
Print all materials.,
Decide on a theme.,
Choose a border.,
Mount printed information and pictures.,
Use 3-D visual aids.,
Add lights, motion, or sound for greater effects.",How to Get Your Science Fair Tri Fold Noticed," Your title should attract, inform, summarize, and show a creative flair. Sum up your experiment in bold or clear words and easy-to-read lettering. This is where precut poster letters or alphabet stickers work great. Make the title large enough to be clearly read from across the room.For example, a project about creating geodes in eggshells could be titled Geode “Eggs”periment.
Brainstorm a few catchy title ideas and pick the best one from your list.;
, When cutting out content to be added to your board, you want to make sure that all of your cuts are straight. With the help of an adult, use a paper cutter or other straight edge to ensure nice, clean lines across your display board.


If using scissors, draw a straight line across the back of what you’re cutting out and follow it very carefully.

, Visual aids are important to your display board because they help tell your story and break up blocks of text. Add pictures of you performing your experiments, taking observations, and graphs of your data. Keep in mind, too many visual aids can be confusing without enough text to explain what was done.Avoid having more than 50% of your board in graphics.
Add pictures to break up the text and make the poster more attractive to look at.
Use relevant images. Don’t add pictures that have nothing to do with your experiment just because they look nice.

, Different elements of your board will need to be printed in varying font sizes. The title needs to be the largest and viewable from at least halfway across a room. Headings and subheadings should be readable from a few feet away and the explanatory text underneath needs to be easily readable standing in front of the board.If you use fonts that are too small, it’s more difficult for a viewer to read and they might not bother looking through everything.
Keep the font size consistent for headings, subheadings, and text., Make sure your content is posted onto the board in a logical fashion that flows. Keep the hypothesis, purpose, and supporting literature on the left side panel, the experimental methods, observations, and data in the middle, and the results, analysis, and conclusion on the right side panel.You can rearrange this format as you see fit, just make sure unrelated sections aren’t pasted next to each other.
Avoid giant blocks of text, using bullet points and dashes where possible.

, Use a word processor to type of all of your content and print it out for mounting. If you have access to it, use a higher quality paper to make it stand out. Hand-written content will look sloppy and not get your board noticed in a positive way., This theme can help in choosing your poster’s design, color, and lettering. If your experiment addresses temperature, you could choose orange and blue or red and blue as your color theme to represent hot and cold. A tri-fold about space could be mounted on a black or blue background. These colors could be used in your lettering, borders, or poster board.


Choose a color scheme with complementary, muted colors so as not to overwhelm the reader. Color is nice, but it’s easy to overdo it if you use neon colors that are difficult to read., If your tri-fold has too much white space on the outer edges, you can add poster borders.This is another great way to keep with the theme of your project and give your poster a finished look. Keep in mind your theme when choosing border colors or designs.


For example, a project about the solar system could have a border of planets or stars.

, Your important information and hard work will stand out when mounted on colored paper. You can also cut the colored paper with decorative edge scissors for an instant design.


Use a straight-edge paper cutter (with adult assistance) to get clean lines for the background paper.
You can mount the content in the middle of the background paper or have the paper slightly offset to one side.

, Add visual interest with eye-catching or 3-dimensional items that fit your poster’s message. A boring picture of a volcano comes alive when an image of an erupting volcano is mounted on foam board and placed 3-D in the center with glittery lava flowing downward.


Make sure the 3-D aids are relevant to your project. The visual aids must add to the overall project to justify having them on the table.

, This is where you get your poster noticed and wow the judges. A poster about electricity is noticed when you add poster lights. A poster about aerodynamics will get their heads spinning when the propeller actually spins on your tri-fold board.


This is your chance to get creative. Don’t overdo it, but add simple elements that add to the overall visual appearance of your board.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Make a saturated sodium carbonate solution.,
Add the saturated solution to the glass jar.,
Tie the string around the pencil.,
Let sit undisturbed for at least five hours.,
Remove the string from the solution.",How to Grow Crystals from Washing Soda2," This experiment allows you to grow a crystal out of solution by submerging it in a saturated solution. To grow crystals using submersion, you will need: distilled water, washing soda (sodium carbonate), a glass jar, string, a pencil, a pot for boiling, and a spoon.Distilled water has fewer impurities in it and is better for crystal formation.
Call the store to ask if they have washing soda. Some large chains do not carry it, but neighborhood stores often do. It was a common washing detergent in the early 20th century and it is gaining a following for being environmentally-friendly now.The pencil needs to be long enough to lay across the top of the jar.

, Add enough distilled water to fill your glass jar about ¾ full to a pot and bring it to a boil. Add a tablespoon of sodium carbonate to the water and stir until it dissolves. Continue adding sodium carbonate, a tablespoon at a time, until no more sodium carbonate dissolves. Stir continuously as you add.Once you start to see the sodium carbonate sink to the bottom of the pot and not dissolve, you have made a saturated solution.
Adult supervision is recommended while working with the stove and boiling water.
If you want to make more crystals, make more solution to add to multiple jars.

, Once the solution has cooled down, pour it into your jar filling it about ¾ of the way full. Be sure to let the solution cool to room temperature before adding it to the jar.


If you’re growing multiple crystals, fill multiple jars ¾ full.

, The string will serve as the nucleation site of the crystal. The nucleation site is where the crystal begins to form.Leave a tail of string long enough to hang just above the bottom of the jar. Place the pencil across the top of the jar and drop the string into the saturated washing soda solution.


You can also use pipe cleaners instead of string for this step. Form them into a shape such as a star or a heart and the crystals will grow around the shape of the pipe cleaners., Cover the jar with plastic wrap and place it somewhere no one will touch it. A windowsill is a good place because it is unlikely to be bumped like a table might be. After a few hours, you should see crystals beginning to form on the string.The longer you let the solution sit, the larger the crystals will grow.

, When you are satisfied with the growth of your crystals, lift the pencil to remove the crystal/string from the jar. Now that you have made your very own crystals, you can grow them whenever you want.


Add food coloring to the water to change the color of your crystals."

Start early.,
Don’t rely on oversimplification.,
Say you don’t know.,
Learn about scientists.",How to Enjoy Studying Science2," Some research suggests that children already start to form negative opinions about science by kindergarten.Start studying science concepts early in your everyday life to see how it is applicable and why it is important.


Supplement TV time with science programming. Watch shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy, Sid the Science Kid, and Mythbusters to introduce you to basic science concepts in an entertaining way.Ask yourself questions. When you first start with a new scientific subject, getting the concepts right isn’t as important as simply encouraging critical thinking. Ask yourself questions like “Why do you think giraffes have long necks?” on trips to the zoo, or “Why does water solidify when freezing?” when you make a new tray of ice.
Remember, it is ok to be wrong. Instead of simply telling yourself that you are wrong, think through the process and guide yourself to new conclusions using new information.

, You might not get all technical concepts of scientific processes, but don’t try oversimplify too much. If you break things down to the point where fundamental information is missing or what you’re saying is simply inaccurate, you may suffer in the long run.Ask yourself “Will this change the concept?” before you simplify something in your notes or on a paper. You may not need to understand nuclear fusion for a middle school astronomy report. Still, saying “The sun is a ball of fiery gasses and metals” is more accurate than stating “The sun is a ball of fire in the sky.”

, You will have science questions that you cannot answer on your own. That is alright. Tell your teacher you don’t know, but that you want help finding the answer.


Saying you don’t know reinforces the idea that scientific learning is not about memorizing facts, but rather about critical thinking and investigating.
Read through your class materials and textbooks thoroughly to gather the information already available to you.
If class materials don’t answer the question, look for online resources that can help explain. There may be videos, games, or even another teacher’s lesson plan that you could use.
Ask to meet with your teacher outside of class to help explain the concept. Tell them “I’d like to learn this so that I can better understand the course content and the subject as a whole.”

, Get inspiration by biographies about famous scientists. Learn about what these scientists' lives were like and what they accomplished that brought good things to the world.


Find grade-level appropriate biographies about famous scientists such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Watson and Crick, and others. You can find these in bookstores or online.
Watch short videos to go along with what you’re reading. There are a number of online videos dedicated to celebrating great scientists. Watch them before or after you read so you can see why that person still matters today.

Visit museums.,
Go to camp.,
Become a citizen scientist.,
Use technology.",How to Enjoy Studying Science3," Museums are great places to see science in action. Go to a museum and spend the day exploring new concepts.


Natural history museums are great places to find information about biology, ecology, and paleontology.
Scientific museums such as museums of science, museums of industry, air and space museums, and others often have hands-on exhibits that allow you to participate in scientific processes in action.
Planetariums allow you to explore the solar system, the stars, and universe beyond our earth.
Aquariums introduce visitors to underwater ecology as well as environmental and water conservation.

, Many communities have camps meant to foster students’ interest in STEM subjects. Day camp, weekend camp, sleepaway camp, and before and after school options are all available.There are different camps for different interests. There are camps dedicated to exploring engineering, ecology, physics, chemistry, and more. Explore a subject that interests you.
Contact your local community centers and organizations to see if they offer free or low-cost day camps or afterschool programs focused on scientific inquiry.
Check with local museums and scientific institutions to see if they offer summer programs and weekend programs.
Look at national programs such as Space Camp or Mad Science.

, Get involved with a program that aligns with what you are studying in school, and help contribute data to real scientific studies all over the world. Many of these are no-commitment required programs, so you only contribute when you feel you can.


Help NASA identify interstellar dust particles with Stardust@home, or work with Galaxy Zoo to classify galaxies.Learn about synthetic biology by playing games that build machines out of our DNA.Contribute to biological research about dogs simply by playing with your pup and reporting your findings to the Animal Ownership Interaction Study.Search online databases such as SciStarter to search for citizen scientist projects relevant to your studies.

, Technology is increasingly impacting the content and the ways students learn. Use new technologies to teach yourself scientific subjects in ways that make sense to you.


Programs like Crash Course, Khan Academy, and others have full subject content including videos, lesson plans, and assignments online and through social media platforms to help learners from the elementary school level up through college.
There are smartphone and tablet apps for almost any scientific subject you will study. Apps like Project Noah and Journey North allow you to participate in citizen science programs right from your phone. Others, such as NASA Visualization Explorer and goREACT, demonstrate concepts and allow for experiment simulations on the phone that would be too difficult in class."

Choose a salt.,
Choose your water.,
Decide how much of each you will use.,
Pour your water into a container.,
Weigh out your salt.,
Pour the salt into the water.,
Account for the temperature of the water.,
Account for other solutes in the water.,
Account for impurities in your salt.",How to Dissolve Salt in Water," There are many different salts available, and they all have different properties.The amount of Epsom salt (MgSO4) that you can dissolve into a given amount of water at a given temperature will differ from the amount of table salt (NaCl) that you can dissolve into the same water. If you are trying to understand the dissolution process in general, you should stick with using table salt.If you need to study the properties of a specific salt, use that salt.;
, The kind of water you use matters. For example, tap water has more contaminants than distilled water. Deionized water can often be even more pure than distilled water. The purer the water (i.e. the less contaminants it contains) the more salt you will be able to dissolve into it.This is because there are fewer water molecules acting on other substances in the water, and therefore, more molecules to act on your salt.

, You will need to decide how much (how many grams) salt you intend to put into your water. You will also need to know how much water you are using. If you use too much salt (or too little water) then you will not be able to dissolve all of it.You can add salt slowly to see approximately how much can be dissolved in a given amount of water (at a given temperature).
You can dissolve more salt by adding more water or heating it up.

, If you are measuring out a specific amount of water, you can use a graduated cylinder or a beaker. If you aren’t as worried about exact measurements, any container will do. Keep in mind that the temperature of the container can affect the temperature of your water. This isn’t a big deal for most experiments, but if you are doing highly controlled experiments, it is worth considering.Make sure to label your container, especially if you are working in a lab with other people.

, Put weigh paper or a weigh boat on your scale and zero the scale. Add salt a little at a time until you reach the desired amount of salt. Record the exact amount of salt that you used., If the salt does not immediately dissolve, try mixing it with a spoon or spatula. You need water molecules to come in contact with your salt to dissolve it, and stirring things up helps that happen more quickly. You can also heat the mixture to help the salt dissolve., When you are analyzing how much salt you can or cannot dissolve into a given volume of water, you should consider the temperature. Warmer water will dissolve more salt than cooler water, regardless of the type of salt you are using. If you are doing a formal experiment, you should record the exact temperature of your water., The more solutes (things dissolved into the water) present, the less water molecules are available to interact with your salt. There can also be interaction between the solutes and the salt, depending on what solutes are present. If you are not studying the interaction of a specific solute with your salt, it is best to use distilled or deionized water to minimize the amount of contamination., Your water isn’t the only non-perfect substance you’ll be working with. Your salt is bound to have some level of impurity. If you purchased your salt, it is likely food or commercial grade and the impurities will be negligible for most experiments. If you made your own salt or mined your own salt, then impurities might be higher."

Ask kids questions about scientific topics.,
Show your kids the science behind their interests.,
Be persistent when encouraging your kids to love science.,
Demonstrate an interest in science yourself.",How to Encourage Kids to Love Science1," Science is the process of asking questions about the world and thinking of reasonable answers. To help your kids start down this path and come to enjoy the creativity that it involves, provide them with questions, not answers. This will get them to develop their own answers and help them love the process of investigation the is so important in science.For instance, instead of telling your kids why the sky is blue, you could ask them why they think the sky is blue. Listen carefully to their answer, then ask them how they arrived at this answer. Help your child locate resources to discover whether or not they’re right.;
, Even kids who aren’t passionate about science can learn to love it if you show them how it impacts their more immediate interests. For instance, if your kids love baseball, you could share some videos that explain the physics behind how baseballs travel through space and how gravity affects the ball’s course.If your kids love videogames, talk to them about the electrical signals and code required to program the game system and software., Love and appreciation of science often comes later in life as your kids gain exposure to different types of science. But if you’ve laid a solid foundation for them to understand scientific principles and processes, it will be easier for them to develop that passion as they grow.Provide encouragement whenever your child shows interest in a scientific topic.
Help clarify scientific ideas if your child asks about them.

, Kids often take after their parents, and if you have a positive attitude about science, your kids probably will as well. When you read something interesting that relates to science, share it with your child."

Understand what a food chain is.,
Use a real life example demonstrating a food chain to help you understand it better.,
Understand the food web.,
Prepare a class project on food chains and webs.",How to Learn About Biodiversity and Food Webs," A food chain is a sequence of who eats whom. The usual order of a food chain is:


sunlight
plants
herbivore
omnivore; and/or
carnivore.;
, Millions of food chains exist around the world. The following farming food chain example is one example of a simple food chain based only on green plants, goats, microorganisms and humans.


Green grass and wildflowers use sunlight to grow in a field maintained by a farmer. This field is called a pasture.
A goat (herbivore) grazes on these delicious plants in the pasture.
In turn, the goat provides milk, meat and wool for the farmer, his or her family, and others.
The goat also provides fertilizer.
Microorganisms decompose the goats’ poop or excrement, which provides fertilizers for the grass and flowers to grow.

, Food chains that are related in an ecosystem form a food web.


In forest ecosystems, many types of herbivores eat the trees and other plant life. Carnivores, or meat-eating animals, such as tigers, lions, and wolves, prey on herbivores. They usually prey on wild animals. Sometimes, if the habitats or homes of carnivores are destroyed, they may also attack goats, sheep or cows for food. For example, in India, farmers may lose their goats to tigers; in Eastern Africa, cows may provide lunch for lions and in Western Canada and the US, wolves sometimes attack the domesticated sheep. Carnivores are an important part of biodiversity because they regulate herbivore populations so that they do not eat their favorite plant species to extinction.

, As part of a class project, either individually, or in groups, prepare a project that demonstrates the food chain and food web in the context of biodiversity. It is a good idea to select different food chains and food webs before starting, to ensure that the class learns as much as possible about different ecosystem chains, e.g., forest, marine, mountain, desert, etc. Ideas for trying include:


Preparing a talk with illustrations of the food chain and web;
Making a model of a food chain and food web, using small models made from recycled materials or reuse your small figurines, plant life, pebbles etc.;
Making a film of the interaction of life in a food web. Present each film to class; or
Making a poster featuring a food chain to display on the classroom wall.

Gather your materials.,
Place the egg in the glass and submerge with vinegar.,
Cover and refrigerate the egg for 24 hours.Cover the top of the container with foil or plastic wrap and place it on a shelf of the refrigerator where it will remain undisturbed.,
Replace the vinegar in the cup after 24 hours.,
Leave the egg undisturbed for at least 24 more hours.,
Test the strength of the membrane.,
Grow the egg with water.,
Shrink the egg with corn syrup.",How to Dissolve an Eggshell," For this experiment you will need a fresh, uncooked egg, a drinking glass, a dissolving solution such as white vinegar or a cola beverage, and 4-5 days of patience. The drinking glass needs to be large enough for the egg to touch the bottom without touching the sides of the glass.


You can also use a plastic cup or container to hold the egg, but clear containers allow you to observe the experiment over time.
Use a fresh egg because an older egg will float in the liquid.
Before you begin, examine your uncooked egg for cracks.;
, Gently place the egg in the bottom of the glass taking care not to crack it. Pour enough vinegar (or cola) over the egg until it is completely submerged in the liquid.

, Keep it out of the way so it doesn’t get knocked around.

, After the first day, you should see the frothy residue of the shell on the surface of the liquid. You will also see that parts of the shell still remain on the egg. The shell takes at least two days to fully dissolve and may take up to three.


Gently pour out the vinegar taking care to keep the egg from falling out of the container.
Carefully roll the egg back down to the bottom of the container and refill with vinegar.

, Place the egg back in the refrigerator and leave it alone. After at least another 24 hours, remove the egg to check its progress. If there are no white spots or areas that look like shell left on the egg, the dissolving process is complete.


Gently pour out the vinegar and catch the naked egg in your hand. See how it feels.

, Carefully remove the egg from the vinegar. You may notice that it feels quite rubbery. To test the strength of the membrane, try dropping the egg on the table and see if it bounces. Start with just one inch above the table and then increase the height by an inch at a time.At a certain height, the egg will break. Do this activity outside or lay down newspaper before experimenting.

, The membrane of the egg is permeable to liquid, meaning that water can pass through into the egg. The contents of the inside of the egg contain about 90% water. If you put the egg in a cup that is 100% water, the water will pass through the membrane to equalize the amount of water inside the egg due to a process called osmosis. As the water moves into the egg, the egg swells in size.Add food coloring to the cup of water to color your egg.

, Using the same properties of osmosis, you can shrink the egg by placing it in a solution with very little water. Place the egg in a container full of corn syrup. This time, water will pass out of the egg to equalize the amount of water on each side of the membrane. As the water leaves the egg, it will shrivel and shrink."

Clean up.",How to Dissect a Worm," The alcohol causes the body and the muscles to relax. Without that, the worm will most likely be stiff and not as long as you'd like, making for a harder time dissecting.If the worm is already dead, make sure the body is still soft and flexible. Immediately place it in alcohol to preserve the body. Earthworm bodies begin to dry and shrivel quickly after death.For this reason, you should have a container of rubbing alcohol with you when you search for the worm.
After a few minutes, remove the worm and lightly pat it dry with a paper towel.;
, Turn that side of the body down, facing the surface of the tray. The smoother side should face upward, towards you.

, This way, you'll avoid accidentally moving it around during the process. Put in the pin as close as to the end as you can without tearing the worm. Then stretch the worm taut and put a pin in the other end., This is the large band that runs around the body of the worm. Place the end of your knife closer to the clitellum in the direction that you plan to begin cutting. This end contains many of the organs you will have to identify first., This is a good starting point, since that's where the most important organs are.

, Do this carefully, keeping your cut shallow. If you go too deep, you could damage the organs.

, Do this for both sides of the worm. Pull back the skin until you can easily see the insides. Make sure to do so slowly and carefully to avoid tearing the skin.

, This is to keep the skin from receding back into the body when you're examining it. Make sure not to stretch the skin out too much in order to avoid tearing it.

, Focus on the upper end of the body first. Gently place the organs to the side so as to not obstruct your examination of the other parts of the body.

, Compare them to a diagram of an earthworm. You will likely be required to recognize the parts of the digestive system, which can be identified as a series of small and large bulges separated by narrow indentations., The mouth is located at the end of the worm closer to the clitellum. It is the beginning of the digestive system, where food enters the body.

, This is a collection of muscles that suck in food. Below the thin tube that extends from the mouth is a noticeable bulge. This is the pharynx.

, The esophagus is the tube where the food passes through from the mouth to the crop. This organ is the tapered area located immediately below the pharynx.

, After food leaves the esophagus, it is temporarily stored in the crop. The crop is another bulge, wider than the pharynx, located directly below the esophagus.

, This organ grinds the food down completely. It is the next large bulge of the digestive system. You can find it directly below the crop.

, The intestine, the bulge directly below the gizzard, performs much of the digestion. In this organ, nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream, while waste products are pushed downward toward the anus.

, This is the end of the digestive system where excrement leaves the worm. It is located at the other end of the worm's body.

, Each pin should be removed carefully one at a time. Place the pins in a cup or tray. Move them to a location where they will not be knocked over.

, Do this when you have finished inspecting the organs and taking notes. Because dissected bodies are not considered hazardous waste, they may be placed in the regular landfill trash., Disinfect your tools with rubbing alcohol. Wash your hands with soap and warm water. Thoroughly remove any blood or other remnants of the body from your workspace.

Expose your kids to a variety of sciences.,
Encourage kids to take things apart.,
Provide opportunities for exploration.",How to Encourage Kids to Love Science2," Science is not a monolithic entity. There are many types of science, so if your kids aren’t into biology, don’t be discouraged. Introduce them to astronomy instead. If they don’t care for astronomy, try to share some geology instead. Make an effort to expose your kids to a wide variety of sciences., The scientific instinct to dissect and dismantle common objects can be powerful. Allowing your kids to act on this instinct will help them love science (even if they don’t know they do). When your kids want to dismantle an old computer, help and encourage them to do so. If they want to pluck the petals off a flower, don’t insist that they are ruining it. Making the process of discovery fun is an important way to help kids love science.Your kids might also have fun dissecting more complex organisms. Dead frogs, for instance, are easy to obtain from companies that provide science kits to homeschooled kids. Owl pellets are another common dissection opportunity that kids enjoy.
Make sure that your kids’ natural curiosity is manifest in a safe way and doesn’t, for instance, lead them to stick knives in the electrical socket.
Teach your kids safety by always insisting that they should not experiment or dismantle things without your approval and oversight. Additionally, teach them to use insulated gloves and safety goggles when handling electrical parts.

, Give your kids time to observe animals and wildlife by taking them to local parks and recreation centers. If you live near a large lake or near the ocean, take them to the shore to see what sorts of shells and strange creatures they can find. They might be drawn to certain bugs, plants, or animals. From there, your kids’ natural curiosity will take over.When you’re visiting these natural habitats, engage your kids in conversation. Ask them to describe what they’re seeing and provide explanations for anything unusual.

"
"
Explain that anyone can be a scientist.,
Introduce your kids to scientists.,
Conduct science experiments at home.,
Don’t provide rewards for learning science.",How to Encourage Kids to Love Science3," Because of certain historical and social trends, men are disproportionately represented in STEM fields and in academia. To counter these trends, tell your children that both boys and girls can be scientists.Encourage your girls to participate in scientific organizations like Girls Who Code and provide them with science kits like Yellow Scope.
Teach your kids about famous women scientists as well as famous male scientists.

, If kids never have any direct contact with scientists, the notion that science is an enterprise that real people participate in will remain a remote and abstract notion. To help your kids learn to love science, take them to your local science center or natural history museum where they can talk to professional scientists and see how they work., If kids can do science themselves, they are more likely to love it. There are countless books and websites enumerating hands-on science experiments you and your children can do at home. Alternately, buy a prepackaged science experiment kit packed with experiments you might not be able to execute using materials that you’d normally have lying about the house., When you reward kids for reading a science book or conducting a home science experiment, you detract from the value of the learning experience by making it more about the reward than about what they did or learned. It also sends a subtle message that science is a kind of chore, and only worth doing because at the end of it, you get a reward."
"
Provide your kids with books that celebrate science.,
Show your kids scientific programming.,
Give your kids toys that relate to science.",How to Encourage Kids to Love Science4," There are many books that could encourage your child love science. For instance, Ada Byron Lovelace and the Thinking Machine by Laurie Wallmark or The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer might inspire your child to learn more about the important work that scientists have contributed to society throughout history.Your child might also enjoy fictional offerings such as Rosie Revere, Engineer.
Older kids might have fun reading age-appropriate biographies.
As your kids grow, they might appreciate age-appropriate scientific periodicals like ‘’Nat Geo Kids’’ or ‘’Zoobooks’’.

, Shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy and Sid the Science Kid can get your kids revved up about science. If your children are a bit older, they might like to watch CSI or a similar show that demonstrates how forensic science works., Coupling science with fun is the easiest way to encourage your kids to love science. Give your kids toys like Magna-Tiles, small connectable magnetic tiles that could inspire curiosity about how magnets work. They might also enjoy GoldieBlox building sets which encourage girls to look at STEM as a fun endeavor.More generic toys that might lead your kids to love science include magnifying glasses, remote-controlled cars, and silly putty. These toys could lead kids to ask how they work or how they are made. Direct your child’s attention to these questions whenever possible.

Gather your materials.,
Outline the viewing port.,
Use scissors to cut the oval out of the box.,
Cut a rectangle for the viewing slit.Turn the box so the oval you cut is on the right-hand side instead of facing you.,
Tape two business cards parallel to each other over the rectangle cutout.,
Tape the disk to the inner side of the box opposite the viewing slit.,
Seal the sides of the box using aluminum foil and glue.,
Insert the paper tube into the oval.,
Tape the tube in place.,
Check to see if the spectrum works.,
Use aluminum foil and glue to seal up the edges.,
Examine different light sources.Hold the spectrum up to a light, putting the viewing port (the paper tube) over your eye and aiming the viewing slit at a light.,
Record your observations.,
Ask scientific questions about the spectrum in class or with friends.,
Enter your spectrum and observations in a science fair.",How to Create a Simple Spectrum," First, you will need to make sure you have all the materials to make a spectrum:


A cardboard box. It needs to be big enough to tape a CD or DVD on the inner edge. Small shipping boxes, cereal boxes, or shoe boxes will work.
A DVD or CD. The DVD or CD will get taped down, so pick one that you don’t mind losing.
2 business cards (or a 3x5 cards). Make sure the card is thicker than standard paper. Some people substitute this for two single edged razor blades, but business cards are less dangerous to handle.A cardboard tube. A toilet paper, paper towel, or gift wrap tube will work.
Aluminum tape or aluminum foil and glue.
Scissors.
Pen or marker
Ruler
Cellophane tape;
, For now, leave the top of the box open as you make the spectrum. This port needs to be drawn on the outside of the box. First, set the CD or DVD on one side of the box, half of an inch away from the left edge. Use your pen or marker to trace the circle in the middle of the disc. Put the disk aside for now. Then, get your paper tube, and center it over the circle you traced. Trace the inner part of the paper tube.


Now, move the tube over half an inch, and trace the inner part of it again.
These circles will tell you where to cut the box to make the viewing port.
The two overlapping circles will look like an oval.

, Cardboard boxes can be hard to cut, so be careful with the scissors. You can also use a knife if the scissors are not working. The oval cutout will allow the paper tube to enter the box at an angle to make the viewing port.

, Place the disk towards the left edge of this side of the box. Use your pen or marker to trace the circle in the middle of the disc. This circle will be your guide for cutting out the viewing slit, which will be about half inch wide and two inches high.


Cut a small rectangle out of the box at the height marked by the small circle you made with the disk.
This slit will not be in a circular shape, but you want to use the height of the circle as a guide for cutting the rectangle.
Now, the right-hand side of the box should have an oval cutout, and the left-hand side should have a small rectangle cutout.

, First, set the cards parallel over the rectangle, but leave a small gap between them. It should be a couple of centimeters. Make sure the gap is not be wider at the top or bottom. This will make a very small slit through which light enters the spectrum.


If you decide to use razor blades, set them up in the same way, but be careful handling the sharp edges.
Tape down the business cards. Now, you have made the viewing slit.

, Tape the disk inside the box so the colorful side is facing the viewing slit. The left edge of the disk should be the same distance from the left of the box as the slit is. Secure the disk in place with tape.

, Leave the top open for now. Doing one edge at a time, glue aluminum foil to the outside of the entire box, or cover it with aluminum tape. Cover any region where light might get in, but leave the section surrounding the viewing port and viewing slit uncovered.

, Place the paper tube you have inside the oval you cutout earlier. Allow half an inch of the tube to go inside the box. Angle the interior end toward the disk. The paper tube should fit snugly inside the oval.

, Tape the tube in place so it isn’t loose, but make sure it is still facing the disc after you tape it.

, Gently close the top of the box, but do not tape it shut yet. Look through the paper tube to make sure it is facing the disk. Adjust accordingly.

, Now, you can close the box. Seal up any edges by gluing aluminum foil over them. The aluminum foil will make a tight seal around the edges to prevent light from coming in. Once you have sealed up the edges, allow the glue to completely dry. Now, you are ready to use your spectrum.

, You should see the full light spectrum, from red to purple. Look at a candle flame, a flashlight, a street light, and so on by aiming the viewing slit at different lights.


If you are having difficulty seeing the light spectrum, try adjusting the paper tube. Remember, it must be facing the disk inside the box.
Use caution when examining sunlight: never look directly at the sun through the spectrum.If you want to observe the sun, look at the sunlight bouncing off of a white wall.

, Record how different light sources look in the spectrum by writing down the light source (such as “candle flame”) then using colored pencils to draw the colors you see.


An incandescent light bulb produces a continuous spectrum of light with no bright lines because of the tungsten in it.
A fluorescent bulb produces distinct, colored lines that come from mercury vapor.
Hot gasses produce light that is made up of only a few colors, which the spectrum allows you to see individually.

, Some examples are: what colors were the individual bands of light reflecting? Was there an order to the colors? If so, name the order. Did different light sources look differently? How and why?


Look for specific colors. Are all the colors of the rainbow present?
Observe the spacing between the colored lines. Are they close or far apart?

, Spectrums make great science fair projects. Ask an adult for help finding out more information about your local science fair or other similar competition.

Fill a clear, glass container ¾ of the way with cool water.,
Fill the glass container the rest of the way with plain, white, foamy shaving cream.,
Prepare your dye.,
Use an eye dropper or pipette to drop some colored water onto the cloud.,
Wait for the rain to form.",How to Create Shaving Cream Rain Clouds1," You can use a cup, bowl, vase, or jar, but make sure that it is clear. This will allow you to see the rainstorm later on. Avoid using anything with a narrow opening, however, or you will have a hard time adding the shaving cream.This is a great project for teaching kids about rain. It's recommended for children 2 years old and up.;
, Make sure that you are using the foamy type and not the gel kind. Try to fill the entire surface of the water. You can make the cloud as puffy as you'd like, but keep in mind that the thicker it is, the longer it will take for the rain to form., Fill a small cup with 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of water. Stir in 10 drops of food coloring. This will be your rain. You can use any color you want, but blue will be the most rain-like.You can make more colors if you want. Use a new cup for each color.
As you prepare the dye, the shaving cream will start to settle, which is a good thing. The shaving cream needs to be resting on top of the water.

, Add the colored water drop-by-drop to the cloud. You don't have to use all of the colored water--a few drops will do. To make the rain happen faster, place the drops at the edges of the cloud, which are thinner.If you can't find an eye dropper, you can use a syringe or ¼ teaspoon instead.You can help speed things up a little by sticking the dropper or pipette directly into the cloud., This will usually take a few minutes, depending on the thickness and size of the cloud. Eventually, the colored water will go through the cloud, and trickle down into the water. It won't form droplets like real rain, but something more streak-like.

"
"
Mix your cloud paint.,
Set out a sheet of blue construction paper in front of you.,
Dab the paint onto the paper using a foam brush.,
Add some rain with glitter glue.,
Let the cloud dry.",How to Create Shaving Cream Rain Clouds2," Fill a bowl with 3 parts white shaving cream and 1 part white school glue. Stir the two together using a spoon until they are evenly combined.Make sure that you are using plain, white, foamy shaving cream and not the gel kind.

, You can orient the paper horizontally or vertically. If you orient it vertically, however, you'll have more room to add rain.


If you can't find any blue construction paper, you can use blue cardstock or blue printer paper.

, Tap the paint on so that it comes out puffy. The puffier, the better. Do not brush it on, or it will turn out streaky.


Your cloud can be any shape you want it to be.
Leave room under your cloud for rain, if you want.

, Use blue or silver glitter glue to make water droplets under your cloud. If you can't find any glitter glue, draw the droplets on using glue first, then shake some loose blue or silver glitter onto it. Tap the excess glitter off downward so that it doesn't get on the cloud.


Shake some some white or iridescent glitter onto your cloud for extra sparkle., The paint will take at least a day to dry. Once it dries, it will be puffy and a little soft.

Add an equal amount of corn starch.,
Knead the two together until a dough forms.,
Adjust the texture, if needed.,
Play with the dough.",How to Create Shaving Cream Rain Clouds3," If you don't want to get your counter dirty, you can use a plastic tub or tray instead. Make sure that you are using plain, white, foamy shaving cream. Do not use the gel kind.


This project makes a soft, fluffy dough. It is a great sensory activity for small children.

, The cornstarch will help bind the dough and make it more squishable. If you want a sparkly cloud, add a sprinkle of white or iridescent glitter.

, Use your palms to scoop and smoosh the two ingredients together. Keep kneading the dough until a dough forms and the texture is consistent.

, The dough should be soft and fluffy, but the final texture depends on your personal preferences. If it is too sticky for you, knead in some more cornstarch. If it is too dry, add more shaving cream.Keep in mind that the more cornstarch you add, the less puffy the dough will be., You can poke it, smoosh it, or shape it. Young, teething children must be supervised. Store the dough in an airtight container when you are done playing with it. Keep in mind that it will eventually dry out.

Place half of each stalk into a separate glass.,
Observe the results.,
Gather other plants and flowers to test.,
Fill glasses with colored water.,
Place one flower into each glass of water and observe the changes.",How to Change the Color of a Celery Stalk," To perform this experiment you will need four celery stalks, food coloring, water, a knife/scissors, and four small glasses. The number of glasses you need is dependent upon how many colors you want to use to change the celery.Make sure your celery stalks still have the leafy tops on them.
If you only have one stalk of celery, you can cut the one stalk lengthwise into multiple pieces.
Blue and red food coloring work best for this experiment, but you can use any combination of colors you would like.;
, Use at least two different glasses to have some variety in the colors.If you have more than two glasses, try combining the colors together to make purple or orange.


The more color you add, the more vibrant the color of the celery stalk will be so be generous with the number of drops you add.Red and blue combine to make purple; yellow and red combine to make orange.

, You want to use a fresh part of the stalk and expose the bottom so that it can take up the most water. Ask a parent to assist with this step. Using scissors or a knife, trim the curved part of the bottom of the stalk off.Leave the leafy top on the stalk. The leafy parts will change color as well.

, To add a little more education to the experiment, ask some questions and make some observations of the celery before beginning. What color is the celery? What do the leaves look like? What are the features of the bottom of the stalk? Does every stalk look the same?


Make predictions on what you think will happen over time to the stalk and the leaves of the celery.
Take note of the observations for each stalk and which one goes into each color.

, After trimming each stalk, place one stalk per glass into the colored solution. It takes time for the celery stalk to take up the water and transport it to the top, so leave the cups undisturbed for at least 24 hrs.


You can check on the celery every few hours to observe the progress of the color change.
Leaving the celery for more time will result in a more vibrant color change., As time passes, the colored water will work its way up the celery stalk and into the leaves. After 24 hrs you should notice that the color of the leaves has changed to match that of the water in the glass. If you look at the bottom of the stalk, you should see that it is also colored.Break the stalk in half and see what the inside looks like. You should see the color all throughout the stalk.
Write down your results as “after” observations. Compare them to your notes before you started.
If you don’t see a color change, try adding more food coloring or using a new piece of celery.

, This is a variant of the original experiment where you will cut one stalk partially in half leaving the leafy top part intact. Each half will then be placed in a different color liquid to see what happens. To do this, you will need one stalk of celery, two glasses, water, scissors, and two different colors of food coloring.Make sure the celery still has the leafy bits at the top.
Parental supervision/assistance is recommended for cutting the celery.

, To expose the xylem of the celery and give it the best access to the water, trim the curved end of the stalk. After trimming, the bottom of the stalk should be flat and you should be able to see small dots.Ask your child what they think those small dots are.

, Using the scissors, cut the celery stalk in half, but stop about one inch below the leafy top. You want to make sure the stalk is still connected at the top and that the leaves will be getting water from both halves of the stalk.If you cut too far up, just get a new stalk and try again.
Parental assistance is recommended for this step.

, Using regular tap water, fill each glass about halfway. Add a few drops of different food coloring to each glass. The more drops you add, the more vibrant the celery stalk will become with that color.Use two colors that blend well such as red and blue to make purple or red and yellow to make orange.

, Take one half of the celery stalk and place it in the first glass and stick the second half in the second glass of colored water. Leave the celery in the colored water for at least 24 hrs. While you wait, make some predictions about the celery.What color do you think the leaves at the top will be? Will half be one color and half the other or will the two colors blend together?
What color will each half of the stalk be?

, After 24 hrs have passed, check on your celery and look at the results. What happened? Write down your observations about the celery. You should notice that the colors have blended together at the top and the leaves are this blended color.Were your predictions correct?
How is this experiment different than just having the whole stalk in one color?

, Do you think this experiment will work with other plants? Get some white flowers such as carnations and roses.Trim the ends of the flower at an angle to help them soak up more water.


If you use a red flower and soak it in blue water, do you think the flower will turn purple?

, Just as you did with the celery, fill each glass halfway and add some food coloring. Because you are using white flowers, you should be able to see the color change very well. Use bright color combinations for your flowers.The more food coloring you add, the brighter the flower will be.

, Over time, the petals will take up the color of the water in the glass. The longer you wait, the more color the petals will develop.Try mixing up the flowers and putting them in a different colored glass each day. What happens to the color of the petals?


You can repeat this experiment with any plant you’d like.

Highlight your results.,
Discuss your conclusions.,
Organize sections from left to right and top to bottom.,
Place sections in chronological order.,
Use the center to highlight your work.,
Display your title front and center.,
Look for balance on your board.,
Glue all of your sections to the board.,
Add photos to your board.,
Bring lab equipment.,
Have your lab notebook handy.",How to Create a Science Project Display Board," You should choose a catchy, but appropriate title. You want to draw the attention of the judges and visitors to your table, while keeping the integrity of your experiment. The more noticeable you are, the more likely you are to get positive attention.A good title might be “Volcanic Explosions” as opposed to just “Volcanoes.”
When you can, use vivid, specific titles like “Bioluminescence in Crystal Jellyfish” in place of generic titles like “Glowing Jellies.”;
, An abstract is a preview of the work that you have done. It introduces your experiment to potentially interested readers. A hypothesis section is a statement that describes what you are going to test.Follow the guidelines of the assignment or fair to know if you need an abstract or a hypothesis section.
A hypothesis must accurately describe what is to be tested in the experiment, and what the expected outcome is. For example, a statement such as “The baking soda will react with the vinegar in a neutralization reaction, evolving gasses and building pressure inside the volcano replica. This pressure will cause fluid to spew from the top of the replica.”

, Whether you have a hypothesis section or your hypothesis is included in your abstract, you will still need to justify why you are doing this experiment. This justification comes from showing literature where others have done similar experiments that suggest that your experiment might be of interest. Gather scientific materials related to your project and post them in the literature section on your board.


Cite previous experiments that indicate that there is a reason to expect the results that your hypothesis predicts. For example, you could cite a lab experiment that states that acids and bases give off gas when they neutralize each other to support the hypothesis that baking soda and vinegar will go through such a reaction.

, The experimental (or procedure) section will detail what you actually did. In this section, you should show the steps you took (in order) and note any significant details such as changes in color, bubbling gases, etc. The procedure section is often the largest section., In any experiment, you will use some materials. This section allows you to detail the resources that you used and display them. This is important to show that you understood the products and steps involved in your project, and it makes it easier for anyone interested to replicate the experiment., The results section should detail what happened during the experiment. Any data that can be shown on charts or graphs should be added to the board in that way. Visuals such as charts and graphs allow visitors to quickly understand your results., Your conclusion should tell the reader why your results matter. The conclusions section is not a place to regurgitate your results, but instead you should expand upon them. You can even describe how your results might be relevant to future projects or other areas of science., You should start in the top corner of the leftmost panel. Place sections down the left side, until you get to the bottom. Move to the center panel and do the same. Place your last sections in the rightmost panel moving from top to bottom., Your introductory section should come first (either the abstract or hypothesis). Next, you should show your literature that justifies the experiment. Follow the literature with the experimental procedures and materials used. End the project with the results and conclusions sections.

, The abstract/hypothesis and literature sections should be on the leftmost panel. Your work is highlighted in the procedure and materials sections that should be placed in the center panel. Your results and conclusion should be placed on the right panel to conclude the board., Your title is the attention getter for the entire project. It should be displayed in large letters in the top center of the board. This will maximize the visibility of your project., You want to use good combinations of colors, for example, white and green go well together.You also want your fonts to vary a little. For example, the board’s title should have the largest font, the section titles should be the next largest, and the sections themselves should be typed in the smallest font on the board.All fonts should be easily readable. If the font is too small or unclear, this will discourage people from reading the information.
Use bullet lists, multiple paragraphs, and white space on your board to avoid an overwhelming amount of text.

, Use a gluestick and trace the perimeter of each item that you will glue to the board. This will help keep corners from pulling away from the board. Press the items firmly onto the board in the place you want them.If you prefer not to use glue, it may sometimes be acceptable to tack items to the board.
Double sided tape is a good way to stick on things that do not stick well with glue.

, Pictures will help make your project stand out. Choose photos that are relevant to your experiment, or take your own photos during the experiment. Be sure to read the rules regarding photos. Sometimes, you will be required to provide sources for every photo. You may or may not be allowed to use photos that include yourself (or other people)., Again, read the rules first. Your lab equipment can provide a hands on component to the experiment, but it isn’t always allowed. If you used several different pieces of equipment, only bring one or two pieces that are interesting and appropriately sized to fit in front of your board without distracting visitors from your project., Having a notebook is sometimes optional, but other times it is required during the judging process. Your notebook is the first hand account of your experiments and should be kept tediously. Have it with you in case you need to refer back to it to answer a question or provide additional details."

Check the reading on the voltmeter.",How to Create a Potato Battery1," To make a single potato battery you will need a potato, a galvanized nail, a copper coin, two alligator clip leads with clips on both ends, and a voltmeter.


Galvanized nails are standard nails that have a zinc coating. They can be purchased at any hardware or home improvement store.
Use a fresh potato as the experiment depends upon the juices inside the potato.;
, Push the nail into the potato until it is almost to the other side. It’s okay if you push it all the way through, just pull it back until it no longer sticks out of the other end.








Some juice will come out of the potato during this step, but that’s okay.
Cover your work surface with plastic or newspaper to avoid getting potato juice everywhere.

, Repeat the previous step with the copper coin. Make sure that the nails are not touching within the potato. If they touch, the circuit will not be complete and the battery will not produce any voltage.









If the nails do end up touching, simply reposition them so they are no longer touching.
The distance between the nails does not need to be exactly one inch, but you want them to be close together.

, The voltmeter should have a black lead and red lead. Connect the copper coin to the red lead of the voltmeter using the alligator clips.








Some voltmeters have black and yellow leads instead of black and red. In this case, use the yellow lead for this step.

, The galvanized nail should be connected to the black lead of the voltmeter.








Make sure the alligator clip is securely attached to both the nail and the lead.

, You should see a small increase in voltage on the voltmeter. You may notice that the voltmeter is reading a negative value. If this is the case, simply switch the clips on the voltmeter leads and it should change to a positive voltage.









If the voltage is very low, try moving the nails closer together. Again, make sure they are not touching within the potato.

Gather your materials.,
Squeeze the lemon without breaking its skin.,
Cut a small slit through the rind in the middle of the lemon.,
Insert the penny and the nail into the lemon.,
Attach the voltmeter clips to the nail and penny.",How to Create a Battery from a Lemon1," To make a lemon battery you will need a copper penny, a galvanized nail, a lemon (10 total), a knife, and a voltmeter. Adult supervision is recommended, especially while handling the knife. Rinse the penny with a light detergent to ensure you are working with a clean surface.Any lemon will do, but a lemon with a thinner rind will make a better battery.


If you have one, a strip of copper will work better than just a penny.
Galvanized nails have a zinc coating that is important to this experiment.They can be found in any standard hardware or home improvement store.
Aluminum foil can be substituted for the nail if you don’t have one.
A voltmeter can be purchased at a hardware or home improvement store.;
, You can roll the lemon on a table applying a small amount of downward pressure. The squeezing action releases the juices inside the lemon needed for the battery to work.









The acidity of the juice in a lemon makes it ideal for this sort of chemical reaction. It contains the solution of molecules necessary to carry electric current between the two metal ends of a battery., The slit needs to be large enough to insert the copper penny about halfway into the lemon. Adult supervision is recommended for this step. You want the penny to stay firmly in place so don’t cut the slit too large.







, The penny should fit nicely into the slit you’ve already made. The nail should be pushed into the lemon about 2 centimeters away from the penny. These items will serve as the positive and negative ends of your battery.









The metals need to be close to each other in order for the necessary chemical reaction to take place.Be careful not to have the nail and penny touch within each lemon. If they touch, the battery will not function properly and you won’t get any voltage.
Make sure the penny and the nail are deep enough to be in contact with the juice of the lemon.

, Using the end clips of the voltmeter, attach one clip to the nail and the other clip to the penny. You should see a small increase in voltage on the voltmeter. If the voltmeter is reading a negative value, simply switch the clips on the nail and penny and it should change to a positive voltage.








If the voltage is very low, try moving the nail closer to the penny.

Pick a specific topic.,
Isolate your variable(s).,
Make a hypothesis.,
Plan your data collection.,
Conduct your experiment methodically.,
Collect your data.,
Analyse your data and come to a conclusion.,
Pick a topic and define your variables.,
Make a hypothesis.,
Organize your data collection beforehand.,
Conduct the experiment.,
Analyze the data.,
Make your conclusions.",How to Conduct a Science Experiment," Experiments whose results cause sweeping scientific paradigm shifts are very, very rare. The vast majority of experiments answer small, specific questions. Scientific knowledge is built upon the accumulation of data from countless experiments. Pick a topic or an unanswered question with a small, testable scope.


For instance, if you want to do an experiment on agricultural fertilizer, don't seek to answer the question, ""Which kind of fertilizer is best for growing plants?"" There are many different types of fertilizer and many different kinds of plants in the world - one experiment won't be able to draw universal conclusions about either. A much better question to design an experiment around would be ""What concentration of nitrogen in fertilizer produces the largest corn crops?""
Modern scientific knowledge is very, very vast. If you intend to do serious scientific research, research your topic extensively before you even begin to plan your experiment. Have past experiments answered the question you want your experiment to study? If so, is there a way to adjust your topic so that it addresses questions left unanswered by existing research?;
, Good scientific experiments test specific, measurable parameters called variables. In general terms, a scientist performs an experiment for a range of values for the variable he's testing for. One vital concern when performing an experiment is to adjust only the specific variable(s) you are testing for (and no other variables.)


For instance, in our fertilizer experiment example, our scientist would grow multiple corn crops in soil supplemented with fertilizers whose nitrogen concentration differs. He would give each corn crop the exact same amount of fertilizer. He would make sure the chemical composition of his fertilizers used did not differ in some way besides its nitrogen concentration - for instance, he would not use a fertilizer with a higher concentration of magnesium for one of his corn crops. He would also grow the exact same number and species of corn crops at the same time and in the same type of soil in each replication of his experiment.

, A hypothesis is essentially a prediction of the experiment's result. It shouldn't be a blind guess - good hypotheses are informed by the background research you performed when choosing your experiment's topic. Base your hypothesis on the results of similar experiments conducted by peers in your field, or, if you're tackling a problem that hasn't been well-studied, base it on whatever combination of literature research and recorded observation you can find. Remember that despite your best research work, your hypothesis may very well be proven wrong - in this case, you've still expanded your knowledge in the sense that you have proven that your prediction was not correct.


Typically, a hypothesis is expressed as a quantitative declarative sentence. A hypothesis also takes into account the ways that the experimental parameters will be measured. A good hypothesis for our fertilizer example is: ""Corn crops supplemented with 1 pound of nitrogen per bushel will result in a greater yield mass than equivalent corn crops grown with differing nitrogen supplements.""

, Know beforehand when you will collect data and what kind of data you will collect. Measure this data at a set time or, in other cases, at regular intervals. In our fertilizer experiment, for instance, we'll measure the weight of our corn crops (in kilograms) after a set growing period. We'll compare this to the nitrogen content of the fertilizer each crop was treated with. For other experiments (such as ones that measure the change in a certain variable over time), it's necessary to collect data at regular intervals.


Making a data table beforehand is a great idea - you'll be able to simply insert your data values into the table as you record them.
Know the difference between you dependent and independent variables. An independent variable is the variable that you change and a dependent variable is the one affected by the independent variable. In our example, ""nitrogen content"" is the independent variable, and ""yield (in kg)"" is the dependent variable. A basic table will have columns for both variables as they change over time.

, Run your experiment, testing for your variable. This almost always requires you to run the experiment multiple times for multiple variable values. In our fertilizer example, we'll grow multiple identical corn crops and supplement them with fertilizers containing varying amounts of nitrogen. Generally, the wider range of data you can gather, the better. Record as much data as is feasible.


Good experimental design incorporates what's known as a control. One of your experimental replications should not include the variable you're testing for at all. In our fertilizer example, we'll include one corn crop which receives a fertilizer with no nitrogen in it. This will be our control - it will be the baseline against which we'll measure the growth of our other corn crops.
Observe any and all safety measures associated with hazardous materials or processes in your experiment.

, Record your data directly into your table, if possible - it'll save you the headache of re-entering and consolidating data later. Know how to assess outliers in your data.


It's always a good idea to represent your data visually if you can. Plot data points on a graph and express trends with a line or curve of best fit. This will help you (and anyone else who sees the graph) visualize patterns in the data. For most basic experiments, the independent variable is represented on the horizontal x axis and the dependent variable is on the vertical y axis.

, Was your hypothesis correct? Were there observable trends in the data? Did you encounter any unexpected data? Do you have any unanswered questions which might form the basis for a future experiment? Try to answer these questions as you assess your results. If your data doesn't give your hypothesis a definitive ""yes"" or ""no,"" consider running additional experimental trials and collecting more data.


To share your results, write a comprehensive scientific paper. Knowing how to write a scientific paper is a useful skill - the results of most new research must be written and published according to a specific format.

, For the purpose of this example, we'll choose a simple, small-scale experiment. In our experiment, we'll test the effects of different aerosol fuels on the firing range of a potato gun.


In this case, the type of aerosol fuel we use is the independent variable (the variable we change), while the range of the projectile is the dependent variable.

Things to consider for this experiment - is there a way to ensure each potato projectile has the same weight? Is there a way to administer the same amount of aerosol fuel for each firing? Both of these can potentially affect the range of the gun. Weigh each projectile beforehand and fuel each shot with the same amount of aerosol spray.

, If we're testing hair spray, cooking spray, and spray paint, let's say that the hair spray has an aerosol propellant with a higher amount of butane than the other sprays. Because we know that butane is flammable, we can hypothesize that the hair spray will produce a greater propulsive force when ignited, sending a potato projectile farther. We would write our hypothesis as: ""The higher butane content of the aerosol propellant in the hairspray will, on average, produce a longer range when firing a potato projectile weighing between 250-300 grams.""

, In our experiment, we'll test each aerosol fuel 10 times and average the results. We'll also test an aerosol fuel which contains no butane as our experimental control. To prepare, we'll assemble our potato cannon, test it to ensure it works, buy our aerosol sprays and carve and weigh our potato projectiles.


Let's also create our data table beforehand. We'll have five vertical columns:

The furthest-left column will be labeled ""Trial #."" The cells in this column will simply contain the numbers 1-10, signifying each firing attempt.
The following four columns will be labeled with the names of the aerosol sprays we're using in our experiment. The ten cells beneath each column header will contain the range (in meters) of each firing attempt.
Below the four columns for each fuel, leave a space to write the average value of the ranges.



, We will use each aerosol spray to fire ten projectiles, using the same amount of aerosol spray to fire each projectile. After each firing, we will use a long tape measure to measure the range our projectile traveled. Record this data in the data table.


Like many experiments, our experiment has certain safety concerns we need to observe. The aerosol fuels we're using are flammable - we should be sure to close the potato gun's firing cap securely and to wear heavy gloves while igniting the fuel. To avoid accidental injuries from the projectiles, we should also make sure that we (and any observers) are standing to the side of the gun as it fires - not in front of it or behind it.

, Let's say we found that, on average, the hair spray shot the potatoes the farthest, but the cooking spray was more consistent. We can represent this data visually. A good way to represent the average range for each spray is with a bar graph, while a scatter plot is a good way to show the variation in each fuel's firing ranges.

, Reflect on your experimental results. Based on our data, we can say with confidence that our hypothesis was correct. We can also say that we discovered something we didn't predict - that the cooking spray produced the most consistent results. We can report any problems or snafus we encountered - let's say that the paint from the spray paint built up inside the potato cannon's firing chamber, making repeated firing difficult. Finally, we can recommend areas for further research - for instance, maybe with greater amounts of fuel, we can achieve greater range.


We can even share our results with the world in the form of a scientific paper - given the subject matter of our experiment, it may be more appropriate to present this information in the form of a tri-fold science fair display.

Gather your materials together.,
Insert one galvanized nail into the middle of each potato.,
Push one copper coin into each potato about one inch apart from the galvanized nail.,
Connect the two potatoes with one alligator clip lead.,
Attach one clip lead to the copper coin and the other clip to the positive side of the battery box.,
Attach the second clip lead to the galvanized nail in the second potato and the negative side of the battery box.,
Check to see if the clock is working.",How to Create a Potato Battery2," To make a potato battery you will need two galvanized nails, two copper coins, two potatoes, three alligator clip leads with clips on both ends, and a small clock.


Galvanized nails are regular nails that have a zinc coating that is necessary for this experiment.They can be found at a standard hardware or home improvement store.
Copper coins, if needed, can also be found at a standard hardware or home improvement store.
It doesn’t matter what color your alligator clip leads are as long as they have clips on both ends.
Use firm and fresh potatoes. The liquid in the potatoes is necessary for this experiment, so dried out potatoes will not work.Remove the battery from the clock before you begin.

, Using firm pressure, insert the nail into the potato until it almost reaches the other side. If you accidentally push it all the way through, don’t worry! Simply pull the nail back so it is no longer sticking out.








Some potato juice may leak out while doing this, but it will not affect the experiment.
To make cleanup easier at the end, cover your work surface with newspaper or a plastic bag.

, Repeat the previous step with the copper coin, ensuring that it does not touch the galvanized nail.








At this point, each potato should have one galvanized nail and one copper coin inserted about an inch apart from each other.
The exact distance between the nails is not important, you just want them to be close together without touching.

, Attach one clip to the galvanized nail in the first potato and the other clip to the copper coin in the second potato. This will complete the circuit for your battery.









Finishing this step, the two potatoes should be attached to each other and the clock.
Check to make sure that all of your clips are securely attached.

, Look at the battery box and identify the (+) sign on one of the sides. Clip one end of the wire to this positive side. Take the other end and clip it to the copper coin in the first potato.








Make sure the clip is securely attached to the nail and the battery box.
This makes the first connection in the circuit for the battery.

, The other side of the battery box will have a (-) sign on it. Clip a new lead onto this negative end. Clip the other side of the lead onto the galvanized nail in the second potato.








Again, make sure to clip the leads on securely.
At this point, each potato should be connected to the clock, but not to each other. One wire should be attached to the copper coin on one potato and a second wire should be attached to the galvanized nail on the second potato.

, At this point, the second hand on the clock should be moving. It’s powered completely by the potato battery! If the clock isn’t working, check to make sure you have the correct leads attached to the battery box. The copper coin needs to be on the positive terminal and the galvanized nail needs to be on the negative terminal.


If it still isn’t working, try reversing the leads.
Make sure you are also using fresh potatoes.
When you’re finished, remove the leads connecting the potatoes and reinstall the battery into the clock.

10 lemons.,
Squeeze the lemons without breaking their skin.,
Cut the copper wire into five 3-inch pieces.,
Connect a penny and a nail with one piece of wire.,
Wrap a piece of wire around just one penny and one nail.,
Cut a small slit through the rind in the middle of the lemon.,
Insert the single copper-wrapped penny and nail into the first and last lemons, respectively.,
Insert the copper-wrapped penny and nail pairs into separate lemons.,
Attach the voltmeter clips to the free end wires.",How to Create a Battery from a Lemon2," A multi-cell battery is when you connect multiple batteries together. In this case, you will link multiple lemon batteries together. To make a multi-cell lemon battery you will need four copper pennies, four galvanized nails, four lemons, a knife, 15 inches of copper wire, wire cutters, a ruler, and a voltmeter. Any lemon will do, but a lemon with a thinner rind will make a better battery.


Adult supervision is strongly recommended, particularly when using the knife.
Clean the penny with a light detergent to maintain a clean working surface.If you have one, a lobster claw will do.
Galvanized nails have a zinc coating that is important to this experimentand can be found at a local hardware or home improvement store.
Aluminum foil can be substituted for the nail if you don’t have one.
You can link as many lemons together as you’d like to increase the voltage.

, Gently roll each lemon across a tabletop, applying a small amount of downward pressure. Squeezing the lemons in this way releases the juices inside the lemon needed for the battery to work.









The acidity of the juice in a lemon makes it ideal for this sort of chemical reaction. The molecules in the juice will carry the electric current between the two metal ends of the battery., Adult supervision is recommended for this step. Measure out 3-inch pieces of wire and snip them using the wire cutters. They don’t have to be exactly 3 inches, you just need enough wire to wrap around a penny and a nail.

, You are going to make copper-wrapped nail and penny pairs. Take a bit of wire and wrap it a few times around the penny and then take the other end and wrap it around the top of the nail. The penny and nail will be inserted into separate lemons so be sure to leave enough space (about 1.5 inches) between them.








Ensure the wire is wrapped tightly around each piece. The battery will not function as well without proper contact between each connection.
You should have three penny and nail pairs when you are finished.

, The battery will begin with a single copper-wrapped penny and end with a single copper-wrapped nail. Just as you did before, take a piece of wire and wrap it a few times around a penny. Using a separate piece of wire, wrap that a few times around the top of the nail.Again, wrap the wire tightly around each piece to make good connections.

, The slit should be large enough to insert the copper penny about halfway into the lemon. Adult supervision is recommended for this step. The penny needs to stay firmly in place so make sure the slit isn’t too large., Line up all four of your lemons and choose one to be the first and one to be the last. Stick the copper-wrapped penny into the slit you cut into the top of the first lemon in the chain. Insert the copper-wrapped nail into the last lemon in the chain.


It is not super important that all of your lemons stay lined up as long as the single penny and nail are stuck into separate lemons.

, Each lemon will ultimately have one penny and one nail sticking out of it. The first lemon in the chain will already have a penny, so stick the nail end of a pair into the first lemon. The second lemon will get the penny from that pair. The second lemon will also get the nail from the second pair of copper-wrapped pennies and nails.Continue alternating between pennies and nails until you reach the last lemon which will already have a single copper-wrapped nail.
Be careful not to have the nail and penny touch within each lemon. If they touch, the battery will short and you won’t get any voltage.

, Using the end clips of the voltmeter, attach one clip to the copper wire attached to the nail and the other clip to the copper wire attached to the penny. You should see an increase in the voltage reading on the voltmeter. If the voltmeter is reading a negative value, simply switch the clips between the nail and the penny and it should change to a positive voltage.








If the voltage is very low, try moving the nails closer to the pennies in each lemon and make sure all of the wires are in contact with each penny and nail.

Collect your materials.,
Put 2 chairs back to back.,
Cut string to 70 centimeter (27.6 in).,
Tie 5 metal washers to the free end of the string.",How to Build and Use a Pendulum1," This pendulum experiment is easy to do at home. All the materials should be readily available. For the purposes of this article you'll only be doing one pendulum, but you can cut more of different lengths, so make sure that your length of string is over 70 centimeter (27.6 in).Gather two chairs and a meter stick. You'll use the chairs and meter stick to create the frame for your pendulum. The pendulum will hang off the meter stick between the chairs.
The scissors are for cutting the string and the tape if you need it. The tape is if you end up using pennies instead of washers.
Your string should be at least 70 centimeter (27.6 in), but preferably longer. It can be string or yarn, depending on what you have available.
The stopwatch will be for recording things like the period of the pendulum and how the period changes when you change the angle of the pendulum or the length.
You can use five washers, or three pennies to weight the pendulum. These are good weights to use and easy to find in your house.;
, You will want them spaced about one meter apart, because you'll be placing the meter stick across the backs of them. Make sure that you're facing them back to back because otherwise the fronts will get in the way of the pendulum's arc.


Put the meter stick across the tops and make sure that it is centered between the backs of the two chairs. Off-centering the meter stick can make your calculations incorrect.
If the meter stick is sitting stably on the back of the two chairs, you can tape it down to keep it in place.

, This is the string that will make up one part of the pendulum. All you'll need to do is add a weight. If you do choose to make more pendulums of varying lengths you'll find that frequency of the pendulum (how many times it swings backwards and forwards per second) is dependent on the length of the string.


Tie the string towards the middle of the meter stick. This will make it so that the pendulum won't hit the chairs.

, These are your weights, which will turn the pendulum into the pendulum. Instead of metal washers you can use three pennies. Tape them securely to the free end of the string.


You'll find that a pendulum with a heavy weight will move at the same rate as a pendulum with a light weight (like a foam ball from a fabric shop, for example) because with gravity the acceleration (speed) of a falling object is the same whether it is heavy or light.

Turn the top of the bottle into a funnel.,
Create your measuring line.,
Mark off half-centimeter or half-inch intervals.,
Place the gauge at an optimal location.,
Pay attention to the weather.,
Repeat your measurements.",How to Build a Rain Gauge1," Use a pair of scissors to carefully cut the top of the bottle off. Cut just beneath where the bottle begins to narrow. A plastic soda bottle works best. Be sure to remove the paper label completely., Pour in the pebbles in the bottom of the bottle. Soda bottles are never flat. Pour in the pebbles to even out the bottom and to keep the gauge from tipping over if it’s windy or the downpour is extremely heavy., Remove the cap from the top of the bottle and turn it upside down. Place it upside down on the bottom part of the bottle so that the top is pointing downward. Secure the funnel in place by lining up the cut edges and taping the two halves together.Make sure that the top half is firmly held in place.

, Cut a long piece of duct tape and place it on the side of the gauge so that it creates a straight vertical line from the bottom of the bottle to the top. Take a marker and a straightedge to draw a horizontal line just above the pebbles. This is the bottom of the gauge.Use duct tape for it’s strong adhesive properties. Masking tape, or other forms of tape, may come loose when soaking wet.

, Take a ruler and place it against the tape so that the 0 lines up with the bottom line you have marked off. Use a marker to mark off every half-centimeter or half-inch along the tape until you get to the top. Label the centimetres or inches from the top to the bottom. You want to be sure that your measurements will be easy to read throughout the duration of the experiment.Every half interval does not need to be labeled. Label every other mark by beginning with the second mark as 1 inch or cm. The marks in-between each label are a half measurement. Make sure to wait until your marker dries on the tape before placing your gauge in the rain. Do not use washable markers or apply markings while in the rain. If you have to reapply new tape or new markings midway through the experiment, your results may be considered invalid.
You may use any unit of measurement your experiment calls for. You can mark off every quarter-inch, eighth-inch, or centimeter.

, Set your gauge on a level surface. Make sure it isn’t obstructed by any branches or in the way of people walking by. Pour some water in the bottom until it reaches the 0 mark and then you’re ready to collect.You may also use coloured jelly instead of water to give yourself a reference point of where to start measuring. Use jelly and not other liquid or it may dissolve and mix into the water, ruining your measurements. These bottles are not evenly shaped on the bottom so you must account for this by establishing your starting point.
Make sure that the gauge is in a protected area. You want to ensure that there’s no disturbance from wind, debris, or anything else that could block or prevent rain from entering, like a branch or powerline.

, Check the forecast for rain. Check your gauge exactly 24 hours later to see how high the water has risen. Now you know how much rain has fallen.Check how closely your measurements compare to official ones by checking the news or online for the rainfall measurements of your area for the day.

, You can continue measuring for 7 - 14 days or until your curiosity has stopped. If this is an experiment assigned by your teacher, make sure you follow every perimeter and take measurements until the experiment tells you to stop."
"
Pull the string tight at an angle from meter stick.,
Let the pendulum go.,
Time its arc.,
Release the pendulum again.,
Record your observations.",How to Build and Use a Pendulum2," You'll do this by holding the weighted end of the strings, where the washers or pennies are. Depending on the angle, the frequency of the pendulum can change.


For example, releasing the pendulum from a 90 degree angle to the meter stick might give you a different frequency of motion than, say, a 45 degree angle.

, Make sure that you're releasing it so that it won't hit anything during its swing. If it hits something you'll have to start over again. While you're letting the pendulum go, you're going to be timing its arc so be ready.

, Start timing the pendulum as soon as you release it. When the pendulum returns to its original position, stop timing. It can be helpful to have an assistant while you do this, so you can manage the pendulum while they manage the stopwatch.


The single arc that the pendulum makes is called the “period of the pendulum.” You can also find out the frequency by seeing how many times it swings back and forth per second.

, Time it to find out if the pendulum makes the same time as it did the first release. Make sure that you're releasing from the same angle. Have you noticed any change?

, Make note of the times of the period of the pendulum and its frequency so that when you start doing creative things with your pendulum you can see how things change.


This will help you to understand the two major applications of pendulums. One is for time telling, the other is called the Foucault Pendulum. For the former, the motion of the pendulum governs the movement of the clock hands.
The Foucault Pendulum demonstrates the rotation of the earth. It has to be incredibly large (sometimes over two stories high) so that it will swing over a longer period of time.

Cut a second string.,
Change the weight.,
Change the angle.,
Change the length.",How to Build and Use a Pendulum3," Using a second, or even third, string can help you demonstrate the special properties of the pendulum. Make the string shorter than your first one, or weight it differently.


Cut 2nd string to 35 centimeter (13.8 in), if you're testing how a difference in height works for pendulums.
Place the second string 20–30 centimeter (7.9–11.8 in) from the first one, so they don't bump into one another during their rotations.

, Test pendulums of different weights and see if there is any change in their rotation and in their frequency. Time them to see what, if any difference, there is.Repeat several times (around five) and average out the times that you've recorded, or oscillations of the pendulum. This will give you the average movement of the pendulum.

, While a slight angle change tends not to have any effect on the rotation of the pendulum, you might try making a really big difference and see what that does. For example, placing one string at 30 degrees and one string at 90 degrees.Again, while you're testing out the different angles, you'll want to repeat the experiment around five times to get the best information.

, Find out what happens with the speed of two different lengths of pendulum. Time them to see if the shorter pendulum is faster or if it remains the same as the longer one.


Repeat, repeat, repeat. Then average out the times and oscillations of the pendulum.

Get a plastic bottle.,
Cut off the top.,
Invert the top of the bottle.,
Place your rain gauge.,
Measure your findings.,
Account for an uneven bottle.,
Analyze your results.",How to Build a Rain Gauge2," Find an empty two litre plastic bottle from your recyclables. You can also buy a two litre bottle of soda from your local supermarket or corner store and empty it out. Make sure that it is completely empty and dry of its contents before using., Cut a consistent diameter by carefully positioning masking tape a quarter of the way down around the bottle to create a horizontal line. Use sharp scissors to cut the bottle at the masking tape. You want the diameter to be consistent., Remove the top of the bottle and invert it to fit upside down over the bottom of the bottle like a funnel. Use paperclips to hold the two halves snugly together. If there is a heavy downpour, you will need to make sure your rain gauge does not come apart., Find an adequate location to collect rain. You don’t want to place the gauge close to a high traffic area where it could get knocked over. Avoid placing it near buildings or trees where a change in wind direction could prevent any rain from falling into the gauge.Keep it upright by placing it in a bucket or container. You may also dig a hole for the gauge to stand about halfway in.

, Remove the gauge from its location at the prescribed time every day and take your measurement. Pour the collected rain into a measuring cylinder. Be careful not to spill any water.For example, your measuring cylinder may be measuring in cm so if you have collected rain for one week and the water you pour in from your rain gauge reaches the 10 cm mark on your measuring cylinder, you can ascertain that roughly 10 cm of rain has fallen during the week.
Compare your daily measurements. Using a pen and paper, record your findings every day at the exact same time of day to give you an accurate comparison.

, Most soda bottles are uneven at the bottom. Before you measure any rain, use a ruler to measure how much liquid fills the uneven bottom. Subtract this small amount from your final findings.

, Compare the amount of rain you gather to the length of time it takes to reach this amount. For example, how many days will it take to rain 15 cm. You can also compare the rainfall from month to month, week to week, or day to day. You may even graph your results to see the changes as the season progresses into the next.You may also compare your findings with the wind speed, wind direction, or air pressure. Be sure to always replace your gauge at the same location.

Some professional bakers think instant yeast and active dry yeast produces a worse flavor compared to fresh yeast, but others detect no difference in the end result.Never use brewer's yeast, champagne yeast, or wine yeast for baking.;
, Pour a small quantity of water or milk into a heat-safe container, writing down how much you use. The exact amount doesn't matter, but you should deduct this amount from the liquids in your recipe. 1/2 cup (120 mL) should be more than enough for a typical bread recipe.


For instance, if you use 1/2 cup (120 mL) of water to bloom the yeast, and the recipe calls for 1 cup (240 mL) of water total, use 1/2 cup (120 mL) of water instead since you'll be mixing in the remaining 1/2 cup (120 mL) along with the yeast.

, Warm the liquid to 105-110ºF (40–43ºC), which is warm but not hot or steaming. While yeast functions best at slightly lower temperatures, active dry yeast takes a little extra heat to get started.If you don't own a food thermometer, warm the liquid to a lukewarm temperature, aiming low. A slightly cooler liquid will take longer to activate the yeast, but too hot and the yeast will die and never activate at all.

, Only warm water is necessary to activate the yeast, but the sugar allows you to test whether the yeast is ready. Activate yeast will eat the sugar and produce carbon dioxide and other substances, which is exactly the process that makes bread dough rise and gives it a unique flavor. Stir in the sugar rapidly until it dissolves.


If you forget to add the sugar, you may add it after the yeast is already in the water. This is just as effective, but you should stir more gently to avoid spilling or damaging the yeast.

, Measure out however much yeast the recipe calls for and sprinkle it onto the liquid. If the recipe calls for fresh yeast, use 1/2 that amount of active dry yeast instead, since dry yeast is more concentrated.If the recipe calls for instant yeast, use 1.25 times that amount of active dry yeast instead.


Note that some types of yeast expand when added to water. Transfer to a larger container if necessary to avoid spilling during this process.

, As the yeast sit on the water's surface or slowly sinks, the water will dissolve the inactive yeast coating and free the active yeast in the center.After allowing time for this to happen, stir the yeast gently into the water.


These is no need to time this step precisely. It is unlikely the yeast will be affected by the stirring, even if you stir it in immediately.

, If the yeast is alive and active, it will start consuming the sugar and releasing carbon dioxide, the gas that causes bread to rise. If the surface of the mixture becomes foamy or bubbly, the yeast is active and can be added to the other ingredients according to your recipe.


You may have to look closely for bubbles around the edge of the bowl.
Other signs of activity may include a noticeable ""yeasty"" smell or an expanded volume, but these are not always noticeable.Unfortunately, if the mixture does not foam, the yeast is likely dead and cannot be used in recipes. You may wish to add some slightly warmed water, no hotter than 115ºF (43ºC), and let it sit an extra 10 minutes. If it has not foamed by this point, discard it.

, Add the liquid mixture containing the yeast when the recipe instructs you to add the yeast. Do not attempt to strain the yeast out.

Repeat to form the remaining squares into a cube.,
Stack two cubes on top of each other.,
Glue the joints of the cubes together.,
Clamp the joints of the cubes in place.,
Repeat the process with another cube.",How to Build a Popsicle Stick Tower," For each basic square you will use five popsicle sticks and wood glue. Each layer of the tower will be made up of four basic squares, so each layer will use 20 popsicle sticks. The number of layers you want to make will determine how many total sticks you will need.If you want five “floors” to your tower, you will need 100 popsicle sticks.
To make your tower as sturdy as possible, use wood glue instead of the basic white tacky glue.;
, Lay out four popsicle sticks in a square with the horizontal sticks on the bottom and the vertical sticks laying on top. You want the sticks to be evenly spaced apart so they make a perfect square. Using one popsicle stick as a measuring device, make sure each stick is one “popsicle stick width” from the edge.Lay two sticks vertically side-by-side across the two horizontal sticks to get the proper spacing.
To align the sticks together, use a straight edge such as a block of wood or a brick.

, Lift one end of a vertical stick and place a dab of glue underneath. Press the two sticks together. Repeat this with the other side of the popsicle stick and then two more times with the other vertical stick. At this point, you should have a basic four popsicle stick square glued together.Take care to maintain the accuracy of the square. This will be important when gluing the “floors” of the tower together. Make each module as square and regular as possible.
Use a heavy weight such as a brick or textbook and lay on top of the glued joints to keep them flat while the glue dries.
If the square gets bumped out of alignment, simply move the sticks back into proper placement.
If the sticks dry out of alignment, you can carefully cut them apart with a knife and re-glue them or just make a new square.

, Before continuing on to the next step, you want to let the glue dry. Follow the instructions listed on the bottle of glue you are using. The glue does not need to be completely dry, but you want to make sure it has set enough that the sticks will not move as you handle the square.


Leave the square under the heavy weight for at least 15 minutes before moving onto the next step.

, Place a popsicle stick diagonally on the “inside” of the square. The “inside” means the brace will be between the two vertical sticks and glued to the horizontal sticks. Place a small dab of glue at each end and glue the brace in place. The brace is essential stabilizing the structure and allowing it to hold more weight.Put weight on top of the whole piece and wait about 15 minutes for the brace to dry.
Try to glue the brace in the same place on each square.

, Starting with four new sticks, lay them out in a square and glue them together. After letting the glue set, add the brace to finish. Make enough squares to build your entire tower.


If you want five floors in your tower you will need 20 squares.
You will get better and better at building the boxes as you go along. Some of your earlier boxes may be ""less precise"", so if you have unlimited popsicle sticks, you may consider building additional boxes and discard some of the first attempts.

, Place one side with the cross brace facing out flat on a table. Slide a second square against the outside of the first piece so that it is sticking up. Slide the third square on the opposite side of the square.It might be easier to place the first square on a raised platform so you can easily slide the other sides under it.
Opposite sides should have braces going in opposite directions.

, Liberally apply glue at each corner to attach the sides together. Let the glue sit for at least 15 minutes to set before you try to glue the final side on. Place books or weights against each side to hold everything in place while it dries.While the glue is setting, you can start assembling other squares or cubes.
You may need to hold the two pieces together, allowing the glue to set a bit before you place the books/weights to hold it in place.

, Once the glue has set, you can attach the final side to the cube. Slide the side over the edges of the sticks and make sure that the brace is facing the opposite direction of the side opposite it. Apply enough glue to ensure a firm seal of the joint.


Wait for everything to dry. Continue to assemble other components while waiting for glue to set.
Again, you may need to hold the fourth wall in place to let the glue set so the cube will be formed properly.

, Repeat this whole process assembling four squares into a cube until you have enough cubes to build the tower as high as you want. Set up multiple work stations so you can build more than one cube at a time.


Each cube takes four sides, so if you want to build a tower with five floors, you will need a total of 20 sides.
While your forming the cubes, try stacking them on top of each other and make sure they align properly. If they don’t, either break the cubes apart and remake them, or start with a fresh set of squares and make a new cube.

, Stack a second cube on top of the first one so that the middle brace is going in the opposite direction of the side it’s stacked on top of. The tips of the popsicle sticks can overlap to give you a better position for gluing.The vertical sticks should be resting directly on top of the horizontal sticks.
Your cubes should fit together pretty well. If you have to work them together a little bit, the tower will still work, it just won’t be as sturdy. If you have to force them to fit together, the tower will lose structural integrity.

, Using the same wood glue used to assemble the other pieces, glue the joints of the cube together. Be generous with the glue to make a sturdier tower. If the squares have been properly constructed, they should fit together nicely.


If the cubes don’t sit nicely on top of each other, you may consider making a new cube so they stack properly. Uneven stacked cubes will not be as sturdy.

, Use clothespins or workbench clamps and attach the clips to hold the two cubes together. Clip them on in such a way that they hold the joints together, but are not touching the glue.


Wait for everything to dry before removing the clamps and adding another cube to the tower.

, Add another cube to the top of the tower making sure to alternate the direction of the diagonal cross beam for each level. Alternating the cross braces adds another level of structural integrity to the tower. Glue and clip each level to ensure strong bonding between the levels.When you glue the last cube on top, your tower is finished!

Examine fresh yeast for problems.,
Measure a small amount of water or milk into a heat-safe container.,
Warm the liquid.,
Mix in teaspoon (5 mL) of sugar.,
Add yeast to the liquid.,
Wait a few minutes and watch for bubbles.",How to Bloom Yeast2," Fresh yeast refers to yeast stored in a slightly moist, packed together form, which keeps it active but cannot preserve it for nearly as long as modern dry yeast packing methods. Be aware that fresh yeast likely won't survive freezing, and only lasts one or two weeks at room temperature, or one to three months at most in the refrigerator.If it has become hard or turned dark brown, it is likely not usable. You may still test it by blooming to be sure, but it's wise to purchase additional backup yeast in advance so you do not have to interrupt your baking.



Note: fresh yeast is also known as cake yeast, wet yeast, or compressed yeast.Never confuse liquid brewer's yeast with fresh baker's yeast. Only use baker's yeast (in any form) for baking.

, Measure out 1/4 cup (60 mL) of a liquid called for in the recipe you plan to follow. You may use more if you need a lot of yeast, but make sure to note down how much you use so you can deduct this amount of liquid from the recipe.


For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup (240 mL) milk, and you use 1/4 cup (60 mL) milk to bloom the yeast, only add 3/4 cup (180 mL) milk in addition to the yeast mixture.

, Warm the liquid slightly, to between 80-90ºF (27 – 32ºC), which is the temperature that encourages maximum yeast activity.Fresh yeast is already active, not dormant like some dry yeast, so there is no need to warm the liquid further to ""wake the yeast up.""


This temperature is only slightly warm. Steam or a skin forming on the milk means the liquid is far too hot and may kill the yeast.
Because fresh yeast contains moisture already, you do not technically need additional water. Water is recommended in most cases, since room temperature may not be warm enough for the yeast to bloom. However, if the room is warm, you may simply mash together sugar and yeast., Yeast feeds on almost any type of sugar, so mix in a small amount of white sugar, brown sugar, or anything natural and sweet. Artificial sweeteners cannot be used for blooming any type of yeast.

, Gently stir in an amount of fresh yeast called for by the recipe. Because fresh yeast contains some liquid ingredients as well as yeast, you will need to adjust the amount used if the recipe calls for a different type of yeast:If the recipe calls for active dry yeast, use twice as much fresh yeast as the amount listed.
If the recipe calls for instant yeast, use 2.5 times as much fresh yeast.

, If foam or bubbles form within 5 or 10 minutes, the yeast is alive and active, and the mixture can be added when the recipe calls for yeast. Otherwise, assuming the liquid wasn't too hot or cold, the yeast is likely dead and should be thrown away.


Because fresh yeast is kept active, it will likely not take as long to bloom as dry yeast.

Pour a little vinegar into a plastic bottle.,
Use a funnel or straw to put a little baking soda into a limp balloon.,
Stretch the neck of the balloon over the top of the bottle.,
Lift the balloon up over the bottle and watch the reaction.,
If it doesn't work, try again with more vinegar or baking soda.,
Understand chemical reactions.,
Learn about baking soda and vinegar.,
Read about the reaction.,
Study the chemical formula.",How to Blow up a Balloon With Baking Soda and Vinegar," Choose a plastic water bottle, or another bottle with a narrow neck. Pour 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) of vinegar into the bottle, using a funnel if you have one. Use white vinegar, also called distilled vinegar, for the best result.


You can try this with any kind of vinegar, but the inflation might take longer or require more vinegar to work. Other types of vinegar tend to be more expensive as well.
Vinegar can damage metal containers, potentially adding an unpleasant taste to food and drink stored in that container. If you have no plastic bottles, use a high-quality stainless steel bottle to minimize the chance of this happening. Weakening the vinegar with an equal amount of water might also help, and won't prevent the balloon from inflating.;
, You can use any shape and color of balloon. Hold it loosely by the neck, with the open side of the balloon facing towards you. Fit a funnel into the neck if you have one, then pour about two tablespoons (30 mL) baking soda into the balloon, or just fill the balloon about halfway full.








If you don't have a funnel, you can place a plastic straw into a pile of baking soda, put your finger over the top hole of the straw, then poke the straw into the balloon and lift your finger. Tap the straw to get the baking soda to fall out, and repeat until the balloon is at least 1/3 of the way full., Be careful not to spill the baking soda while you do this. Hold the balloon's neck with both hands and stretch it over the top of the plastic bottle containing vinegar. Have a friend keep the bottle steady if the table or bottle is wobbly.








, The baking soda should fall out of the balloon, through the neck of the bottle, and into the vinegar at the bottom. Here, the two chemicals will fizz and react, turning into other chemicals. One of these is carbon dioxide, a gas, which will rise up and inflate the balloon.









Shake the bottle gently to mix the two ingredients if there's not much fizzing.

, If the fizzing has stopped and the balloon still hasn't inflated after you count to 100, empty out the bottle and try again with more vinegar and baking soda. The stuff left in the bottle has turned into other chemicals, mostly water, so it can't be used again.


Don't go overboard. The bottle should never be more than about 1/3 full of vinegar.

, Just about everything around you is made up of molecules, or different types of substances. Often, two kinds of molecules react with each other, breaking up and forming different molecules out of the pieces.

, The reactants, or substances that reacted with each other in the fizzy reaction you saw, are baking soda and vinegar. Unlike many ingredients in your kitchen, both of these are simple chemicals, not complicated mixtures of many chemicals:


Baking soda is another word for the molecule sodium bicarbonate.
White vinegar is a mixture of acetic acid and water. Only the acetic acid reacts with the baking soda.

, Baking soda is a type of substance called a base. Vinegar, or acetic acid, is a type of substance called an acid. Bases and acids react with each other, partially breaking apart and forming different substances. This is described as ""neutralization"" because the end result is neither a base nor an acid. In this case, the new substances are water, a kind of salt, and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, a gas, leaves the liquid mixture and expands throughout the bottle and the balloon, inflating it.


Although the definition of acid and base can get complicated, you can compare the differences between the original substances and the ""neutralized"" result to see there are obvious changes. For instance, vinegar has a strong smell and can be used to dissolve grime and dirt. After being mixed with baking soda, it smells much less strongly and is no more effective at cleaning than water is.

, If you're familiar with some chemistry, or curious about how scientists describe reactions, the formula below describes the reaction between sodium bicarbonate NaHCO3 and acetic acid H C2H3O2(aq)NaC2H3O2.Can you figure out how each molecule splits apart and reforms?


NaHCO3(aq) + HC2H3O2(aq) → NaC2H3O2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
The letters in parentheses show the state the chemicals are in during and after the reaction: (g)as, (l)iquid, or (aq)ueous. ""Aqueous"" means the chemical is dissolved in water.

Compete in an inventor challenge.",How to Become a Young Inventor," The very first step in any inventing process is to identify the problem that your invention will solve. Look at the world around you and ask yourself: What could work better? What task could be done better or faster? What annoys you and how could you fix it?Ask friends or family about daily problems they face and record their feedback.
The problem doesn't need to be new and the device doesn't need to be new. Even if a dozen designs for a particular device exist, you're still inventing something if you make a new design to do the same thing in a different way.
Be creative with your ideas. Not every idea will be a great one, but don’t be afraid to think outside the box.
Some problems that have been solved in the past include:

The telephone solved the problem of rapid communication. Before the telephone, the fastest way to communicate was using a telegraph and Morse code. With the telephone, you skip the translation of the code and speak directly to another individual!
Crayon holders: Invented by 12 year-old Cassidy Goldstein who solved the problem of coloring with broken crayons.;
, Have you ever had a brilliant idea and then forgotten about it later? Carry a notebook around to take notes as ideas come to you so you don’t forget about them. Add a little note about how the idea came to you and write the date next to it.Use your notebook to keep track of inventions you’re currently working on and to write down ideas about new inventions.

, You may have come up with a fantastic idea, but it’s possible that someone else has already thought of it. Do a quick search online to see if something similar has already been made. With your parents help, search for patents that might already exist for your idea.If your idea does exist, don’t be discouraged; it just means that you came up with such a great solution that it has already been made.

, People have been coming up with creative ways to solve problems for thousands of years. Reading about famous inventors and the inventions they came up with can spark your own problem-solving creativity. Learn about their process and apply it to your own life.Be inspired by reading about other young inventors.
Look at other inventions in your surroundings and learn how they work. Inventions don't need to be complicated, simply functional.

, Ask your parents to help you contact other inventors to meet with them. Ask them about their process and how they came up with their ideas. Getting first-hand information about what it takes to be an inventor is a great beginning step to becoming an inventor yourself.


Ask them how long it took them to come up with an idea and make a workable device.
Find out how much time and effort they put into their inventions. Did they ever come up with an idea that they couldn’t make work? What do they do when that happens?

, Draw out a basic diagram of what your invention will look like. Label every component and make notes in the margins about how various pieces will go together. List the types of materials you would use to build the finished project. Don’t hesitate to make multiple sketches of the same design until you are satisfied with the result.Start the sketch with pencil so you can erase mistakes.
Use colored pencils or markers to add the finishing details.
If you’re a little more advanced, you can use a Computer Aided Design (CAD) program to make a 3D model of your invention on the computer.

, Once you’ve come up with an idea and a basic sketch, talk to your parents about it. They may be able to help you with some of the details and point out any design flaws you may have missed. They can also give you an idea of how much supplies will cost and whether it is feasible to create a working prototype., A prototype is a working model of your idea. It will likely not be a very polished version, but will prove the concept behind the idea itself. You don’t need to use the highest quality materials, but simply ones that will give you a functional working device.Make a list of everything you’ll need and how much of it is necessary.
Look around your home for recycled materials that you may be able to use and then purchase the rest with permission from your parents.
Learn all you can about the things that will comprise your invention, whether those are wood or metal rods, circuits and software, motors and gears, or fabrics and threads. The more you know about how the pieces work and how they work together, the more robust your invention can be.
If you need any special tools for construction, ask your parents if they have them or if they know anyone who might have access to them. Find out if your school has a workshop that you can use.

, If you will be working with power tools or other dangerous materials, you will likely need adult supervision. Ask your parents when they have enough free time to sit down with you and start building. If you have an older sibling, ask them if they can help you out as well.


If there are components that don’t need adult supervision, work on those when your parents are too busy to help you with the power tools.

, Once you have all the materials you need and the necessary supervision for construction, you can build your prototype. Be precise in your building and try to make it as close as possible to the sketch you’ve made.Measure twice and cut once. You don’t want to mess anything up because you weren’t paying attention while measuring.


You may find that while building the prototype you have to change the design a bit. This is all part of the inventing process.Always have a parent in the room with you while you are inventing. They know how to use the tools and will be a huge help.
If you have to use a hot glue gun, there are mini ones on the market. You can use those by yourself, but make sure a parent is in the room.
Wear old clothes you don't care about to avoid getting paint and glue all over good clothes.

, Does your finished product work? Is it solving the problem the way you envisioned? Are there improvements you can make that will work better? Will a different material work better for the final construction? These are all important questions you need to ask yourself to decide if your idea is going to be a success.


Ask your parents to test out the device and if they have any suggestions for improvements. Ask them what they like about it and what they might change.
Constructive feedback is an important part of the process. If something isn’t working, use the information they give you to make it better.

, Invention workshops will guide you through the basics of coming up with an idea, building it, and then telling other people about why your idea is important and useful.There are young inventor workshops all over the world that you can sign-up for and participate in.There are also camps available for young inventors that might be of interest., In most cases a simple name, describing the function of your invention is sufficient, but a catchy name can also help people remember your product. Keep the name short and to-the-point. Avoid using a confusing or misleading name.Come up with a few different names and ask your friends and family what sounds the best.

, In order to protect your invention and claim it as your own, you must patent it. A patent is a legal document stating that you came up with the idea and proves that you own the invention. It prevents other people from stealing your idea.The patent process can be complicated so ask your parents for help with this if it’s something you are seriously considering.

, If you want to mass produce your invention and start selling it to others, you will likely need to raise some money. Investors are individuals who give you money when you are first starting out so you can produce the product. In return, they will get some of the profits from the sales of product.You can start by asking friends and family to help out.
Participating in inventor challenges can be a great start because many of them have cash prizes.

, Inventor challenge competitions are a great way to show your inventions. Some of these competitions may have specific problems that they are trying to solve, while others are completely open to submit whatever you like. If you have a working prototype, consider submitting it to an open competition.Find a competition near you and register for it.
Turn in all of the components on time to be eligible for the competition.
Some of the top competitions include:

Buy or cut some white carnations.,
Create your vases or cups.,
Cut the carnations.,
Split the stems.,
Place each piece of stem in a different cup or vase.,
Leave the flowers.",How to Make Multi Colored Carnations1," You need fresh, white carnations to do this experiment. If you try to use a darker color, you won't be able to see the change as much. You can buy white carnations at any florist and in most grocery stores, too., You need a vase or cup for each color you want to use. Shorter will probably work better than taller. If you want red and yellow carnations, you'll need two vases. Fill up each vase about 1/4 of the way with water. Next, add in food coloring for each color you want to create.You'll need a lot of food coloring to get an effect, at least 15-20 drops. You'll need more if you want them darker.

, Once you have your vases ready, you'll want to cut your flowers again. Cutting the flowers again allows them to draw up more of the colored water. It's best to cut the flowers under running water or underwater because that keeps the flowers from getting air bubbles in their stems, which block the water., To create carnations that are multi-color, you must split the stem in half with a craft knife or box cutter. Split it down the middle lengthwise, being careful not to cut your fingers. Only adults should do this step. You may also be able to split it three ways, if the stem is especially thick., Gently pull the stems apart at the bottom. Slip one part of a stem into one cup and the other part into another cup. Make sure you do not separate the bottom stems from the flower or break the stems higher up. The cups should be right up next to each other, so you don't have to spread the bottom stem apart too much., Now, you must wait, as this process takes time. You'll need to wait at least a day for the color to develop. In fact, color will continue to develop over the next several days if you leave it in the colored water. You may only see parts of the flower petals changing color, not the whole petal."

Use large rear wheels.,
Use thin, light wheels.,
Use a narrow rear axle.,
Create traction by giving the edges of the wheels friction.",How to Adapt a Mousetrap Car for Distance1," Large wheels have greater rotational inertia than small wheels. In practical terms, this means that once they start rolling, they're harder to stop rolling. This makes large wheels perfect for distance-based contests — theoretically, they'll accelerate less quickly than smaller wheels, but they'll roll much longer and they'll travel a greater distance overall. So, for maximum distance, make the wheels on the drive axle (the one the mousetrap is tied to, which is usually the rear one) very large.


The front wheel is a little less important — it can be large or small. For a classic drag racer look, you'll want big wheels in the back and smaller ones in front.;
, Thinner wheels have less friction and may go farther if distance is what you want or need with your mousetrap racer. It's also important to take the weight of the wheels themselves into account — any unneeded weight will ultimately slow your car down or lead to added friction. In addition, it's worth noting that wide wheels can even have a small negative effect on the car's drag due to air resistance. For these reasons, you'll want to use the thinnest, lightest wheels available for your car.


Old CDs or DVDs work fairly well for this purpose — they're large, thin, and extremely light. In this case, a plumbing washer may be used to reduce the hole size in the middle of the CD (to fit the axle better).
If you have access to old vinyl records, these also work extremely well, though they may be too heavy for the smallest mousetraps.

, Assuming your car is a rear-wheel drive car, each time your rear axle turns, the rear wheels turn. If your rear axle is extremely skinny, your mousetrap car will be able to turn it more times for the same length of string than it would if it were wider. This translates to turning your rear wheels more times, meaning greater distance! For this reason, it's a wise idea to make your axle out of the skinniest material available that can still support the weight of the frame and wheels.


Narrow wooden dowel rods are a great, easily-accessible choice here. If you have access to thin metal rods, these are even better — when lubricated, they usually have less friction.

, If the wheels slip against the ground, when the trap is sprung, energy is wasted — the mousetrap works to make the wheels turn, but you don't get any extra distance. If this happens with your car, adding a friction-inducing material to the rear wheels may reduce their slippage. To keep your weight requirements down, use only as much as is necessary to give the tips of the wheels some grip and no extra. Some suitable materials are:Electrical tape
Rubber bands
Popped balloon rubber
Additionally, placing a piece of sandpaper under the rear wheels at the start line can reduce slippage as the car begins to move (when it is most likely).

From a standard piece of wrapping tissue paper, you can usually make 8 squares that are 8 inches each, which will make a good size carnation, about the size of a regular carnation or a little larger., Use your hand to crumple up the paper into a loose ball. You can crumple all 8 layers at once. Basically, you want to create wrinkles in the paper to give it a similar effect to carnation petals. Un-crumple the paper, and separate out the layers., Once you've got the layers separated, start with one layer, and smooth it out. Pinch the ends slightly. As you do, try to create pleats across the middle. You don't want perfect pleats. Rather, you want the middle to just ruffle up a bit. Repeat for each layer.However, if you prefer, you can accordion each layer in perfect pleats for a slightly different effect., Now that you've ruffled each sheet, stack them together, one on top of each other. They don't have to match up perfectly--they just need to mostly align, though the ends are more important than the sides. These flowers are forgiving., With the pieces aligned, find the middle, lengthwise. Wrap floral wire around the middle. Fold the papers up away from wire. Use pliers to cinch the wire more tightly around the middle of the papers.If you don't have crafting wire, you can use ribbon, yarn, a twisty tie, or cord. However, with floral wire, you can make a stem for the carnation., About an inch above the floral wire, tie a piece of string around the flowers, gathering the two sides you folded up together. Cut off any excess string. About another inch or two above that, tie it again. Make sure you leave enough paper at the top to form the petals and the flower., Now you'll make the base of the flower with floral tape. Starting with the last place you tied, wrap the floral tape around the flower, and slowly spiral down, covering the other place you tied, too. Move on to the floral wire, covering the place you pinched. You can cover the whole wire down to the bottom or stop wrapping the floral tape near the base of the flower., Move back up to the top of the flower where the petals are. Make sure the petals are fluffed out into a carnation shape. Rearrange any petals that need it to make it look more like a carnation until all the petals are in place. Tie a ribbon around the wire if you are giving out the carnations individually."

Fill a pan with water.,
Add food coloring to the water.,
Collect all other materials needed.",How to Make Water Rise1," The pan should be an inch or two deep at least. You need a pan that can hold enough water so that it isn’t all sucked up into the glass. If all of the water gets sucked up into the glass, then air will be able to get in. Since the water is heavier than the air, it will fall back out of the glass because of gravity. , This step is optional. The food coloring does not contribute to the science involved at all. It does make the water easier to see as it rises up the glass. This is especially important for a large audience that might not be able to get close to the glass., Make sure that you have a glass, a candle, and a lighter or match before starting. It does not matter what kind of match or lighter that you use. You must use a glass and not a plastic cup. Using a short candle also keeps the flame from directly touching the glass.


If you try to substitute a glass with a plastic cup, it will melt and the experiment will fail.
Tea light candles work well for this experiment.

Build the lightest frame possible.,
Make the frame long and narrow.,
Use glue instead of nails wherever possible.,
Keep your frame's structural integrity in mind.",How to Adapt a Mousetrap Car for Distance2," Above all, your car should be light. The smaller the mass of your car, the better — every gram or milligram you can shave off of your car's frame is a little further your mousetrap will be able to push your car. Try not to have any extra frame material beyond what's necessary to keep your mousetrap and wheel axles in place. If you see wasted space on your frame, try removing it, or, if this is impossible, make holes in it with a drill to bring its weight down. You'll also want to use the lightest material possible for your frame. Here are just a few suitable ones:


Balsa wood
Hard plastic sheets
Thin, light metal sheets (aluminium/tin roofing material, etc.)
Building toys (K'NEX, Legos, etc.)

, Ideally, you want your car to be shaped aerodynamically — that is, so that it presents the smallest possible surface area in the direction it will travel. Like an arrow, a longboat, an airplane, or a spear, a vehicle that's designed with maximum efficiency in mind will almost always have a long, skinny shape to minimize drag from air resistance.For the purposes of your mousetrap car, this will mean making your frame both narrow (though it will be difficult to get your frame any narrower than the mousetrap itself) and vertically skinny.


Remember, to minimize drag, you're trying to give your car the narrowest, smallest profile possible. Try getting down on the ground and looking at your car from the front to spot pieces of the frame that make your car's profile unnecessarily large.

, Wherever you can, try to use glue in your car's design, rather than nails, pins, or other heavier solutions. For instance, you should only need to use just a few small spots of glue to fix your mousetrap to the frame. Generally, glue will hold just as well as nails, which can add unnecessary weight.


Another advantage of glue is that it shouldn't usually affect your car's air resistance. On the other hand, if either end of a nail sticks out of your frame, it can have a minor effect.

, The only limiting factor when it comes to how light and skinny you can make your mousetrap car's frame is its fragility — if it's too light, it may become so fragile that the action of springing the mousetrap breaks the car apart. The delicate balance between achieving the maximum distance and making your car unstable can be quite tricky to get right, but don't be afraid to experiment. The mousetrap itself is unlikely to ever break, so as long as you have extra frame material, you'll have the freedom to make mistakes.


If you're using an extra-fragile material like balsa wood and you're having a hard time getting your frame to hold together, consider adding a small strip of sturdier material like metal or plastic on the underside of the frame. Doing this increases the structural strength of the car while minimizing the change to its air resistance and weight.

Give your trap a long ""arm"" to increase its leverage.,
Position the trap as far forward as possible.,
Ensure minimal friction on your moving parts.,
If you're allowed to, use the most powerful mousetrap possible.",How to Adapt a Mousetrap Car for Distance3," Most mousetrap cars work as follows: the mousetrap is ""set"", a string tied to the arm of the mousetrap is carefully wrapped around one of the wheel axles, and, when the trap is sprung, the swinging arm of the trap transfers its energy to the axle to turn the wheels. Since the arm of the trap is fairly short, if the car isn't carefully constructed, it can pull on the string too rapidly, causing the wheels to slip and energy to be lost. For a slower, steadier pull, try attaching a long pole to the arm to act as a lever, then tying the end of the string to this, better than to the arm itself


It's important to use the right material for your lever. The lever shouldn't bend at all under the stress of the string — this represents wasted energy.Many guides recommend sturdy balsa constructions or balsa reinforced with metal to give a sturdy yet light lever.

, Assuming that your trap will be turning the rear wheels, you'll want your car's mousetrap to be far forward on the frame as it can be without touching the front wheels. The longer distance between the trap and the wheels, the better — more distance means you'll be able to loop more string around the axle for just a little extra slow and steady pulling power.

, For maximum distance, you'll want to be using as close to 100% of your mousetrap's power as possible. This means reducing the friction on surfaces of your car where points slide against each other. Use a mild lubricant, like WD-40, auto grease, or a similar product to keep the points of contact between a car's moving parts well-oiled so that the car ""runs"" as smoothly as possible.


Many mousetrap car building guides identify the axle as the primary source of friction on a mousetrap car.To minimize axle friction, rub or spray a little lubricant on each axle where it meets the frame, then, if possible, work it into the contact point by sliding the wheels back and forth.

, Most of the time, for mousetrap car assignments, all students will be required to use the same size of mousetrap so that everyone's car designs have the same amount of power. However, if you don't have this restriction, feel free to use the most powerful mousetrap you can find! Bigger traps like rat traps provide much more power than basic mousetraps, but they also require sturdier constructions or they may break the car apart when they're sprung, so you may need to reinforce your frame and/or axles to accommodate.


Keep in mind that rat traps and other large rodent traps can easily break fingers, so handle armed traps with extreme caution, even when you're confident that the trap is rigged up to your axle and shouldn't be able to close freely.

Add about 40 ml of dish soap and swirl to mix.,
Add the potassium iodide to the solution and quickly stand back!,
Test for the presence of oxygen.,
Clean up.",How to Make Elephant Toothpaste," You don’t need to buy official lab equipment for this fun experiment as most of the supplies can be found at any home. Create a list of what you have available to you and see what you can improvise if anything is missing. For example, if you do not have 6% hydrogen peroxide, you can also use 3%.;
, Remember that this can get messy so tell everyone involved that they have to pitch in for cleanup afterwards. Allow enough time for everyone to participate and enjoy the experiment.

, Experimenting with oozing foam can be fun at any age but it’s easy for kids to get carried away. Whether you plan to conduct the experiment in the bathtub, out in the yard, or use a large baking pan or plastic bin, minimize cleanup by preparing a contained space.

, The amount of hydrogen peroxide will determine how much foam you generate. While you might have some 3% hydrogen peroxide in your medicine cabinet, you can also go to a beauty supply store to find 6% as it usually is not readily available at grocery stores or drug stores. Beauty supply stores will sell 6% hydrogen peroxide as bleaching agent., You can let the kids do this step. Allow them to measure out the yeast and mix in the correct amount of warm water. Have your little one stir it to get out all the clumps.Depending on your child’s age, you can have them use a fun spoon and stirring tool. You can also have the put on goggles and a lab coat. Kid safety goggles can be found at your local hardware store.

, Make sure everyone wears gloves and safety goggles before handling the hydrogen peroxide. Do not let your kids handle the hydrogen peroxide unless you think they are old enough.If your child is too young, have the little one squeeze the dish soap and food coloring into the bottle. You can also add glitter to make it more fun. Make sure the glitter is plastic and not metal-based because peroxide should not be used with metal.Stir the mixture yourself or have your child do it if old enough. Be sure that the hydrogen peroxide is not spilled.

, Quickly stand back and remove the funnel. You can allow your child to pour the yeast but if she is young, keep within arms distance to ensure the bottle doesn’t spill onto her. Use a short bottle with a wide base for stability. Make sure the neck is narrow to increase the effect.The fungi in the yeast immediately cause the hydrogen peroxide to decompose and strip off an extra oxygen molecule. The yeast acts as a catalyst as it causes the hydrogen peroxide molecule to release an oxygen molecule. The stripped off oxygen molecule takes the form of a gas and once it hits the soap it creates fluffy foam bubbles, while the rest stays as water. The gas looks for an escape route and the foam “toothpaste” gushes out of the bottle.Make sure the yeast and hydrogen peroxide are mixed well for optimum effect.

, If you choose smaller bottles with narrower escape routes, you will have a more powerful oozing foam. Play around with the size and shape of your bottle for greater effects.With a regular soda bottle and 3% hydrogen peroxide, you will probably get a cascading effect like a chocolate fountain.

, Observe how the foam gives off heat. The chemical reaction is known as an exothermic reaction so heat is given off. The heat is not enough to cause any harm so you can definitely feel the foam and play around. The foam is just water, soap and oxygen so it isn’t toxic.

, You can use a sponge to clean up the area and pour any extra liquid down the drain. If you decided to use sparkles, strain them out of the liquid and throw them out before pouring down the drain., The concentrated hydrogen peroxide used in this experiment will burn the skin and eyes. It can also bleach fabric, so choose your clothing with that in mind., Be sure to handle with care and make sure the graduated cylinder is set on a stable location.

, Create fun patterns and color variations. To make the final product striped, tilt the graduated cylinder and drip food coloring down the sides.

, Add a small layer of liquid dish soap by pouring it into the solution down the side of the cylinder.You can also use powdered dish soap but be sure to mix the solution thoroughly.

, Using a spatula, add the potassium iodide to create the chemical reaction. You can also dissolve the potassium iodide in water in a vial before adding to the solution. Large colored foam will rise out of the cylinder.

, Place a glowing wood splint near the foam and watch it reignite as the oxygen is released from the emerging foam., Flush the remaining solution down the drain using plenty of water. Make sure all glowing wood splints are out and there are no open flames. Close and store the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide.

Put the candle into the pan of water.,
Place the glass over the candle.,
Watch for bubbles.,
Allow the candle to burn out.,
Watch the water rise into the glass.",How to Make Water Rise2," Make sure not to get the wick wet. Light the candle in the center of the pan of water.If you are using a tea light candle, it will sit in the pan on it’s own. If you are using a tall slender candle, it may tip over. To avoid this, use a short candle holder to stabilize the candle.

, Flip the glass upside down and set it overtop of the candle. Make sure that the opening of the glass is completely submerged in the water. This provides a seal that prevents air from entering the glass and allows the water to rise into the glass.If the candle is touching the glass, you can either get a shorter candle or a taller glass. This will ensure that the experiment goes well.

, As the candle burns, it heats the gas inside the glass. This will cause the gas to expand, raising the pressure inside the glass. Some gas will need to escape the glass to relieve the pressure.. The only way for gas to escape is through the water at the bottom of the glass. Once the pressure gets high enough, the gas will have no choice but to bubble out through the water. , The burning candle converts two oxygen molecules (2O2) and one molecule of paraffin wax (CH4) to one carbon dioxide molecule (CO2) and two water molecules (2H2O). With no air entering the glass, the candle will burn all of the oxygen available. When the oxygen runs out, the fire on the candle can no longer burn.Though there may be oxygen left in the glass, the candle will go out when it has used up all of the oxygen that is close enough to fuel the flame.

, When the candle burns out, the remaining gas will cool quickly. The cooling gas contracts (shrinks its volume) and creates a vacuum in the glass. The outside pressure will force the water into the glass to fill the vacuum. This will be easier to see if you chose to color the water with food coloring. Keep in mind that the water will only fill part of the glass, since there is still some gas trapped in the glass."
"
Know what chemical reaction is taking place.,
Recall Charles’s Law.,
Consider what happens when the gas cools.,
Understand pressure differentials.",How to Make Water Rise3," There are many incorrect explanations for this experiment. In order to understand what is really going on you need to know what chemistry is taking place. The combustion reaction occuring is:2O2 + CH4 → Co2 + 2H2O

, Charles’s Law is a piece of the ideal gas law that says that the volume of a gas will change proportionally with temperature (and vice versa) when outside pressure and the mass of the gas remain constant. Since the walls of the glass do not change the amount of pressure that they exert on the gas inside, the pressure in this experiment remains constant. The gas cannot enter the glass because it is upside down in the water, creating a seal.


Technically, since the combustion reaction converts two O2 molecules into one CO2 and two H2O molecules, the amount of gas temporarily increases. However, the candle will not keep the temperature inside the glass above 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) and the two H2O molecules will condense into liquid water. This means the amount of gas in the glass effectively decreases ‘’’while the candle burns’’’.Charles’s Law applies in this case only because the amount of gas in the glass remains constant from the time that the candle burns out. Without the combustion, no more gas is consumed or produced. The heat source simultaneously disappears, allowing the gas to cool and decrease in volume., Since the volume of your gas is proportional to the temperature, it decreases as the gas cools. This decrease in volume creates a vacuum inside the glass. The pressure outside the glass remains the same, so this creates a pressure differential., Within any given system, fluids move from the high pressure end to the low pressure end. With air sealed out of the glass, the water is forced from the high pressure end of the system (outside the glass) to the low pressure end of the system (inside the glass) until the pressure inside the glass is equal to the pressure outside the glass.This is a little like opening a faucet. The pressure outside the water line is lower than the pressure inside the line, so the water is forced through the line and out of the faucet (even if it has to go against gravity to do so).

Gather the necessary materials.,
Remove the batteries from the digital clock.,
Insert one nail and one short piece of copper wire into each potato.,
Use the alligator clips to connect the potatoes and clock.,
Check the connections and set the clock.",How to Make a Potato Clock1," Before you can get started putting together your potato clock, you first must gather the items you’ll need. You can likely buy most of these items at your local hardware or hobby store, except the potatoes which will need to be purchased at a grocery store.2 potatoes
2 copper rods
2 zinc rods
3 alligator clip assemblies (each should be two clips connected by wire)
A simple, low voltage digital clock;
, When completed, the potatoes will connect to the positive and negative ends of the battery terminals inside the clock instead of the batteries. You will want to keep the battery cover removed so you can easily access the terminals with your wires.If the clock does not have the positive and negative battery connectors labeled, mark them yourself using a permanent marker based on the way the batteries were connected.
If they are labeled, the positive end will be marked with a “+” and the negative will be labeled with a “-“.

, Begin by labeling the two potatoes as 1 and 2, this will help you to differentiate them as you move forward with the experiment. Then press one nail about an inch into each potato near the end. Once the nail is secured, press a piece of copper wire into the opposite end of the potatoes, as far from the nail as possible.Each potato should have one nail and one copper wire sticking out of opposite ends.
Make sure the nail and wire aren’t touching inside the potato.

, You will be connecting each of the potatoes together and to the clock utilizing the three alligator clip units. In doing so, you will establish a circuit that includes the clock and each potato that will allow electrical current to pass through. Connect each of the following:Connect the copper wire in the first potato to the positive (+) terminal in the clock's battery compartment using the first alligator clip.
Connect the nail on the second potato to the negative (-) terminal in the clock.
Use the third alligator clip unit to connect the nail in the first potato to the copper wire in the second one.

, As soon as you connect the third alligator clip unit to the two potatoes, the clock should turn on. If it fails to do so, check each of the connections to ensure they are tight and there is good metal on metal contact in each.This method will not last for very long, so after confirming that it works, you may want to disconnect it if you hope to enter the clock into a science fair or present it to your class.

This creates a rainbow as the light exits the prism.You can buy a prism at a science supply store, a hobby store, or online. Basic prisms are relatively inexpensive.;
, The prism operates by splitting a beam of white light into its component colors. To see this, you will need a high intensity light source. Putting the prism by a sunny window or outside on a sunny day will be best., Make sure that there is nothing blocking the light from reaching the prism. As the light passes through, it will bend and be split into a rainbow. It might be easier to see if you aim the prism at a white wall or a white piece of paper."

Begin by gathering your materials.,
Place one nail in each potato.,
Insert a penny or copper strip into each potato.,
Connect the potatoes in a series.,
Connect the potatoes to the clock.,
Check the connections and set the clock.",How to Make a Potato Clock2," As with any experiment, you must begin by gathering the materials you will need. You can purchase most of these materials at your local hardware or hobby store, or you may even have some of them at home already. Gather the following:3 potatoes
3 copper strips, or you can use pennies
3 galvanized nails
4 alligator clip units connected with wires (10 total clips)
1 low current digital clock

, Just like making a two potato clock, each potato will need one galvanized nail inserted into it. Place the nail near the end of the potato and press it in about an inch. Then repeat for the other two potatoes.Make sure the nail doesn’t break through the other side of the potato.
Ensure you don’t press the nail into the potato in such a way that will make it touch the penny or copper strip you will insert next.

, Press a penny or copper strip into each of the potatoes on the opposite end from the nail. If you are using a penny, make sure to press it into the potato so half of the penny is still visible above the surface of the potato skin so you can attach an alligator clip to it in the subsequent steps.If using a copper strip, make sure you don’t insert it so far into the potato that it comes into contact with the nail.
Try to separate your copper from the nail as much as possible in the potato.

, Once you have a galvanized nail and a piece of copper in the ends of each potato, you can connect them to one another in a series to produce more electricity. Place the three potatoes in a row in front of you and use the alligator clip units and wires to connect them to one another sequentially. Make sure the potatoes are lined up in the same way, with the nails all on one side and the copper on the other.Attach an alligator clip to the copper end of one potato, then connect it to the nail on the next one.
Repeat that process until each of the outside potatoes are connected to the middle one with one wire.

, The two outer potatoes should only have one wire connecting them to the middle potato. Now attach an alligator clip unit to the remaining nail on one potato, and another separate clip to the remaining piece of copper in the other potato.Attach the alligator clip unit coming from the nail to the positive terminal inside the battery compartment of the clock.
Attach the alligator clip unit coming from the nail on the final piece of copper to the negative battery terminal.

, Once both clips are attached to the positive and negative battery terminals, the clock should turn on. If it doesn’t, check each of the connections to ensure they are attached tightly and there is good metal on metal contact.Once connected securely, the clock will come on.
You may want to disconnect it to avoid depleting the chemical energy in the potatoes if you need to show the experiment at a fair or in class.

Check the wire connections.,
Add another potato.,
Soak the potatoes in Gatorade.,
Swap the potatoes out for conductive fruit.,
Ensure you have the right materials.",How to Make a Potato Clock3," If your clock fails to work, there may be an issue with one of the connections between the potatoes or the clock. Make sure that each connection is tight and that there isn’t any material separating the metal from the alligator clip from the galvanized nail or the piece of copper. You also need to ensure the connections are made in the correct order: wires should connect negative to positive. The nail on one potato should connect to the copper on the next and so forth.Try replacing pennies with strips of copper to ensure a strong connection.
Make sure each alligator clip is firmly attached where it belongs.

, If everything is connected properly but the clock is still not working, it may be because your potatoes aren’t producing enough voltage to power the clock. You can use a multimeter or voltmeter to check the amount of voltage being produced by your potato batteries if you have them, or you can try adding another potato to your battery chain to increase the amount of power it produces.Connect an additional potato just as you connected the first ones: run an alligator clip unit from the copper of one potato to the galvanized nail on the next, then from the copper on that potato to the clock or the next potato.
If another potato still does not make the clock work, there is either an issue with the connection or the clock.

, Soaking the potatoes overnight in Gatorade can increase their conductivity and help ensure your potato powered clock works. Gatorade contains electrolytes that can help conduct the electrical current through each potato, but you’ll need to soak the potatoes overnight in order to ensure the electrolytes reach the center of the potato.Gatorade also contains phosphoric acid, which adds to its conductive properties.

, If you cannot make your potato powered clock function, you may want to try swapping the potatoes out for another conductive fruit. Lemons and oranges both work as great replacements for potatoes when conducting this experiment. Place the nail and copper into the fruit just as you did the potato.Rolling the fruit on the table first can help break down the interior of the fruit, allowing fluid to travel more easily, and as a result, the electrical current too.

, Using the incorrect materials can make it far more difficult or even impossible to correctly assemble your potato clock. Look over your materials and the packaging they came in so you can make sure you have exactly what you think you have.


Make sure the package you purchased the nails in says they are galvanized. While most nails are, this experiment will not work if they are not.
Ensure the clock you purchased runs on 1-2 volts and takes a traditional “button-type” battery. You can see how many volts it requires on the product information on the package."

, Set the bottle contraption on the ground and have a helper hold a funnel just over the top of the bottle. Have another helper standing ready with the bottle cap to seal the bottle once you’ve filled it. Fill the bottle with about 2"" (5cm) of liquid nitrogen. (The amount is inexact and does not matter too much).

, The cap-holding helper should quickly cap the bottle tightly. You have less than five seconds to get the bottle capped and in the garbage can.

, Drop the bottle into the center of the can and then get out of the way. The explosion will occur in about 15-30 seconds.

, Make sure everyone is standing at least 30 feet (9.1 m) away. More is preferable. The explosion is really big. This explosion mimics what is called a Plinian Eruption, a particular type of volcanic eruption often associated with Mt. St. Helens or ancient Vesuvius. The water will launch into the air and rain down


Wait at least two full minutes before assuming the experiment has gone wrong. Approach very carefully, wearing safety equipment. If it does not work, the cap was probably put on incorrectly."

Turn your mist so that it catches the light.",How to Make a Rainbow2," Usually, rainbows are seen in the rain. That is because there are many water droplets falling through the sky refracting the sun’s light. To mimic that, you should find a source of water that can be moved. A water hose or a spray bottle will work nicely., A stream of water is not ideal for creating a visible rainbow. Instead, you want a mist of water that the sun has to pass through. You can create this mist by holding your thumb over the end of a water hose, or turning a nozzle to the “mist” position., Once you have a steady mist, turn so that the sun’s light passes directly through the mist. This will allow the sunlight to be refracted by the small droplets of water. You will see the rainbow form in the mist."

If you do this, place a mirror in the container and submerge it halfway at a 45 degree angle., The light should shine through the top of the glass and directly hit the surface of the water. The light should shine out the side of the glass, and a rainbow will be visible. The water causes the light to refract much in the same way that a prism does., If you are struggling to see the rainbow, position the glass so that it shines onto a white wall or a white piece of paper. This backdrop will make it easier to see the rainbow. You can use other colors, but this might not be as effective.If you are using a mirror in a tub, place the paper above the mirror to see the light when it refracts.

Food coloring
Water;
, Use just enough water to cover the bottom of the jar. You only want to use a small amount of water so that the water can evaporate.


Swirl the water around inside the jar so that it covers the sides.
Use oven mitts, since the boiling water will make the jar very hot.

, Have the fingers of the glove pointing downward into the jar. This will seal in the air into the jar.

, Once your hand is in the glove, move it upward so that you pull the fingers of the glove up. You’ll notice that nothing happens to the water in the jar.

, Take the glove off the jar for just a moment. Light a match (or have an adult light it for you) and drop it in the jar. Stretch the glove back over the jar, with the fingers pointing down into the jar.


The water at the bottom of the jar will put out the match, and smoke will form in the jar.

, Slide your hand into the glove and pull it outward again. This time, a cloud will form in the jar. When you put your hand back inside the jar, the cloud will disappear.This will last for 5-10 minutes, and then the particles will settle into the bottom of the jar.

, When you shine a light on the jar, you will be able to see the clouds better.

, The air is full of warm water vapor molecules inside the jar. The air is compressed by the glove because the glove takes up some of the space inside the jar. Pulling the glove fingers out of the jar releases some space in the jar. The air inside the jar cools. The smoke from the match acts as a vehicle that the water molecules can attach to. They stick to the smoke particles, condensing into cloud droplets.When the glove fingers go back into the jar, the air inside the jar warms up again and the cloud disappears.

, Add a few drops of food coloring to the water in the bottom of the jar. Then cover the jar, add a lighted match, and watch your clouds bloom in a different color.

Large glass jar (one gallon size) with lid
Aerosol (hairspray or air freshener)
Flashlight or lamp
Water
Dark-colored paper and flashlight

, Put enough water in the jar to cover the bottom (about 2 centimeters). Swirl the water around so that the jar heats up. This will also prevent any condensation from forming in the jar.


The jar will be very hot. Be sure to use oven mitts to hold the jar.

, Turn the jar lid upside down so that it’s a little bowl. Place two ice cubes in the lid. Lay the lid on top of the jar. You may now see some condensation in the jar.

, Use an aerosol product like hairspray or air freshener to spray into the jar. Lift the iced lid up and quickly spray a small amount into the jar. Replace the lid to trap the aerosol in the jar.

, Use a dark piece of paper to create contrast. This way, you will be able to see the cloud that has formed in the jar.


You can also use a flashlight to shine into the jar.

, When you lift the lid off the jar, the cloud will float out. You can let it pass through your fingers.

, You created hot, moist air in the jar when you poured in the boiling water. The ice on the lid works to cool the air as it rises. This water vapor will turn back into a liquid when it cools, but it needs a surface to condense on. When you spray the aerosol into the jar, you’ve given the water vapor a surface. The molecules stick to the aerosol and condense into cloud droplets.The clouds swirl around inside the jar because the air inside is swirling around. The warm air is rising while the cool air is sinking. You can see the movement of air as the clouds swirl.

Assemble your supplies.,
Pour hot water into the bottle.,
Strike a match.,
Toss the burned match into the bottle.,
Screw the cap onto the bottle.,
Squeeze the sides of the bottle hard.,
Look at the formation of fog in the bottle.",How to Make a Cloud in a Bottle3," Have your supplies on hand before you start on this experiment. You will need:


Plastic bottle with a cap: A 2-liter soda bottle is ideal for this experiment. Make sure to remove the label from the plastic bottle. Then you will be able to see the clouds when they form inside the bottle. It is also best to choose a clear bottle.
Matches
Water

, Use hot water from the tap. Pour in enough water to cover the bottom of the bottle (about 2 centimeters).


Don’t use boiling water in a plastic bottle. The plastic might warp and the experiment won’t work. The water should be hot, though. Try for about 130 degrees Fahrenheit.Swirl around the water a bit to warm up the sides of the bottle.

, Blow it out after a few full seconds. Make sure an adult is doing this step.

, Tilt the bottle with one hand and insert head of the match into the top of the bottle. Let the smoke from the match fill the bottle. , where it will seem to disappear. Discard the match.

, Grip the neck of the bottle so that you do not squeeze the sides before the cap is screwed in completely. This prevents any smoke or air from escaping.

, Do this three or four times. Wait a few seconds then squeeze the bottle again, this time holding the squeeze longer before releasing.

, You should see your very own cloud there! Putting pressure on the bottle's sides forces the water particles to compress. When you let go of the sides of the bottle, the air expands, decreasing the temperature. When the air cools, the particles can stick together a little more easily, which causes them to clump into little tiny droplets around the smoke molecules. This mimics the process of clouds forming in the sky. Clouds in the sky are made up of water droplets that have clung to tiny particles of dust, smoke, ash, or salt.

Explain the theory behind the experiment.",How to Crush a Can with Air Pressure," Rinse a soda can with water, and leave approximately 15–30 mL (1–2 tbsp.) of water in the bottom of the can. If you don't have a measuring spoon, pour in just enough water to cover the bottom of the can., Fill a bowl with cold water and ice, or with water that has been kept in a cold refrigerator. A bowl deep enough to hold the can might make it easier to conduct the experiment, but it is not necessary. A clear bowl will make it easier to watch the can get crushed.

, In this experiment, you'll be heating this soda can until the water inside it boils, then rapidly moving it. Everyone nearby should be wearing splash-proof goggles in case hot water is sprayed toward their eyes. You'll also need a pair of tongs to grab the hot can without burning yourself, then turn it upside down into the bowl of ice water. Practice picking up the can with the tongs so you're sure they can pick up the can firmly.


Continue only with adult supervision.

, Place the soda can upright on a stove burner, then turn the heat setting on low. Let the water boil outside the can, bubbling and letting out water vapor for about thirty seconds.If you smell something strange or metallic, move on to the next section right away. The water might have boiled away, or the heat might have been too high, causing the ink or aluminum on the can to melt.If your stove burner cannot support the soda can, use a hot plate, or use tongs with heat-resistant handles to hold the soda can over the stove.

, Hold the tongs with your palm facing upward. Use the tongs to pick up the can, then quickly turn it over above the cold water bath, plunging the can into the bowl of water.


Be prepared for a loud noise as the can is rapidly crushed!

, The air around you is pressing against you and every other object, with a pressure as high as 101 kPa (14.7 pounds per square inch) when you're at sea level.This would normally be enough to crush a can by itself, or even a person! This doesn't happen because the air inside the soda can (or the material inside your body) is pushing outward with equal pressure, and because the air pressure ""cancels itself out"" by pushing at us from every direction equally.

, When the water in the can boils, you can see the water start to escape as little droplets in the air, or steam. Some of the air in the can gets pushed out when this happens, to make room for the expanding cloud of water droplets.Despite the can losing some of the air inside it, it doesn't get crushed yet, because the water vapor that took the place of the air is pushing from the inside instead.
In general, the more you heat a liquid or a gas, the more it expands. If it is an enclosed container so it can't keep expanding, it exerts more pressure., When the can is turned upside down in the ice water, the situation changes in two ways. First, the can is no longer open to the air, since water is blocking the opening. Second, the water vapor inside the can rapidly cools down again. The water vapor once again shrinks down to its original volume, the tiny amount of water at the bottom of the can. Suddenly, most of the space inside the can has nothing in it at all – not even air! The air that's been pressing from the outside of the can this whole time suddenly has nothing on the other side to resist it, so it crushes the can inward.


Space that has nothing in it is called a vacuum.

, The appearance of a vacuum, or empty space, inside the can has one other effect besides causing the can to be crushed. Watch the can carefully as you lower it into the water, and again as you lift it out. You might notice a small amount of water getting sucked up into the can, then trickling out again. This is because the water pressure is pushing against the opening of the can, but only hard enough to fill a little of the can before the aluminum is crushed.

, See if the students have any ideas about what happened to the can. Do not affirm or deny any of the answers at this stage. Acknowledge each idea, and ask the students to explain their thought process.

, Ask the students to come up with new experiments to test their ideas, and ask them what they think will happen before they conduct the new experiment. If they have trouble coming up with a new experiment, help them out. Here are a couple variations that may be helpful:


If a student thinks the water (not the water vapor) inside the can was responsible for it getting crushed, have the students fill an entire can with water, and see if it is crushed.Try the same experiment with a sturdier container. The heavier material should take longer to be crushed, which will give the ice water more time to fill it.
Try letting the can cool for a short time before putting it in the ice bath. This will result in more air being present in the can, and thus less severe crushing.

, Use the information in the How it Works section to teach the students why the can was crushed. Ask them whether that matches what they came up with in their experiments.

Choose a space that is easy to clean.,
Put some baking soda in a small cup.,
Prepare the coconut.,
Add some toys and props.,
Pour some plain vinegar into another small cup.,
Add a spoonful of dish soap to your cup of vinegar.,
Add food coloring.,
Use a syringe to draw up some of the “lava.” Use a bulb syringe or a regular small syringe to suck up as much liquid as possible.,
Squirt the lava solution into the top of the coconut volcano.,
Watch the eruption.,
Replace the baking soda and do it again.,
Let your kids participate.",How to Create a Coconut Volcano," This is a messy project so find an area that can cope with getting a little messy, or work in an area that can be covered thoroughly with newspaper (such as the kitchen counter or table). You can skip the messy newspaper if you do the experiment outside on gravel.Another suggestion is to do it in the bath tub (during a bathtime is even better since the lava will start to change the color of the bath water)., You want to add about a cup of baking soda inside your volcano. You can use an empty yogurt cup or other plastic container to hold the baking soda underneath the volcano shell. Just be sure that the cup is clean and dry., Start by using a screwdriver to open up one or more of the holes on the top of the coconut. Drain the coconut water out through these holes. Then, you can use the blunt end of a knife to break the coconut in half along the groove that wraps around the middle of the coconut (in most store bought coconuts). If there is no groove, you can make one with a knife or other sharp object. Clear out the flesh of the coconut, and place the side with the three holes upside down over your baking soda cup.Any steps involving a knife, screwdriver, or other potential safety hazard should be done or supervised by an adult.

, You can set some plants or toy trees around the volcano. Then add a few dinosaurs or forest animals to the scene. This will help kids stretch their imaginations and make the volcano even more fun. You can also make up a story to go along with the erupting volcano., A plastic cup will be fine for this step, too. You will need to put about one cup of vinegar in the cup.This will make enough lava solution for several eruptions.


Since vinegar is an acid, it will react with the baking soda (which is a base) in what is known as a neutralization reaction. This releases gasses and ultimately causes fizzing and bubbling that these volcanoes are known for. The gasses released also build the pressure necessary to force the “lava” out of the volcano., Adding a little bit of dish soap will help make the more bubbles. As the vinegar and baking soda react, they release gases that must move through the soap to escape. This causes the soap to bubble up, much like when you blow bubbles outside. About one teaspoon of soap should work well, but you can experiment with more or less to change how your lava looks., The food coloring doesn’t contribute to the reaction, but it does give your lava the red color that kids might expect (unless you use a different color). You should only need a few drops, but again, you can try adding more or less to see how it changes your lava. Just be careful not to get the food coloring on any easily stained surfaces or clothes.Using washable paint is a good alternative to using food coloring. It is less likely to stain surfaces or hands, and still gives your lava a fun color!, Do this near the coconut to minimize spills and drips from transporting the lava solution to the coconut. Wearing gloves during this step can help minimize stains on your hands and fingers., Remember the three little holes that you used to drain the water? Now you can stick the syringe in one of those same holes and squirt in your lava solution. This will bring the lava in contact with the baking soda and start the reaction!, Pull the syringe away quickly and step back to watch the volcano. The vinegar solution and baking soda should start to react, sending bubbles and liquid out of the holes at the top of your coconut volcano. The kids love this part, and it’s a great time to explain the science involved., The best thing about the coconut volcano is that it is easy to replicate. Just lift the coconut up and put more baking soda underneath. Then, get some more of your lava solution and make it erupt again.When you are finished making your volcano erupt, you can save it to use as a normal toy volcano., Watching the volcano erupt is great, but actually helping create and carry out the experiment will make your kids love it that much more. Using the syringe to suck up the lava and squirt it into the volcano will give them a chance to work on their fine motor skills. Also, seeing that they can cause the volcano to erupt will make them more receptive to learning the science behind their new entertainment."

These kinds of miniature cars are often used for physics experiment when learning about mechanical advantage, gravity, and gear ratios. For the purposes of this example, heavy cardboard will be used as the chassis, but you also might use:


Foam core.
The body of an old toy car.
A piece of light, durable wood, like balsa wood.;
, You can modify the design of your car to achieve certain goals. For example, if your physics class is having a distance race competition, you'll want to:


Lighten your car as much as possible. If using a solid chassis, this might include drilling holes in its frame and wheels.
Use wheels that are both thin and stiff.
Decrease air resistance by making the front of your car small and sleek., If your car will be traveling up a ramp or across hilly terrain, smaller wheels will be able to manage the incline better due to inertia. Flat surfaces, like table and floors, can be best traversed with larger wheels., As previously mentioned, there are many different materials you might use to make your mousetrap car. Some additional options are listed in the ""Tips"" below. However, to make the mousetrap in this example, you will need:


Compass (for drawing circles)
Duct tape
Durable string
Elastic bands/rubber bands
Eye hooks (4)
Heavy cardboard or foam core
Mousetrap
Pliers
Ruler
Thin dowels (2)
Utility knife

, You'll need to create four wheels out of your heavy cardboard or foam core. To do this, take your compass or some other round object and your pencil to trace your wheels-to-be onto the cardboard. In this example, one inch (2.5 cm) diameter front wheels and two inch (5 cm) diameter rear wheels were used. After you've traced your wheels:









Use your utility knife to cut your wheels free.
Attach rubber bands around the outside edge of the wheel to give the wheels additional traction.
You might also use CDs, DVDs, and vinyl records to make your wheels.NOTE: In this example, larger back wheels and smaller forward wheels are used.

, There will likely be sharp teeth at the end of the rod. Carefully remove the rod, and if it has any sharp teeth, use your pliers to pull these free.








, To accommodate your mousetrap, you'll need your chassis to be about ½"" (13 mm) bigger on all sides than your trap. Measure and mark this out on your cardboard, and then use your utility knife to cut out your chassis from the cardboard.Balsa or basswood make a light but more durable body for the car., Center the mousetrap on top of the chassis and then, using duct tape or clear packaging tape, secure the mousetrap into place on all 4 sides.









While taping your trap into place you should avoid taping the spring. The spring should be found in the middle of the trap and snapper arm.

, If these hooks are out of line, your car won't travel straight, so you should:









Use your ruler and a pencil to mark the location of your eye hooks in the four corners of your chassis.
Double check the marks are evenly lined up with your ruler.
Screw the eye hooks into place through the cardboard chassis where you have marked.

, These dowels/wooden skewer sticks will be the axle rods for the wheels that you made. They should be thin enough to slide through the eye hooks and spin freely.









Eye hooks that are too thick or skewers that are too thin will cause the axle rod to pivot in its eye hook holder, which could affect the alignment of your car.

, This should create holes that are slightly smaller than the dowel rods. Then you should:









Wind a rubber band onto your axle so that it is close to the body, but not touching it. This will form a buffer between your wheel and the chassis of your car, but can create friction if it comes in contact with your chassis.
Push your wheels onto the axle rods. If you have larger drive wheels, these should go on the rear axle and the smaller wheels on the front axle.
Your axle dowels should extend past your wheel about 1"" (2.5 cm).

, The elastic band will keep the wheels from falling off of the car.








, Carefully lift the snap-arm just enough to slide one end of your string beneath it. Then, wrap the string around the snap-arm and tie a tight knot to secure the string.









A general knot, like a square knot should work fine for attaching your string to the arm of your trap.

, Before you do, make sure that it is long enough to reach past the car's rear axle. The longer the string, the longer time it will take for the force of your trap to be released, which will create slower acceleration but greater distance traveled.







, Your string is the part that will transfer force from the spring mechanism of your mousetrap to the rear wheels of your car. Pull back the snap-arm and hold it securely. While you are holding the snap-arm:









Use your free hand to wrap the string tightly around the car's rear axle.
Continue winding until no string remains.
The string should be tight enough to hold down the snap-arm when held.

, Place the car on the ground while still holding the snap-arm. Make sure you have a good grip on the end of the string. This should keep your snap-arm in place, and releasing should cause the arm to snap forward, propelling your car.

, Move your hands clear of your mousetrap car and let go of the string. The kinetic energy of the mousetrap spring will transfer through your string to your read axle, causing your mousetrap car to travel forward a few feet, depending on construction and the length of the string.

Pull the trigger to launch the trebuchet.",How to Build a Trebuchet (1 Meter Scale)," To build the base, you will need the following tools: hammer, electric drill, a 1” drill bit, some nails and wood screws, and a saw. Remember, power tools are dangerous; always use caution and use adult supervision when necessary. The supplies for the actual base include:2 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) wood pieces, 36” (91.4 cm) long
2 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) wood pieces, 12” (30.5 cm) long
2 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) wood pieces, 23” (58.4 cm) long
¼” (6.35 mm) plywood that is between 20”-24” (50.8 cm – 61 cm) square
1 piece of flat wood (can be plywood) that is 10”-12” (25.4 cm – 30.5 cm) wide and 36” (91.4 cm) long to serve as baseboard
1” (2.54 cm) diameter dowel rod, 15” (38.1 cm) long
Two eyehooks;
, The plywood needs to be cut into triangles. These triangles will serve as supports to stabilize the trebuchet when it is in use. Using a jigsaw or table saw (whichever is available) cut the square from corner to corner through the center.If you don’t have a table saw or jigsaw, many home improvement stores will cut wood for you before you take it home.

, Measure 13” (33 cm) from the left side of one of the 36” (91.4 cm) long pieces of wood and make a mark. Place the 23” (58.4 cm) long piece of wood perpendicular to the 36” (91.4 cm) long piece of wood on top of the mark that you made.Lay one of the triangle-shaped pieces on top of these supports so that the base of the triangle is aligned horizontally with the bottom of the 36” (91.4 cm) piece of wood and the straight side is aligned vertically with the left side of the 23” (58.4 cm) piece.
Hammer nails into each corner and 2-3 nails along each side of the triangle.

, Use the same process detailed above, but make it in a mirror image. This will ensure that when you build the base, both supports will face the same direction and the wooden triangles will face out.When both sides are constructed, line them up and make sure they are identical mirror images of each other.

, Stand the side supports up making sure the triangle wood pieces face out. Place one 12” (30.5 cm) long piece of wood between each side of the ends of the supports. Using the drill, attach the pieces together with two screws on each side.At this point, the base is almost finished. You should have a rectangular base with two vertical supports.
The triangles point towards the front of the trebuchet.

, Measure about 2 inches (5 cm) from the top of each arm and drill a hole about 1” (2.54 cm) in diameter. Make sure the dowel rod fits through the holes. If it doesn’t, make the holes larger.You don’t want the hole to be too large because you want the dowel rod to be secure.

, Place the baseboard on top of the bottom of the base. Hammer nails along the edges to secure it in place. You can also screw the baseboard into place if you prefer.Screw two eyehooks into the front end of the trebuchet baseboard about 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.

, A trebuchet works with a counterweight system. In addition to the materials listed, you will need something heavy to serve as a counterweight. You can use some hand weights, a brick, or a small bucket that you can fill as needed to vary the weight. To build the launching arm of the trebuchet, you will need the following supplies:1 hammer
1 2”x4” (5 cm x 10 cm) piece of wood, 40” (1 m) long
About 5 feet (1.5 m) of string
A piece of cloth to make a pouch, any cloth, 10” x 6” (25.4 cm x 15.2 cm)
Two eyehooks
1 long thin nail with the head removed

, This hole needs to be large enough for the dowel rod to fit through and rotate without friction. Measure 10 inches (25.4 cm) from the top of the 40” (1 m) long piece of wood and make a mark. Make the hole at this 10” (25.4 cm) mark slightly larger than the diameter of the dowel rod (1”, 2.54 cm).Test the rotation by putting the rod through the 2x4. If the 2x4 rotates without resistance, the hole is large enough.
This is the back end of the swing arm.

, One eyehook will serve as the attachment point for the string and pouch while the other eyehook will be part of the trigger. Screw the first eyehook into the very end of the swing arm, on the bottom. Screw the second eyehook into the bottom of the swing arm about one inch (2.54 cm) from the end.Hammer the first eyehook into the end until just the loop of the hook is sticking out.

, Make sure that the head of the nail has been completely removed. When the trebuchet launches, the string on the nail needs to be able to fly off the nail and it won’t be able to do that if it gets caught on the head. The head can be removed with a Dremel tool.Hammer the nail into the flat end of the swing arm, approximately in the middle.
Bend it slightly forward so that the string will stay on until the trebuchet is launched. The angle of the bend will need to be optimized using trial and error launches.

, You can vary the weight on the back easily by putting more or fewer rocks inside. Drill a small hole into the back end of the swing arm about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the end. Feed some string through the hole and tie the bucket in place.


You want the bucket to hang vertically down but still be close to the arm. Tie it so that it hangs about 1-2 inches (2.5 – 5 cm) from the top of the arm.
Fill the bucket with rocks or heavy pieces of metal.
Alternatively, you can attach a heavy weight such as a 20 pound (9 kg) hand weight directly to the end of the arm.

, Trim the corners of the 10” x 6” (25.4 cm x 15.2 cm) piece of cloth so that the shorter edges of the pouch are slightly tapered. This well help contain the object and let it release properly during launch. Make small holes in the middle of the shorter edges.Tie a 27” (68.6 cm) piece of string to one end of the pouch and make a small loop at the other end of the string. Hook the loop on the nail at the end of the arm.
Tie a 24” (61 cm) piece of string to the other end of the pouch. Tie the other end of the string to the second eyehook (the one still sticking out of the wood).

, To finish the trebuchet and assemble it together, you will need a coat hanger, wire cutters, and some string. These are the final materials necessary to complete the trebuchet.The coat hanger must be made of wire so you can manipulate it for the trigger.
If you don’t have wire cutters, find another tool that will cut through the hanger.
You can use as much or as little string as you like for the trigger.

, Position the swing arm between the two supports of the base and slide the dowel rod in place. This will secure the swing arm in place. Without the trigger in place, the counterweight on the back end will cause the arm to stick up.Again, make sure the swing arm can rotate freely around the dowel rod.

, Straighten out a coat hanger and cut a length about 15” (38.1 cm) long. Make a small loop on one end of the wire and attach some string to the loop. Bring the swing arm of the trebuchet down so that the counterweight is in the air. Feed the straight end of the hanger through the first hook on the base, then through the front hook on the swing arm, then through the second hook on the base.Pulling the string, releases the swing arm and launches whatever is in the pouch.

, With everything set up and ready for launch, you can adjust the lengths of the strings attached to the pouch. Loop the end around the nail at the end of the swing arm and straighten the pouch so that it lies directly on top of the baseboard.You want both sets of strings to be approximately the same length and for the pouch to sit close to the end of the baseboard.

, Load the pouch with something round like a tennis ball or baseball. When the cargo is securely in place, stand back and pull the trigger. If the nail is positioned at the correct angle, you should see the ball sail through the air.Alter the angle of the nail as needed to get the best launch distance. Trial and error is the best way to accomplish this.
Adding heavier items to the counterweight will allow you launch heavier things and/or launch things a further distance.
Don't stand in front of the throwing arm when releasing. It might hit you in the face and cause injury.
In early tests, the throwing can be unpredictable; stay clear of all moving parts.

Put the candles in an upside-down bottle.,
Watch the egg go into the bottle.,
Explain how it works to your friends.",How to Get an Egg Into a Bottle," Put the egg in a pot full of water. Use warm water so it will boil faster.


You might want to boil several eggs so you can try the trick more than once or in case something happens to your first egg.;
, Put the pot on the stove set to Medium-High temperature. Let it sit there for 20 minutes while the water boils., Empty the boiling water into the sink being careful not to burn yourself. Use cold water to cool the egg, then peel the shell off. It can be helpful to tap the egg on the counter to crack the shell so that it is easier to peel., Stand the glass bottle upright with the opening skywards. This is the necessary position to perform this trick.


Make sure that you use a glass bottle. Using a plastic bottle (or a bottle made of any material other than glass) could be very dangerous.
The mouth of the bottle should be small, but still at least half the diameter of the egg (like a milk bottle).

, Carefully light three matches. With extreme caution, drop them into the bottle. Wait a second or two., Quickly put the egg onto the bottle's opening, wide end up. Don’t wait too long to put the egg on the bottle or the matches will go out and this trick won’t work., After the matches go out, the egg will be pulled into the bottle. Then, you can amaze your friends with your egg in a bottle.

, Use two or three small birthday candles and place them in the narrow end of your peeled hard-boiled egg. Make sure they are securely in place, but not pushed in deep enough to make the egg fall apart., Carefully (and with adult supervision) light the candles. They should burn easily.

, Take your bottle and place it upside down with the candles inside of it, being careful not to seal the opening with the body of the egg for a few seconds. You need to let the candles warm up the air inside the bottle first., After a couple seconds, lower the bottle fully so that the outside opening is sealed by the egg. The candles may go out with a pop, but in moments the egg will slide up into the bottle.

, This trick works because when the matches burn, they heat up the air inside the bottle and release steam (water) as a part of the combustion reaction. This process causes the air inside the bottle to expand, forcing some out of the bottle.


Once the egg seals the top of the bottle, the matches quickly run out of oxygen and go out. As the air in the bottle cools, the volume of air inside the bottle drops due to condensation of the water vapor (look for the little ""cloud"" inside the bottle just as the match goes out) and the cooling of dry air.
When the volume of the air drops, it exerts less pressure on the egg, while the air pressure outside of the bottle doesn't change. The egg is pushed into the bottle once the difference between those forces is sufficient to deform the egg and overcome friction with the neck of the bottle."

Run a nylon comb through your hair.,
Turn on your faucet.,
Place the comb right next to the stream of water without touching it.,
Understand how this works.,
Experiment.,
Play with static electricity in other ways.,
Learn about grounding.",How to Bend Water with Static Electricity," Take a dry nylon (plastic) comb and run it through your hair about 10 times. Your hair must be dry as well. When the comb moves through your hair, it picks up electrons — tiny particles with an electric charge.If you don't have a comb, find a plastic spoon or an inflated balloon instead. Rub the object quickly against your hair, or a piece of fur, wool, or carpet. The friction from rubbing the two materials together knocks electrons loose from one object and onto the other.;
, Only let a very thin stream of water flow. It needs to be a smooth stream, not one that breaks up.

, If the comb (or spoon or balloon) picked up enough charge, the water will bend toward the comb as it falls. See ""Why this works"" below for an explanation.

, Electrical charges come in two types, positive and negative. Those electrons that ended up on your comb have a negative charge, while water molecules have a positive charge on one side. Positive and negative charges pull each other closer together, so when the comb is close enough, the positive side of the water molecules get tugged in that direction.When the negatively charged comb comes near the water, it repels the electrons, so that the side of the water nearest the comb then has a positive charge. The attraction between this positive charge and the negatively charged comb results in a net force on the water, bending the stream., Bend water again, but change the variables, one at a time. See how they affect the result. Can you explain why?


Does the temperature of the water affect how much it bends?
Does a bigger object make the water bend more?
Does the material that the object is made of affect its ability to bend water?
How does the strength of the stream flow affect how much it bends?

, Try rubbing an inflated balloon against your hair as fast as you can. Gently put the balloon against a bare patch of wall and let go. If the balloon picked up enough charge, it will stay there against the wall without falling.This works because the balloon weighs almost nothing, so gravity barely affects it. The electrical attraction between the balloon and the wall is strong enough to resist the pull of the whole world!
You can also tear up tiny bits of paper and pick them up with the balloon.

, When trying this experiment, you might have put down the comb, then discovered it can't bend water anymore after you pick it up again. Some objects (especially metal ones) can suck up all the extra electrons with a touch, so your comb loses its charge. This is called ""grounding."" Scientists and engineers use grounding on purpose to protect themselves from electric shocks. You can too:


Wait until a dry day, when it hasn't rained in a while. Static electricity builds up much faster when there is almost no water in the air.
Find an object that often gives you a shock. This might be a car after you've been sitting in it for a long time, a metal door handle, or a playground slide.
Before touching the object, poke it with something metal. (Or before getting out of the car, poke the metal frame.) This could be a coin, a key, or a metal pole. The electrons will quickly flow into the metal you're holding, then harmlessly into you. You can now touch the object without getting shocked.
Sometimes, if a lot of electrons have built up, you can see a spark as they jump into the thing you're holding.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Position the volcano in a large, outdoor area and open the soda bottle.,
Prepare a whole roll of Mentos to drop into the bottle.,
Release the Mentos into the bottle and run.",How to Make a Soda Bottle Volcano1," To make this type of volcano, you will need a two-liter bottle of cola, a roll of Mentos brand candy mints, and a large open area. Diet cola appears to work better than regular soda (it’s also less sticky than regular soda). Sodas with caramel color look more like ‘lava’ when they erupt as compared to clear lemon-lime sodas.This experiment is best done outside, but if you must be inside, lay down a large plastic tarp first.;
, Avoid doing this experiment inside, as it will create a huge, sticky mess. Make sure your outdoor area is also uncovered since the soda can erupt quite high. Remove the cap from the soda bottle.


Warn any spectators to stand back.

, When Mentos come in contact with the soda, a reaction occurs that causes the carbon dioxide gas in the soda to push the liquid out of the bottle. The more Mentos you drop in all at once, the greater the eruption; however, this can be difficult.There are a couple of different ways to deliver the Mentos into the bottle.


Method 1: Make a paper tube the size of the bottle neck. Place an index card over the bottle mouth, place the tube over the hole, and fill it with Mentos. When you are ready to erupt, you will slide the card out, releasing the Mentos into the bottle.Method 2: Loosely scotch tape the entire roll of Mentos together. When it’s time, you will drop the taped chain directly into the open bottle.
Method 3: Insert into the bottle a funnel with a mouth that is wide enough to allow the Mentos to pass, but small enough to fit inside the neck of the bottle. You will drop the Mentos through the funnel and remove the funnel once the Mentos are in the bottle.

, Getting all the Mentos to fall in the bottle simultaneously is quite hard. If done incorrectly, the volcano will only rise a few inches or so. Practice getting the Mentos to drop simultaneously a few times before wasting your bottle of soda. Once the Mentos drop into the bottle, run a few feet away to observe the eruption!


If using the paper tube method, remove the card holding the Mentos in place and let them all slide into the bottle at one time.
If using the tape method, simply drop the piece of taped-together Mentos into the mouth of the bottle.
If using the funnel, drop all the Mentos into the funnel at the same time. Remove the funnel once they’re all in and run back.

Find a base for your volcano.,
Attach a full, unopened, 2-liter soda bottle to the base.,
Build the volcano around the bottle.,
Paint the volcano.",How to Make a Soda Bottle Volcano2," This can be a plastic cutting board, a piece of scrap wood, or any other sturdy, flat surface that can be spared for a while. Avoid cardboard, as it will likely be too flimsy to support your project.


If you’re working with scrap material, consider decorating the base to look like a flat landscape. You may want to paint it, cover it with moss, apply green felt to indicate grass, attach miniature trees, etc.

, Since you will build the volcano around the bottle, be sure place it where in the center of the base. How you attach it will depend on what your base is. If it’s a kitchen cutting board, place a lump of clay or Play-Doh on the board and lightly crush the bottle into it for a loose hold. If you’re using scrap wood, use a plastic/wood adhesive.


A caramel-colored soda will probably look the most like lava when your volcano erupts, so avoid clear drinks. Both diet and regular soda work for this experiment, but diet soda erupts higher.
If gluing the bottle, let the bottle reach room temperature. A cold, sweating soda bottle will never glue properly. Avoid using hot glue, which might melt the bottle and make a mess.
If you’re doing a vinegar and baking soda volcano, you will attach an empty bottle to the board.

, For a textured look, shape some chicken wire into a lumpy, mountainous cone around the bottle. Cover the chicken wire with papier mâché. An alternative to papier mâché is to sculpt some clay around the bottle. For a more solid look, shape appropriately-colored play-dough or clay around the bottle.


Avoid covering the cap of the bottle or you won’t be able to activate the volcano. Ensure you have access to the opening so you can add Mentos or baking soda for the eruption!

, After you have let the papier mâché dry, paint it with acrylic paint (which will also help form a moisture seal over the surface). Use shades of brown and orange around the top and add some green to look like grass.


You may even want to press pebbles, dirt, and moss into the surface to give it a more natural appearance.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Combine vinegar, water, and a squirt of dishwashing liquid.,
Place the volcano on a plastic-covered table or over a linoleum floor.,
Add a spoonful of baking soda to the mixture.",How to Make a Soda Bottle Volcano3," For this volcano, you will need 400 milliliters (13.5  fl oz) of vinegar, 200 mL of water, a squirt of dishwashing liquid, a large spoonful of baking soda, an empty 2-liter soda bottle, and red food coloring.Do a little experimentation to find the proper amounts of each material to get the size of eruption you want.
You can use a smaller plastic bottle, but will have to adjust the ingredients accordingly.

, Use red-wine vinegar for the best lava coloring. Alternatively, you can also add red or orange food coloring to white vinegar. The liquid soap breaks the surface tension of water, therefore creating a larger eruption.

, This method won’t make as big a mess as the Mentos method, but you definitely don’t want to have to scrub the results out of a carpet or rug.


If the weather is agreeable, place the volcano outside.

, The baking soda will react with the vinegar mixture and cause your volcano to erupt! If you want a larger explosion increase the amount of vinegar and baking soda used."

Gather the necessary materials.,
Cut the soap into four pieces.,
Microwave the soap on HIGH for 1 ½ - 2 minutes.,
Observe and touch the soap.,
Place the bar of soap in a bowl of water.",How to Expand Ivory Soap1," To perform this experiment, you will need a bar of Ivory brand soap, a bowl, water, a knife, paper towels, a microwave-safe plate, and a microwave. Parental supervision is recommended while performing this experiment. All of these items should be easily accessible at home. The soap can be purchased at any grocery store or big box store.The bar of soap must be Ivory brand for this to work properly.;
, With adult supervision, use the knife to cut the bar of soap into four approximately equal pieces. Separating the soap will make it heat faster and expand better in the microwave.Put the soap pieces on a microwave-safe plate.

, Place the plate of soap in the microwave and set the time for two minutes. Watch the bar of soap as it begins to expand and erupt into beautiful puffy clouds. Make sure an adult is present during this step and stop the microwave once the soap stops expanding.Avoid overcooking the soap as this can cause it to burn.
Leave the “soap soufflé” in the microwave for at 1-2 minutes to let it cool.

, Once the soap has fully cooled, handle it and see what it feels like. It may look like a giant marshmallow, but you’ll notice that it is still rigid like the original bar of soap. You can still use it like soap as well; just break off pieces.The soap expands because there are water molecules in the tiny pockets of air. When the soap is heated, the water vaporizes and the trapped air expands. The heat also makes the soap softer, allowing these expanding air pockets to cause the whole bar to blow up like a cloud.
Try the same experiment with a different brand of soap. You’ll notice that the soap doesn’t expand like the Ivory soap does because it doesn’t have air pockets.

, Before (or after) you perform the experiment, you can do a small test to see if the soap floats. Fill your bowl with water until it is about two-thirds full. Drop the bar into the water and observe what happens. You will notice that the soap floats. If you have other bars of soap that aren’t Ivory brand, drop them in the water and see what happens. They will sink to the bottom of the container.The Ivory brand soap floats because it has lots of tiny air pockets inside it. These tiny air pockets are what allows the soap to expand the way it does when it is heated.
Remove the soap from the water and let it dry before microwaving it.

Talk about a hypothesis.,
Experiment with different types of soap.,
Discuss the results.",How to Expand Ivory Soap2," A hypothesis is an educated guess about the outcome of an experiment. Discuss the air pockets in the soap and ask your child what they think will happen to the soap when it gets heated. Write down the hypothesis before you begin.


Can they think of anything else that expands when heated? Talk about heating marshmallows and popcorn., Ivory soap is special because it has air whipped into it, but other soaps do not. Perform this same experiment with different types of soap and observe the various results with each brand.Record your results and observations underneath your written hypothesis.

, Talk about what happened with the soap. Ask your child why the soap expanded and why the air pockets are important. Explain to them that there is water trapped in the air pockets and that gas expands when it is heated.Gases expand because the molecules begin to move quickly when they are heated. This causes them to bounce off of each other and hit the pockets of soap with such force that they expand out.Discuss the differences between the various brands of soap and the reason you see differences in the results.

Don't play humble.,
Buy quality clothing.,
Take care of how you ""dress down"".,
Wear only the finest lingerie and nightwear.,
Consider the details as important as the rest of the outfit.,
Stay well groomed.,
Focus on your posture.,
Keep slim.",How to Look Like a Frenchwoman," French women look good because they believe in themselves as being the most stylish and elegant women in the world. It's a touch arrogant but it works.


You have faults? We all do. However, the secret for French women is not only to not care less but to accentuate the fault as a beauty feature. You can only do so when you feel confident about who you are inside. So get your confidence on and love every part of yourself!;
, Rather than spreading your clothing budget across as many items as possible, spend it sparingly on one to two quality items as you can afford them, perhaps each season. French women don't wear dowdy clothing, they abhor cheap fabric and they prefer stylish classics over faddish styles.


Even your exercise clothes should be well tailored and tidy in appearance.
A little nod to fashion is fine––don't be a fashion victim though. Know and stick with your own defining style.

, French women look good even when relaxing. For a working French woman, coming home from work might mean removing the jacket and jewelry and donning a cashmere sweater and trousers for a ""more relaxed look"". In other words, stay chic even when you're relaxing.

, French women love the luxury of fine lace, satin and silk for undergarments and nightwear.


Fine underwear is considered appropriate for unwinding in. Especially on Sunday mornings with croissants.

, For example, your accessories and your shoes should be chic, of good quality and tasteful. They are never an afterthought but are part of an entire carefully put-together package.


Shoes should be good quality and expensive.
Scarves should match your clothing. They should be made from the finest materials and be elegant, not overstated.
Your earrings and necklace should be of high quality, not copycat versions of the real thing.

, French women do not leave the house unkempt, ever. Good grooming is the basis of always appearing impeccable and chic. Good grooming is the guarantee that a plain woman can look beautiful.


Discover your favorite beauty products and use them religiously. French women adore their beauty products. Even if you don't wear makeup, get products to keep your face cleansed and moisturized. And as you age, use anti-wrinkle creams––for the mental boost as much as for their effect on the skin.
Grey hair is fine provided it's well cut and groomed. If you must have it dyed, do it subtly so that nobody knows. In fact, whatever your age, never get your hair dyed in an obvious way––no French woman would ever dare.
Good skin is important. Feed your skin by consuming healthy, nutritious foods.
Keep makeup simple and elegant. Caking it on is never acceptable.
Have well manicured nails and toenails at all times. No excuses, ever.
Don't hate people or your life. It will show on your face.

, French women know how to carry themselves well. They don't slouch, drag their feet or try to hide their height (or lack of it). They stand tall and walk properly.

, French women are renowned for staying slim. To look French, you'll need to perfect this too. Find an eating regime that works for you and keeps you fit and healthy, as well as slim. Read books like Mireille Guiliano's book French Women Don't Get Fat for more tips on this aspect.

Plus, in some Parisian venues, you can get some nasty recriminations just for looking at a waiter the wrong way. For more value, use the sit-down option sparingly.

, Experienced travelers know about some of the readily accessible food options across Paris that come with a lower price tag. Some of these, like crepes and falafel sandwiches, are easy to make and sell, and therefore, you will pay a lot less for them than for some other kinds of meals.

, These open-air or centrally-housed markets are where many locals shop, and you can find fresh, affordable food. Again, it helps to know the language in order to barter with individual sellers.

Decide whether you want to eat at a cafe on the Left Bank or the Right Bank.,
Choose whether you want to eat at a cafe that is more formal and traditional or more relaxed.,
Walk around the city and observe what people are eating outside at cafes.",How to Eat at a Street Side Cafe in Paris1,"


The Left Bank is the area south of the Seine river. It includes the student-oriented Latin Quarter and the St. German-Des-Pres neighborhood, one of Paris's cafe centers. The Right Bank is the more historic part of the city, with the expensive shopping areas of the Grands Boulevards and the Champs-Elysees, as well as the more bohemian neighborhood of Montmartre.;
, Prices for the former tend to be more expensive.


On the Left Bank, the Cafe de Flore and the Cafe Les Deux Magots in St. Germain-des-Pres are typical examples of the traditional Paris cafe, with lots of tourists and high prices. Cafe de la Paix, by the Opera on the Right Bank, is another classic cafe.
Le Sancerre near Montmartre is a good choice for a more laid-back atmosphere. Aux Folies in the neighborhood of Belleville is another reasonable choice, with more eclectic fare that tends away from traditional French restaurant cuisine.

, Sometimes it's best to find a cafe purely based on what it looks like from the outside, and not on reputation.

Wait for the waiter to approach you after you have been seated.

French restaurant service is generally more formal than in other parts of the world. It is considered rude to be too casual with a server or to snap or clap at them.

, Although the food at a Paris cafe is generally standard French cuisine, it is best to sample whatever might be especially good at a particular cafe.

, The French restaurant experience is just as much about watching people and enjoying conversation as it is about the food and drinks.

, A French server will generally not bring the check over until you specifically ask for it.

, A 15 percent gratuity is included in all checks in Paris, so any extra change you include is considered a comment on whether the service was above average

Processing time for a passport can take several weeks or even months, so be sure to start this process well in advance if you don’t currently have a valid passport.


To visit Germany, your passport must be valid for at least three months beyond your expected departure date.If your passport is expiring soon and you're planning to move there, consider renewing your passport now, especially if you intend to maintain the citizenship of your origin country.;
, Germany has a few different types of visas, and the one you need depends on factors such as your reasons for moving to Germany and your education. However, citizens of the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland do not need any sort of permits to visit, live, or work in Germany. For citizens of other countries, the different types of visas include:Work visas are for academics, doctors, engineers, mathematicians, IT specialists, and people in the life sciences. These people are entitled to the EU Blue Card, which is a work and residency permit.
Job seekers’ visas allow you entrance in to Germany for six months with the intention of finding employment. However, you must apply for the EU Blue Card in order to start working.
Studying visas are for people who have been accepted to a German university or wish to attend one.
Training visas are for training or vocational courses that will last at least two years.
Internship visas are for internships with German companies, but these cannot last longer than one year.
Research visas are for highly qualified professionals who wish to pursue work with a research facility. These visas can be extended for as long as the individual meets the requirements.
Self-employment visas are for freelancers or people who want to start a manual trade or retail business in the country.

, A Schengen visa is a special visa that’s required for citizens of certain countries to enter the Schengen Area, a 26-member group of European nations to which Germany belongs. If you want to enter the Schengen Area and don’t have your other visa in place yet, you will need a Schengen visa before you're allowed to enter the country.If you plan to move to Germany before getting your more permanent visa, a Schengen visa will allow you to stay in the country for 90 days and get your affairs in order.
Citizens of the Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, and the U.S. do not need a Schengen visa to visit Germany for up to 90 days, and can apply for residency and work permits after arrival in Germany.If you don’t have your work or other visa and are unsure of whether you need a Schengen visa to enter Germany, check the Schengen Visa Info website., If you want to move to Germany but aren't eligible for a visa that grants you temporary residency, or you want to extend your residency when your visa runs out, there are residency permits you may be eligible for.These include the:


Residence permit, which generally now comes in the form of the electronic residence title (the elektronischer Aufenthaltstitel)
Settlement permit, which can be applied for after five years of holding a residence permit.
Family reunification permit, which is for people who want to live with a spouse or partner who’s living in Germany.
Asylum and refugee seekers permits, which require you to have a clean criminal record and means of supporting yourself.

, To take up permanent or long-term temporary residence in Germany, you will have to get health insurance. If you are working, ask if your employer can set you up with it. Otherwise, contact a few insurance companies to see what kinds of rates they offer.Most people in Germany are with the Government Health Insurance System, but there are also private health insurance companies that offer more comprehensive care packages. However, premiums for private health insurance can range anywhere from $115 a month to over $1,000.
If you get a job that has employee status, you will automatically be covered by Germany’s statutory health insurance fund (Krankenkasse), as long as you make less than about $4,600 per month. Statutory health insurance guarantees medically necessary health benefits for all subscribers.Students in Germany are eligible for the Krankenkasse for a fee of about $65 a month, so if you're going to Germany for school, insurance will be much cheaper than if you had to get private insurance.
If your partner is covered by Krankenkasse and you yourself have little income, you will be covered by your partner’s benefits.
For artists and writers, there is a separate organization you can join called the Künstlersozialkasse, and they will actually pay half your monthly health insurance contributions if you're accepted as a member.

, Unless you are moving to Germany for a new job, a transfer, or for studying or training, you will need to find employment to support yourself, pay your bills, and cover your living expenses.


It’s important to understand the work culture in Germany, because while many work days are over at 4 p.m., there is a strong emphasis on efficiency.German salaries are among the highest in the world, but don’t be surprised if you're taxed at a rate of 50 percent.
If you're looking for a job after you’ve made the move, you can check local classified ads, check official job listings,walk around town to see if there are any vacancies being advertised, visit local job fairs, or go to a labor office (Arbeitsämter).
If you haven't made the move and want to line up work for when you arrive, check the internet, newspapers and magazines, try a recruitment agency (Arbeitsvermittlung), or contact the chamber of commerce where you'll be living.

, The manner of application will depend on the job, but you may be able to send your application by email. Along with your resume, prospective employers will also want to see:Copies of your certificates, degrees, or diplomas. Have the original documents available for inspection if required
Proof of training or courses you’ve taken
References
A passport photo attached to your resume in the upper right corner

, Before or after you move to Germany, you will have the option of purchasing or renting a home or apartment. When it comes to rentals and purchases in Germany, homes don’t come furnished, so you will have to provide your own furnishings.


Rentals in Germany can either be Kaltmiete (cold rent), meaning you have to pay for heat and utilities separately, or Warmmiete (warm rent), meaning heat and possibly some other utilities are included in the rent.To find a rental before or after you arrive, check online classifieds. Be sure to ask lots of questions and look at many photos before signing any sort of rental contract if you won’t see the place in person first. Never pay any money or fees in advance of signing a lease.If you want to purchase a home once you're there, your best bet is to hire an estate agent to help you find a home, negotiate a sale on your behalf, and walk you through the purchase process., When you first arrive in Germany, you will need a place to stay if you weren't able to secure permanent housing before your trip. Depending on your situation, you may have several options available to you, including:


Staying with friends or relatives.
Staying in hotels, hostels, or Airbnbs while you get settled and look for a place to live.
Setting up a temporary accommodation before you arrive., Moving to a new country requires a lot of planning, and there are many things you have to do before you can leave. If you’re moving for a job or studies, your moving date can coincide with your start date. If you're just moving for an adventure, you can decide how much time you want to give yourself to prepare. Things you'll have to get in order include:


Getting all your paperwork and documentation
Arranging a place to live
Notifying your friends, family, employer, or landlord about your departure
Booking your flight
Determining what to do with your stuff

, You can arrange your travel as soon as you have your moving date set. The sooner you arrange your travel the better, because you might be able to get better rates if you book in advance.

, If you own property in the country were you currently live, you will have to decide what to do with it. The two major options are selling and keeping the property:


Selling the property may take time, so you will want to start this process well in advance of your move.
Keeping the property means you'll have somewhere to live if you ever move back, but in the meantime you will have to figure out what to do with the property. You can choose to leave it empty (this may require extra insurance), you can rent it out, or you can let friends or family live there.
If you are currently renting a place, make sure you give your landlord the required notice before vacating and moving.

, Moving to a new country is a big step, and while you will require many of the same things there—such as furniture, kitchen accessories, and clothing—it may be more expensive to ship all your stuff there than it would be to buy new once you arrive.


If you are going to sell your stuff, consider having a garage sale to help fund the purchase of new household items when you arrive in Germany.
Be warned that you are better off buying new appliances in Germany, especially if you don’t live in Europe already. The voltage in Germany is double what it is in North America, for instance, so even if you use an adaptor to make your plug fit into the wall, appliances and electronics made in North America are not suited for that type of voltage.If you want to keep your belongings but don’t want to take them with you, you can rent a storage locker in your current country of residence to safeguard your possessions.

, Moving to a new country is difficult, but even knowing a few words or phrases will be an immense help, and will make the experience less stressful. Not only that, but the people you meet will be much more sympathetic if you make an effort to speak to them in German, even if they’re bilingual and speak the same language you do. Ways you can learn some German include:Taking classes
Listening to audiobooks or CDs
Going through a German phrasebook and bilingual German dictionary
Speaking with German people

, Depending on where you work or what kind of contract you have, you may have to give your employer anywhere from two weeks’ to several months’ notice that you'll be leaving your job.


Be sure to ask for a letter of reference in case you need someone to vouch for your skills or credentials.

, Once you arrive in Germany, take your passport and residence certificate to the bank of your choice to open an account.You don’t have to close out the bank accounts in the country where you currently live. In fact, it’s a good idea to keep at least one account and one credit card open (this way your credit won’t be affected if you decide to move back).
Exchange some of your money before you leave for Germany, as it will be beneficial to have Euros on you when you arrive in Germany.

, When you move in to your new place in Germany, you will likely have to set up things like heat and power for your home, unless you're renting a place that includes these things. Otherwise, setting up utilities will be much easier if you know any German or have any German-speaking friends who can help you. If you're on your own, it’s best to visit the various offices in person to set up your utilities, so that you can find someone who speaks English.The utilities you might need include your:


Phone
Cable / Satellite TV and internet
Heat and power
Water

, It’s a good idea to get yourself a map in case you get lost, but one of the best ways to get to know your new neighbourhood is to get out there and explore. Germans love walking, and many take a walk on a near daily basis, especially Sundays when most stores are closed.Walking around any city, you'll find the closest grocery stores, malls, doctors, pubs, cafes, and other necessary amenities.
If your city has a public transit system, get to know the routes and schedules, and explore the city by bus or train as well.

, Moving away from friends and family to live in a new city can be difficult, but feeling at home in the new city will be much easier after you make a few friends. Good ways to meet new people include:Volunteer with an organization
Make a local café or pub your regular place
Meet people through work or school
Join a local team or club
Partake in hobbies that you enjoy

Give yourself enough time to fill out the application materials and wait for the passport to be mailed to you. Current processing times for applications are between 4 and 6 weeks.;
, There are several excellent travel guides about the entire country of Ireland, and the regions within. You can also follow online blogs and perform an Internet search using the cities and towns you expect to visit. Make a list of things you do not want to miss while in Ireland.

, Many travel packages include a car rental. If you are traveling outside of a major city such as Dublin, you will probably need a vehicle to reach places that trains and buses do not go regularly. Remember that in Ireland, you drive on the left side of the road. Most rental cars are manual transmission. You will need to pay a premium for an automatic automobile. Insurance is required, and can often be more expensive than rental cars in other countries.

, As you put together your packing list, consider what you will be doing, and what time of year you are visiting.


Pack clothing and shoes to accommodate Irish weather changes. Check international weather websites before you depart to get an idea of how cold or warm in will be in Ireland while you travel. Pack an umbrella or rain jacket, clothes you can layer, and comfortable shoes.
Pack enough medications and prescriptions for the time you plan to be away. Pack a little extra, in case of flight or travel delays on your way home.
Pack an electric adapter. If you plan to use a hairdryer, laptop, or other electrical device, make sure you have an adapter that will allow you to access Ireland's energy outlets.

, Double check with your airline, hotels, and car rental agencies to make sure you are confirmed to arrive and depart at your expected times. Take itineraries and confirmation numbers with you.

, International travel has become more time-consuming. Arrive in plenty of time to check in, go through security, and get to the boarding gate. Check with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for a list of what you are not permitted to take on the airplane or into the boarding area.

, Ireland is 5 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time (EST) for most of the year. Ireland observes daylight savings time earlier, so for a couple of weeks in March and April, Ireland is 6 hours ahead of EST. During most of October, Ireland is 4 hours ahead of EST.

There are some pros and cons to traveling during the off season, which usually falls during the colder months. It’s good because you receive better rates for airfare, accommodation, rental cars, and the attractions will not be as crowded. Negatively, not every attraction is open during the off season, and the weather is a lot colder than it is during the warmer summer months.You may have to travel during peak season if you’re traveling with children that only have the summer and holidays off.
June through August are the peak traveling months. Spring, fall, and winter are considered the off season months for traveling to Ireland.;
, It is better to book your plane tickets as far ahead of time as possible. You pay more if you book close to the date of your departure. Look for discounts on websites like Expedia, Trip Adviser, and Kayak. If you will be flying within Ireland, book with low fare airlines before you get to Ireland, like Ryan Air, Easy Jet, and Flybe.


About seven weeks before your departure is the ideal time to buy tickets.
Fly with only carry on luggage to avoid additional fees and lessen time spent in the airport.

, Your itinerary may change slightly when you get to Ireland, but try to figure out where you will be staying. Dublin, Cork, and Limerick are some of the largest cities in the Republic of Ireland. Belfast is the largest city in Northern Island, but some other cities you can visit are Ballymena, Coleraine, and Craigavon.How many cities you visit depends on the amount of time you have. If you only have a few days, you may want to stick to the Republic of Ireland. Both parts of Ireland can be visited even if you only have a week.

, Once you know what cities you will be visiting, begin looking for accommodation. You may decide to stay the night in an unplanned city when you get there, but it’s better to book as much accommodation as possible to save money. If you’re looking for a hotel, look on websites like Expedia and Trip Adviser to compare prices. If you want to an book apartment, look through rooms on AirBnB. You can also search for hostels if you want to go for a cheaper route. Try to book the apartment as far ahead of time as possible.Who you’re traveling with may determine what kind of accommodation you choose. For example, a hotel or apartment would be better if you’re traveling with family, especially if there are children. For students, younger travelers, and individuals traveling alone, hostels would be okay.

, Unless you’re planning to visit only one city, you will need to plan a way to get around. You can take a small, lost cost airline if you want to get around quickly. But since Ireland is a small and scenic country, it is arguable that the best way to get around is by car. Renting a car gives you the option to stop off wherever you want and make spontaneous visits to unexpected destinations. You can also book trains or buses to get from one city to the other. As with airfare and accommodation, book your travel method as early as possible.You can use websites like Expedia to compare rental car prices. Keep in mind that you may have to pay an extra fee per day if you are under the age of 25.
Irish Rail has trains to all major cities in Ireland.
Megabus is a bus service that offers inexpensive bus rides across Ireland.

, Once you have planned out the cities you will be visiting, plan out some activities. Look at the local museums, attractions, and scenery. You should also look for guided tours through the city or parts of the city if you want an experienced guide to help you get to know the layout and history of the city.In Dublin, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral and Trinity College are worth visiting.
In Belfast, the Titanic Belfast Museum and Crumlin Road Gaol are popular tourist sites.

, Even in the summer, Ireland can be chilly. If you’re traveling during the winter, you will definitely need warm clothing. Rain is common in Ireland, so bring hats, raincoats, and hoodies. Make sure to bring a hat, jacket, socks, scarf, gloves, and comfortable shoes, along with your outfits and undergarments. Bring clothing that can be mixed and matched to avoid overpacking.Buy thermal clothing if you are traveling during winter.

, You can choose to pack or bring things like toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner, razors, and other items. You will need to bring your passport, an adapter (Ireland does not have the same outlet as the US and other countries), health insurance information, your wallet, and driver’s license.You should also bring any necessary medication in the bottles they were prescribed in.
Make a list and check it off as you’re packing.

, You should bring at least one guide book with you. Guidebooks help you find attractions, eating recommendations, helpful information, some history, and advice for accommodation and travel if you need it. Some guidebooks are general, and some are made specifically for certain audiences. For example, you can find a guidebook made for students, but you can also find one aimed at families. Some guidebooks to choose from are Rick Steve’s Ireland 2016 (or whatever year you’re traveling), Lonely Planet Ireland, and Frommer’s Guide to Ireland.Backroads Ireland is a guide that comes with a map and gives advice for visiting the hidden gems of Ireland.

, It is helpful to keep a map or GPS system with you, especially if you’re driving. If you’re staying in one city, you can find a map of the city. If you’re traveling throughout Ireland, it is good to buy two maps. One map should be a map that is focused on roads. The second map should focus on site markings.Smartphones usually come with a GPS, but it can be very expensive to use your phone if you are outside of your own country.

, You can exchange your currency for Irish currency once you arrive in Ireland, but it is good to have some cash with you before you arrive. 100 euros or pounds is recommended. Northern Ireland uses the pound sterling, and the Republic of Ireland uses the euro. Get the currency for whatever part of Ireland you will be using first. After that, it is better to withdraw money from ATMs (cashpoints). The exchange rates vary a lot, and you get the best deal when you use your debit card to exchange money rather than going to an exchange place in the airport.Make sure to let your bank know where you will be traveling before you go. Many banks will allow you to set a travel notice on your phone. If you don’t, your bank may think your card was stolen and cancel it.

, In Ireland, you drive on the left side of the road and pass on the right. This is the exact opposite to how it is in the US and most countries in the world. Make sure to keep this in mind if you will be driving a rental car. Start slowly and practice in the parking lot if you feel uncomfortable.Most cars are manual in Ireland. Make sure to rent an automatic car if you don’t know how to drive manual.

, The Cliffs of Moher is perhaps the most famous natural scenery in Ireland. It is definitely worth taking the time to visit. The Cliffs of Moher are located on the western coastline of Ireland, and they stretch for nearly five miles. Nearly one million people visit per year, but that doesn’t take the beauty away from these famous cliffs., Guinness comes from Ireland, but it is world famous. The storehouse is a great place to visit if you’re a fan of Guinness or beer in general. When you visit the Storehouse, you can take a tour of the seven story building, learn how Guinness is made, and learn about the history of the famous dark beer. After that you get a complimentary glass and you can enjoy the Dublin view from the top floor.It is best to visit this attraction without children.

, Ireland is famous for its wonderful pubs. Check your guidebook or ask the locals for recommendations. You can simply grab a beer, or you can order a meal. Often, you can have lunch in a pub even if you’re with children.Cobblestone’s is a famous pub in Dublin that is known for its beer and music.

, If you’re more interested in the nature side of Ireland, Killarney National Park is a great option for visiting. The park spans over 25,000 acres, and mountains, lakes, and woodlands can be viewed in the park. This park is also where the only wild red deer can be found in Ireland., The Rock of Cashel is a great place to visit if you’re interested in Ireland’s rich history. Located in County Tipperary, this attraction features multiple ancient sites. A 12th century Romanesque chapel and 13th century Gothic cathedral can be visited in this location. Over 1000 years of Irish history exists in this location."

Actual residents tend to flee during this time, meaning you'll just be surrounded by other tourists. It's better to go April through June or September through November. Christmas is beautiful with the city all lit up, but November through February is their cold, rainy season.That being said, most fashion shows are in September and October, making it more difficult to get a hotel, and at an off-season price (slightly lower than normal). Your best bet, if it works for your schedule, may be the spring.;
, Apart from early-in-the-week flights being cheaper, there are a couple of things to consider:


Aim to arrive in Paris on a Sunday or Monday if you'll be using the Metro a lot. This way you'll be able to take advantage of purchasing a Metro (Paris metropolitan subway) Navigo Découverte pass – a weekly pass in the form of a reloadable ""smart card."" The Navigo Week pass price, valid only from Monday at 00:00 to Sunday 23:59:59, does not go on-sale until Monday and is not sold during the weekend. If you purchase on Thursday, then your week is already half-gone.
If you're museum-focused, arrive on a Saturday, a day before the first Sunday of the month. Most Paris museums (there are over 3,800 museums in Paris) are free on the first Sunday of the month., When possible, try to choose the same airline on all flights (as opposed to flying one portion with one airline to a connecting airport, then flying with an affiliate airline). It's also best to book your flight around two to three months in advance. Research shows that it's during this time that flights are at their lowest prices.Be aware that almost all international flights from the United States to Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport will be incoming into Terminal 1. You may want to visit the CDG website for more information.Call your airline in advance and ask for assistance at the airport if you have suffered any injury or need assistance in any way. Travelers needing assistance receive red-carpet, first-class treatment with a team of handlers at each airport who whisk you away to bypass long lines, through secret passageways and directly to the gate.

, There are several things to consider when it comes to finding and choosing a place to stay. Here are the factors you should be weighing:


Consider check-in time. A common problem is that many international flights arrive in the early morning – yet many hotels will not let you check-in until after 3:00 pm. So what does one do for six hours, with all of luggage in-tow? Plus, after an international flight, people are tired, want to take a shower and relax. Anticipate this situation in-advance and request early check-in at the hotel or apartment.
Consider an apartment in order to have a kitchen/kitchenette and cook meals. Restaurants in Paris are very expensive and a week of three meals per day could easily go over a thousand dollars or more per person. For a shorter stay of three days or less, then a regular hotel might be a good choice. However much longer, and renting an apartment makes sense – especially if you want to have a midnight snack, keep a bottle of wine cold or keep your restaurant’s to-go box refrigerated to eat for breakfast tomorrow morning.
Choose a place that is near a Metro station. Accommodations on or around Rue Cler are in a very prime location. Other parts of Paris have their own flavor. If you want to stay out and go to nightclubs, then the Marais area might be a good choice, too.

, Purchase washcloths in advance and bring them with you. Do not expect too much from your hotel or apartment. Paris accommodations are going to be much smaller than hotels in the United States. They typically do not supply washcloths and can be sparse on supplying toilet paper.


Bring your own adapters and power-strips that turn one electrical outlet into six. Electrical outlets are sometimes sparse at hotels and apartments. Purchase a grounded adapter, not just a regular electrical adapter before your trip.

, The most iconic experience in all of Paris may just have to be on a postcard for you if you don't book in advance. Either that or the line will be hours long or the top will be booked. To avoid this disappointment, purchase your tickets to the Eiffel tower around a month in advance. Print out the tickets upon purchase and don’t forget to take them on your trip.


Do not wait until you arrive at the Eiffel Tower to buy tickets! It can be very crowded on the Eiffel tower. You'll have to wait in line to buy tickets and then wait in line to get up into the Eiffel tower. It could eat up an entire day.

, You can purchase Museum Passes upon arrival at Charles de Gaulle Airport from French Tourist Information Desks in Arrivals (Terminals 1, 2C, 2D and 2F) and at Orly Airport (Terminals South and West). As an alternative to free admission, the Paris Museum Pass provides unlimited access during its period of validity to more than 60 museums and monuments in and around Paris. Besides its convenience, it can save considerable amounts of time by permitting you to by-pass long ticket lines.


Paris Museum Passes are for two, four or six consecutive days, costing €39, €54 and €69 respectively. Whether the Museum Pass makes sense is a function both of the number of museums you intend to visit and of the value you place on the time you can save by using the Pass to bypass sometimes lengthy ticket lines.
Understand that another benefit is that the Pass permits multiple visits to any covered museum, as well as permitting you to just duck into a museum for a quick look round (or to use the facilities) without having to pay the entrance fee., The sooner you do this, the easier it will be to plan. As you survey the rich field of activities, target those of interest. The sheer volume and variety of potential activities and venues might seem quite daunting, so take your time getting to know what is available before you set foot on a plane, which are the easiest to get to, and which fit your budget. Do not finalize your thoughts; just survey the field. Later you will be able to pick judiciously so that you leverage your money to good effect.


Explore the architecture, public sculptures, public art displays, history museums, art museums, sports facilities, and other activities of interest online. Just get an idea of what is going on or is available. What do you and the rest of your party definitely want to do and see?

, Get a feel for the variety and extent of what might be had. You might come up with several ""must dos,"" things you will not be able to leave undone. Great! Your itinerary is starting to shape up.


The best section of town to find a good restaurant is Rue Cler street, which is East of the Eiffel Tower and West of Invalides and South of the Seine River.
Picnics are a wonderful way to save money, in-style. There is nothing like a picnic on the Eiffel Tower grounds or sharing a bottle of wine on the banks of the river Seine. Potential picnic spots to consider are Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Jardin du Luxembourg, Les Champs de Mars (overlooks the Eiffel Tower), Parc de Belleville, Parc de la Villette, and Le Square de Vert Galant – one of the most romantic parks in Paris, especially at sunset.

, There's far more to Paris than great wine, baguettes, museums, and the Eiffel Tower. Here's a short list (a comprehensive list would take all day) of a few other notable attractions you may want to check out:


Arc de Triomphe
Notre Dame
Champs Elysees
Versailles (a 30-40 minute ride on RER line C – the last stop)
Pont Neuf
Sacre Coeur
Pere Lachaise (cemetery with remains of notable people like Oscar Wilde and Jim Morrison)
Folies Bergere
Moulin Rouge
Place de La Bastille

, Paris is full of public (that is, free and beautiful places to check out) parks, and green spaces. Here are some you may want to look into:


Bois de Boulogne (has a lake with rowboats for rent on the West Side)
Bois de Vincennes (East Side)
Japanese Gardes on Jardins Albert Kahn
Versailles has a big lake and more boating via rowboat
Parc de la Villette (includes bamboo garden)
Parc de Buttes Chaumont (includes a suspension bridge, waterfall, lake and cave)
Monets Gardens at Giverny
Luxembourg Gardens or Champ de Mars or Canal St-Martin

, This can be heaven on earth with the right individual on the right night, and the cruises are almost always enchanting. Dinner cruises usually start at 8:30 pm and last for three hours. Do some shopping around to know that you're getting the best deal and that it starts or ends somewhere you can manage to get back to where you need to be.


Many are about 75 minutes length, with runs every 30 minutes from 10 am – 11:30 pm.

, The Metro and RER are two separate sets of train tracks; however, they share many of the same stations for easy transfers. The Metro is within Paris and the RER goes to outlying areas, including the airports, Disneyland and Versailles.


Be aware that Metro Stations and RER Stations typically do not have public bathrooms (toilets). Never turn down an opportunity to use a toilet in Paris, as they are difficult to find and are for ""paying customers only"" (in fact, like in the Louvre, you have to pay specifically for the toilets to use them).
After you determine which Metro or RER Line to take, then to determine the direction of travel (i.e., the correct platform) you need to know the terminus or endpoint of the line. For example, Metro Line 8 terminuses are Ballard and Creteil Pointe de Lac. Even if you figured out which Metro Line to take, if you do not know your end-points of travel, you could end up going in the wrong direction.
The RER is the same situation: in this case (especially with the Red A line) the RER line forks, and certain trains are set to go to specific destinations. It is good to pay attention to each stop while you are on the subways.

, Do they offer a shuttle service? They probably do not. Take the RER as the most economical choice (and the quickest) at 10 Euros per person. To get into Paris, take the RER Blue Line B to Chatelet/Les Halles station.


Air France also operates a couple of buses out of the airport and into the city center. Each way costs 15 Euros a person. They take about an hour to get there, and leave every 30 minutes.
You could take a taxi, but it's a pretty expensive option. It'll be at least 50 Euros and there's also a luggage fee., You'll quickly find that the only way to really get around is the Metro. Zone 1 encompasses enough of main Paris where nearly all of the sights and attractions are, that it is usually not necessary to purchase the pass to include zones 2-6. Purchase a map if you'd like and you'll be able to see all the routes sprawled out in front of you.Use the Navigo Découverte pass beyond the cost-savings mentioned above to not have to fuss with paper tickets. While purchasing a carnet (a ten pack) still saves a ton of money and hassle (as opposed to purchasing one Metro pass at a time – which is ridiculous), still, a carnet is nothing more than ten loose tickets – not even held together with perforation. It's easy to mix up used and unused tickets.
Hold on to the ticket to prove that you have valid admission. That being said, rarely does the train conductor ever check.

, Paris is divided into 20 arrondissements, or neighborhoods, which are like distinct sections of town. The first arrondissement is in the center of Paris, and each subsequent arrondissement spirals outward like a seashell.


Paris is divided into two parts by the Seine River (la rive gauche (left) and la rive droite (right)). On the West side (la rive gauche) are the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower.
In the center is the Louvre and the Musee d'Orsay.
Slightly East (though also central) is Notre Dame. The university and student areas for young people are also on the East side.
Just north of center is the Opera shopping area, where a single name brand product might be represented by a single store that takes an entire city block.

, If you are just taking a short trip to Paris for leisure, you likely do not need a visa. If you are from the US or Canada, just a passport is fine unless you're on a job assignment. You can also transit into France through a number of other countries without problems.However, if you are on job assignment or if you come from a nation not included in the EU, the US, or Canada, you may need a visa. Check out the French consular website for more information.

, Before traveling to Paris, notify your mobile phone carrier and discuss your options. If you do not have a SIM card in your phone, it may be useless to you on your trip. If you do, make sure it is compatible on a European network if you plan to use it.


Consider alternatives like include purchasing a European disposable phone, a SIM card, Viber, WhatsApp, Skype and other online options.

, About 95% of all businesses, restaurants and sightseeing companies take standard credit cards. There are credit cards with zero international transaction fees and can make for smooth transactions that charge a very fair and legitimate conversion rate in US dollars, without any international transactions fees or costs of any kind. This is by far the way to get the best foreign exchange currency rate, which also happens to be the most convenient and safest. Every place (including taxicabs) takes credit cards – except the Metro subway station machines can be temperamental. In this situation, a bit of Euro currency with you.


Get 100 Euros in cash before a trip to Paris (about $150 USD), especially if you are going to stay a week or more. Avoid the touristy bureaux de change.In most cases, your local bank branch will have to order the funds from one of their main banks to be sent to your bank branch, and it can take 3-5 business days. So do not get your foreign currency at the last minute; try to get it 2-4 weeks before your trip.

, Call your bank at least two months before your trip to notify them of your travel. Let them know that you are traveling and give them the dates of your travels for fraud purposes – you don't want them blocking your card, not knowing you're in Paris. It's a good idea to call again a week before you leave for your travels. Here's a few other things you can do:


Learn the policies, transaction fees and charges of all of your credit cards and ATM card
Request a second (backup) credit card
Request that your daily ATM withdrawal limit be temporarily raised
Request a second ATM card (extra client card) be sent to you in case that your current ATM card is accidentally consumed by an ATM machine. In many cases, if you try unsuccessfully three times to get cash from an ATM, on the third unsuccessful attempt, the machine will confiscate the card.
Gather and write down all bank, credit union or credit card company telephone numbers in case there is a problem
Find out which ATMs are affiliated with your bank, credit union or credit card companies and learn where the ATMs are located in Paris and print a map., Go to a local bookstore or travel agency and purchase a map of Paris and a map of the Metro/RER Subway system. Spend some time getting familiar with the Metro and RER Subway systems so when the moment comes, you'll know what to do.


Once you have booked your hotel/apartment, then, using your maps, figure out how to get from the airport to your hotel/apartment, from your hotel to the Eiffel Tower, from your hotel to catch a bus tour of Paris, and/or from your hotel to the Louvre, for example.
Not sure how to get from point A to point B? France has a great website that tells you how to do just that, figuring it all out for you automatically. You can select the fastest route or the one with the least walking., Avoid drawing attention to yourself. Having your wallet exposed and within easy reach invites pickpockets, further compounded by future identity theft. Losing your wallet, passport, cash and having all of your credit cards maxed-out can be an expensive and time-consuming mess to unravel and can ruin a vacation with spending time at the US Consult to get a replacement passport - instead of seeing the sights and relaxing.Purchase a money belt. There is an entire assortment of arm wallets, chest wallets, leg wallets, belt wallets, sock and underwear wallets available online.
Purchase an RFID protective sleeve for your passport and any chipped-credit cards to prevent electronic theft.
Security wallets can be reused for future trips or shared with family and friends on their trips. They provide peace of mind knowing that it would be difficult, if not nearly-impossible, to lose something as a result of a pickpocket, if you had your things stashed to where they are not easily visible or accessible except by you.
Avoid these areas in Paris after dark: Les Halles, Bois de Boulogne, Vincennes, Gare du Nord, Chatelet-Les Halles, Barbes Rochechouart, Strasbourg St.-Denis

, In Paris, everyone dresses up a little. Nearly all men wear a dark sports coat or blazer, with a collared shirt (typically an oxford button-down), with or without a tie. Knit collared type shirts are okay. Dress pants or khaki pants are the best, but even nice jeans are okay. For women, don't shy away from packing a couple of nice dresses.


Try to select neutral colors, such as white, off-white, gray, blue, or beige.
Avoid wearing shorts. Shorts never caught on in much of Europe, especially Paris. Regardless of the time of year, few to no one wears shorts.
Wear dress shoes or at least nice walking shoes that are dark and blend in with dress clothes. Very few locals wear athletic shoes, unless they are actually participating in a sporting event. Avoid sandals or flip flops, too. Sandals do not go well with a sport coat and collared shirt.
Being in Paris means a lot of walking. Seriously consider purchasing walking shoes and/or insoles. Also make sure that you pack moleskin and antibiotic ointment if you are prone to blisters.

, Make sure you bring everything you need but also follow baggage restrictions and travel requirements. A lot of air carriers are scrutinizing passengers taking oversized carry-on or luggage over 50 lbs. As you pack, be sure to visit your airlines website to make sure that your luggage is not oversize or overweight. In many cases:


Carry-on luggage is limited to 9 x 14 x 22,
One personal item is limited to 9 x 10 x 17
Checked baggage is limited to 62 linear inches (height + width + length).

, Place your identification both inside and outside on each bag as well as try to make your luggage distinctive for easy identification. Have a carry-on bag with a day or two's worth of clothing in case your luggage gets lost.


Realize that the value of your things adds up quicker than you might realize. Laptops, iPods, tablets, a few nice clothes would easily take thousands of dollars to replace. If you can, just don't bring them. They're not worth the hassle and worry.
It is easy for the value of one adult's luggage to value at over $5,000.00 to replace the contents. Take pictures of every single valuable item; just in case of the unforeseen event if your luggage were to be lost, you are in a better position to be reimbursed a more accurate value.

, Be aware that there are pickpockets everywhere in every city. If traveling to or through any area anywhere, in which you are concerned for personal safety, consider constructing a “mugger's wallet” – an old wallet with expired credit cards that you can surrender to a mugger and safely get out of the situation before the robber discovers that you just gave him a bunch of worthless plastic.


Do not have the false sense of security that carrying your wallet is safe in a front pocket. The best thing to do is to not carry a wallet at all – carry only what you need: one credit card, one ATM card, and 20-50 Euros. There is no need to carry your passport or driver’s license (unless you are renting a car).
Scan and make photocopies of your passport, driver's license, credit cards, and insurance cards and email the scanned copies to yourself before your trip, in case you need to access them in an emergency.

, Understand that the French see their place of business like their home: the public are invited guests. When you come into a Parisian business, it is important to greet the owner or employees with a simple, polite, “Bonjour” and a gentle smile. This one single French word, Bonjour, is the most important French word to know.


The second most-important word to know is “Merci”, which means “thank you."" These two words can get you surprisingly far.

, The French are very pleasant and exceptionally friendly - and in many cases, the French will go out of their way to be as helpful as possible, almost as citizen ambassadors on behalf of France. Overall, most French people are very nice, helpful and understanding, even if you know very little French. Before you go, brush up on your manners. There are ways of nearly-guaranteeing getting bad service, rudeness, or stares or glares from local Parisians:


Being rude to them first
Not saying ""bonjour"" immediately upon entering a place of business
Being loud or obnoxious
Dressing too casually or sloppy
Not making any attempt at all with French and expecting everyone else to speak in English
Broadcasting the perception that you feel that your country/culture is superior to theirs

, At the end of the day, Paris is a world-class, wonderful, delightful, top-tier international city and is the quintessential epicenter of the pinnacle of art, museums, sculpture, fashion, architecture, wine and food. The trip will be what you make of it. Set out to have fun and you will. It'll be hard not to!

DO NOT drink and drive.,
Watch out for anything unusual on the road.,
If you are from North America or any other place where they drive on their right side of the road with the driver's side on the left, you must remember to drive on your left side of the road, in an Irish car where the driver's side is on the right.,
Don't drive for long periods of time, fatigue is a killer.",How to Drive in Ireland," It goes without saying, no matter where you're from, but in Ireland, drinking is part of the culture and atmosphere, so you need to be extra vigilant and realize that you are still not immune to it. Also, in a country such as Ireland where alcoholism is a rather serious matter, it won't hurt to look out for other folks who are driving erratically and appear to be drunk. Should you see someone in this condition, give them the right of way so that you don't get your own car damaged.;
, If you're in a larger city, such as Dublin or Cork, you don't need to always be on high alert, but in any city you'll see the occasional cardboard box, coffee cup or blown tire. If you're driving out west, in rural Ireland, where the roads may be nothing but dirt paths, it's especially important to look out for loose rocks or livestock.

,


Even if you're in the countryside, still do this. You never know how many other people you will happen upon.

, Switch drivers if you're in a group, especially if you're on an excursion in the countryside.

Send a notice to the Republic of Ireland of your intention to wed. Do this 3 months before the wedding is to take place.,
Live in Ireland for at least 15 days.,
Meet with the appropriate registrar to supply the necessary documentation before the marriage takes place.,
Plan the ceremony.",How to Get Married in Ireland," This written notice should be sent to the district's wedding registrar where you want the wedding to take place. You can apply for an exception at the High Court Office or the Family Circuit Court, but these exceptions are not given on a regular basis.;
, Both parties can live there for 1 week, and then the wedding can happen 8 days later. If you want to get married in Ireland without a license, you can do so, but the waiting period becomes much longer. You may have to wait at least 22 days before the ceremony can take place. Check with the residency requirements for the particular district you wish to get married in to ensure that you can fulfill them. If you are having a church wedding, the residency requirements may not apply.

, The registrar you visit with will depend on the wedding's district as well as whether you are having a civil or religious ceremony. Protestant and civil marriages will be handled by a separate registrar than Roman Catholic marriages. You must supply birth certificates, and if one or both parties was previously divorced, a Decree of Absolute Divorce that is written in English. If either party is a widow or widower, the death certificate must be supplied. When the registrar is satisfied, you will receive a Marriage Registration Form (MRF), which is required before any ceremony can take place.

, For a Roman Catholic ceremony, you need to show linkage to a parish and church. If you are divorced, you are not allowed to marry in a Roman Catholic church, but you may still be married in another church. Civil ceremonies are an alternative for those who cannot or don't want to have a religious ceremony.

Resist the temptation to just hop on a plane to Italy with your fiancé. It is unlikely you will be able to have a legally binding ceremony if you don't have the proper documentation.;
, Most civil and religious ceremonies have restrictions on location. Catholic ceremonies must be conducted in a church and civil ceremonies must often be conducted in a town hall.


While a town hall might sound like a boring, clinical setting, many of them are located in beautiful castles, villas or palaces. The Palazzo Municipale in Ferraro or the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence with its striking Sala Rossa are notable spots. If you have your heart set on an outdoor ceremony, check with the local mayor or deputy to see if they will perform the ceremony in your desired park or outdoor destination., While the general laws of marriage apply in the same ways all over Italy, certain towns may have fewer requirements than others. Once you decide on a location, contact the registry of the local town hall for their specific requirements.A list of all of the town halls in Italy is available at Ancitel.it , If you do not have a valid passport, then you will need to apply for a new one or renew your existing one. You will need to allow at least six weeks to receive your new passport, so complete your application right away., Both you and your partner will need to have your original birth certificates in hand to get married in Italy. If you do not have the original copies, then obtain them as soon as possible., If applicable, you will need to prove that any prior marriages have been legally dissolved. This might require you to obtain a divorce decree, an annulment decree, or the death certificate of your late spouse if you have been widowed.You will need the original copies of these documents as well.Some citizens may also need to swear a Nulla Osta to be allowed to marry.For example, citizens of Australia must swear a Nulla Osta at the Australian Embassy in Rome or at the Australian Consulate in Milan. The Nulla Osta is a sworn statement that you are legally allowed to marry someone., The Atto Nottario is a declaration where you affirm that you have no obstacle (such as a pending divorce) to getting married in Italy. You might find it easier to get this done at an Italian Embassy in your home country before you leave for your wedding rather than at your country’s Consulate General office or the Embassy in Italy. There are some things to keep in mind as you complete the Atto Nottario, such as:The declaration must be sworn by two witnesses. The witnesses must be at least 18 years old, they must know both you and your spouse, and they cannot be family members or future in-laws. Think of asking friends, fellow church members, or co-workers to serve as your witnesses., If you decide to get an Atto Nottario in Italy, you must do so at the closest Notary Office to the location of your wedding. You must also have two witnesses (non-family members both over 18 years old). If either you, your spouse, or even one of your two witnesses does not speak Italian, then you must also hire an interpreter to be present at the notarization.You will also need to provide evidence of your legal presence in Italy, such as a plane ticket, a visa or a permit to stay.
You must also procure two revenue stamps (costing 16 euros each) and one additional stamp costing 10,62 euros. These lower cost stamps will require four to ten days to process and then pick up for your notarization. If you need the stamps issued on-the-spot, then you will need to buy the same two stamps costing 16 euros each and a third stamp costing 30,86 euros.
Make your appointment for the Atto Nottario well in advance. If you only have a limited amount of time in Italy, then you need to make sure you have this appointment lined up before going.

, You will do this in the Marriage Office belonging to the town hall where you intend to get married in Italy. You will need all of the above documentation in order to do this.


For Italian citizens and residents of Italy, civil banns are posted for at least two weeks after they submit their Declaration to Marry. They cannot have a civil ceremony before these postings have occurred.
But for international visitors to Italy, the banns requirement might be waived or shortened to a length ranging from one day to one week. Contact the local town hall where you plan to get married to find out if they waiver the banns requirement for international visitors., If you are interested in a civil ceremony, then this will be performed by the mayor of the town or one of his deputies in Italy. Contact the town hall in the city where you plan to get married to make these arrangements., You must have two witnesses with you who are over 18 years old. They can be of any nationality and they must have valid, unexpired photo identification (like a passport or driver's license).A member of your wedding party or a family member can serve as a witness.

, Unless all members of your wedding party speak Italian, you will need to hire an interpreter. You cannot have one of your witnesses play the part of an interpreter as well. You must hire someone who is not part of the wedding party to interpret for those who do not speak Italian., If you have a civil ceremony, then you will need to have the ceremony in the town hall and pay a rental fee for it. This fee can range in price from 500 euros to 9,200 euros., A religious ceremony in Italy is only considered legally binding if it is in the Catholic Church. The priest who performs your ceremony will register your paperwork with the local town hall.If you have a religious ceremony at a different house of worship, then you will need to have an additional civil ceremony.
Keep in mind that the Vatican is a separate state from Italy, so the same rules and regulations may not apply to a religious ceremony conducted there.The Catholic Church will not perform your wedding if either you or your spouse has been previously divorced in the Catholic Church. If you were previously married and divorced, but not in the Catholic church (i.e. your previous marriage was performed by a justice of the peace or in another faith), then you can get married in the Catholic church after filing a Lack of Form and paying a $50 fee to process it.If you wish to get married by the Catholic Church in Italy, you must produce certificates of your baptism, first communion and confirmation. These must be stamped by your local Bishop's office prior to coming to Italy.

, To get married in a Catholic church in Italy, you will need to provide a letter of Declaration from your local priest stating that you and your future spouse are active members of your church. This letter must be written on the letterhead of your parish to be considered valid.Your priest can also provide proof that you have completed any pre-cana classes with your spouse.
The Bishop of your parish must provide a NHIL OBSTAT letter. This letter affirms that you have no impediment to getting married in the Catholic church in Italy. It should also include the name of the church in Italy and the date you intend to get married.

, The Bishop of your parish must also approve the Prenuptial Inquiry Form. This is a questionnaire issued by your archdiocese's office (not your local priest) and it asks a range of questions concerning your personal data and religious history. This form must also be written on parish letterhead and it must be signed and stamped by the Bishop's office., The Declaration from your priest and the NHIL OBSTAT and Prenuptial Inquiry Form from your Bishop must be sent in their original form for approval by the Italian Curia in order for you to have a Catholic wedding in Italy. However, most of these documents expire after three months. Send these no earlier than three months before your wedding but no later than one month before the date.Talk to the priest in Italy about the best address to send these documents to. You should send them with a tracking number provided by FedEx or a similar service.Most Italian churches will translate these documents for you into Italian. However, you should check with your priest in Italy to make sure they provide this service.
If you are Catholic but your future spouse is not, you can still get married in the church, but your Bishop will need to include a stamped and signed ""Permission of Mixed Religion"" form along with other documentation., Keep in mind that because the cost of attending a destination wedding is high, many of your friends and family will not be able to afford to come to your wedding. Therefore, you may want to plan on having a small, more intimate affair.


Try to give your guests plenty of notice (10-12 months) so they can look for good deals on airfare or plan to set aside extra expenses for a trip to Europe.
If you have friends or relatives that you want to be in your bridal party, make sure you tell them you are having a wedding in Italy prior to asking them to be in your wedding. That way, they won't agree to be your bridesmaid or groomsmen, but then back out due to financial or time constraints., If you are planning a wedding in a popular tourist destination in Italy during the high travel season (summer), then you should try to book a block of hotel rooms at least 10-12 months before your wedding. This will ensure you get enough space to meet your guests' needs while also allowing you to get the best rates.If you are having a smaller party of guests, consider renting an entire villa or cabin that you can all stay in together. You can often find great deals on AirBnB, VRBO or HomeAway.

, Italy can be very hot in July and August. It might not be the best climate for a heavy satin ball gown or a stuffy topcoat and tails. Inform your guests that they should also prepare for the heat if you are hosting your wedding during this time., A planner will be a helpful asset, especially if you won't be able to travel to Italy prior to your wedding in order to plan it. The planner will know the best vendors in the area and she will also be able to easily communicate with them in Italian.The wedding planner will be able to recommend vendors for food, music, lighting, florists, linens, etc. All of these are key elements to making your guests comfortable. Her or she will be your eyes on the ground when you can't be there.
If you are not using a wedding planner, make sure you do lots of research on-line about your vendors before hiring them. Check their web sites for portfolios of their work and read reviews of them on-line.

, Airfare will be a major expense for yourself and your guests if you are traveling overseas. Once you have a date set for your ceremony, you should start looking for tickets. Use price comparison sites like Kayak and try looking for sales on Tuesdays or Sundays -- studies have shown these are the best dates to find deals.If you see an excellent deal on airfare, be sure to notify your guests of this. Consider making an email group or text group so you can quickly tell them about good deals.

, Once you all actually arrive for the joyous event, make welcome bags for your guests. You can include items like a timeline of the wedding events (rehearsal dinner, ceremony, reception, post-wedding brunch) maps, pamphlets of local sightseeing attractions, and menus from nearby restaurants or cafes, and pieces of your favorite Italian chocolate or candy.You can also include more practical things like sunscreen (a necessity in Italy), sunglasses, a sheet with common Italian sayings or phrases, bugspray, etc., While you will have lots of responsibilities to juggle during the days leading up to the wedding, make sure you spend quality time with your guests. They have taken a long and expensive trip to celebrate with you.Try planning a couple of group outings, such as a wine tasting at a nearby vineyard or a picnic at a local lake. This will give you the chance to interact with your guests even if you are very busy on the actual wedding day.

Do your research.,
Select a train line.,
Locate on a map where Milan's Centrale train station is.,
Check the information marquees for the latest information, and make sure you are boarding your train on the correct platform.,
Enjoy the ride.It's roughly 3 to 4 hours by train from Milan's Centrale station to Venice's Santa Lucia station.",How to Get from Milan to Venice," Hop on the web to find schedules and prices for the trains. The Italian train system, Trenitalia, has its website here: http://www.ferroviedellostato.it. At the top of the page there is a link to translate into English.;
, There are two types of trains that operate in Italy: the national 'Trenitalia' line, and the European 'Eurostar.' The Eurostar lines have two classes, and both are reasonably comfortable and a little faster than the Trenitalia ones. For plug outlets at every seat and plush seats, choose first class on Eurostar; to save a bit of money, go with second class.

, It is pretty much in the central part of the city, pretty hard to miss. Tickets can be bought at the station, and usually there are hourly trains from Milan to Venice, so you won't have to wait long if the next train is full.

, There are not always conductors or employees to point you in the right direction. IMPORTANT: There are two Venice train stops, one in Santa Lucia and the other is Mestre. Mestre is inland, it's where tour bus groups stay because it's cheaper than the island. You are probably going to Santa Lucia, where all the lovely gondolas and crumbling building facades are.

, Very likely, your stop will be the last stop for the train, so just hop off, make sure you have everything with you, and get cash from the ATM while you're at the station. Venice is much like other Italian cities, which favors cash over plastic. Head outside to soak in the beautiful surroundings, and take the Vaporetto water-bus to your hotel if practical.

When reading articles online, look for reputable sources. Lonely Planet and Trip Advisor are good online travel communities to visit. You can also check out blogs of people who have traveled.


Once you get an idea of the things you would like do and the cities you want to visit, you can start to plan your trip.
Talk to anyone that has visited Italy to get some additional tips.;
, Popular destinations in Italy include Rome, Florence, Tuscany, Milan, Venice, and Naples. You can spend all of your time in one area or visit multiple areas. If you visit more than one area, allow enough time to visit each area. The shorter your trip, the fewer number of areas you should try to visit.


If it is your first time visiting Italy, start with Rome, Florence, and Venice.If you want to go to the beach, consider going to Southern Italy (e.g., Amalfi Coast, Pompeii, Naples, Sicily)

, Most tourists visit Italy in July, August, and early September. It will be more crowded this time of year, and it is also very hot and humid with the highs around 90℉/32℃. Temperatures are more pleasant from April to mid June and mid September to October with highs around 70-80℉/21-27℃ and lows 50-60℉/10-15℃.The winters are cold and are not the best time to walk around. Northern Italy is colder than the south as are higher elevations.
Flights and hotels are often more expensive during peak travel season as well.

, This will help you plan your attractions, based on the time you have. The length of your stay will depend on your budget and how many cities you plan to visit. Consider how many days you will actually have on the ground when you are in Italy. The day that you arrive and they day that you depart should not be included. Also consider the time it will take you to travel in between cities.


The train from Rome to Florence takes one hour and thirty minutes.The train from Florence to Venice takes a little over two hours.If you are going from Southern Italy to Northern Italy, you will need even more time. The train ride from the Amalfi Coast (i.e. Southern Italy) to Florence (i.e. Northern Italy) will take you five hours and forty five minutes., Once you decide what cities you will visit, look up the major attractions in each city. For example, if you are going to Rome, you may want to visit the Colosseum. If you go to Venice, you will want to visit the canals. In Florence, you may want to visit the Santa Maria del Fiore.It's best to purchase tickets for major attractions and museums before you leave for your trip, or you may not be able to get inSome places only allow a limited number of visits per day or require you to wait for hours and hours to get in. Tickets can be purchased online at Italian websites.You will have to change the language to English.
Attractions often have their own website where you can buy tickets and check the hours of operation.

, Look up the price of everything. Consider the costs of hotels, food, transportation (e.g. airfare and getting around the country), attractions, and shopping. There are options for every price point, but you will need to thoroughly research.Also, remember the exchange rate. Italy uses the Euro (€). Check the current exchange rate with your currency as it changes all of the time.


The amount of money you need will really depend on the types of activities you plan on doing. If you plan to eat at more expensive restaurants or visit a lot of attractions, you will need more money.
It may help to have a set amount of money you will spend each day. For example, $100 a day or $60 a day.

, While it is nice to plan out what you would like to do every day, allow some flexibility in your schedule. Things will not go exactly as you plan. You may get lost or your train may not be on time. The line at the museum may be longer than you anticipated. You also may want to explore the streets or stumble upon something interesting.If you do have activities planned, allow some flex time between each activity. If you plan to visit a museum from 10:00 am-12:00 pm, do not have another activity that starts at 12:15 pm or 12:30 pm. Consider giving yourself forty five minute or an hour of cushion time.
You could also block off two or three hours of free time each day.

, A travel agent or travel company can help you book your trip. You can purchase your flight and hotel together as well as get tickets to different attractions. Your trip can come with a planned itinerary or you can do an independent vacation package. A quick Google search can help you find Italian vacation packages.This is a good option if you are not comfortable planning all the logistics yourself or do not have time to plan.


Only work with reputable companies. Ask your friends, family, and coworkers about any travel agents or companies that they have worked with. Look the agent or company up on the Better Business Bureau website.
You can also contact the American Society of Travel Agents at (703) 739-2782 to see if the agent belongs to the organization., If you are from the US, sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program online, in person at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, or the Consulates General in Naples, Milan, and Florence. This will give you up-to-date information on travel and security within Italy and makes it easier for the Embassy to contact you in case there is an emergency.


You can also call 1-888-407-4747 or 1-202-501-4444 for up-to-date information on security.

, Your plane ticket will be the biggest expense for your trip. Flights to Italy are more expensive than flights to other European cities.Search for the best deal and travel during the off season (October - April). Flying into the major airports in Rome and Milan will be more expensive than flying into a smaller airport and taking a train or bus to the major city., The rail system is the best way to get from one city to the next. You can check train times and prices before you get there by visiting the Trenitalia (Italian Railways) websiteor by using two other private agency websites that connect to the Trenitalia website.Prices start at either €9, €19, or €29. There are no baggage fees or weight limits, and you can bring your own food and drinks.Buy your tickets at the station or online. You can buy the tickets 120 days in advance and will save money by purchasing your tickets in advance.Children under four can ride the train for free., A car is not the easiest way to get around Italy, and most cars have manual transmission. If you plan to drive while you are in Italy, you will need an International Driving Permit.These permits can be purchased from your nearest American Automobile Association office for $15.You can use your American Driver's license if it is accompanied by an official Italian translation. Visit the U.S. Embassy website to find a list of official translators.


A car is best if you are traveling around southern Italy, but public transportation is usually the best way to get around.You will not have to worry about parking, driving in an unfamiliar city, and getting tickets.

, Public transportation is a great way to get around the country. Train, metro, and bus tickets can be purchased at tobacco shops, bars, or vending machines at the metro station or bus stop. Validate your ticket by entering it into one of the validation machines located near the entrance of the station or bus stop. The machine will stamp your ticket with the date and time.If you know you are going to be in a city for a few days, go ahead and purchase a multi-day pass. Prices will vary depending on the city and the number of days (e.g. 7 day pass, 48 hour pass, 24 hour pass)
Always have your ticket ready in case a ticket inspector comes by to check your ticket.
Public transportation is free for children that are ten years old or younger.

, You can stay in a hotel, hostel, agriturismo accommodation (farm-stay), convent/monastery or rent an apartment while you are in Italy.When looking for a place to stay, consider the location and distance from public transportation. Check and see if they offer WiFi and breakfast before you book. Also, ask if they offer transportation to and from the airport.


An agriturismo is where a family has guest accommodations on their farm. Meals are sometimes included, and they are cheaper than a hotel. The best way to find one is by using Google maps.
A pensione (bed and breakfast) is also an option in Italy.
Apartments can be found using AirBnB, HouseTrip or HomeAway.A convent or monastery is less expensive than a hotel as well, but they often have rules and curfews.
If you see a hotel you like, call the hotel directly to see if you can get a cheaper rate.
Visit travel websites like TripAdvisor to read other traveler's top choices and experiences that are in your price range.
Hostels will be less expensive than hotels. This is a good idea if you are traveling alone and want to meet other people.

, When you convert money, you pay an additional fee. These rates will vary depending on where you exchange your money. Exchange money at an Italian bank or use your ATM card to get the best exchange rate.ATMs in Italy are called Bancomats.You will need to have some cash on hand to pay for a taxi or in some restaurants and shops.
Call your bank and/or credit card company to see what the foreign transaction fee (i.e. percentage of your overall purchase) is and if your card will be compatible with Italian banks.
Be careful exchanging money at a storefront. They do not post their exchange rates and may charge you more if you are a tourist."

Determine who your last Italian-born ancestor was.,
Make sure the relative qualifies you.,
Start collecting documents.,
Obtain apostilles and translations (into Italian) of all documents from the United States.,
Obtain naturalization records for your last Italian born ancestor.,
Make an appointment at the Italian consulate nearest you.,
Go to your appointment and file your application for Italian citizenship.

",How to Obtain Italian Citizenship Through Jure Sanguinis," For example, if your great grandparent was born in Italy in 1911 but moved to the US in 1920, he is considered your last Italian-born ancestor.You will need this person's information (date of birth, place of birth and US naturalization documents, if applicable).;
, Italian citizenship ""jure sanguinis"" is passed down through the bloodline. This means that an Italian citizen passes on citizenship to his children, no matter where they are born in the world. If you can prove an uninterrupted line of Italian citizenship--no matter how many generations removed--in accordance with the following general rules, you may be eligible for dual citizenship: Your ancestor must have been...


Born in Italy.
Alive at any point in time after March 17th, 1861 (the date of Italian unification). Prior to this date, there was no such thing as an “Italian citizen” because Italy itself was not a unified country.
Not have naturalized as a citizen of the US before July 1, 1912. Ancestors who naturalized before July 1, 1912 could not transmit Italian citizenship, as per Italian Law no. 555 of July 1912.
Not have naturalized before his or her child was born, if that is the person through which you would be eligible. For example: if your grandfather was your last Italian-born relative, he must have NOT naturalized before your father's birth, as your father is the person through which you would obtain your citizenship (Italian law automatically recognizes the children of Italian citizens as citizens of Italy just waiting for legal recognition of citizenship).
Italian women could not pass on citizenship to their children before January 1, 1948. If your Italian ancestor was a woman who had her child before that date, you may not be eligible for Italian citizenship. For example: If your last Italian-born ancestor was your great grandmother who had her child (your grandmother) in 1940, you might not be eligible. However, this has been successfully overturned in Italian court and it might be worth your while to contact an Italian lawyer.

, You will need all marriage, birth and death certificates regarding your family. For example, if you are applying through your Italian born ancestor, you would need:


His birth certificate from Italy
Your grandmother's birth certificate
Their marriage certificate
Your grandfather's naturalization certificate
Your father's birth certificate
Your mother's birth certificate
Their marriage certificate
Your birth certificate
Any and all death certificates and divorce decrees if applicable

, An apostille is a separate sheet of paper which enables your American document to be legally used in Italy. You obtain them from the Secretary of State of the state which issued each document.

, If you are unable to find your ancestor's US naturalization certificate, you will have to contact USCIS for a ""certificate of no record.""

, Put your application together in the meantime.

Italy's culture has been influenced greatly by its diverse ties to the rest of the Mediterranean world, especially North Africa, Greece, and Spain.
You should also understand that Italy is a very regionalized country. The unified Italian state was only formed in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and consequently there are tremendous regional differences within the country. Provincial subcultures are especially strong, and the broader divide between northern and southern Italians is a fact that many within the country remain particularly conscious of.;
, Many Italians can speak English, but it's useful to learn Italian as it is the official language of Italy.


Understand that a language can provide great insights into the culture and traditional worldview of the people of a country. The way in which a people refer to themselves, their country, and its spaces and places can only properly be understood in the native language.
Though many travelers only gain fluency in a language after moving to a country, you should begin the process of learning the language before you move to Italy. Build a foundation, and then add to it.
While it is commonly claimed that grammar and sentence structure are the most important early components of a language to pick up, some research suggests that vocabulary is actually the key. Second-language learners simply have nothing to build upon without first gaining a basic vocabulary. Start with this, but pay attention to word order as you become more familiar with the vocabulary., You are probably thinking about moving to Italy because you are convinced that there is some possibility of a higher quality of life there than where you currently live. While possibilities do abound in Italy, it is not a guarantee that everyone can find the right place to live or the best means to make a living.


The Italian economy has not rebounded well from the economic crisis of 2008, and there remains a high level of unemployment. Young people in particular struggle to find work--36% of workers under 25 are unemployed. The situation does not seem likely to improve in the near future in part due to a government that is frequently stuck in gridlock.Though it may seem like a stereotype, Italy has had greater struggles with the crime problem than nearly any other country in western Europe. Non-violent crimes (such as pick-pocketing) are very common in major tourist cities. More sinister organized criminal syndicates are also influential in much of the country (especially southern Italy), and have on occasion even assassinated politicians and police chiefs in order to protect their interests in narcotics trafficking., If you intend to spend months or years in Italy, you really should see the country before you commit yourself to the move.


You must select a place of residency, and this is your opportunity to investigate the many cities of Italy. Get to know a potential hometown.

, With the knowledge you now have of Italy, you can make an intelligent decision to move (or not move) to Italy.

, A visit of ninety days or fewer requires no special permit or visa for American citizens or citizens of the EU countries. All extended visits do require a visa or permit. Like those of many other developed nations, the immigration and residency laws of Italy were primarily authored by opponents of immigration. For that reason, it can be quite difficult to establish legal residency in Italy. You need to understand all of the options available before you move.Student visas are among the easiest to obtain--provided you had no difficulty gaining acceptance to a program in Italy. Many programs specifically target students from overseas. For young people who want to spend an extended period of time in Italy this is probably the best option available. If you are already studying at a college or university, contact their study abroad program to see if there are opportunities available with schools in Italy. If you have not yet entered post-secondary education, you can look for Italian universities or American schools with programs in Italy.
Work visas are among the hardest to obtain. These are further subcategorized into artist visas, dependent worker visas (for employees), and independent worker visas (for freelancers and other independent contractors). The independent worker visas are especially hard to obtain, but those seeking dependent worker visas are caught in a bit of a catch-22--it is difficult to get a job without a visa, but you cannot obtain a visa without a job.
Residency visas require that you can demonstrate that you possess enough wealth to support yourself while in Italy. However, because it is not a worker visa, that wealth cannot come from income based on employment inside of Italy.

, In order to obtain the visa, you must be able to prove that you have the status that fits one of the above profiles. Here are a few things that you may need:


A valid passport issued by the country of which you are a citizen. A green card or proof of residency in another country is inadequate.
A letter of acceptance from the college or university you will be attending (if applicable).
Bank documents proving that you are in possession of the money that you claim (if you are applying for the residency visa).

, The documents that you must provide differ based on your nationality and country of residency.


You must arrange an embassy or consulate appointment weeks in advance.
During the visa interview, you will be asked a number of questions about the length of your intended stay, your purpose, and your background. Really, they need to confirm three things: 1. That you are not going to perpetrate any crimes while in Italy; 2. That you will not become a burden on the social welfare system; 3. That it is not your intent to immigrate permanently. While there are some--such as fabulously rich investors--who are encouraged to immigrate on a permanent basis, in the majority of cases the authorities are told to discourage anyone who has the intent to make Italy their permanent home.
Though you may be approved on the spot, you may also be told that a further background check will be required. They will then perform a thorough check to confirm the authenticity of your claims and verify your stated plans.

, The approval process can take weeks, and approval is never guaranteed. Understand, then, that an appointment scheduled just before your move may not be a good idea.


Check the visa to make sure the details listed on it are accurate. Errors could complicate the process and result in a forced departure from Italy.

, You must find a place a reside. Even if you plan to move to Italy for the long term, it may be a good idea to find an apartment at first, just so you can really get to know the country, the neighborhoods, and the housing market.


If you made a trip to Italy earlier, hopefully you had some success while scouting around. That would have been a good time to compile a list of potential neighborhoods, apartment complexes, or residential agents that you can contact later.
Until recently, rents were set by government agencies. Legal changes in the last few years have opened up housing prices to market shifts, and you may notice substantial price differences from one neighborhood to the next.City centers, as you might expect, remain the most expensive areas to live. Some of the larger cities have highly capable public transportation, so you want to factor that in when you are selecting a house or apartment., You will need electricity, water, possibly gas, and phone service in Italy. The process is little different from doing so in the United States, but there are a few things you can do to simplify it.


If you already have a cell phone, get a European sim card. You will need an ""unlocked"" phone, but with the right sim card your phone will be identified as European by local networks and you will have access to regional cell phone rates (as long as you find a carrier).Though you will have to make arrangements with a local water company, you will probably not be billed regularly. Each household has a water quota and, outside of the subscription fee, you are only charged for exceeding that quota. If you are always under the quota, expect just a two to four bills from them a year.You are free to choose which electrical utility you want to use (at least if you purchased or are renting an entire house). The regular quantity of electricity apportioned for each household is smaller than is the case in the United States, and if you need additional power you may have to ask for a higher volume. You will be charged at a higher rate if you do so., The decision of plan, train, or automobile should be based upon the relative cost of each and your current distance from Italy.


The cost of flights is largely based upon the amount of time between the time of purchase and the flight and the amount of demand for tickets at that departure time. Purchase early or for flights during a slow season to get the best deals.

, Bring everything that you will need in the short term. Essentials here are items like clothes and toiletries to get you started. A language dictionary is also a must if you are still learning the language.

, Even if you think this move to Italy is for the long term, it may not be practical to ship all of your current possessions there. If you live in the Americas, for example, the transhipment cost would be prohibitive for all but the most valuable of items. Bulky but relatively inexpensive items (such as common furniture) should be left behind and replacements will have to be purchased in Italy.

, Obviously, you can skip this step if you live in a country where the Euro is already the national currency. Remember, the more money that you bring, the better start that you will get in Italy.


Calculate the value of your money in Euros. The exchange rate changes frequently, and exchanging your currency at a time when your nation's currency is weak in comparison to the Euro could actually cost you a substantial portion of your wealth.
You can exchange your currency at certain banks or at offices in the airports. Of course, since this is a trip planned well in advance, there is no reason to wait until you are in the airport to do it. Check with your bank to see if they offer these services and, if so, how much they charge for them.,


Keep your passport on hand the entire time. Do not place it in checked luggage. You will be asked for it as you board a plane or ship bound for Europe. If you do not have it, you can be denied boarding.

Schedule a trip in the tourist offseason.,
Book a romantic, boutique hotel.,
Inquire about special packages or bonuses for couples.,
Dine in off-the-beaten-path restaurants and cafes.,
Stroll the shops on ancient, winding streets.,
Wait for late-night hours to visit busy tourist squares and bridges.,
Find alternatives to tourist trap destinations.",How to Plan a Romantic Italian Getaway1," Italy’s ancient cities are invariably exciting, gorgeous, and mysterious, but they’re also perpetually besieged by flocks of tourists. Fortunately, you can limit the amount of camera-toting, street-clogging tourists disrupting your tete-a-tete time by booking your stay during the spring or late autumn.The peak tourist season is from June to September. Avoid August in particular, as native Italians join the hordes of international tourists on holiday, and temperatures linger consistently in the 90s.;
, Just because you’re going to the bright lights, big city, doesn’t mean you have to book a big, generic hotel. Popular Italian metropolises, such as Venice, Florence, Milan, and Rome, are overflowing with boutique hotels where you’ll feel all the charm of an Italian villa. For example, the 16th-century Ca Maria Adele in Venice boasts only twelve rooms and its own, private entrance to the Grand Canal.You can also check out alternate accommodation sites, such as Airbnb or vrbo. You and your partner will be all alone together, but you’ll also be responsible for such prosaic chores as buying groceries, cooking, and cleaning up after yourselves.

, Once you’ve selected a hotel for your getaway, contact guest services and ask about any exclusive, couples-specific rates or packages. Even if they don’t offer any discounts for romantic retreats, they might provide special extras, such as flowers or champagne delivered to the room, spa or massage services, or custom keepsakes from your stay., You’ve probably heard of such legendary establishments as Harry’s Bar in Venice, the Camparino in Galleria in Milan, or the Antico Caffe Greco in Rome. While these historic dining and drinking venues are worth a glance, the packed, noisy atmosphere is less-than-conducive to an intimate evening, so plan instead on eating and drinking at local alternatives.


For example, pop into Harry’s Dolci for a bellini in Venice, spend an evening at Fonderie Milanesie in Milan, or have a glass of wine at the Vintage Bistrot in Rome., Browsing quaint Italian shops and finding unique gifts for each other—be they vintage knickknacks, sumptuous jewelry, or Italian designer clothing—can be a great way to create memorable romance. In addition to the upscale shopping streets such as Via Monte Napeleone in Milan or Mercerie in Venice, you can check out quaint, bohemian boutiques in Milan’s Brera district, the San Polo neighborhood in Venice, or the Campo de Fiori neighborhood in Rome.Check exchange rates ahead of time so that you know exactly what that price tag—as part of the European Union, Italy uses the euro—means in your native currency.

, Just because you’re looking for an intimate vibe to your urban wanderings, doesn’t mean that you have to skip the famous sights and landmarks entirely. Simply wait until nightfall—9 p.m. or after—to stroll notoriously crowded places such as St. Mark’s square or the Accademia Bridge in Venice. You’ll find these gorgeous spaces not only nearly empty, but also filled with romantic lighting and mysterious atmosphere.The same goes for any museums or galleries you’re hoping to visit. Many popular tourist attractions offer late-evening or nighttime hours on specific days during the week, so check out the late-night options before battling the throngs., When thinking about famously romantic activities in Italy, you probably envision floating down Venetian canals in a gondola, sipping wine on a sidewalk café, or surveying the cityscape from La Pergola restaurant in Rome or Campanile di San Marco tower in Venice. Unfortunately, the long lines and steep prices of these attractions can drain the romance right out of your day.


Avoid these popular pitfalls by planning to visit less-famous alternatives to these tourist traps. For example, check out the San Giorgio Maggiore bell tower in Venice rather than the Campanile di San Marco, or venture to the couples-friendly, local-favorite Gianicolo Hill vista rather than jostling for a table at La Pergola."

Plan a route through Tuscany or Umbria.,
Book a rental car.,
Make reservations for winery tastings.,
Include world-famous olive groves in your itinerary.,
Stop overnight in quaint Italian villages.",How to Plan a Romantic Italian Getaway2," If you’re more country mouse than city mouse, consider taking a tour through the rolling hills and small villages of the Italian countryside. Both Umbria and Tuscany offer the best and most romantic attractions that Italy has to offer—spectacular scenery, wine, and medieval landmarks—but there are some differences that can help you make your choice between them.If you’re looking for a more off-the-beaten-path experience and overall lower prices, head to Umbria. If you’re looking for some beach time and a wine-weighty experience, go for Tuscany., Many tourists take organized bus tours through Tuscany or Umbria, but for a romantic getaway, you’re better off renting a car for the two of you. This way your trip is full of tete-a-tete quality time, as well as easily customizable and flexible. Use a big rental company like Avis, Hertz, Europcar, or Maggiore/National and pick up your car from the airport when you arrive.Remember to account for fuel costs in your travel budget, as gasoline prices in Italy are among the highest in Europe at up to two euros a liter (around nine or ten dollars a gallon).Also take some time to educate yourself on the Italian road system before you arrive. You should know, for example, that the autostrade are toll roads, that city speed limits are 50 km/hr and 110 km/hr on the autostrade, and that all cars and motorcycles must use headlights at all times when outside of the city., Most of the wineries in Tuscany and Umbria let you stop by for casual, impromptu tastings, but you should make reservations if you want a more in-depth experience. Pick a few wineries that seem particularly interesting and make arrangements before departing. Some must-see wineries in Tuscany include Biondi Santi, Casiglion del Bosco, and Castello di Ama, while Di Filippo Winery and Cantina Roccafiore wineries in Umbria offer delicious drinks and stunning scenery.Call ahead or visit the specific winery’s website in order to make reservations. Most wineries offer a range of tastings, from some basic options where you simply sample some varietals, to more deluxe excursions where you tour the estates and facilities and eat some house-provided cheese and cured meats.In order to avoid the perils of drinking and driving, arrange for a shuttle or taxi from and returning to your overnight accommodation.

, Wine vineyards aren’t the only picturesque farms and estates to visit on your tour of the Italian countryside. Olives and olive oil are one of Tuscany and Umbria’s most valuable exports, and you can get an inside peek at the gorgeous groves by stopping in and taking tours of the olive farms which dot the countryside. As an added bonus, many of these farms include intimate, gourmet restaurants on-site, so you can stay for a romantic dinner after your tour.For example, you can witness the process of olive oil production, as well as tour surrounding Etruscan pathways, at the Ilune farmhouse in Tuscany. In Umbria, you can visit the Pongelli Benedettoni estates, where 220 hectares hold 5,000 organically grown olive trees.Fall is harvest season for olive farmers, so this is the best time to visit Italy’s olive groves.

, The Tuscan and Umbrian countryside offer a plethora of romantic, boutique hotels. Just be sure to plan your stay ahead of time, as these modestly sized getaways book up quickly and consistently. Some particularly romantic options to consider include the medieval villa of Borgo Santo Pietro in Tuscany, and the Torre di Moravola—housed in a restored medieval watchtower—in Umbria.You can also check out the wineries and olive farms you’re planning to visit, as many of these estates offer accommodations for travelers.

Choose a gorgeous Italian seaside, such as the Amalfi or Cilento coast.,
Find cozy hotels with access to private beaches.,
Rent bikes to tour the surrounding landscape in private.,
Picnic on the coast instead of eating at crowded cafes.,
Watch the sunset from mountaintop vistas or scenic boat rides.",How to Plan a Romantic Italian Getaway3," Italy is chock-full of scenic beaches, so your biggest problem once you’ve decided to get away to the coast is figuring out which one to visit in particular. The Amalfi coast is arguably the most famous and luxurious Italian getaway of this kind, but your other options include Lake Como, or the less-known but equally gorgeous Cilento coast.When making your choice among Italy’s coastlines, consider factors such as budget, crowds, and activities. If you’re looking for a resort vibe with tons of foreign tourists, shopping, and sunbathing, as well as historical sites such as the ruins of Pompeii, go Amalfi. If you want a less crowded, budget-friendly escape, opt for Cilento., No matter which coastline you visit, there will be plenty of beach and sun for even the most avid sunbather. Your romantic, sun-soaked experience can be easily ruined by ice cream-waving, screaming toddlers or rowdy teenagers, though, so book a small hotel with private pools and beaches. The Santa Caterina in Amalfi, for example, offers its own beach club and bar, and honeymoon suites contain private infinity pools.On the Cilento coast, the Palazzo Belmonte and Il Cannito offer private beaches for their guests., Guided bike tours along the Amalfi and Cilento coasts are extremely popular, as they offer a budget-friendly, fun, and active way to explore the coast and take in the stunning, panoramic views of the coastline. For your romantic getaway experience, you can take in all the untouched sights and sounds without the distraction of a guided tour by renting bikes on a daily or weekly basis.


Consult online cycling groups and forums for sample itineraries and must-see landmarks. On the Amalfi coast, you won’t want to miss the ruins of Pompeii on your cycling tour. In Cilento, be sure to stop by Paestum—one of the oldest Greek temple ruins in the world—and one of the many buffalo mozzarella farms dotting the coastline., Instead of paying top dollar to sit on crowded terrace overlooking the sea, you can make your own, intimate picnic for a fraction of the cost. Buy a bottle of wine, a baguette, cheese, and prosciutto, and pick a spot on the rocks with a view. Voila, you’ve got your own, private restaurant.In Italy, a decent bottle of wine should cost you no more than 5-10 euros, while bread, cheese, cured meats, and olives are priced equally reasonably., The Italian coasts boast some of the most jaw-dropping and romance-stirring sunsets in the world. Make sure you get first-row seats to this nightly spectacular by perching on a marina dock or beach, sitting on your hotel room’s balcony, or hiking to a cliff-side vista, such as the Villa Communale in Sorrento.You can also hire a private boat to take you for a sunset cruise.


In September and October, the sun sets between 6 and 7:30 p.m., while summertime will have a later sunset."

Take the subway if you need to get across the city and it is too far to walk. It is much cheaper than a cab, and it works similar to the subway systems in most cities.;
, Unless you get breakfast for free in your hotel, you should save your appetite for later. If you are hungry, grab a banana or an apple from one of the corner fruit markets for less than 1 euro.

, You will probably need to share a bathroom with lots of other people, but you will pay a fraction of what you would pay in a hotel.


Stay in a hotel near the train station. If you want budget accommodations but do not want to stay in a hostel, check the hotels near Rome's Termini station. They are clean and much cheaper than the luxury hotels closer to the main city attractions.

, Rome is full of classic ruins and old churches which can be enjoyed free of charge.


Explore the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain, 2 popular attractions that cost nothing. You can also see the Coliseum, the Forum and other ruins for no charge.
Visit Rome's churches. There are over 900 churches in Rome. Stick to the major basilicas and historical churches such as St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, St. John in Laterno, Basilica of Santa Maria in Maggiore, Santa Croce and Saint Paul Outside the Walls.
See the Vatican Museums, including the Sistine Chapel on the last Sunday of the month. The Vatican admits people for free on Sundays from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Get there early and prepare to stand in line.

, Rather than sitting down to an expensive dinner in Rome, there are plenty of local trattorias and cafes that serve good food for less money.


Make a picnic. Buy some bread from a bakery, and stop by a deli for some great cheese, Parma ham or salami, and a bottle of wine for just a few euros. Take the meal to a park or other scenic spot.

, This is often cheaper than exchanging cash in a bank or tourist center.

On dressing.,
On going to someone else's home.,
On meeting.,
On gift giving.,
On dining.,
On jokes.,
On respect.",How to Be Polite in Italy," Never dress poorly - casual, daily clothes should be elegant and stylish, and women should always wear at least a little makeup and a piece of jewellery. If invited to a special event, always wear your best clothes. Italians also often follow the latest trends in fashion.;
, If you are invited to somebody else's home, dress well. If the invitation says informal, or it is un-informal occasion, you will still be expected to wear stylish clothes (see step 1) - casual, but stylish. However, over-dressing for an occasion is seen as vulgar. You should arrive on time, though being ten or fifteen minutes late won't cause any upset. When you arrive give your attention to the host - to immediately go off and talk to other guests or sitting down is very impolite. Also, bring a gift with you (see step 4). Note that when you are invited to an acquaintance's home for dinner, you are expected to return the invitation (though a week or two later.)

, First impressions are particularly important to Italians. Greetings should be warm and enthusiastic, yet not informal. In Southern Italy a greeting will usually be a kiss on each cheek, whilst in the North this is reserved for close friends and family; otherwise, a handshake while suffice, but remember to make eye-contact. Also remember that it is rude to call somebody by their first name unless they give you express permission.

, It is possible you will want to give a gift. Flowers are not as common a gift in Italy as in other countries, though are still given - if you do want to give flowers avoid Chrysanthemums, which are seen as funeral flowers, red flowers,which are only to be given to a lover, and yellow flowers, which symbolise anger. In Italy gifts are thought of as quite important, and an Italian will spend time looking at your gift - to put a gift away in a corner shortly after receiving it is thought of as very disrespectful. Therefore, it is best to buy a good quality gift, such as nice chocolates or an expensive wine. Do not wrap it in black or purple paper, as this is seen as unlucky.

, Only sit down once you have been invited to do so, and only get up to leave the table when the host does so. Take small portions - if you want more, you can go back for a second helping. As in most European countries, the knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left. When eating you should remember not to make a mess of the plate, and not leave more than a very small amount once you are finished. Offer the host to help take the dishes away (though they will usually decline, it is a polite formality).

, It is thought of as bad taste to tell rude or offensive jokes, or tell any jokes on sad occasions.

, Child or adult, you should show respect to elders.

Do you enjoy going on hikes together, swimming, or visiting new places? Listing some of these on a piece of paper will help you narrow down a list of potential places.Here are some common types of places to plan a vacation:


A beach. The beach has a number of obvious attractions for families. Playing in the sand and rolling waves will provide hours of entertainment for your kids while you will be able enjoy lying in the sun with a great book.
A lake. If you are in a more landlocked location, a lake can also provide an excellent water destination for your family. You can teach your children how to use a canoe or kayak while also enjoying the beautiful scenery surrounding the lake.
The mountains. If your family loves to hike and learn more about nature, a vacation in the mountains can be a wonderful opportunity to grow closer as a family.
A city. If you want to experience museums, inspiring architecture, and new restaurants, then a city can be an excellent vacation destination.
A cruise. A cruise can also be a great option, especially for families, since many cruises provide shows and group activities for kids.An amusement or water park. These will be a big hit with your kids, but you should make sure you will have things to do that will interest you as well.;
, Often your budget will determine how you will pick your destination. A beach vacation in the U.S. can often be more affordable than a beach vacation in another country. Some things that you will need to budget for include:


Transportation costs (airplane, train, or gas money). Be sure you factor in the price of a ticket for each member of your family. If you plan to rent a car or take taxis once you arrive, you should count this in as well.
Accommodation. Hotels are a common option, but if you have a larger family, you might want to consider renting a house, condo or cabin.
Food. You will probably have to account for the cost of eating out in a restaurant, but staying in a place with a kitchen will help you save money here.
Entertainment. If you plan to attend amusement parks, shows, concerts, or museums, you will have to budget the cost of these tickets for your family.

, Summer is a popular time for family vacation due to school schedules, but it is not the only option. Spring break and winter vacation are also good times to plan a vacation.


Generally, the cheapest time of year to travel is in the three weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas (the two most expensive holiday travel dates). But this can be a tricky time of year for your kids, especially if they are in high school and have final exams or end-of-year activities like holiday concerts. Make sure you clear your schedule with your children's academic calendar if you plan to travel in this period.Travel to popular destinations is cheaper when the conditions are a little less than ideal. Most places in the northern hemisphere will be most expensive during the summer. You will generally find better deals to travel to Europe in the fall or the ski slopes in the late spring because these are not the ideal times of the year to visit these places.If you plan to take to your children out in the middle of the school year, be sure to plan ahead. Talk to your children's teachers as far ahead of time as possible so you child can complete their work ahead of time.
Do not plan to take your child out during a time when they have to take a standardized tests. These can be very hard to reschedule for your children.

, If you are planning on purchasing plane tickets, be sure to buy them well in advance to get the best fares. You should aim to purchase them roughly 6-8 weeks before you plan to leave.Remember that kids under two years old can fly for free, but you will have to hold them in your lap for the entire flight.Compare airfares on web sites like Kayak and Skyscanner. Comparing prices will ensure that you find the best deal at the best time. Southwest often has competitive prices, so you can check their web site for daily deals as well.
Tuesday and Wednesday are generally the cheapest days to fly whereas Friday and Sunday are the most expensive.Keep in mind airline limits on luggage; most airlines limit your luggage to two checked pieces of luggage and one carry on bag per person. Encourage your children to pack lightly; the last thing you want to worry about it cumbersome luggage.

, You should scout around and compare prices at different hotels. You can also find rental homes and condos on web sites like VRBO, HomeAway and AirBnB.


Consider various factors in your accommodation. Is it in a central location where you can walk to different things or will you need to rent a car or take a cab? Does it have a kitchen where you can prepare meals?
Check the reviews for your accommodation on-line. Does the hotel appear to be clean and safe?
You might also include booking a reservation at an all-inclusive resort. These places will generally provide all your meals and drinks in the price of your accommodation so you won't have to leave the resort.

, You may need to book other activities in advance, especially if they tend to sell out. Look into buying theater tickets, theme park passes, or tickets for sightseeing tours.Get your kids' input into what they would like to do. If your kids have time to plan and think about how they would like to spend their time, they will generally feel more involved and cooperative with the vacation.Consider if your hotel or resort provides activities for kids, like shows, games or scavenger hunts., If you are traveling overseas by air, your child needs a passport, regardless of his or her age. If you child is under 16, you must apply for your child's passport in person at a local passport agency and you must bring your child with you, as well as supporting documentation..

The following steps are for citizens in the USA but can be used as a guide if you live in a different country:

Application form DS-11, found here: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/212239.pdf Fill it out but don't sign it until you are at the passport agency.
One 2x2 inch color photo of your child taken within the past six months.
A certified birth certificate which proves your relationship to your child as well as your partner's relationship to the child.
Proof of your identity and your partner's identity (like a passport or driver's license). Make two copies of each of these documents.
If your child's other guardian cannot be present at the passport agency with you and your child, they must sign the parental consent form giving their permission for the child to receive a passport.If you are a single parent, you must provide proof of sole authority, such as court order granting you sole legal custody or a death certificate of your former spouse if you are a widow.$120 for the passport application fee for a minor (under 16) and the expediting fee to process the application. Passport agencies will accept credit cards, debit cards, check, money orders and cash in exact change., Half the battle of vacation is arriving at your destination. This can be tricky, especially if you have kids.


For airline travelers, prepare as much as you can in advance. Print your boarding passes out at home so you do not have to stand in an extra line at the airport before checking your bags.Discuss with your kids ahead of time what it will be like to go to the airport, especially if it is their first time flying or they don't remember flying as an infant. Explain that they will have to take off their shoes and any jackets when they go through security. They will need to put their bags and any toys into bins and push them through the conveyor belt at security.Discuss how it will be crowded at the airport and they need to remain by your side at all times.Use a backpack for your carry-on item. A backpack will keep your hands free as you go through the airport, making it easier for you to keep your children close to you.
Prepare for security. If you are traveling with a car seat or stroller, these will both need to go through security and there is a likelihood that you will need to check this at the gate of your flight, as opposed to keeping them in your overhead bin on the plane.
Remember that the TSA's 3oz limitation on liquids, gels and aerosols for carry-ons does not apply to breast milk, baby food or formula. You can pack as much of these as you need to get to your destination.Bring toys and games to keep your kids occupied. Great portable toys include coloring books, stickers, magnets, and games that don't require small pieces.
Make sure your kids know that the must listen to their headphones or mute the sound on any electronic device that they use during the flight.Make sure you pack plenty of snacks to take on the flight such as nuts, dried fruit, and Cheerios. While you won't be able to bring bottles of water with you to the airport, you should purchase a bottle in case your kids get thirsty or drink more than any complimentary drinks served on the flight., For closer destinations, you might find it easier and cheaper to drive than to fly. But driving can take a toll on even the best behaved kid. Here are some tips for keeping your kids occupied during a long drive:


Plan strategic stops. Make everyone goes to the bathroom before you all get into the car, even if they don't think they need to. From there, you should plan to stop every couple hours to accommodate the diverse bladder needs of all passengers.If you have a short road trip, try to plan your departure around your child's sleeping schedule. For instance, if they normally take a nap right after lunch, try leaving at around the same time. Your child will most likely spend the majority of the trip sleeping.Keep your documents organized. On a road trip, you should keep all relevant documents together, including maps, hotel or camping reservations, pamphlets for sightseeing stops, a list of potential restaurants to stop at. You can keep everything in a binder under your seat.Give your kids a surface to work with. Bring along a cookie tray or small lap desk for each child so they can draw with coloring books and crayons, play with puzzles or blocks, toys, etc. This will help keep them occupied.Plan a scavenger hunt. If you are planning on stopping at a few different sites while on the road, give your kids a scavenger hunt for each stop. Find pictures on-line of things at each site (like a statue, a particular building, or a famous tree), print them out, and then give them to your kids to find.Reward your kids for good behavior. Before you embark on your journey, bring a few rolls of different coins -- quarters, nickels, dimes -- and give them to your kids whenever they do something good, like sharing a toy with their sibling or when they finish reading a book. That money can then be used for them to buy a souvenir at their destination.Consider giving them glow-in-the-dark toys to use when you travel in the car at night.

, Once you have arrived, try to not over plan your days.


Aim to complete just one or two major activities or outings every day (like going to a zoo or aquarium). The number of activities you do will depend on your kid's age and stamina, but don't cram too many things into one day. You should budget plenty of relaxation time between sightseeing or other physical activities.Remember that the hottest hours of the day during the summer are from 10:00am-2:00pm. These might not be the best times for your kids to do very strenuous outdoors activities (like hiking or running).
Keep an open, flexible mind. If your children become irritable or cranky, don't force them to do an activity simply because it was on the agenda.

, Ask your kids to collect memorable items from your trip such as ticket stubs, candy wrappers from their favorite sweet shop, sea shells, even a little jar of dirt or sand from your favorite beach., As a family, you might feel compelled to do all the same activities together. But you should feel open to breaking up into groups based on different interests.


For example, if you and your daughter would like to go shopping, but your spouse and son would like to take a surfing lesson, then you should feel alright about breaking apart for a short time.

, If you would like to enjoy a nice dinner out with your spouse, many hotels offer baby sitting services that you can use for your date night.


If you travel with another couple and their kids, you can also switch off baby sitting duties.

Do a little research to find out when airfare and other expenses will be the cheapest, then carve out a time that fits your personal calendar, decide how many days you want to stay and try to work around the pricier seasonal tourism.Resort fees tend to be highest during busier times of year like late spring, the height of summer and toward the winter holidays.
The weather in Hawaii is warm and hospitable year-round, making it possible to enjoy a tropical vacation on your own schedule.;
, Look into places to stay that are big enough for the number of people that are going. There’s an abundance of places to stay across the Hawaiian isles, from cozy bed and breakfasts to full-fledged resorts complete with amenities. Take into consider your budget and the distance from your accommodations to the things you want to see and do, then call or get online ahead of time and make reservations.When traveling with a big group or young children, it will most likely be easier to snag a couple of rooms at a larger hotel chain for the sake of space and affordability. Some resorts even offer amenities just for kids, like special games and play areas, educational activities and appearances by their favorite animated characters.
Consider renting condos, villas or private Airbnb residences for short-term stays if you plan on making multiple stops., Once you’ve decided on the best time to go, buy a plane ticket for each member of your party. Double-check to make sure the times of departure and arrival fit your own timetable and your flight details are correct. If possible, try to fly directly to the island you’ve chosen to visit in order to avoid multiple connecting flights or long layovers.Shop around online for special deals on airfare.Plan on flying out in between peak travel seasons. Things tend to be less crowded in early spring and the tail end of summer, which means they’ll also be less expensive.You’ll need to carry your passport to enter Hawaii, unless you’re traveling from inside the United States., Some essential items you’ll want to bring along include t-shirts, shorts or skirts, tennis shoes, sandals, sunglasses and a swimsuit or two. Be sure you bring enough clothes to last you the whole trip and allow you to dress for different activities and occasions.Don’t forget to load up on beach accessories like towels, sunscreen, an umbrella and any toys or sporting equipment you want to have with you.
Hawaii is a very laid back, casual place, so don’t worry about packing anything too fancy. A simple collared shirt or dress will usually be enough for an outing at even the ritziest places on the isle., Stake out a patch for your clan among the dunes, then kick back and spend your day basking in the sand and sunshine. Some people prefer the relaxed atmosphere of the beaches and nearby restaurants and shops to always being on the go. And there couldn’t be a more perfect place for it—the weather in Hawaii is warm, sunny and inviting all year long.In addition to getting a tan, you’ll also find opportunities to go snorkeling, kayaking, windsurfing, or play a few games of beach volleyball.Bring extra sunscreen, and maybe some snacks, if you intend stay out on the beach all day.

, Transportation in Hawaii is set of up to make jetting around the nearby isles fast and easy. Depending on the length of your stay, you might find time to visit popular tourist destinations like Maui and Oahu or stop by older, more rustic islands like Lanai or Kauai. Many of these smaller islands are less commercialized and offer a glimpse of traditional island life. There’s always something new to see no matter where you go.Work these stops into your travel schedule in advance to ensure that you’re not rushed.For shorter vacations (a week or less), limit your island-hopping to one or two places, or else you could spend more time packing up and commuting than actually sightseeing., Of course there’s also a long list of sights to see and fun to be had. Plan a day trip or two during your time in the Pacific to go horseback riding down the coast, hire a helicopter tour for an overhead view of the islands’ beautiful vistas or take an exhilarating ride on a zipline. Just make sure you have enough room in your schedule. You could spend months in Hawaii and only see a small part of what all it has to offer!Take a poll within your group to find out what activities everyone is interested in, then narrow down a list of adventures that you’ll have time to fit in.

, You’ve got to eat, so you might as well do it in style. Polynesian cooking has a rich and diverse history, incorporating native ingredients like fresh seafood, pineapple, coconut and sweet potatoes as well as foreign influences such as barbecue, Portuguese sweet breads and east Asian dishes. Savor five-star dining experience at a renowned bistro, pay admission for a pig roast or simply pop down the street and grab some fish tacos for a couple of bucks.Browse travel and dining websites for restaurant recommendations and reviews.Give local favorites like poi, poke and Spam Musubi a shot.Calculating a food budget before you depart can help you plan your meals.

, One of the most celebrated parts of Hawaiian culture is the luau, a large party or feast that usually takes place right on the beach. In many cases, it’s possible to book admission to a luau directly through the hotel or resort where you’re staying. At these events, you can expect to find an array of scrumptious foods, along with traditional entertainment like live music and hula and fire dancing. Don’t miss out—a luau could be the most fun you have on the whole trip!Luaus are also often hosted by Polynesian cultural and historical centers, where they are designed to showcase the ritual character of the Hawaiian people.
This may be one of your only opportunities to savor authentic kalua, a time-honored method of cooking that involves wrapping succulent meats in banana or taro leaves and roasting them over hot coals dug into the ground., Set aside a day to visit museums and local sites of historical significance. All of Hawaii’s outlying islands have a fascinating story to tell, dating back long before their induction into American statehood. You and your loved ones will be able to learn about rulers and legends of times long past as you roam the lush, beautiful landscapes of the countryside, and leave with a deeper respect and understanding of the island and its inhabitants.


Tour important military landmarks like Pearl Harbor or the U.S. Army Museum in Waikiki.To get the full benefit of an educational jaunt, plan on seeing multiple islands. Each is a treasure trove with its own unique history and customs.

, Hawaii, and the island of Oahu in particular, contains a wealth of mountains just waiting to be explored by eager adventurists. If you’re looking for a change of pace from sunbathing, strap on a pair of boots and hit the trails. There are miles and miles of ground to traverse that cut through dense jungles, rise into the clouds and even circle around dormant volcanoes.If you plan on doing any hiking, take along a small backpack filled with bottled water, sunscreen, bug spray and your phone or camera for capturing the breathtaking views you’ll encounter.
Long hikes may be too difficult for young kids, but there are many shorter treks to choose from as well.

, What tropical escape would be complete without catching a wave or two? Those who are up for it can easily find equipment for rent or take some quick lessons from a local surfing instructor and try their hand at hanging ten. The waves in the Pacific are world famous, so whether you’re a daredevil chasing a big-wave ride or it’s your first time on a board, there’s a good time awaiting you.Surfing is ingrained in Hawaiian culture, which means it’s something that you owe it to yourself to try at least once on your trip.
No matter where you stay, you’ll be able to take your pick of any number of spots to paddle out to and get radical."

Decide how to get there.,
Where to Sleep


The best advice on where to stay is to check hotel rooms and rates early, a few months in advance.,
""I Forgot""


It's a bummer when you find out that you forgot something important and have to spend money on an item like, a bathing suit, or shampoo.,
Mealtime


An expensive, but fun pastime during vacation is eating out.",How to Plan a Family Vacation On a Budget," Assuming that by now you have your destination already picked out, how are you going to get there? Gas prices are near four dollars a gallon, and plane tickets are expensive, not to mention the very strict rules as to what you can and cannot take on board.


International train travel. Amtrak is the national rail company in the United States. In Europe, consider buying Eurail (for non-EU citizens) or Interrail (for EU citizens) international rail passes.






International coach travel. In the United States, Greyhound provide bus travel. In Europe, Eurolines provide a pass to cover travel between more than 45 European cities. Megabus provide intercity bus travel in North America and Europe.






International ship/ferry travel. Cruises can be cheap if you consider accommodation and meals are included. Cunard operate transatlantic cruises. TheCruisePeople compare cruise prices.






If you Drive. Instead of eating your meals at McDonald's on your way to Vacation, pack a cooler of food. You can buy a cooler and a weeks worth of sandwich stuff for around 25-35 dollars. Get a tune up, they can be expensive but a Tune up will help keep your car fuel efficient and could possibly save your life. Budget at least $20 over what you think you'll be paying in gas.






If you Fly. Travelocity, or other Internet sites like Expedia can help with finding a cheap rate. Flying at odd hours will ensure a cheaper ticket! When traveling around Europe book your plane for around midnight because those flights offer the lower rates. Whatever airline you book with, look up their site as well and see what their rules are as far as carry on material and flight exchanges or cancellations. You might be able to get a cheaper rate through the airline than through Travelocity, and you can save even more money by bringing food with your carry on, so long as they allow it. In flight snacks are expensive so if you can, pack your own.





;
,






The earlier you book a room the cheaper the rate.






Also try to book in their off season, many Hotels will have cheaper rates when they don't expect a lot of reservations to be coming in.







, Granted these items can be cheap, but its better not to have to spend money on them.






Here's what you do to make sure you don't forget anything. Do a walk through of your home and write down all the things you use for personal hygiene, and things you will want to have on your vacation. Tape the list to the top of the suitcase, and the day of your flight... start packing.






Once you know, that everything on the list is in the suitcase... rip up the list. Its easy and It's a fairly good way to make sure you got everything.







,






Plan your meals ahead of time.






Budget your money and if you can, eat out everyday, if you can afford it.






If you can't, look at your monthly food bill, and estimate how much it will cost for you and your family to eat for the amount of time on the vacation. Then either pack a cooler to take with you, or plan on going shopping at a store near the hotel and fixing picnic-like meals in the room.






Try to set money aside for at least one meal out at a restaurant, and if you do, make sure it's a place that isn't common to your hometown.






Make it something different and something fun.

Bring a book (or two).,
Pack something to draw with.,
Consider bringing games.,
Bring good napping supplies.",How to Pack when Traveling by Train2," Most train rides are fairly long, meaning that you'll have a lot of time to kill. This is a great opportunity for reading - either for pleasure, or for schoolwork. Choose one or two books to bring with you on the train ride, and keep them in your personal bag (not your luggage). You'll then have the opportunity over the whole ride to read and/or study.

, There's something romantic about the idea of drawing the scenery out the window as you drive by on a train. Whether you're an artist at heart or just looking to kill time, drawing is a great way to do it. Bring a sketchbook and a drawing pencil, along with any other drawing tools you might enjoy. You'll be able to draw to your heart's content, and you'll have a memento from your trip to look back on later.

, If you're traveling with more than one person, bringing a card game for the ride might be a good option. Games are a great way to distract yourself from the boredom of a long trip, and they make the time seem to go by much faster. Traveling by yourself? You can still bring a deck of cards to play a game like Solitaire, or bring a trivia card game and quiz yourself while you travel.

, Sometimes, a long train ride begs for nothing more than a good nap. However, trains aren't always the most comfortable, making napping difficult. Consider wearing a scarf or another head-wrap to use as a makeshift pillow, or bring a neck pillow for relaxing. You'll probably want headphones and some music too, to block out the sounds of a busy train car.

Decide who to invite.,
Decide how many cabins you’ll need.,
Calculate how many nights you want to stay.,
Decide if you want an isolated cabin or a community cabin.,
Decide whether you want a rustic or a modern cabin.,
Think about what kind of activities you’ll do.,
Plan your outings.",How to Plan a Cabin Getaway1," Who do you imagine going with you on your cabin getaway? This important question can affect the quality of your cabin adventure. If you have a family, you might choose to limit the getaway to just you, your partner, and the kids. On the other hand, you might want to invite another family to accompany you on the getaway.If you are in a relationship but don’t have kids (or if you do, but want to take some time away from the kids), you could plan a cabin getaway with your significant other. Perhaps the two of you might want to invite another couple.
Finally, you might want to go alone. Relaxing by yourself for a few weeks in a cabin getaway can be refreshing and enjoyable.
There is no wrong answer when deciding who to invite and who not to invite on your cabin getaway. Think about your reason for taking the cabin getaway before deciding who to bring along.;
, Your answer to the first big planning decision – who to invite – will prepare you to figure out how many cabins you’ll need. The number of cabins you’ll need to rent will also vary depending on the size and number of beds there are in each cabin. For instance, if you and your partner are renting a cabin for just the two of you, you’ll only need one cabin. But if you and your partner are both inviting your parents, you’ll probably need three small (one-room) cabins.Some cabins are very large and have multiple bedrooms. In such a case, you’d need to figure out how many rooms you’ll need and rent the appropriate number of cabins based on the cabins’ accessibility.

, Talk to everyone you’ve invited to the cabin getaway. How much time do they have to share with you? Remember, most cabin rental agencies require stays of at least two nights or more depending on the time of year. Call the cabin rental agency you’re interested in booking with to find out what the minimum number of nights you can book is.It’s okay if the rest of your friends can’t arrive at the cabin at the same time as you. It’s also okay if they – or you – don’t leave at the exact same time. For instance, if your friends can only spend five days with you instead of the full six days you’ll be at the cabin, just have them meet you there (or tell them it’s no problem if they leave early, depending on your schedules).

, Isolated, rustic cabins are tucked away in a natural setting. Alternatively, you could rent a cabin in a resort community, where rows of small cabins sit neatly along a shoreline or in a mountain valley.If you’re heading out alone, or if it’s just you and your partner on your cabin getaway, you might prefer one of the more solitary cabins.
If you’re in a big group of friends or family, though, you might want to stay in a resort community where everyone can have their own cabin but still stay in close proximity to each other.

, A truly rustic cabin might not have indoor plumbing or electricity. A more modern cabin will, along with (possibly) wi-fi and a television. Decide how much you want to “rough it” when planning your cabin getaway, and choose the cabin that suits the needs of you and your group.

, Choosing the right cabin getaway depends in large part on what you want to do during your getaway. Do you want to go swimming? Rent a cabin on the Great Lakes. Do you want to hike or climb mountains? Try a cabin in the Adirondacks. If you want to do seasonal activities like ski or snowboard, you’ll need to organize your cabin getaway during the winter season., In addition to the self-guided activities you should plan for yourself during the cabin getaway, you should also consider what activities you want to do in the area. For instance, some cabins are located near caves where you can go spelunking. Others are located on lakes where you could rent a jet ski.If you’re unsure what activities and outings are near your cabin, contact the rental agency or landlord.
Popular cabin rental agencies can be found at https://www.tripping.com/cabins.
Schedule the activities you want to do ahead of time.

"
Know your rental agency’s rules.,
Look for deals.,
Find ways to save.",How to Plan a Cabin Getaway2," Every cabin rental company has its own policies regarding cancellations, pricing, and hidden costs. Ask lots of questions before booking you cabin getaway. For instance, many rental agencies won’t allow you to cancel within 30 days of the scheduled rental date. Other agencies charge cleaning fees of up to $100.Before booking, be sure you understand what the total package will cost. Ask the landlord or agency representative, “Are there any fees or surcharges beyond the rental cost?”
You might also inquire, “What is the cancellation policy?”

, During the off-season, cabin rentals are cheaper than they are during the peak season. Shop around for the right cabin when planning your cabin getaway. Most top destinations offer more than one cabin rental option, and prices can vary significantly. Look around for the one that best suits your needs and budget. You might also be able to get a deal by booking for a certain number of nights. For instance, if it’s $50 per night for up to four nights, but $40 per night if you rent for five nights or more, you might want to extend your cabin getaway to at least five nights, since you’ll be spending the same amount of money for an extra day.

, If the cabin you’re really interested in renting is a large cabin with several bedrooms, it’s impractical and expensive to rent it by yourself. If you’re amenable to inviting family or friends to your cabin getaway, you can save money by dividing the costs of the cabin between you."

Plan things to do.,
Think about what kind of food you want.,
Think about the gear you’ll need.,
Pack a small dining set.,
Pack the right clothing.",How to Plan a Cabin Getaway3," Do you want to challenge your friend to a game of checkers? Don’t forget the checkerboard. Would you like to catch up on your reading? Bring a good book or – if you have electricity – an e-book reader. Whatever you want to have during your cabin getaway, write it on a list and pack it before you leave. Other things you might want to bring include:a guitar
a laptop
a badminton set
art supplies

, Make a list of anything you want to have during you cabin getaway. Do you want to have a wiener roast? Bring hot dogs, buns, and condiments. Does the cabin have clean running water? If not, you’ll need to bring a few gallons of bottled water.Find out from the rental agency or landlord if refrigeration is available at your cabin. If it is not, you should plan on bringing only foods that do not need refrigeration.

, Most people spend at least some of their time outdoors if they head out on a cabin getaway. Equip yourself for being outside by bringing folding chairs, backpacks and hiking gear, a flashlight, and bug spray. Don’t forget firestarter materials like matches and newspapers for kindling. Other handy tools like a Swiss army knife and a small hand-axe could also prove useful. And of course, you should always have a first-aid kit on hand.If the weather is hot, pack a small fan. If it’s cold, bring a portable heater.

, It’s best to bring a small set of plates and just wash them after each meal. If you’re renting a private vacation cabin directly from a landlord, it will probably be stocked with plates and some basic cooking ingredients. If you’re renting a cabin from a larger housing resort, however, the cabin will probably be totally bare of even the most basic cooking ingredients, plates, and cutlery.Bring plates that you don’t mind getting chipped and cracked. Whenever you travel with fragile plates, there’s a chance they could be ruined.
Some people like to use disposable plates and cutlery, but this creates needless waste.

, If you’re headed out for a cabin getaway in the dead of winter, you’ll need to pack quite differently than if your cabin getaway is scheduled for the summer. Think about what clothes you’ll be comfortable in during your cabin getaway and pack appropriately.Even during warmer months, it’s best to bring a few sweaters and pants for cooler nights or overcast days.

Choose resorts such as Cozumel and Cancun if you want to stay near the Gulf of Mexico or on the eastern side of the country.

, You will probably want to go to the beach, but other interests might dictate where in Mexico you choose to travel.


Select a tourist-friendly area such as Playa del Carmen or Cabo if you want a lot of nightlife and enough amenities at the hotel that you rarely have to leave the resort.
Travel to a beach with less tourists and more history if you want. Tulum has celebrated beaches as well as access to Mayan ruins and nature preserves. Puerto Vallarta offers sightseeing, shopping and Los Arcos--a dramatic oceanside row of arches.

, Most cruise lines such as Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Princess offer cruises with several stops at Mexican ports.


Making Reservations for a Beach Vacation to Mexico

, Decide how much you can spend on things such as airfare, lodging, food and entertainment.

, Many destinations offer deals that include airfare, hotel and sometime extras such as meals and transportation to and from the airport.


Check for popular Mexican beach vacation packages with Westin Hotels, Barcelo Hotels and Resorts, Oasis Hotels and Palace Resorts.

, If you decide to book airfare and hotel separately, check online travel sites such as Expedia, Hotwire, Priceline, Kayak and Orbitz for competitive air and hotel prices.

, While Mexico only requires a picture ID to get into the country, the United States requires a passport for travel between the U.S. and Mexico.

,


Remember to confirm your reservations before you leave for your trip.

, Pack your passports, itinerary, confirmation and flight numbers and any directions you might need to your hotel.;
, The climate at most Mexican beaches is hot and sunny most of the year.

Sign up for a basic physics class at a local college.",How to Understand Classical Physics," Newton’s first law tells us that any object in motion will continue to move in the same direction with the same speed unless another force acts on it to change its motion. If an object is stationary, it will remain stationary.This first law is sometimes referred to as the law of inertia.This law states that an object moves with a constant velocity (speed and direction) unless there is a nonzero (unbalanced) net force acting on it. An object that is not moving has a net force of zero acting on it.;
, As the force acting on an object increases, the acceleration of the object increases. Force alone does not determine the acceleration of an object; the object’s mass also plays a critical role. The larger the mass of an object, the slower it will accelerate.This relationship can be explained using the formula F = ma where “F” is the force acting on the object, “m” is the mass of the object, and “a” is the acceleration of the object.
Another way to think about this law is that an object will not accelerate unless there is an unbalanced (or net) force acting on it., The third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.When a force acts on an object, there is a force of the exact same magnitude that pushes back in the opposite direction to the original force.


For example, when you sit down on a bench, you are exerting a downward force on the bench, but the bench is exerting an equal upward force on you.This law states that all forces come in pairs.

, Conservation of energy states that “energy can be neither created nor destroyed.” In other words, energy remains constant in an isolated system. The same goes for momentum and angular momentum: in an isolated system momentum and angular momentum remain constant.It’s important to note that an isolated system is one in which there are no outside forces acting on it. In reality, an isolated system doesn’t really exist, but it is a useful model to describe the basic principles of the physical laws of nature.

, There are four basic equations that describe the motion of an object in terms of time (t), velocity (vf: final velocity; vi: initial velocity), acceleration (a), and displacement (d).These are known as the kinematic equations and can be rearranged in various ways to solve for the desired variable.Being able to derive these equations on your own will solidify your understanding of these concepts.


Recreate some basic physics labs at home and try to derive the equations from the data you have collected.
The basic kinematics equations are:

d = vit + ½at2

vf2 = vi2 + 2ad
vf = vi + at
d = (vi + vf)/2 * t



, A vector is a quantity commonly used in math and physics that has both a magnitude and a direction.The magnitude defines the “length” of the motion. When talking about velocity, the magnitude is the speed the object is moving. The direction the object moves defines the second component of the vector, direction.


When objects are in motion they generally move in one direction at a specific rate. They may be moving at a constant velocity or accelerating, but in either case, the motion is said to have both a magnitude and direction; therefore, its motion is a vector., Physics can be very abstract, but the best way to get to the root of the problem is to draw it out. Sketch a basic picture of what’s happening in the problem described and then add in all of the forces that exist.Forces are vectors so remember to draw them using an arrow with both a magnitude and direction.
Don’t forget about unseen forces such as the force of gravity, the friction force, and the normal force (the force that acts against an object resting on it)., The best way to learn something is to dive right in. Try your hand at some basic problems to check your understanding. To solve any problem draw the diagram, write the givens, determine what you’re solving for and apply the correct equation to solve for your unknown.For example: Find the distance it takes for a car traveling at 25 m/s to stop using an acceleration of -9 m/s2.
Sketch a picture of the car, drawing arrows to represent the direction of travel.
Write down the knowns: vf = 0 m/s, vi = 25 m/s, a = -9 m/s2, d = ?
Identify the relevant equation: vf2 = vi2 + 2ad
Plug in the knowns: 02 = 252 + 2(-9)(d)
Solve for d: d = (02 - 252)/-18 = 34.72 m
The car traveled 34.72 meters before stopping.

, If you really want to dive into classical physics, buy a beginner’s textbook and start reading.Simply reading the concepts will not be enough to really understand. You must also review the sample problems and try your hand at some of the questions at the end of each chapter.


Take the time to process the derivations of the basic equations of motion and truly understand why they work before you move onto the next concept.

, Reading a textbook on your own might not be enough for you to gain the depth of knowledge you’d like in physics. There are many open courseware and online courses you can take related to physics.Many of these courses have assignments to check your understanding and forums to discuss the work.


These types of courses are also easy to fit into your schedule as you can work on the material when you have the time.

, Physics is a subject best learned through hands-on activities and solving practice problems. Do some basic experimenting and see if you can derive the equations based on your data. Answer all of the questions at the end of each chapter and check your solutions.


Seek out more problem sets online for concepts that are more troublesome than others.
Physics builds upon itself, so continue to do practice problems until you feel that you have mastered the concept before moving on to the next one.

, If you work best in a classroom setting, check out the courses available at your local community college. Choose a course with a well-rated professor during a time that fits well into your schedule. Taking a course just because you’re curious about the material can be really fun and you’ll be more likely to focus on the work and truly learn the subject.


Take advantage of office hours and open lab times to discuss concepts that may be causing you trouble.

Plan some visits to non-dark sites and/or downtime for your trip.,
Pack appropriately for your trip based on weather conditions for the location in that season and length of stay.,
If you are traveling by automobile, make sure that your vehicle is in shape for the trip, especially if traveling long distances.

",How to Plan a Dark Tour or Halloween Vacation," Whether friends or family, they should have an interest in the subject matter of the tour. It can be an unpleasant experience for them, yourself and anyone else along if one person is uncomfortable with the nature of the locations being visited.;
, This will further generate interest and can be fun in its own right. Besides, with more than one person researching the trip, you are more likely to turn up a location or opportunity that would have been otherwise missed.

, A geographical location can be chosen based on proximity to home, a specific point of interest, density of dark locations, other non-dark tourist features that may also appeal (you can always take a break from Salem’s witches to go whale watching), or any number of other reasons an area might appeal. Picking a theme for a dark journey can be satisfying for someone with specific interests. Themes can range from something simple/general such as Halloween events/festivals and haunted locations to complex/specific such as visiting sites of political assassinations or places that were used in the filming of horror movies.

, Utilize the internet, books, magazines, DVDs, etc. to perform your research.

,, For example: Amityville, NY and Burkittsville, Maryland are not pleased with the attention brought to them by the films ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Blair Witch Project."" You may wish to reconsider your trip if the location isn’t friendly to this form of tourism.

, Finding out the cost of guided tours, museum admissions, and other attraction costs will help with planning the budget for the trip.

, Another handy thing to know for your trip budget. It pays to look into surrounding areas. For example: The demand for hotel rooms in Salem, MA in the month of October drives the price up and makes it prohibitively expensive for some folks. However the city of Danvers has average-priced lodging while only being 15 minutes away (it also has quite a few locations tied to the Salem Witch Trials…including the actual execution site).

, What can you expect to find there? Some locations of interest are not oriented for tourism. Some may in fact be sore points with the local community. They may have been torn down or altered over the years due to either natural change or a community’s need to have an infamous crime scene removed due to a need to heal and move on from the unpleasantness.

, Some locations have events that only occur on specific days of the week or year. Do you wish to visit on the anniversary of a particular event associated with the location? Visiting some locations near an anniversary or during the Halloween season may lead to dealing with crowds, lines and other associated drawbacks of peak time for a particular location. However, it may also feature tourist opportunities unavailable during non-peak time, such as guided tours limited to specific times of year, festivals, etc.

, Print out maps from websites which allow you to get directions from one location to the next.

, This is especially important if you are traveling with people who are not as into the subject matter of the dark locations as you. It can also be a good idea to plan breaks and visits to more lighthearted locations to avoid becoming depressed if the area you are visiting might bring yourself or other travelers down. Taking a guided tour of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland or visiting the site of the former World Trade Center in New York City may affect you in ways you don’t plan for. Also, you are on vacation…you should plan time to relax and not burn yourself out by trying to cram in too many locations/activities.

, Make sure to bring your camera or camcorder to capture the moment. Take into account the luggage of fellow travelers if the trip is by automobile.

Rewrite acceleration and velocity in terms of position and rearrange terms to set the equation to 0.


mx¨+bx˙+kx=0{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}+b{\dot {x}}+kx=0}

This is still a second-order linear constant coefficient equation, so we use the usual methods. 


,
Solve for the equation of motion.,
Go through the three cases.,
Simplify.,
Rewrite the solution in terms of the decay time τ{\displaystyle \tau } and damped angular frequency ωd{\displaystyle \omega _{d}}.",How to Solve the Classical Harmonic Oscillator," This object is resting on a frictionless floor, and the spring follows Hooke's law F=−kx.{\displaystyle F=-kx.}

Newton's second law says that the magnitude of a force is proportional to the object's acceleration F=ma.{\displaystyle F=ma.} When the spring is being pulled to an excited state, i.e. out of equilibrium, the object experiences a restoring force that tends to bring it back to equilibrium. At the instant the spring reaches its equilibrium point, however, the object is traveling at its greatest speed. The spring therefore undergoes an oscillatory motion, and because we assume the floor is frictionless (no damping), it exhibits simple harmonic motion.

Newton's law only indirectly relates the position of an object to the force acting on it through a second derivative, because a=d2xdt2.{\displaystyle a={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}x}{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}.}

When dealing with time derivatives, physicists often use Newton's notation for derivatives, where the number of dots corresponds to the number of time derivatives. For example, a=x¨.{\displaystyle a={\ddot {x}}.}
;
, The equation is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. In our system, the forces acting perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object (the weight of the object and the corresponding normal force) cancel out. Therefore, the only force acting on the object when the spring is excited is the restoring force. This means that we equate the two together to obtain F=ma=−kx.{\displaystyle F=ma=-kx.} 
,,

Set up the characteristic equation.


mr2+k=0{\displaystyle mr^{2}+k=0}



Find the roots of the characteristic equation.


r=±kmi{\displaystyle r=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}i}



Then, the solution to the differential equation is as follows.


x(t)=c1cos(kmt)+c2sin(kmt){\displaystyle x(t)=c_{1}\cos \left({\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}\,t\right)+c_{2}\sin \left({\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}\,t\right)}




, While the above expression is true, it is a bit bulky when the solution is written in terms of two trigonometric functions. 

First, we recognize that the square root is the angular frequency of the system, so we can label ω0{\displaystyle \omega _{0}} like so.


ω0=km{\displaystyle \omega _{0}={\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}}



This means that the differential equation can be rewritten in terms of the angular frequency.


x¨+ω02x=0{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}+\omega _{0}^{2}x=0}



Below, A{\displaystyle A} is the amplitude of oscillation, and ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is the phase factor, both dependent on initial conditions. See this article for details on how to rewrite the solution in terms of a phase factor. 


x(t)=Acos⁡(ω0t+ϕ){\displaystyle x(t)=A\cos(\omega _{0}t+\phi )}




, In a system describing a damped harmonic oscillator, there exists an additional velocity-dependent force whose direction is opposite that of motion. This force can be written as F=−bv,{\displaystyle F=-bv,} where b{\displaystyle b} is an experimentally determined constant. With this additional force, force analysis gives ma=−kx−bv.{\displaystyle ma=-kx-bv.} 
,,

Set up the characteristic equation.


mr2+br+k=0{\displaystyle mr^{2}+br+k=0}



Solve the characteristic equation. Use the quadratic formula.


r=−b±b2−4mk2m{\displaystyle r={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4mk}}}{2m}}}



Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation of damped harmonic oscillation is as follows, where we factor out a e−b/2m.{\displaystyle e^{-b/2m}.}


x(t)=e−b/2m(c1eb2−4mk2mt+c2e−b2−4mk2mt){\displaystyle x(t)=e^{-b/2m}\left(c_{1}e^{{\frac {\sqrt {b^{2}-4mk}}{2m}}t}+c_{2}e^{{\frac {-{\sqrt {b^{2}-4mk}}}{2m}}t}\right)} 




, The three cases depend on the value of the value in the exponent, which in turn depends on the discriminant b2−4mk.{\displaystyle b^{2}-4mk.}


b2−4mk>0{\displaystyle b^{2}-4mk>0}

When the discriminant is positive, then the solution is simply a sum of two decreasing exponential functions. This is called an overdamped system. Because this does not describe a harmonic oscillator, we are not interested in this case.




b2−4mk=0{\displaystyle b^{2}-4mk=0}

When the discriminant is 0, then the solution is a decreasing exponential function (c1+c2)e−b/2m.{\displaystyle (c_{1}+c_{2})e^{-b/2m}.} This is called a critically damped system. A mass on a spring in a critically damped system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible and does not oscillate, so we are also not interested in this case.




b2−4mk<0{\displaystyle b^{2}-4mk<0}

When the discriminant is negative, then the solution involves imaginary exponents. This is called an underdamped system, and the mass oscillates. 




, Since in the underdamped case, the roots are complex numbers, we can use Euler's formula to write the solution in terms of sines and cosines. Note the sign change in the square root. 


x(t)=e−b/2m(c1cos(4mk−b22mt)+c2sin(4mk−b22mt)){\displaystyle x(t)=e^{-b/2m}\left(c_{1}\cos \left({\frac {\sqrt {4mk-b^{2}}}{2m}}\,t\right)+c_{2}\sin \left({\frac {\sqrt {4mk-b^{2}}}{2m}}\,t\right)\right)}


,

The decay time τ=2m/b{\displaystyle \tau =2m/b} is the amount of time it takes for the amplitude of the system to decay to 1/e{\displaystyle 1/e} of the initial amplitude. 

The damped angular frequency relates to both the angular frequency (of a corresponding undamped oscillator) and decay time in the following manner, where we bring the 2m{\displaystyle 2m} inside the square root.


ωd=4mk−b24m2=ω02−1τ2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\omega _{d}&={\sqrt {\frac {4mk-b^{2}}{4m^{2}}}}\\&={\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-{\frac {1}{\tau ^{2}}}}}\end{aligned}}}



From previous results, we can therefore write the equation of motion of a damped harmonic oscillator as the following, where A{\displaystyle A} is the initial amplitude and ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is the phase factor, both dependent on initial conditions.


x(t)=Ae−t/τcos⁡(ωdt+ϕ){\displaystyle x(t)=Ae^{-t/\tau }\cos(\omega _{d}t+\phi )}



We can see here that the equation of motion describes an oscillating system, whose envelope is a decreasing exponential function. The rate at which the function decreases and the frequency at which it oscillates are all dependent on the parameters of the system and must be experimentally determined.

Recognize the variables you will be using.,
Familiarize yourself with the symbols used to represent movement in these equations.,
Familiarize yourself with the basic kinematic equations.,
Look at an example of an equation that is not kinematic, but resembles it.,
Look at an example of a kinematic equation.",How to Recognize Kinematics Equations in Physics1," To recognize a kinematic equation, you will need to know the units and variables that will be displayed in the equation. These include:


vf – final velocity
vi – initial velocity
a – acceleration
xf – final position
xi – initial position
t – time;
, There are established kinematic equations that you can learn. Keep in mind that when looking at kinematic equations, there are certain assumptions you must have. These include:


Knowing that the object being described as a constant acceleration
Using a positive sign to represent horizontal motions going to the right, and vertical motions going upwards.
Using the negative sign for movement to the left or downwards.

, It helps to have the following equations memorized so that you can compare other equations, and recognize kinematic equations quickly.Velocity as a function of time: vf = vi + at
Position as a function of velocity and time: xf = xi + 0.5(vi + vf)t
Position as a function of time: xf = xi + vit + 0.5at2

Velocity as a function of position: vf2 = vi2 + 2a(xf – xi)

, For an equation to be considered kinematic, it must contain most or all of the variables listed in the last step of the previous section. It must also mirror one of the equations listed in the previous step. Let’s look at an example:


Take a look at: mv1 + F(t2-t1) = mv2

Let’s look at the variables in this equation: m, v, F, and t. Out of the four, only 2 parameters match those used in kinematic equations. It also does not mirror any of the forms of the equations; therefore this is not a kinematics equation.

, Now let’s look at this example: y = yo + vot - 0.5gt2

The variables used are: y, v, g, and t. Out of the four, only v and t check out. But as we can see, this equation is very much similar with equation 3 of step 1 in terms of form.
The variable y, denotes a vertical position, while g denotes gravity. Gravity has a value of 9.81 m/s2 – and we know that acceleration has a unit of m/s2. We can classify gravity as acceleration.
However, there is no negative sign in , but still we don’t have minus sign in our equation 3. But since we know the a vertical displacement increases as we go up, and we also know that gravity pulls downward, we can assess that the negative sign is there to denote that gravity acts on the opposite direction. So the given equation is indeed a kinematics equation.

Consider the branches of physics.,
Understand the definition of kinematics.,
Consider which standard of measurement you will be working with.,
Be aware that the two parameters of kinematic equations are displacement and time.,
Understand how to find velocity.,
Consider acceleration.",How to Recognize Kinematics Equations in Physics2," Mechanics is a branch of physics that is concerned with the rest or motion of bodies with forces applied to those bodies. There are several subjects that fall under Mechanics: Statics, which is concerned with bodies in equilibrium that are at rest, and Dynamics, which is concerned with bodies also in equilibrium that are moving and/or accelerating.


Under dynamics, we have Kinetics, which is used to analyze the forces that cause motion and finally, Kinematics, which is concerned with the geometric aspects of motion.
As a reminder, the term ‘equilibrium’ refers to the state that an object enters into when all of the forces pushing against the object cancel each other out. This results in the object becoming balanced, or static., Kinematics analyzes how a body will move when a certain force is applied to it, including its motion when it’s accelerating or mounted on an angle. Kinematics provides the basis for higher physics theories as well as engineering principles.

, Standards are used to establish uniformity among units assigned in kinematic equations (in this case distance and time). These standards do not change over time, because they provide a fundamental basis for all scientific calculations. There are many types of standards – the Système Internationale (SI), or the metric system and the English system are one of the most used standards.


The SI assigns meter (m) and seconds (s) as their primary unit for distance and time respectively, while the English systems assigns inches (in) or foot (ft) as its primary unit for distance, and seconds (s) for time.

, Because kinematics equations focus on motion, let’s take a simple example of motion: walking. Imagine yourself walking in a straight path. What parameters do you achieve when you walk? First, you arrive at a certain position away from your initial starting point. You covered a certain distance; we can call this first parameter displacement. Second, you traveled that distance in a certain amount of time, which is our second parameter.Distance and time are the basic building blocks of kinematic equations, but it doesn’t mean that we are finished. Kinematics equations are composed of displacement, time, and their derivatives. Derivative units are composed of the product or quotient of two or more standard units.
For example, if you divide meter by second, you will get meter per second (m/s), which is a derivative unit.

, Velocity is the total displacement divided by total time. Let’s look at the walking example: let’s say, you want to find out how much feet you traveled in a second, but you didn’t measure your displacement every second that you were in motion. To determine velocity:


Measure the total distance that you walked, and divide it by the total time that you were walking. This will result in your velocity.
The equation for velocity is meters divided by seconds, or m/s.

, Acceleration is the speed at which you were traveling during your movement. Determining acceleration can help you to figure out if you traveled faster or slower during a certain period. To find acceleration, you divide the velocity by the time. The equation for acceleration is:



(m/s) / (s) = m/s2.

Determine the distance the runner is to run.,
Set-up the experiment.,
Start the runner and your watch at the same time.,
Stop your watch when the runner crosses the finish line.,
Divide the distance the runner traveled by the number of seconds elapsed.",How to Measure Speed1," This can be done on a running track of a known length, such as 100 m (328 ft), or by staking out the distance on an open field.


Use a measuring tape or a meter stick to measure the distance if you’re in a field.
Mark the starting and ending points with a piece of string or a cone.;
, In order to determine the runner’s speed you need to know the amount of time it takes the runner to travel the set distance. Tell the runner to wait until you say “Go!” to get an accurate reading on the stopwatch. Make sure your stopwatch is set to zero, then have the runner get in position at the start of the measured distance.


You can also use a watch to time the runner, but it will be less accurate.

, To sync up the timing as best as possible, yell “Go!” and start the watch at the same time. If you realize that the timing was off, have the runner reset and try again.

, Watch closely to see when the runner crosses the point designated as the finish line. Be sure to stop the watch as close to the exact moment he crosses as possible.

, This division is the calculation to determine the runner’s speed. The equation for speed is distance traveled/time to travel that distance.Using the example length of 100 m (328 ft), if the runner took 10 seconds to run that distance, the runner's speed would be 100 m (328 ft) divided by 10, or 10 m/sec (32.8 feet per second).


Multiplying 10 m/sec by 3,600 (the number of seconds in an hour), the runner traveled 36,000 meters per hour, or 36 kilometers per hour (1 kilometer equals 1,000 m).
Multiplying 32.8 feet per second by 3,600, the runner traveled 118,080 feet per hour, or 22.4 miles per hour (5,280 feet equals 1 mile).

Find a wall that reflects sound.,
Measure a distance of at least 50 m (54.5 yards) from the wall.,
Clap your hands in time to the echo from the wall.,
Clap your hands 11 times while recording time with the stopwatch.,
Multiply the distance by 10.,
Divide the distance the sound traveled by the amount of time it took to clap.",How to Measure Speed2," A large brick or concrete wall will work well for this experiment. You can test the wall by clapping your hands or yelling and listening for an echo. If you hear a strong echo, it’s a good wall to use., A 50 m (54.5 yd) distance is suggested because it should give you enough time to make accurate measurements. Because you are taking into account the distance the sound will travel from you to the wall and back to you, you are actually measuring a distance of 100 m (109 yd).


Measure the distance with a tape measure. Try to be as accurate as possible with your measurements.

, Stand in front of the wall at the measured distance and clap your hands slowly. You should be able to hear the echo as you do it. Speed up or slow down your clapping rhythm until your clap coincides with the echo from the previous clap.If you are perfectly in sync, you should not hear the echo, but only your clap.

, Have your friend start the watch on the first clap and stop on the last clap. By clapping 11 times you will have timed 10 distance intervals for the sound of the clap to reverberate off the wall. In essence, the sound has traveled 10 times the initial 100 m distance.Clapping 11 times also gives your friend enough time to start and stop the watch accurately.
Perform this step multiple times and average the times together to get a more accurate measurement. To average the trials, add up all the times and divide by the number of trials.

, Because you clapped 11 times, the sound actually traveled 10 times the distance. 100 meters multiplied by 10 is 1000 meters.

, This will measure the speed of the sound of the clap from your hands to the wall and back to your ears.


For example, let’s say it took 2.89 seconds for the 11 claps. To find speed we take the distance, 1000 meters, and divide by the time, 2.89 seconds to get a speed of sound of 346 m/sec.
The speed of sound at sea level is 340.29 m/sec (1,116 feet per second or 761.2 mph).Your calculations should come close to this figure, but may not match it exactly, especially if you aren’t at sea level. At higher altitudes, the air gets thinner and the speed of sound is slower.
Sound travels faster through liquids and solids than it does through air because sounds moves more quickly through materials of higher density."

Obtain an anemometer.,
Calculate the circumference of the anemometer.,
Place the anemometer where the wind will catch its cups.,
Count the number of times the anemometer spins for a fixed length of time.,
Multiply the number of rotations by the distance the anemometer travels in a single rotation.,
Divide the total distance over the elapsed time.",How to Measure Speed3," An anemometer is a device that measures wind speed.It consists of 3 or 4 cups mounted on wires attached to a central rotating shaft. Wind catches the cups and makes them spin. The faster the wind blows, the faster the cups spin around their axis.


You can either buy an anemometer or make your own.
To make your own, get five three-ounce paper cups, two straws, a sharpened pencil with an eraser, a stapler, a small sharp pin, and a ruler.Color the sides of one of the cups to make it distinct from the others.
Punch a hole in the side of four of the cups about 1 inch from the rim. In the fifth cup, punch four holes equally spaced around the cup about 1 inch from the rim. Also, punch one hole in the bottom of this cup.
Push one straw through the side of one of the cups leaving about 1 inch of straw inside the cup. Staple the straw to the side of the cup. Feed the rest of the straw through the fifth cup with 4 holes in one side and out the other. Place a second cup on the end of this straw and staple it in place. Make sure all of the cups face the same direction.
Repeat the above step with the other two cups, feeding the straw through the remaining two holes in the middle cup. Again, make sure all cups are facing the same direction.
Carefully, place a pin through the intersection point of the straws in the middle cup.
Feed the pencil through the bottom hole of the fifth cup and push the pin through the eraser. Make sure your anemometer can spin freely. If so, it is now ready to use. If not, adjust the pencil so the eraser is not directly up against the straws.

, When one of the cups completes a full rotation, the distance it travels is the circumference of the circle. To calculate the circumference you need to measure the diameter of the circle.


Measure the distance from the center of the anemometer to the center of one of the cups. This is the radius of the anemometer. Doubling this distance is the diameter.
The circumference of a circle is equal to the diameter times the constant pi or 2 times the radius times pi.
For example, if the distance between the center of the cup and the center of the anemometer is 30 cm (1 foot), the distance the cup travels in a single rotation is 2 x 30 x 3.14 (rounding pi to 2 decimal places), or 188.4 cm (74.2 inches).

, You want enough wind to spin the anemometer, but not blow it over. You may need to anchor it to the ground or a post to keep it upright.

, Stand at a fixed point and count the number of times the colored cup rotates around the circle. Possible intervals are 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 seconds, or even a full minute. Set a timer to go off at your specific time interval to ensure accuracy in the count.


If you don’t have a timer, have a friend watch the clock, while you count the rotations.
If you purchased an anemometer, mark one of the cups in some way to allow you count properly.

, This will give you the total distance the anemometer traveled in the time you were watching it.


For example, your anemometer has a radius of 30 cm (.98 ft), therefore it travels 188.4 cm (6.18 ft) in a single rotation. If it rotated 50 times during your count, then the total distance is 50 x 188.4 = 9420 cm.

, The equation for speed is total distance divided by the amount of time it takes to travel that distance. Taking the total distance the anemometer spun and dividing it by the amount of time you counted for will give you the current wind speed.


For example, if you counted the number of rotations in 10 seconds you would divide the distance traveled by 10 seconds. Speed = (9420 cm/10 sec) = 942 cm/sec (30.9 ft/sec).
Multiplying 942 cm/sec by 3600 gives 3,391,200 cm/hr, divided by 100,000 (the number of centimeters in a kilometer) or 33.9 km/hr.
Multiplying 30.9 feet per second by 3,600 gives 111,240 feet per hour, divided by 5,280 gives 21.1 miles per hour.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Prepare the bromothymol blue solution.,
Collect “emissions” by burning matches in a jar.,
Add the bromothymol blue solution to the jar.,
Observe what happens to the color of the liquid in the jar.",How to Simulate Acid Rain1," This experiment simulates the emission of harmful gases into the environment that combine with water in the sky to lower the pH and cause acid rain. To perform this simulation, you will need an eyedropper, distilled water, a glass jar with a lid, bromothymol blue, a small clear container, and matches that have a high sulfur content.Bromothymol blue is a solution that changes color when pH drops and can be purchased online.
The small container can be glass or plastic as long as it is clear.
Adult supervision is recommended while using the matches.;
, Pour about 10 mL of distilled water into the small clear container. The exact amount of water doesn’t matter, but 10 mL is a good amount for this experiment. Use the eyedropper to gradually add the bromothymol blue to the distilled water until the solutions turns a light blue.10 mL is about equal to two teaspoons.When bromothymol blue comes into contact with an acid, the color of the solution turns yellow.

, Light several matches and then drop them in a glass jar while still lit. Place the lid on to collect the gases. Wait until the matches burn out.With the lid on the jar you have trapped the carbon dioxide and sulfur gases produced by the matches. These gases are the same gases that get trapped in our atmosphere.
Have adult supervision during this step

, Open the jar containing the matches and pour the entire container of bromothymol blue solution into the jar. Put the lid back on the jar as quickly as possible to keep all of the gases in the jar.Shake the jar to mix the gases from the matches with the bromothymol blue solution.

, Because bromothymol blue turns yellow when acid is introduced to it, you should observe that the solution has turned yellow. This experiment is a model of how gases can dissolve in water to decrease the pH of the water, making it more acidic.If the water doesn’t turn yellow, you may need to burn more matches to trap more gas.
Alternatively, you can use less water and try again.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Work in a safe environment.,
Add sulfuric acid to the distilled water.,
Spray the potted plant with the sulfuric acid solution.",How to Simulate Acid Rain2," This experiment simulates how acid rain affects the environment and plants. To do it, you will need two small potted plants, sulfuric acid, distilled water, an eyedropper, a pH meter or pH strips, and a spray bottle.If you want to do this easily at home, you can use vinegar or lemon juice instead of sulfuric acid. You don’t need an eyedropper or pH meter if you use vinegar or lemon juice., When working with strong acids like sulfuric acid, you need to wear a lab coat, gloves, and safety goggles. Always wear this protective equipment when handling the sulfuric acid. Adult supervision is required for this process.


Do not lean over or breathe in the acid.

, Fill a small container with distilled water. The exact amount isn’t important, but one cup of water should be sufficient. Using the eyedropper, add some sulfuric acid to the water, stir, and check the pH with the pH meter. Keep adding sulfuric acid and stirring until the water has a pH around 4.0.If you’re using pH strips, dip the strip into the water and wait until the strip changes color. Compare that color to the key to determine what the pH of your solution is. Keep checking the pH with a new strip each time until you get to 4.0.
If you’re using vinegar/lemon juice, skip this step.

, Add your acidic water (or vinegar/lemon juice) solution to a spray bottle and spray one of the plants with the “acid rain”. Spray the second plant with plain distilled water. Repeat this process once a day for a week and observe the results.Monitor the state of your plants over time, noting the effects on the plants.
After a few days, you should notice that the plant sprayed with the acid rain develops brown/yellow leaves and is badly damaged compared to the plant with just distilled water.

Holly, Ilex aquifolium, either a shrub or a tree, produces small red berries containing seeds.,
Remove potential problem plants.",How to Recognise Weed Plants in New Zealand," Plants with berries are the most problematic. They are attractive to birds, which eat the berries and in the process they drop berries into areas away from the initial garden where the plant grew (either during flight or through their excrement). The seeds inside the berry grow into weeds in natural bush and reserves, remaining unchecked because there is nobody around to remove them. In addition, plants that grow aggressively can escape garden boundaries and begin growing in adjacent natural reserves if your home borders on native bush. Even innocent transferal of garden waste or berries and seeds stuck on car tyres can also move plants around unwittingly.;
, Garden plants that turn into weeds in the native bush endanger native species through aggressive growth, shading out native species and smothering them. In other words, these plants often take over the environment of the local species and out-compete them. In turn, this destroys the diverse ecosystem that is reliant on the native plant species and exchanges a thriving native environment for a sterile, introduced one.

Determine what type of problem it is.,
Draw a picture.,
Label the distances and velocities given in the problem on your picture.,
List all your variables.,
Make sure the units match.,
Use physics constants to fill in some unknown variables.,
If your problem is set up like scenario (2), make sure to use the angle given to break up the initial velocity into x and y components.,
Pick a kinematic equation to use.,
Find the similar variables.,
If there is not an equation you can use to solve for your desired variable, use a kinematic equation and solve for a different variable.,
After finding the intermediate variables, use them to solve for your desired variable.,
Make sure you include units and draw a box around your answer.

",How to Solve a Projectile Motion Problem," There are two types of projectile motion problems:


(1) an object is thrown off a higher ground than what it will land on.
(2) the object starts on the ground, soars through the air, and then lands on the ground some distance away from where it started.;
, Draw out the scenario so you can see how the object travels.

, You should be able to look at the picture and have a clear understanding of the path and values given in the problem.

, It may seem unnecessary if you have your picture properly labeled, but keeping all your variables together in a list will help show what you are missing. These variables should include your final velocity, initial velocity, distance, acceleration, and time. Since this is projectile motion problem, however, there are different values for the object in the x and y direction. This means you will need to make two lists. It is important to read the question carefully and label your values accordingly.

, Convert your units into meters and seconds so that you can use constants to solve the problem.

, In the y direction, acceleration will always be -9.8m/s^2 since there is always acceleration due to gravity. The initial velocity in the y direction will always be 0 m/s as well. In the x component list, your initial and final velocities will be the same, since there is no new force acting on the object, meaning your acceleration will be 0 m/s^2.

, In this case, the y direction initial velocity is not 0 m/s, but instead it is Vi*sin(angle). The initial velocity in the x direction is Vi*cos(angle). If your problem is set up like scenario (1), the initial velocity is simply what is given.

, Once you have most of your variables listed, pick an equation that will allow you to solve for the desired variable. The picture shows equations you can use when you are missing a certain variable.

, Although the velocities and distances of the x and y components are often different, the time it takes will always be the same in the x and y direction. If you are stuck, try solving for time in one component so you can use it to solve for the other component.

, Solve for as many missing variables as you can to find your solution.

, Use a final kinematic equation to solve for the answer.

Take fast action when exposure occurs.",How to Protect Kids from Household Chemicals," Even small children can be very resourceful, crafty, and determined when they want to get their hands (or mouths) on something. They have been known to defeat safety measures on storage cabinets and on chemical product containers. They cannot, however, overcome an observant pair of eyes from a supervising adult.Supervision is your first line of defense, but no one can keep their eyes on one or more kids all the time. Use additional household chemical safety measures in coordination with your observational skills.;
, When it comes to storing household chemicals in a child-safe manner, “out of sight, out of mind” should be your mantra. Keep chemical containers out of reach, out of view, and, whenever possible, behind a locked door.Even if you add a child-proof lock to the doors, the cabinet under your sink is not a great place to store household chemicals (including dishwasher detergent). A locked cabinet that is also out of a child’s reach is a much safer option. Who says you can’t store your holiday dishware under the sink and your household cleaners on the upper shelf of a (locked) upper kitchen cabinet?

, An elevated, locked storage cabinet is only a useful safety measure if your dangerous household chemicals are actually inside it. Keep a chemical product container either in your possession or in the locked cabinet at all times; never leave it on the counter, table, etc., even for a few moments.Don’t leave the laundry detergent container on top of the washer or in the clothes basket between loads. Put the drain cleaner bottle away each time, even if you know you’ll need to use it multiple times to bust a tough clog. Pay extra attention to laundry and dishwasher detergent pods or packs, as they can look and smell like candy.

, Whatever your reasoning may be — dividing a heavy bottle of bleach into two smaller juice bottles, putting insect killer in an empty window cleaner bottle because the nozzle on the bug spray broke, etc. — it is always a bad idea to store any chemical in a container other than the one it came in. You might forget what’s in there, you might cause a chemical reaction with residues in the new container, you lose the benefits of all the warnings and information on the original container, and the list goes on.Never under any circumstances use an empty food container to store chemicals, no matter how well you label it with a marker. You have to make sure that kids don’t associate household chemicals with food, so don’t add any amount of additional confusion. Keep dangerous chemicals in the original containers with all the warnings, and add (and explain) a “Mr. Yuk” or similar warning sticker for added effect., You do want kids to understand that household chemicals have particular uses (by grown ups alone), so you can explain to them that you’re going to use the product to whiten the clothes, clean the toilets, etc. However, to prevent any unexpected and unwelcome “assistance” from your kids, it is best to use the product when they are not present.Also, small children are more sensitive and susceptible to chemical fumes, so remove them from the area and make sure you ventilate the room properly when using household chemicals.
Really, for a host of reasons (including their safety and your sanity), it may be best to clean the house with various chemicals while the kids are visiting grandpa’s house.

, You might feel a bit silly crawling around on your hands and knees in the laundry room, kitchen, or wherever else household chemicals are stored. However, getting the same view of things that a small child has can help you catch weaknesses in your household chemical protection plan that you might not otherwise notice.An unlocked upper cabinet that you thought was out of reach may not be. A shelf that you thought kept chemical bottles out of view may be easy to see. You may even find that the mouse poison block you thought was well out of view and reach between the cabinet and the fridge isn’t so inaccessible after all.
Try to think like a kid too. Does your container of laundry detergent “pods” look a bit like a candy jar? Do your spray bottles remind you of the kids’ water pistols?

, Do you have an old bottle of weed killer in your garage even though you started hiring a lawn service years ago? Is your cleaning cabinet full of old bottles with so-small-it’s-useless amounts of cleaners left in them because getting rid of them would be “wasteful”? A child can’t be injured by a household chemical that isn’t there to be found, so only keep around the products that you use regularly and get rid of the rest.When disposing of superfluous household chemicals, follow the instructions on the package or contact your waste disposal provider or water and sewage authority. Don’t just pitch bottles into the trash or dump them down the drain without knowing the best disposal practices.

, Whether you’re cleaning the oven or scrubbing the tub, using a little less cleaner and a little more “elbow grease” usually can provide the same results while reducing the amounts of chemical fumes and residues in your home. It is more thrifty and (more importantly) safer to use only as much of a household cleaner as is necessary to get the job done.Mixing household chemicals together is always a bad idea, but adding water to water-based cleaners (like glass cleaners, for instance) can be beneficial in multiple ways. You’ll probably find that the cleaner works just as well and lasts much longer. Also, a diluted cleaner has less concentrated fumes and amounts of the chemicals inside, which may make them safer around kids.

, Because of their smaller bodies and lungs, amounts of chemical fumes in the air that you might only find annoying or uncomfortable may be very harmful to small children. Always make sure to open a window or use an exhaust fan when dispensing or applying household chemicals, especially those with noticeable fumes.Keep in mind that the “fresh, clean scent” created by your favorite household cleaner is usually caused by chemicals. Some kids may react negatively to these fumes as well. Remember that “clean” doesn’t have to smell like anything.

, If you think that baking soda and vinegar are only good for making science fair volcanoes, think again. These common household items, along with others like lemon juice, salt, and just plain old water, can be used to make a range of surprisingly effective household cleaners that also happen to be much safer to store and use around kids. You may also consider purchasing natural or eco-friendly products. These products may still be a hazard to your child, but they are less hazardous than products made with harsh chemicals.


Equal parts of white vinegar and clean water, for instance, make a window cleaner every bit as effective as the ones found in stores. You can find a host of other homemade cleaning recipes online.Remember that “homemade” does not automatically equal “safe” or “healthy,” though. Continue to store your homemade cleaners behind locked doors, in clearly-labeled, previously unused containers (such as empty spray bottles you can buy at the store).
Try eco-friendly cleaners such as Seventh Generation and Ecover. Some big cleaning product companies also make eco-friendly versions of their cleaners, such as Lysol., Time is of the essence when a child is exposed to dangerous chemicals. You don’t have time to waste searching for the local poison control hotline number. Save it in your mobile phone, and display it prominently near your home phone and/or where you store the chemicals.In the U.S., for example, the nationwide poison control number is 800-222-1222. Call this number if there has been a chemical exposure and the person is conscious and alert.
If the exposed person is unconscious, call 911 (anywhere in the U.S.) or the emergency services number in your country.

, No matter how well you safeguard your household chemicals, never assume that a chemical exposure incident can’t happen in your home. Be prepared not only by knowing what phone number to call, but by learning techniques that could potentially save a child’s life.If you have kids, are going to have kids, or regularly watch or supervise kids, you should learn CPR for infants, children, and adults, as well as infant and child/adult versions of the Heimlich maneuver (for choking). Take a class and refresh your knowledge every few years.
Make sure you have a well-stocked first aid kit in your home at all times.

, Calling poison control or emergency services should always be either the first or among the first things you do when a hazardous chemical exposure occurs. There are, however, additional actions you can take that can provide immediate treatment for various types of chemical exposure.If poison is swallowed, call poison control and only induce vomiting if they tell you to do so.
If a hazardous chemical gets in a child’s eyes, flush the eyes with water for fifteen minutes while (whenever possible) someone else contacts poison control.
If the skin is exposed to a hazardous chemical, drench the area with clean water, remove any contaminated clothes, and thoroughly wash the area with soap and water.
If dangerous chemicals are inhaled, get the person into fresh air immediately. Drag or carry an unconscious child outside and start CPR if necessary.

Substitute the uncertainties of the quantum harmonic oscillator.",How to Verify the Uncertainty Principle for a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator," This partial differential equation is the fundamental equation of motion in quantum mechanics that describes how a quantum state ψ{\displaystyle \psi } evolves in time. H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} denotes the Hamiltonian, the energy operator that describes the total energy of the system.


iℏ∂ψ∂t=H^ψ{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial t}}={\hat {H}}\psi }
;
, While the position and momentum variables have been replaced with their corresponding operators, the expression still resembles the kinetic and potential energies of a classical harmonic oscillator. Since we are working in physical space, the position operator is given by x^=x,{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}=x,} while the momentum operator is given by p^=−iℏ∂∂x.{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}=-i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}.}


H^=p^22m+12mω2x^2{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}={\frac {{\hat {p}}^{2}}{2m}}+{\frac {1}{2}}m\omega ^{2}{\hat {x}}^{2}}


, We see that the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time, so the solutions to the equation will be stationary states. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is an eigenvalue equation, so solving it means that we are finding the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions - the wavefunctions.


−ℏ22md2ψdx2+12mω2x2ψ=Eψ{\displaystyle -{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}\psi }{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{2}}m\omega ^{2}x^{2}\psi =E\psi }


, This differential equation has variable coefficients and cannot easily be solved by elementary methods. However, after normalizing, the solution for the ground state can be written like so. Remember that this solution only describes a one-dimensional oscillator. 


ψ(x)=(mωπℏ)1/4exp(−mω2ℏx2){\displaystyle \psi (x)=\left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar }}\right)^{1/4}\exp \left(-{\frac {m\omega }{2\hbar }}x^{2}\right)}

This is a Gaussian centered at x=0.{\displaystyle x=0.} We will use the fact that this function is even to simplify our calculations in the next part. 


, The uncertainty of an observable such as position is mathematically the standard deviation. That is, we find the average value, take each value and subtract from the average, square those values and average, and then take the square root.


σx=⟨x2⟩−⟨x⟩2{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}={\sqrt {\langle x^{2}\rangle -\langle x\rangle ^{2}}}}


, Since the function is even, we can deduce from symmetry that ⟨x⟩=0.{\displaystyle \langle x\rangle =0.}

If you set up the integral needed to evaluate, you will find that the integrand is an odd function, because an odd function times an even function is odd. 


⟨x⟩=∫−∞∞x|ψ(x)|2dx{\displaystyle \langle x\rangle =\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }x|\psi (x)|^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x}



One property of an odd function is that for every positive value of the function, there exists a doppelgänger - a corresponding negative value - that cancels them out. Since we are evaluating over all x{\displaystyle x} values, we know the integral evaluates to 0 without having to actually do the calculations.


, Since our solution is written as a continuous wavefunction, we must employ the integral below. The integral describes the expectation value of x2{\displaystyle x^{2}} integrated over all space. 


⟨x2⟩=∫−∞∞x2|ψ(x)|2dx{\displaystyle \langle x^{2}\rangle =\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }x^{2}|\psi (x)|^{2}{\mathrm {d} }x}


, We know that the wavefunction is even. The square of an even function is even as well, so we can pull out a factor of 2 and change the lower bound to 0. 


⟨x2⟩=2(mωπℏ)1/2∫0∞x2exp(−mωℏx2)dx{\displaystyle \langle x^{2}\rangle =2\left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar }}\right)^{1/2}\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{2}\exp \left(-{\frac {m\omega }{\hbar }}x^{2}\right){\mathrm {d} }x}


, First, let α=mωℏ.{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {m\omega }{\hbar }}.} Next, instead of integrating by parts, we will use the gamma function.


⟨x2⟩=2(mωπℏ)1/2∫0∞x2e−αx2dx,  u=αx2=2(mωπℏ)1/2∫0∞uαe−udu12αx,  x=uα=(mωπℏ)1/2α−3/2∫0∞u1/2e−udu=(mωπℏ)1/2(mωℏ)−3/2Γ(32),  Γ(32)=π2=ℏmω1ππ2=ℏ2mω{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\langle x^{2}\rangle &=2\left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar }}\right)^{1/2}\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{2}e^{-\alpha x^{2}}{\mathrm {d} }x,\ \ u=\alpha x^{2}\\&=2\left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar }}\right)^{1/2}\int _{0}^{\infty }{\frac {u}{\alpha }}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u{\frac {1}{2\alpha x}},\ \ x={\sqrt {\frac {u}{\alpha }}}\\&=\left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar }}\right)^{1/2}\alpha ^{-3/2}\int _{0}^{\infty }u^{1/2}e^{-u}{\mathrm {d} }u\\&=\left({\frac {m\omega }{\pi \hbar }}\right)^{1/2}\left({\frac {m\omega }{\hbar }}\right)^{-3/2}\Gamma \left({\frac {3}{2}}\right),\ \ \Gamma \left({\frac {3}{2}}\right)={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}\\&={\frac {\hbar }{m\omega }}{\frac {1}{\sqrt {\pi }}}{\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}\\&={\frac {\hbar }{2m\omega }}\end{aligned}}}


, Using the relation we wrote in step 1 of this part, σx{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}} immediately follows from our results.


σx=ℏ2mω{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}={\sqrt {\frac {\hbar }{2m\omega }}}}


, As with average position, a symmetry argument can be made that leads to ⟨p⟩=0.{\displaystyle \langle p\rangle =0.}
, Instead of using the wavefunction to calculate this expectation value directly, we can use the energy of the wavefunction to simplify the calculations needed. The energy of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator is given below.


E0=12ℏω{\displaystyle E_{0}={\frac {1}{2}}\hbar \omega }


, We expect this relation to hold not just for any position and momentum but also for their expectation values as well.


12ℏω=⟨p2⟩2m+12mω2⟨x2⟩{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\hbar \omega ={\frac {\langle p^{2}\rangle }{2m}}+{\frac {1}{2}}m\omega ^{2}\langle x^{2}\rangle }


,


mℏω=⟨p2⟩+m2ω2ℏ2mω{\displaystyle m\hbar \omega =\langle p^{2}\rangle +m^{2}\omega ^{2}{\frac {\hbar }{2m\omega }}}


⟨p2⟩=mℏω2{\displaystyle \langle p^{2}\rangle ={\frac {m\hbar \omega }{2}}}


,


σp=mℏω2{\displaystyle \sigma _{p}={\sqrt {\frac {m\hbar \omega }{2}}}}


, The uncertainty principle is a fundamental limit to the precision with which we can measure certain pairs of observables, such as position and momentum. See the tips for more background on the uncertainty principle.


σxσp≥ℏ2{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}\sigma _{p}\geq {\frac {\hbar }{2}}}


,


ℏ2mωmℏω2≥ℏ2ℏ2≥ℏ2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\sqrt {\frac {\hbar }{2m\omega }}}{\sqrt {\frac {m\hbar \omega }{2}}}&\geq {\frac {\hbar }{2}}\\{\frac {\hbar }{2}}&\geq {\frac {\hbar }{2}}\end{aligned}}}

Our results are in agreement with the uncertainty principle. In fact, this relation only achieves equality in the ground state - if higher energy states are used, then the uncertainties in the position and momentum only grow.

Soak up the urine.,

Buy a commercial pet stain remover.",How to Neutralize Ammonia1," Apply layers of paper towels as soon as you discover the urine stain. Stand or walk on the paper towels to increase absorbency. Try to soak up as much as possible before moving on., Mix a solution of one part white vinegar to one part water. Transfer the mixed ingredients into a spray container or cleaning bucket. Spray or pour the solution onto the area. If the area is carpeted, apply a generous amount of cleaning mixture.


You want to use enough solution to soak into all areas of the urine stain. You must be careful not to let the solution sink into the subflooring., Wait 10 minutes. Return and blot the area again with paper towels. If you have ample wash cloths, you can use these as well. It isn’t advised to use many washcloths because the ammonia can be difficult to remove., Let the area dry until it is slightly damp. Sprinkle the area with baking soda. Let the baking soda sit for 15 minutes. Baking soda is a mild alkali that dissolves dirt and grease with water effectively.Put a laundry bucket over the area while the baking soda is cleaning the area. This will prevent your pet from messing with the area.

, You should have removed the majority of the urine, which causes the release of ammonia. If the odor still smells, then you will need to treat it again to remove the remaining area or use a commercial product., The key to a commercial product is to make sure it removes the smell. Cats, especially, will urinate in the same location if they smell their urine. Buy a product that caters to your pet specially, instead of buying an ""all pets"" stain remover. Try to use natural products that won't be damaging to your pet or yourself.


Apply the cleaner according to package's directions. Repeat as necessary. Read the safety measures to ensure the product doesn’t contain hazardous materials.

Choose an absorbent bedding.,
Prepare the stall.,
Mix your bedding with an ammonia-neutralizing product.,
Spread the bedding.",How to Neutralize Ammonia2," Ensure your horses are in stalls that provide proper ventilation, even in the winter. Ventilation in the walkways is not enough. Each stall should have at least a one-foot (0.3m) opening to ensure that the excess ammonia gas can leave the stall.


In high concentrations, ammonia can cause respiratory damage and even death., Make sure you clean underneath the mats at least once week.

, Wheat straw has been found to reduce ammonia. Kenaf fiber is also helpful in reducing ammonia levels. The most absorbent bedding is porous flooring like packed dirt, clay, or even stone dust.


Use tightly interlocking or seamless stall mats to keep the urine from seeping into the floor underneath the bedding., Remove the horses from their stalls for a daily cleaning. Get rid of all urine-soaked bedding and dispose of it. It is important to let the horses out of their stall when cleaning or preparing ammonia neutralizers.

, You can use diatomaceous earth or a clinoptilolite-based product. This increases the absorbency of the materials, lowering the amount of bacteria that is converted into ammonia.Use a ratio of 1:8 for the ammonia neutralizing agent.

, Use a stable shovel and dump two scoops of bedding into the stall. Spread out the bedding with the shovel. Continue to shovel and spread the bedding in increments of two scoops. If you're leaving the horse in the stall overnight, use between 4 to 6 inches of bedding.

If the horse is in and out of the stall and you have mats, cover the mats with about 2 inches of bedding.

Create a dry mixture.,
Acquire a weak acid.,
Identify the ammonia spill.,
Scoop up the mixture into a container.,
Create a liquid cleaner.,
Apply the liquid neutralizer.",How to Neutralize Ammonia3," Mix together equal parts sodium bicarbonate, clay cat litter and dry sand. Keep it in buckets near your workstation. Create a dry mixture if you intend to absorb the spill. Some might attempt to dilute the spill and use it to clean the affected area.Liquid ammonia is a common cleaning agent. You can dilute the spill with water and use the mixture as an impromptu cleaner. You'll need to add a higher ratio of water to ammonia, so if you spilled too much, use the dry mixture.
This combination of dry ingredients is a safe way of containing and disposing large amounts of liquid ammonia.

, An acid or alkaline compound can be used to neutralize ammonia, making it safer to handle. You could use hydrochloric or sulfuric neutralizers. Application of these products to the spill will cause a chemical reaction that will neutralize the ammonia.Search for ammonia neutralizers. Some brands develop a mixture of acids to be used to neutralize ammonia.

, Cover the spill with your dry spill mix. You should use enough spill mix so that the surface is completely dry. Wait for the mix to absorb the liquid.

, Wear a mask while doing this. If possible, place the compound in a fume hood.Turn the fume hood on for the remainder of the process.


Throw this mixture directly into your outdoor trash bin if you don’t have access to a fume hood.

, Fill a pail with cold water. Slowly add the liquid neutralizers into the cold water. Only add a tenth of the chemical neutralizer to the water.


If you added too much, the neutralizer will still do the job, but may need more applications of water to the spill area.Stir the mixture for about thirty seconds.

, Add a small amount of liquid mixture created earlier to the area of the spill. Add small dollops at a time. On the surface clean thoroughly with a clean mop. Allow the area to dry before cleaning a second time.

On the second cleaning, use water and a surface cleaner to ensure a thorough cleaning of the area.
Never use bleach to clean ammonia because the combined chemicals will create a poisonous gas harmful to people."

Ensure that your burner and hose are clean and in good working order before you put them in the drawer.",How to Light a Bunsen Burner," It's also a good idea to make sure you are working on a fireproof bench or at least a fireproof mat.;
, And that all materials needed are available.

, It is best to survey the locations before you start any laboratory procedure. In particular, you should make sure that you have unobstructed access to the following:



A fire blanket. Use this as a wrap should your clothing catch fire. The blanket will suffocate the flame by removing the oxygen supply.

Fire extinguishers. Know the location of each. It would not hurt to make sure that the inspections are up-to-date. At the same time you can determine the types available and form an action plan in case of emergency. There are several types of extinguishers and each (in the US) should be marked by a colored ring near the top of the extinguisher.


Dry powder retardants can be used on every type of fire except for oils. That is, the extinguisher containing dry powders can be used on solids, liquids, gases and on electrical equipment. Extinguishers containing a solid flame retardant (dry powder) are marked with a blue stripe in the US.Foam (yellow stripe, US) or CO2 (black stripe, US) are for oils.

CO2 extinguishers can also be used on electrical equipment and on flammable liquids.Foam extinguishers can also be used on flammable liquids and flammable solids (paper, wood, other).Know how to use a fire extinguisher. Use the acronym PASS: Pull the pin and, with the nozzle directed away from you, undo the locking mechanism. Aim low (at the base of the fire). Squeeze the trigger slowly and evenly. Sweep the chemical from side to side.A fire hose. This is for large fires and should be used by trained individuals. Spray the base of the fire to cool the combustible (burning) material. Water should be used on solids-- wood, paper, clothes, furniture, etc., but not on flammable liquids, gases, oils or on electrical equipment. Never use water on liquids less dense than water (1.0 g/cm3). Such liquids float on the surface and spraying with water causes the fire to spread.

A safety shower. If your clothes catch on fire and are not saturated with a flammable liquid, this might be a good choice. The safety shower is primarily for rinsing acids from your body, but can come in handy in event of a fire.

, Wear safety goggles and use other protective equipment when dealing with Bunsen burners.


Make sure to tie back long hair and tuck in loose clothing (or remove it). Also tuck in your tie and remove jewelry. Think ahead and eliminate hazards before they become a problem. You don't want anything to catch fire.

, Gently squeeze the tubing along the entire length and bend it at several places along its length while you look carefully look for visible cracks. If you see cracks, replace the tubing.

, Ensure that the hose is pushed well up onto the ribs and that it is secure on both ends. There should be no way for any gas to escape into the air except through the burner.

, Hold the Bunser burner only by the base or by the collar at the bottom of the barrel. After the burner is lit the barrel will be very hot and you will burn yourself if you pick up the burner by the top part of barrel before allowing the burner to cool.

,


The bottom of the burner that rests on the bench top is called the base. The base provides stability and helps to keep the burner from being tipped over.
The upright part of the burner is called the barrel.
At the bottom of the barrel is an outer sleeve (the collar) which can be rotated to expose slots in the barrel, called air ports. These allow air to be introduced into the barrel where it is mixed with the gas to produce a highly combustible gaseous mixture.
The gas enters the barrel through a needle valve which can be adjusted to control the gas flow.

, There is really a flame within a flame. The inner flame is the reducing flame and the outer flame is the oxidizing flame. The hottest part of the flame is the tip of the inner, reducing flame.

,


The air and gas mix within the barrel. If the collar is turned so the air ports are closed, then no air is introduced into the barrel. All of the oxygen (required for combustion) is supplied at the top of the barrel from the surrounding air. This flame burns yellow and is the coolest flame, often called the safety flame. When the burner is not in use the collar should be rotated to close the air ports and produce the cool safety flame.
The needle valve and the collar are used in conjunction to control the volume and the the mixture ratio of gas to air. The gas to air ratio determines, in large part, the heat produced. Equimolar amounts of gas and air produce the hottest flame. The total volume of gaseous mixture rising through the barrel determines the flame height.

You can slightly open the needle valve and air ports to achieve a hot, small flame or you can increase both flows simultaneously to create a hot taller flame.



, Locate the openings at the base of the chimney and twist the outer metal shell (collar) until the holes are closed. This will ensure that the flame is at its coolest once the gas is ignited (safety flame).

, The handle should be going across the axis of the gas line, perpendicular to the gas outlet.

, Make sure that it is closed all the way.


You will want to light your match or have your striker ready and then turn the gas on (handle in-line with the gas line) and open the needle valve slightly. This ensures that, initially, the flame will be small.
The best way to light a burner is with a striker. This device uses flint on steel to make a spark.
Practice making sparks until you can generate a strong spark with each stroke. Push the flint across the ""washboard"" while pushing up. This will enable you to make a strong spark. Practice until you are able to make a strong spark each time. You are now ready to light the burner.

, You should not hear any gas at this point. If you do, turn the gas off immediately and close the needle valve by turning it clockwise. Open the local gas valve again and make sure your striker is handy.

,,


If you do not have a striker, you can use a match or a (disposable) lighter. Before turning on the gas, light your match/lighter and hold it away from the burner, a bit off to the side. Turn on the gas, then bring the ignition source toward the side of the gas stream/column. Once the flame is lit, put out your match/lighter. Let the match cool completely, then you can put it on the bench out of the way.

, Open or close the needle valve to get an appropriately sized flame for the task at hand. Note: The needle valve is the one that is used to increase or decrease the gas flow, not the local shut off valve.


To adjust the flame height, throttle the gas flow by opening or closing the needle valve. More gas will give a larger flame; less gas, a smaller flame.

, Adjust the collar so that no air enters the barrel for the coolest flame, the safety or ""stand by"" flame. When you are ready to heat something, open the air ports until the flame is the right color. Yellow is cool, blue and almost invisible is the hottest.


For a hotter flame, twist the collar at the bottom until the holes (air ports) are more fully open. Adjust until you have reached the desired heat.

,


At its hottest, the flame is sometimes called a ""banana flame"" or ""working flame"". To create a blue flame (the hottest flame), open the collar holes to allow additional oxygen into the combustion chamber. The holes should be completely open, or nearly so.
A blue flame is very hot (around 1500 C) and is not easily seen. It can be almost invisible against some backgrounds.

, If you are bending glass tubing, for example, you will try to achieve the hottest flame and, at the same time, get a medium size flame, then position the tubing at or just above the tip of the reducing flame. If it is too hot, raise the tubing a bit into the cooler oxidizing flame.


There are many adjustments that you will learn through trial and error, but nothing is too critical other than being safe. Soon you will learn which colors correspond to specific temperatures, at least in a relative, qualitative way.

, Keep your eye on it at all times. If you are working on something that does not involve the flame, turn it down to the coolest, most yellow flame (safety flame) by twisting the collar until the holes are completely closed.

, Turn off the local supply  by positioning the valve handle perpendicular to the gas line.

, Five minutes will be more than enough, but still handle the burner only from the bottom. Reinforce this habit.

, The valve will then be set for the next use.

, When your burner is clean and the needle valve is closed, risk of unexpected behavior is reduced. Remember this important step.

Use immersion oil on 100X objective lens.,
Place a drop of immersion oil on the slide where the organism is smeared.,
Examine your slide under oil immersion.",How to Perform a Capsular Stain2," Clean off any oil on the lenses from previous examinations with lens tissue. Take your glass slide, organism facing up, and clip it on the stage of your light microscope with the stage clips which will hold it into place. If needed, use the stage adjustment knobs to move the slide back and forth to make sure the part of the slide you’re examining is positioned under the objective lens.

, Your objective lens should be set on the lowest power which is 10X. You will not be able to see much here but this step is used to focus your microscope. To move the objective lens, use the nosepiece.

, It may move the stage or the upper part of the microscope. You will turn this knob until your specimen comes into focus. Don’t worry about the lens coming in contact with the slide and breaking it, there is a stop that will prevent that. This should only be used on low-power objective. It shouldn’t be needed when you move to your next objective lens magnification.

, Once you have identified the structure you want to examine closer, you will proceed to higher magnification. On this microorganism, we want to use oil immersion to increase the magnification. The oil will form a continuous lens system that reduces the loss of light. This will cause the resolution to increase.

, To apply the oil, turn the nosepiece so that it’s positioned between 40X and 100X.

, You then gently move to the 100X magnification and the oil will meet the lens. You may then use the fine focus knob again to bring your bacterium into better focus. Also, you can adjust the light by using the light intensity control.

, You should be able to identify the capsules as light blue and the cells will appear as dark purple.

Store anhydrous ammonia under pressure.,
Use only non-corrosive storage containers.,
Paint tanks in light, reflective colors such as white or silver.,
Inspect all storage tanks and hoses on a regular basis and service them as needed.,
Keep protective gear on hand if you store anhydrous ammonia in bulk.",How to Handle Anhydrous Ammonia1," Anhydrous ammonia boils at a temperature of  -28 degrees Fahrenheit (-33 degrees Celsius). To keep it liquid at temperatures above this, it must be stored and injected into the soil under pressure. (Once in the soil, the liquid ammonia turns to gas, releasing its nitrogen into the soil as it absorbs the soil's moisture.) Containers used to store anhydrous ammonia should conform to the guidelines of the American National Standards Unit, with all parts and surfaces able to withstand a pressure of at least 250 pounds per square inch (1724 kilo-pascals).


One cubic foot (28.3 liters) of liquid anhydrous ammonia vaporizes to 855 cubic feet (24,196.5 liters) of gas. Nurse tanks (on-farm storage tanks) and applicator tanks should be filled no more than 85 percent full, to allow for some of the ammonia to vaporize without rupturing the tank.;
, Anhydrous ammonia will corrode metals such as copper and zinc and any alloys that include those metals. Because zinc is used to galvanize steel, galvanized steel containers and pipe cannot be used with anhydrous ammonia.

, This will reflect heat, helping to keep the tanks cooler and the pressure inside them lower. Label nurse tanks with ""ANHYDROUS AMMONIA"" in letters that are 4-inches (10-centimeters) high on the sides and rear of the tank, with the words ""INHALATION HAZARD"" in letters 3-inches (7.5-centimeters) high on either side.

, Walk around the tanks looking for defects; you can get a checklist of what to look for from your supplier. Inspect the hoses for bulges, blisters, cracks or cuts, and replace them if you see any slippage around the coupling.


Hoses designed for anhydrous ammonia use should have the words ""ANHYDROUS AMMONIA"" stamped on them, as well as the maximum rated pressure, the manufacturer's name and dates of manufacture and expiration. Nylon-reinforced hoses should be replaced every 4 years and stainless-steel-reinforced hoses every 6 years, sooner if defects are found.
The pressure relief valve should be replaced every 5 years, sooner if leaks or other defects are found.
Leaks can easily be detected; anhydrous ammonia has a distinct odor easily detectable at 50 parts per million (ppm), enough to drive someone away. A concentration of 134 ppm irritates the nose and throat, while a concentration of 700 ppm leads to coughing and severe eye irritation. Concentrations of over 1,700 ppm lead to serious injury and death, while a concentration 5,000 ppm will asphyxiate someone within minutes.

, You'll need a raincoat and least 2 gas masks with current air canisters. The gas masks will only protect you against low concentrations of ammonia gas; if a major leak occurs, contact your local fire department, which has the training and equipment to deal with a serious leak.

"
"
Read and follow the instructions that come with your equipment.,
Wear protective gear.,
Keep clean water on hand.,
Transfer ammonia between tanks in a safe manner.,
Maintain safety precautions when applying anhydrous ammonia.",How to Handle Anhydrous Ammonia2," Be sure all farm workers who will work with anhydrous ammonia are familiar with these procedures and refer any questions to your farm equipment dealer.


U.S. federal law requires anyone working with anhydrous ammonia to be at least 16 years of age.

, To protect yourself, wear a heavy-duty, long-sleeved shirt and long pants and/or coveralls, along with rubber gloves with an extended cuff that can be turned down to catch any of the liquid ammonia if it runs down your arms when they're raised. Cover your face with either chemical-proof goggles or a full-face respirator.


Regular glasses are not a substitute for goggles, but if you wear normally wear contact lenses, wear your glasses under your goggles instead of your contacts when working with anhydrous ammonia. That way, should any ammonia seep into your eyes, you can flush them with water; contact lenses will trap the ammonia and damage your eyes before you can remove them.

, Many states require that a 5-gallon (19-liter) tank of water be kept near nurse and applicator tanks of anhydrous ammonia to flush the eyes and wash the skin if either comes in contact with the ammonia. It's also a good idea to have a second such water tank on the tractor itself, and handlers should also carry an 8-ounce (237-milliliter) water bottle on their person at all times while around anhydrous ammonia. Water in tanks should be changed daily to ensure its cleanliness.


The water is necessary because anhydrous ammonia has a strong affinity for water. In liquid form, it will first freeze the skin, then cause rapid dehydration and severe chemical burns as it pulls moisture out of the body.

, The nurse tank should be parked close to the source tank, on level ground and downwind of the source tank, away from obstacles. Block the wheels of the wagon carrying the nurse tank and set the towing vehicle's parking brake. Inspect the filler hose couplings and connectors for dirt or damage before connecting the hoses, and carry the hose by the valve body or coupling, not the flow control wheel. Always turn the flow control wheel by hand, to avoid damaging its fitting and causing a leak.


If transferring ammonia between tanks with a compressor, keep the pressure in the receiving tank lower than that of the source tank to avoid backflow. As noted previously, the receiving tank should be filled no more than 85 percent full.

, The hose between the nurse or applicator tank and the applicator tool bar should have a breakaway coupler kept in good working condition to cut off the ammonia flow if the applicator separates from the tank. When unclogging applicator tubes, stand upwind from the tubes wearing your protective clothing and use a long piece of heavy-gauge wire to remove the debris.


If the coupler separates, vent off the pressure in the lines attached to the tank and applicator with the bleeder valves before reconnecting. You may also want to bleed the lines before unclogging the applicator tubes to prevent the ammonia from rushing out through the opened holes.

"
"
Label the transport tank.,
Attach the tank wagon to the towing vehicle securely.,
Tow the tank as a slow-moving vehicle.",How to Handle Anhydrous Ammonia3," The words ""ANHYDROUS AMMONIA"" and ""NONFLAMMABLE"" need to appear in large green letters on both sides and either end of the tank, along with U.S. Department of Transportation placards showing the code number ""1005"" alongside those words. The words ""INHALATION HAZARD"" need to appear on 2 of the 4 sides.


Many states regard farmers' transport tanks as ""implements of husbandry."" As such, they must comply with the state's regulations for such implements, in addition to federal regulations.

, You'll need a drawbar, hitch pin, safety clip and safety chains, which should be secured and inspected each time you set out on the highway, as should the wagon's tires and wheel lug nuts. An improperly secured tank wagon may fishtail from side to side, which could cause it to overturn or collide with another vehicle.

, Slow-moving vehicles can travel no faster than 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour), and must display a slow-moving vehicle emblem at the rear.


Individual states may have additional requirements for tank wagons being towed at night to display lights and reflectors to be better seen by oncoming vehicles.

Investigate about the Diels-Alder reaction's discovery by two chemists in Germany that were awarded the Nobel Prize for its discovery.,
Master the theory as the fundamental to understanding reactions in the organic lab as well as in inorganic chemistry also.,
Use knowledge of the Diels-Alder reaction theory in predicting correctly, in many cases, that reactivity of organic compounds is governed by the highest occupied molecular orbital in the molecule and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital which are called HOMO and LUMO respectively.,
Plan to setup your reaction to collect data on two reacting components involved in the Diels-Alder reaction.,
Read theoretical and experimental studies on many systems with various types of substituents.,
Examine the impact of substituents on organic compounds in general that can have dramatic effects on the electronic properties of the compound and on its chemical reactivity.",How to Study the Diels Alder Reaction in Organic Chemistry," This reaction although considered now obsolete is still a powerful synthetic tool for the construction of two carbon bonds stereospecifically. Variations of this reaction include its application to heterocyclic aromatic compounds cyclo-addition reactions with appropriate dienophiles. This reaction does not have biologically analogous reactions and is a purely synthetic method that was designed and discovered in the organic research laboratory.
, Its explanation relies heavily on theory that without it, would not be possible to rationalize products of this reaction. The same phenomena occurred with electro-cyclic reactions which eventually were rationalized only based on theoretical arguments from the molecular orbitals theory of organic compounds., It is one type of organic reactions among several reactions that are collectively referred to as cyclo-addition reactions. All these reactions under this category proceed based on similar basic rules that are governed by one of the theories of molecular orbitals theory of organic compounds which is called the frontier molecular orbitals theory.

This theory works quite well at least for these cyclo-addition reactions in addition to all electro-cyclic organic reactions.
This observation has been studied theoretically extensively and found to be compatible with the experimental results.
This trend also is compatible with the theory of valence bond theory which postulates that the most important electrons in a compound and which are responsible for its chemical reactivity are those that are located in the outermost electronic shell of the molecule.

, One of them is a diene and the other is a dienophile. The diene is usually a derivative of butadiene and the dienophile is a derivative of ethylene. This reaction proceeds with high rate only when there is a matching in energy between the diene and the dienophile that are the components of the reaction. Also more important is the matching in symmetry between the frontier orbitals on the two reactants. These are usually the HOMO of the diene and the LUMO of the dienophile. These two orbitals must be close in energy and also must match in their symmetry. Otherwise this reaction will not work. This the most basic form of this reaction that was developed further to measure the effect of substitution of both the diene and the dienophile with a substituent on the electronic properties of the reactants and on the rate of this reaction., Their results have showed that the best/optimal conditions for this reaction to take place is when there is an electron rich substituent on the diene and electron poor substituent on the dienophile. This requirement brings the HOMO of the diene closer in energy to the LUMO of the dienophile. This type of substitution is called normal Diels-Alder reaction. An inverse demand Diels-Alder reaction means the substitution of an electron rich substituent on the dienophile and an electron poor substituent on the diene. This arrangement should bring the LUMO of the diene close in energy to the HOMO of the dienophile. This reaction can also take place in this arrangement of the orbitals provided they are of similar symmetry., This is a general trend in all chemical compounds and is not restricted to dienes and dienophiles. This achieved is by influencing the energy levels of the chemically governing orbitals of the compound which are the HOMO and LUMO.

This reaction is usually thermodynamically driven by the favorable formation of two sigma bonds instead of two pi bonds.
This reaction is also entropically disfavored due to the formation of one compound from two reacting fragments.
The rate of this reaction was shown also to be influenced by the effect of solvent choice and by the effect of Lewis acids on the reaction. This reaction usually proceeds in a concerted manner. This means that there is only one transition state without the involvement of reactive intermediates.

Wear a lab coat or apron.,
Protect your eyes with safety goggles.,
Use acid-resistant gloves.,
Locate emergency showers, eyewash stations, and lab spill kit.,
Educate yourself on what to do in the event of a spill.",How to Handle Acids1," Any time you work with acids, it is important to wear a lab coat or lab apron. Be sure that the sleeves cover your wrists and that it is buttoned all the way up. You will also want to make sure you meet certain safety requirements with what you wear in general. For example, you should wear closed toe shoes, long pants, and keep your hair pulled back.;
, It is also crucial for you to protect your eyes when working with acids. Use a pair of a large safety goggles that cover your eyes, both in the front and on both sides. Safety goggles often come in multiple sizes, and sometimes have an adjustable strap in the back. Be sure to select goggles that fit properly, and/or make adjustments for a snug fit.

, In order to properly handle acids, you will also need protective covering on your hands. Wear a pair of gloves, made from an acid-resistant material, such as nitrile or butyl.

, Your lab should be equipped with emergency showers, emergency eyewash stations, and at least one lab spill kit. Familiarize yourself with the locations of these stations and kits before you begin your work with acids.


If your lab does not contain these stations or kits, discontinue your work in that space, as it is not safe for handling acids.

, When a chemical or acid spill occurs, you must act quickly without panicking. You will be better able to accomplish this task if you are well educated on what to do.

Use acid-compatible containers.,
Check containers for any damages or leaks.,
Utilize a fume hood.,
Use the right size container for the job.,
Store acids in a dedicated “corrosives cabinet.” For your own safety and the safety of your lab, it is a good idea to store all acids in a dedicated “corrosives cabinet” or “acid cabinet.” For the most part, you will want to avoid storing acids alongside bases.",How to Handle Acids2," There are a wide variety of materials used for laboratory containers (such as PVC, LDPE, PP, and many others). Different acids will have divergent effects on these materials. As such, it is crucial to determine which material will be best suited for storing and transferring the acid (or acids) you will be using.


For example, chromic acid (at 10%-50%) can be safely stored in LDPE.
Acetic acid (50%), however, should be kept in PP.
It is important to reference a chemical compatibility chart to determine the best material for your containers., In addition to selecting the correct material for your containers, it is very important to ensure that your containers are intact. Carefully inspect each container for leaks, cracks, or other damage before use.


If you determine that a container is unusable, be sure to dispose of it according to the guidelines of your lab (Often, there will specific disposal bins for various materials.)

, An excellent safety measure is to conduct all operations involving acid underneath a fume hood. It is best to work at least six inches inside the fume hood, to ensure the highest level of contaminant capture.

, In addition to selecting a container of the proper material, it is most safe to use a container of the correct size. Use of a container that is too large or too small can result in spills, leaks, or other hazards.,


Always label acids before storing them.
Consider using a color-coded cap system (acetic acid = brown, phosphoric acid = white, hydrochloric acid = blue).

Consult the MSDS.,
Use a volumetric flask.,
Begin with 2/3 of your water.,
Add acid to water.,
Add remaining water.",How to Handle Acids3," Always review the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) before using any hazardous material in the laboratory. This guide will provide you with any necessary warnings, proper protocol, and important information about the acid (or other material) you are about to work with.

, Before you begin preparing your solution, use a volumetric flask to measure your concentrated acid and distilled water. Be sure to use a flask made of borosilicate (or Pyrex), as this material will be acid-safe.

, To prepare an acid solution, begin by measuring out 2/3 the required amount of distilled water. Add the appropriate amount of acid to this, and stir to combine.

, When preparing solutions, you should always add acid to water, never the other way around. You should never add water to concentrated acid! This can generate acidic steam, and as a result, can very easily cause spills, accidents, and/or injuries.

, Once your solution has cooled to room temperature, add water to dilute the solution to proper volume. (This will be the remaining 1/3 of the required distilled water).

Utilize emergency showers or eyewash stations.,
Remove all contaminated clothing in the shower.,
Apply calcium gluconate gel.,
Assess the spill.,
Evacuate the area.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Handle Acids4," If you should be exposed to acids, the very first thing you should do is proceed to the emergency showers (if your body was exposed) or the eyewash station (if the acid made contact with your eyes). Flush the contacted area with water for at least 15 minutes.

, If your body and clothing have been exposed to acid, remove any and all contaminated clothing while you are in the emergency shower. You can dispose of this contaminated apparel later.

, If the spill contains hydrofluoric acid (HF) and it has made contact with your skin, you will need to apply a calcium gluconate gel right away. This will help to neutralize the hydrofluoric acid, stop the burn, and provide you with some relief., Very quickly, you will need to decide if this is a spill that can be handled by the laboratory staff, or one that requires immediate, large-scale evacuation. This will vary slightly by the capacity of your laboratory and staff. Make sure you understand what types of spills fall under which category. When an emergency occurs, quickly decide what needs to be done.

, In the event of an acid spill, the laboratory will need to be evacuated. In some severe cases, you may need to evacuate the whole building. After the most acute injuries have been addressed, make sure that everyone is removed from the area.


If you are on a university campus, you should also notify campus police.

, Depending on the severity of your injuries, it may be necessary to seek medical attention. If you have sustained burns, injuries to the eyes, of have inhaled acid fumes, it is a good idea to visit your local doctor or hospital.

Determine the desirability or feasibility of replacing devices that contain mercury or sources of mercury in your home.,
Keep mercury contained.",How to Locate Liquid Mercury in the Home," Mercury (also known as quicksilver) is an element (symbol Hg) and has an atomic number 80 on the Periodic Table of Elements. Since mercury is solid below -38ºC (above -38ºC it melts into a liquid) and boils into a gas when the temperature rises above 356ºC, in the home it would be found in a liquid state. It would look like a highly reflective, silver liquid.;
, The most common items are fluorescent light bulbs, thermometers and electrical switches such as thermostats that control heating and air conditioning equipment and some float switches like those used to automatically turn sump pumps on and off. Some batteries also contain mercury. Some indoor paint and outdoor paint might contain mercury, as well as some inks. Many antiques such as barometers, some grandfather clocks, old medical equipment, and aircraft calibration tools also contain mercury.


If you are not sure whether an item contains mercury, contact the manufacturer and ask for their advice.
Locate fluorescent lights. A small amount of mercury is also used in all fluorescent lamps, regardless of whether or not they have the ""green"" ends.
Drugs and cosmetics may contain mercury. Some drugs use mercury as a preservative; ask your pharmacist for advice and always dispose of outdated and unwanted medications properly.

, In the past, dentists used mercury to make ""silver"" dental fillings. The impact of such fillings can include inhalation of mercury vapor but the impact of amalgams may be dependent on your personal body burden of toxic chemicals.There is other dental filling material (such as gold) that can be used instead, but using it is more costly than the silver fillings.

, Methylmercury in fish is one of the most toxic forms of mercuryand it's easily ingested through eating contaminated fish or seafood.

, The need to replace mercury-filled items will depend on their age and their condition in many cases. You may simply feel happier not having anything with mercury in the house but keeping in mind the costs of replacement, it can be more efficient to replace items that are old, worn, or broken first. Any broken item that contains mercury should be removed from the home environment (see the following step for what to do). If you want to remove devices and sources of mercury in your home, here are some suggested alternatives:



Thermometers can be changed to an electronic type or to the type that uses red dyed alcohol.
Thermostats can be replaced with an electronic or programmable model.
Fluorescent lamps could be changed to incandescent or LED types. Note that incandescent bulbs have been banned or phased out in some jurisdictions.
Float switches would require a completely different actuation or detection and would need the application to be assessed.

Dental fillings could be removed and replaced. Speak with your dentist about the risks and costs involved. Not all dentists will be happy to perform this procedure, and some people are concerned the removal process could be more harmful than leaving the mercury amalgam fillings in place. Do your own research first to determine how you feel about this source. Do not have amalgams removed while pregnant.Choose fish with low levels of mercury.

, Handling mercury is not difficult while it is encapsulated in the products listed above. Simple care to prevent breakage of the container is all that is required. Mercury that is allowed to escape however is not easily retrieved. It will break up into many small droplets and ""roll away"" into low areas. Here is what to do if you accidentally break a container, which releases mercury:


Remove all people and pets from the area apart from the person cleaning; you can do without the distraction and children and pets can be easily lured to the balls formed.
Turn off all sources of heat and ventilate the area as best you can.
Remove any jewelry, put on a pair of gloves and start retrieving the mercury droplets. Try to recover as much as possible by scooping up the droplets with a stiff piece of paper or an eyedropper; also, a damp paper towel or wet wipe may be used. If there are any last droplets, use sticky tape to pick them up. Place the droplets and the cleaning items in a sealable plastic bag for proper disposal, double bag it and label it ""mercury waste"". Call up your local municipality to find out where to dispose of the toxic waste; do not simply place it in your usual garbage.

Never use a vacuum cleaner or broom to clean up the spill.
If the mercury spill is on carpet, cut out the piece of carpet and dispose of it as well in a double plastic bag.

Define the resonance effect.,
Learn about the delocalization effect.,
State the principles of resonance.,
Draw a Lewis structure of the molecule.,
Identify the bonds that can alternate to form resonant structures.,
Diagram all possible resonant Lewis structures.",How to Study the Resonance Effect in Organic Chemistry," The resonance effect is a chemical phenomenon observed in compounds characteristic of double bonds of organic compounds. Organic compounds that contain double bonds in their structure are usually made of the overlap of p-orbitals on two adjacent carbon atoms (referred to as pi bonds).A single bond is often called a sigma bond and is present in compounds which have only one bond between the adjacent carbon atoms. Sigma bonds are usually lower in energy than pi bonds and also have higher symmetry than pi bonds.;
, The delocalization effect has been experimentally determined by measuring the heat of formation of the double bond containing compound alone and comparing it with the heat of formation of the sum of all the double bonds in the compound individually. The result of these measurements shows that the heat of formation of the whole molecule is lower than that of the sum of the heat of formation of its constituent double bonds measured singly.This indicates that the molecules exists in a hybrid resonance state with a lower energy than that of a single individual resonance structure. In other words, they are more stable.
Aromatic compounds are especially stable due to this bond delocalization and resonance effect., Not all resonant structures are equally significant to the compound. There are a few principles involved that can help you determine how significant a resonance structure is.,The rules of least charges: The resonant form with the lowest overall charge is the most significant.
The octet principle: The resonance forms with a full octet are more significant than those lacking a full outer shell.
Stabilization of positive charges: Forms where positive charges are acting on the least electronegative atom are the most significant.
Stabilization of negative charges: Forms where negative charges are acting on the most electronegative atom are the most significant.
Covalent bonds: The most significant resonance structure has the most covalent bonds.

, A Lewis structure is a simplified representation of a molecule. It shows how atoms are bound together and their valence electron states.Start by writing the chemical symbol of each element.
Single bonds are represented with a line connecting the two atoms bound.
Double bonds are represented by two lines and triple bonds by three.
Valence electrons (electrons in the outer shell of the atom) are represented by dots next to the atom.
Remember to indicate the overall charge of the molecule with a “+” or “-“ at the top right of the structure.
For example: O3 has three oxygens all bound together. The oxygen in the middle is bound to the other two oxygens by one single bond and one double bond.

, Molecules that have resonant structures actually exist in a hybrid state between the different structures formed by the variations in bonds. While you may draw the various Lewis structures as separate molecules, that is just a way to pictorially represent them. Electrons that form double bonds can switch between atoms, slightly changing the way the structure is drawn.


Bonds of this nature are said to be “delocalized”, as they are distributed evenly across all the atoms in the compound.For example: O3 has two resonant structures. The double bond can be between the first and second oxygen or between the second and third oxygen.

, Once you have identified the bonds that can alternate in the compound, you can draw the various Lewis structures for each version. It is also possible to draw a representative hybrid structure by using a dashed line where the bond could be either a single bond or a double bond.


For example: You can draw two O3 structures with the two possible bond configurations or one O3 structure with dashed lines representing the bonds.Draw a double-sided arrow between each structure to indicate that they are resonance structures.

Never mess with an unlabeled chemical. It may be corrosive and dangerous to your skin, and mixing it with other chemicals could produce toxic fumes or even an explosion.
Know the difference between an acid and a base. Every chemical has a property known as the ""pH level"" which indicates its concentration of hydrogen ions.In chemistry, each chemical's pH level is determined on a scale from 0 to 14 with 0 being ""very acidic,"" 7 being ""neutral,"" and 14 being ""very basic."" Both acidic and basic chemicals can be dangerous and corrosive to your skin and can create dangerous chemical reactions when mixed. For example, battery acid is a dangerous acid and lye and ammonia are dangerous bases. Add acids to water instead of the other way around. Adding water to an acid will cause heat to build up, and may cause an explosion.Bleach is a particularly dangerous but common chemical. Never mix bleach with acids or bases, such as ammonia or other household cleaners. Doing so can produce a toxic gas that can be fatal if inhaled.If you're not sure whether chemicals are safe to combine, do not combine them.
Never use mouth suction to fill a pipette with a chemical. You may inhale or accidentally swallow some. Instead, always use a bulb syringe.;
, All well-equipped chemistry labs have sources of heat like a Bunsen burner or electric heating coil, in order to complete various chemical experiments. These heat sources are often the source of accidents in the lab, ranging from minor burns from handling hot glassware to clothing or hair accidentally set on fire from a Bunsen burner.


Always practice extra caution around sources of heat and fire. Do not reach across open flames or heat sources, which could set your sleeve on fire or burn your arm.

, Glass tubing is a frequent cause of lab accidents, as it can snap into sharp pieces if you forget to lubricate it before putting it through a stopper or cork. Other dangers include beakers that might be accidentally dropped, particularly because they can be awkward to handle while wearing gloves.Move slowly and deliberately in the lab to avoid breaking glass and causing cuts or other damage. If you break glassware in the lab on accident, be careful while disposing of it; the shards are sharp and may cut you, even through protective gloves.
Never use beakers or burners that are damaged in any way. A cracked beaker may explode when heated.

, While some accidents are unpredictable, most lab accidents are the result of negligence, horsing around, or not following instructions and thus can be totally prevented by being mindful and having the right attitude while in a lab setting.


Listen to the instructor and follow directions. Now is not the time to be adventurous or try your own thing.
Save chatting with your friends or goofing off for after lab is over. You need to focus on what you're doing so that you can stay safe. Running, dancing, being loud and boisterous, or any other kind of horseplay is dangerous and not a mature way to behave in a lab.

, Using a buddy system in the lab is an important way to stay safe: if anything happens to you in the lab, someone is there who can help you or go for more help if needed.Ask a teacher, friend, or colleague to work with you in the lab as you are learning the ropes.


If it's not possible to have someone with you in the lab, at the very least you should let people know that you are using it. Tell a friend or parent that you will call when you're done, and give them an expected time, so that they will know if you don't get in touch then something is wrong.

, Every chemistry lab is set up slightly different, which means that the things you need to stay safe may be hard to find in an emergency. Even if you are just helping someone else in a lab, you may need to locate safety gear in case they are incapacitated. Locate the following before doing any kind of work in a chemistry lab.All exits to the lab (check to see if windows are locked, and unlock them if possible)
Fire extinguisher and fire blankets
Chemical shower
Eye wash station
First aid kit
Telephone

, Chemicals can be harmless (such as water) or highly corrosive and dangerous (like sulfuric acid). If a chemical is unlabeled and you are not familiar with it, leave it alone until an instructor can tell you what to do.


Never sniff directly from a container with an unknown chemical. Some chemicals are highly toxic and can kill you if you inhale them. You can use one hand to ""waft"" the scent toward your nose from the top of an open container, rather than inhaling it.
Similarly, never taste an unknown chemical. Doing so could be fatal.

, If you are in school, do not deviate from the lab procedure given to you by your instructor, such as by substituting another chemical or adding them in inexact quantities.If your instructor wants you to make a deviation, do so only with her supervision.


Every detail in a lab procedure matters, including which chemical to add to the other, the exact temperature to heat it to, amounts to measure, or any other details given.

, If you spill any amount of a chemical on yourself, wash yourself immediately with cool water.


Depending on where you've spilled the chemicals, you may need to use an eye wash station, hand washing sink, or an emergency chemical shower. If you've spilled harsh or corrosive chemicals on your clothes, you may need to remove the clothing, or even strip naked if your clothes are saturated. Nobody wants to get naked in front of their lab colleagues, but it is better than living with burns on your skin!

, Similarly, you should not prepare food in the lab or store it there. Even if you are careful to keep the food away from contact with chemicals, your food may still become contaminated with chemical fumes.


For the same reason, never smoke, chew gum, or apply cosmetics in a lab.

, When you finish a lab, you should leave it how you found it. That means replacing everything where it belongs or leaving it where your instructor prefers. A clean lab is a safer lab!


Be sure to push your chair back in and close all cabinets and drawers before you leave, to ensure that the lab is safe for the next users.

, A chemistry lab is no time to be fashion conscious. Your clothing choices should be made with your safety in mind.


Wear something that shows little skin; long pants and sleeves are ideal. Be sure your sleeves are fitted and do not dangle down, and be sure your clothing are easy to remove in case they become saturated with a chemical and have to be taken off.
Wear closed-toe shoes that are easy to walk in safely (no high heels!), and if you have long hair, tie it back so that it doesn't hang down and possibly catch fire or dip into a chemical. Similarly, do not wear dangling bracelets, necklaces, or earrings.
If safety aprons are available, wear these over your clothes.

, Your eyes are very vulnerable, and getting even just a small bit of a chemical in your eye could permanently blind you. Even if you are not working with chemicals, you should wear chemical splash goggles while in the lab; someone else may spill a chemical and it could splash into your eyes inadvertently.Be sure your goggles fit snugly but not too tight. Try them on before the lab begins to ensure that they fit, and do not proceed with the lab if they do not fit.
If you wear glasses, they are not adequate to keep chemical splashes out of your eyes, since chemicals could come from the side and go under your lenses. Wear your safety googles on top of your glasses.
If you wear contact lenses, it is important that you wear your glasses instead on days when you will be working in the lab. In the rare case that a chemical got into your eye while wearing contacts, it would be very difficult to remove them and rinse the eyes without causing more damage to the eyes.

, Your instructor will tell you when they are necessary. If you are working with corrosive chemicals, wear gloves as they will prevent any spillages from damaging your skin. Wear gloves appropriate to the chemicals you are working with.


When you work with highly corrosive materials, such as concentrated sulfuric acid, thin latex gloves (the one your dentist uses) will not protect you and will only make you think you are safe. Should you spill anything onto any glove (latex, neoprene, any sort of gloves) put the chemical away as safely and quickly as possible and take off your gloves. Wash your hands, then wash or dispose of your gloves in a hazardous waste receptacle.
Always check your gloves before beginning the lab to ensure that they are free of holes or small cracks.

Always attend class.,
Read the material before the lecture.,
Do the homework.,
Have a model kit handy.,
Make flashcards.,
Prepare for tests.",How to Survive and Thrive in Your First Organic Chemistry Class1," Most organic chemistry courses are split into two sections: lecture and lab. Lectures can be held for hundreds of students at a time, and as such attendance is rarely taken. However, don't think you can get away with only attending labs. Going to class as much as you possibly can is vital to your success.


Attend TA sessions. If you're studying at a large university, your organic chemistry class will have several teaching assistants who will hold independent study sessions. Find one scheduled at a time that works for you, and go as often as possible. Additionally, the TAs will have office hours, during which you can drop in and ask questions.;
, You'll get more out of the class if you read the chapter before attending the lecture on that chapter. Make note of any questions you have the night before. If the professor hasn't answered your reading questions by the end of the discussion, approach him or her after class for more clarification.

, If you're attending a large organic chemistry lecture, you probably won't have to hand in homework every week and will be graded solely on tests. However, doing the questions in your textbook is excellent practice, whether they're assigned or not. Try to do them as soon as possible after class, and stick to the Reading -> Lecture -> Homework model.


Take your time. Don't rush through the problems. Concentrate on each step as you go. Understand the problem and doing it correctly is better than making mistakes.

, You can buy a model kit at your university bookstore, or find a used one online. It will help you see what's happening to a molecule in three-dimensional terms, which will be useful when you're studying isomers.

, A lot of your success in organic chemistry will depend on memorizing certain reactions. Here are a few things you should know in addition to specific reactions:


Where most of the electron density is (especially double bonds)
Shapes of orbitals
Know what has high bond strain and what doesn't
Know your orbitals s, p and d. (f is useless to know at this point)
Memorize a few NMR and IR shifts and peak wavelengths. Especially hydroxyl, carbon bonds 1-3, aldehydes, and ketones.
The chair and boat isomer forms of cyclohexane
How to find the HOMO and LUMO of molecules

, Take organic chemistry tests seriously. Set aside time to study every day for at least a week before the test. Get sufficient sleep the night before, and eat a healthy breakfast.

Learn the dress code for your lab.,
Know where the wash stations are.,
Be extra cautious.,
Read ahead.,
Learn the wafting technique.,
Know the format for lab write-ups.",How to Survive and Thrive in Your First Organic Chemistry Class2," Different labs have different standards. However, closed-toe shoes, full-length pants and safety glasses are common requirements.

, Your lab should have at least one eye-wash station, as well as a shower head on the ceiling with a pull-chain. Locate them ahead of time, in case you need them in an emergency.

, Never do something to a compound or solvent that's not indicated in the lab manual. You might think throwing a leftover chunk of sodium in the sink is harmless, but it could explode when it comes into contact with even a drop of water. Always ask your lab TA how to dispose of materials if you're unsure.

, Read the procedure of your next lab at least a few days beforehand. It is probably better to read one more lab beyond where that as well. Have data that will be or could be in the lab write up, do not wait until the last minute. As is true in normal class, organic chemistry lab is best done one step at a time and not in a rush.

, If you do not use the wafting technique, you could end up passed out from the fumes of compounds like sulfuric acid. Be very careful. Here's how to do it:


Keep the sample at least a foot or so from you.
Move a column of air with your hand wafting toward you in a gentle circular motion.
Make sure you keep your hands, eyes, ears, mouth away from the sample.

, The format of a lab write-up can vary from course to course. In general, do not use personal pronouns like ""I"", ""me"" or ""our"". Use third-person voice (""the experiment,"" not ""our"" or ""my"" experiment). Here's how the report should be laid out:


Title: The name of the lab you are doing.
Purpose/Objective: Why you are doing the lab/what can be learned from it.
Materials: The chemicals, equipment and amounts/notes about each.
'Table of reactants/products:' The melting point, boiling point, density, phase and amount of each compound you use in the experiment.
Observations/Notes: What you see in the experiment, anything unusual or something that provides insight into what is going on (e.g the compound (name) fizzed and turned blue).
Results: Your tables, graphs, numbers, equations and work shown for the experiment.
Conclusion: What you conclude from the data you gathered, based on your results section. Explain your results in terms related to the experiment.

Take the name of the element attached (chlorine) and replace the -ine with -o (chloro). Use the same group prefixes to describe the amount. Ex: CF3CHBrCl is named 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane.;
, An alcohol is a carbon chain with a hydroxide (OH-) attached. Name the carbon chain, using the suffix -anol. Place a number in front to indicate what carbon the hydroxide is attached to.
Ex: CH3CH2CH2(OH) is named 1-propanol.

, The shorter of the two chains becomes the first part of the name (use a prefix). Then add ""oxy"". Then add the longest chain, prefixed with the ending -ane.

Living things are made up of molecules made mainly of carbon. This means that O chem includes the chemistry that goes on inside your body every day. It also includes the chemistry that occurs inside animals, plants, and natural ecosystems.


However, organic chemistry isn't limited to living things. For example, the chemical reactions involved in the burning of fossil fuels fall under the O chem umbrella because these reactions involve carbon-based compounds in the fuels.;
, O chem is a more ""visual"" area of study than general chemistry. You will be relying on drawings of molecules and compounds more often than in previous chemistry classes. Knowing how to interpret these sorts of visual representations is one of the most basic, important O chem skills.


You'll need to be familiar with Lewis structures before you begin. These are typically taught as part of a general chemistry course. In a Lewis structure, atoms in a molecule are represented by their chemical symbol (their letters on the periodic table). Lines represent the bonds between them and dots represent their valence electrons. See our Lewis structure article for a refresher.
One way of drawing molecules that will probably be new to you is the skeletal formula method. In a skeletal formula (also called ""bond-line structure""), carbon atoms are not shown. Instead, there is just a line to represent the bond. Since there are so many carbon atoms in O chem, this makes it much quicker to draw molecules. Non-carbon atoms are still represented by their chemical symbols. A good guide to skeletal formations is available here., Covalent bonds are by far the most common type of bonds you will be dealing with in O chem (though knowledge of ionic bonds, etc. is still valuable).In a covalent bond, two atoms share unpaired electrons to form a bond. If extra unpaired electrons are available, double- or triple-bonded atoms are possible.


In both Lewis structures and skeletal formulas, single bonds are represented by one line, double lines by a double line, and triple bonds by a triple line.
In skeletal formulas, the bonds between carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms are not usually drawn because they are so common.
Except in special circumstances, atoms are typically only allowed to have eight valence (outer shell) electrons. This means that most of the time an atom can bond to a maximum of four other atoms.

, Organic chemistry requires students to think about chemical molecules the way they actually exist in real life — not just the way they are drawn. Molecules take the form of three-dimensional structures. The nature of the bonds in the molecule is the most important thing for determining the 3-D shape of a molecule, though other factors can sometimes also play a role. Below are a few things to remember when it comes to the shapes of carbon-based molecules:


A carbon bonded to four other atoms with single bonds will have the shape of a tetrahedron (four-pointed pyramid). A good example of this is the molecule methane (CH4)
A carbon bonded to another atom with a double bond and two atoms with single bonds has a trigonal planar (flat triangle) shape. The ion CO3-2 is a good example here.
A carbon bonded to two atoms with double bonds or bonded to one album with a triple bond has a linear (rigid line) shape. The molecule carbon dioxide (CO2) is one example.

, This topic has an intimidating name, but it's not that hard to understand. Essentially, hybrid orbitals are just ways that chemists represent an atom's valence electrons based on how that atom behaves (rather how it is drawn). If an atom has a certain number of unpaired electrons available for bonding but tends to form a different number of bonds, it is said that it has ""hybrid orbitals"" to make up the difference.


Carbon is a perfect example of this. Carbon atoms have four valence electrons: two in the 2s orbital and two unpaired ones in the 2p orbital. Since there are two unpaired electrons, it might be expected that carbon will form two bonds. However, experiments show that the paired electrons in the 2s orbital form bonds even though they are not unpaired. Thus, we say that the carbon atom has four unpaired electrons in an sp hybrid orbital.

, There are many, many factors that can determine how two molecules react with each other in O chem. However, electronegativity is often one of the most important factors. Electronegativity is a way of measuring how ""tightly"" a given atom holds its electrons. Atoms with high electronegativity tend to hold their electrons tightly (and vice versa for atoms with low electronegativity). See our electronegativity article for detailed information.


As you go up and to the right in the periodic table, atoms gain more electronegativity (hydrogen and helium are not included). Fluorine, the atom in the very top top right, has the highest electronegativity of all.
Because electronegative atoms ""want"" more electrons, they tend to react by ""grabbing"" available electrons on other molecules. For example, atoms like chlorine and fluorine often appear as negative ions because they have taken electrons from other atoms., Organic chemistry introduces a lot of new concepts and forces you to think about chemistry problems in new ways. You will have to learn a whole new chemistry ""vocabulary."" Relax — everyone in your class is facing the same challenges. Study diligently and get the help you need and you will likely be fine.


Don't let horror stories from people who have taken O chem before get to you. Students tend to embellish how difficult their experiences were. Going into your first test terrified that you are facing an impossible challenge will only make things harder.Instead, boost your confidence by spending plenty of time studying and getting plenty of rest the night before.

, You will likely see hundreds of different reactions in your O chem class. It's virtually impossible to memorize them all, so don't waste your time memorizing any but the most important. Instead, focus on the basic principles behind the most common reactions. Most reactions follow one of just a few patterns, so understanding these patterns well and knowing how to apply them is a much more efficient way to get problems right.


However, if you are good at memorization, you can still use this to your advantage. Try writing basic reaction mechanisms on flashcards and using these to memorize the reactions. You'll still need to be able to adjust your knowledge when you see reactions that you're not familiar with, but you can use the basic principles to guide you towards the correct mechanism.

, Basic O chem uses the same set of reactive structures in nearly all of its molecules. These structures are known as ""functional groups."" Knowing how to identify these functional groups as well as how they tend to react it crucial for many O chem assignments. Since functional groups usually react in the same way with consistency, knowing their traits allows you to solve a wide variety of problems.


There are too many functional groups in organic chemistry to list in this article. However, it's not hard to find guides to the functional groups online. For example, a good guide from Purdue University is available here.

, At their most basic level, most organic chemistry reactions just involve two or more molecules exchanging electrons. If you can't figure out how to get started on a reaction mechanism, start by looking for places where it makes sense for electrons to transfer. In other words, look for atoms that seem like especially good electron acceptors and atoms that look like especially good electron donors. Make the transfer and then ask, ""what do I need to do now to get my new molecules to a stable state?""


As one example, since oxygen (O) is more electronegative than carbon, the O that is double-bonded to C in a ketone group tends to hold the electrons in the bond closer to itself. This gives C a partially positive charge and makes it a good candidate to receive electrons. If you have a good electron donor involved in the reaction, it makes sense that it might attack the C, forming a new bond and kicking off your reaction.

, Don't ever feel like you need to tackle organic chemistry by yourself. Getting together to do your work with your fellow students is a fantastic idea. Not only can others help you with concepts you're struggling with — you can also get a stronger grasp on material you already know by explaining it to someone else.

, The person with the best knowledge of O chem in your classroom is the person teaching the class. Take advantage of this valuable resource. Visit your teacher's office to discuss areas you are having trouble with. Try to have a few clear, succinct questions to ask or a problem or two that you are having trouble with. Be ready to explain the thought process that got you to the wrong answer.


Avoid walking into your professor's office without a clear idea of what you want. Simply saying ""I don't get the homework"" won't get you useful help.
Not only is this a great way of getting your questions answered — it can also help you get to know your professor. Keep in mind that if you're aiming for grad school, you will need a few academic references in the future. Professors are much more likely to write positively of people that took the time to talk to them.

, In O chem, the shapes of molecules can determine how they react. Because it can be difficult to represent complex 3D molecules on a flat piece of paper, using physical building blocks is a great way to wrap your head around difficult structures.


Molecular model sets allow you to build molecules out of plastic pieces. These can be somewhat expensive if you buy them from your school's book store or a chemical supplier, but some professors will loan them out to students who ask for them at no cost.
If you can't get your hands on a ""real"" model set, try using foam balls, markers, and wooden dowels from your local craft store for a DIY alternative.
Various computer programs (like the one available here) can also help you model molecules in three dimensions., One of the silver linings of O chemistry's high difficulty level is that there are lots of students looking for help online (as well as offering it). Various online chemistry forums have large communities of users willing to discuss difficult organic topics. Try posting a problem that you're having trouble with on one of these forums, then work with the people who respond to get the help you need.


Though there are many forums for these sorts of problems, chemicalforums.com is a good place to start., A wide variety of sites can help with difficult O chem topics. Just a few good resources are listed below:



Khan Academy: Hosts numerous video lectures covering a variety of basic topics.Chem Helper: Has links to practice tests, help forums, reaction mechanisms, and more. Also includes laboratory help.University of South Carolina Aiken: Includes its own directory of helpful websites covering a variety of O chem topics.

Normally you will be given an IUPAC name instead of a formula, you may want to look at How to Name a Hydrocarbon Chain Using the IUPAC Method to help you.;
, It will be made up of a few snippets of words (think ""bromo"", ""hexa"", ""ane"", ""cyclo"", and others) and some numbers. The numbers denote the location of the atom or functional group. Sometimes this will be followed by a name, for example 2-bromo (Bromine off Carbon 2) but sometimes not, for example 3-pentone, ""pentone"" being the name describing the main organic chain of the compound. The ""one"" means there is a Ketone, but the ""pent"" is talking about the general structure, saying it has 5 Carbons total. You would not say ""3-ketone pentane"".

, This will be denoted by using the prefix on the name of the chemical, see the list below. If the first 5 letters are ""cyclo,"" this means the structure is polygonal in nature, we will cover this more in step 5.

1 carbon: Meth
2 carbons: Eth
3 carbons: Prop
4 carbons: But
5 carbons: Pent
6 carbons: Hex
7 carbons: Hept
8 carbons: Oct
9 carbons: Non
10 carbons: Dec

, For example, if you have 1-bromo 2,3 pentene (all the alkenes with chemical formula C5H10), look at the ""pentene"". If the first five letters of that word are ""cyclo"" then you have a compound that is polygonal in nature. the prefix after the ""cyclo"" tells you how many carbons, and by extension what shape you have. For example, ""cyclohexane"" is a polygonal structure with 6 carbons making up the ring, meaning it is a hexagon. If you see the word ""Benzene"" then you have a special polygonal structure. ""Benzene"" is the word that refers to a hexagon with alternating single and double bonds, it has the formula C6H6.


, You are drawing the bonds between the carbon atoms, with an atom residing at each end of the line segments you have drawn. If there are any non-carbon atoms making up the chain, do not denote them yet.

, This is done by drawing a line above or beneath the specified line segment. Skip this step if your structures name ends with ""ane.""

If your structure has a double bond, the last three letters of the main word will be ""ene."" The structure will also have two consecutive numbers with a comma separating them before the main name, for example 2,3-Hexene. The ""2,3"" means the double bond is between the second and third carbon.






The procedure is the same for a triple bond, except the last three letters to look for are ""yne."" For example 2,3-Hexyne would mean a 6 carbon molecule with a triple bond between carbons 2 and 3.
If you have a triple bond in your molecule, make sure to draw the functional groups on either side coming off at a 180 degree angle.







, Do this by either erasing the apex and drawing the atomic symbol (see the N between carbons 3 and 4 as an example) or by adding in an additional bond line and writing the symbol at the end of it. Note that the carbons in the backbone of the molecule are indirectly labelled as apexes and ends of lines. Hydrogens off of these carbons are not denoted at all, but rather implied. Any hydrogens contained in functional groups are usually written, for example NH2, OH, COOH, and others.

Be aware of the history of this branch of organic chemistry.,
Study the versatility of these reactions.,
Study the sigmatropic shifts.,
Study conjugated double bonds.,
Study the correlation diagram, which is important for the understanding of how electrocyclic reactions proceed.,
Note that electrocyclic reactions are mostly thermodynamically driven due to the formation of a sigma bond instead of an existing double bond.,
Study the electrocyclic reactions kinetically.",How to Study Electrocyclic Reactions in Organic Chemistry," Electrocyclic reactions are a class of organic reactions that are important from the theoretical point of view to the computational chemist. They are also important from the practical point of view to the practitioner organic chemist. In order to understand how electrocyclic reactions occur and proceed, one needs solid information in the area of molecular orbitals theory of organic systems in particular.;
, This area of organic chemistry was investigated theoretically by two American chemists one previously at Harvard called Woodward (deceased) and the other an emeritus professor at Cornell University. These two scientists investigated many electrocyclic organic reactions from the theoretical point of view and came up with a collection of chemical observations that are called the Woodward and Hoffman rules of electrocyclic reactions. These formulated laws are basic and fundamental to the understanding of this type of reactions.
The impetus for discovering these electrocyclic reactions stemmed from the fact that the chemist at Harvard was doing certain synthetic work in the organic laboratory and was unable to rationalize the products that he obtained in his flask. This led him to collaborate with the other scientist from Cornell to investigate the possible pathways of these interesting reactions. Roald Hoffmann is a distinguished professor of theoretical chemistry that has sound mathematical background. This background helped him to exceed other scientists in this area of chemistry due to their poor mathematical skills. He also won the Nobel prize along with Woodward for his contributions to the understanding of the chemistry of the electrocyclic reactions and for his formulation of its laws that are called the Woodward and Hoffman rules of electrocyclic reactions.

, Electrocyclic reactions are versatile type of organic chemical reactions that share in common The presence of unsaturated conjugated organic compounds that can undergo reactions in several ways. An example of such an electrocyclic reaction which has been extensively studied is the Diels-Alder reaction which is a very powerful synthetic method in chemistry for the generation of two carbon bonds at the same time. In the chemical literature there are hundreds of research articles on this reaction and its variations. Most explanations to the manner in which this reaction occurs are based on theoretical work from the molecular orbitals theory area of chemistry and in particular the electrocyclic reactions theory predicts very confidently the fate of this type of reactions chemically.

, The sigmatropic shifts of hydrogen atom and of organic functional groups occur in an organic conjugated system of double bonds. Hydrogen atoms were observed experimentally to shift from one carbon to another under thermal effects or under the effect of UV light. These shifts are well understood and rationalized based on the molecular orbitals theory that include a description of the shape of the p orbitals along the conjugated system with its symmetry. Symmetry of the frontier orbitals on the reacting compound in this respect is fundamental to the understanding of how the reaction will take place and to predict the behavior of the reactant molecules.


Sigmatropic shifts are governed by the HOMO orbital symmetry of the conjugated system. The effect of light is completely different than the thermal effect on the fate of the electrocyclic reaction. In a light induced reaction electrons are promoted from the HOMO to the LUMO. This process changes the roles of the frontier orbitals making the previous LUMO now HOMO. This in turn changes the symmetry of the orbital that is involved in the reaction.

, Conjugated double bonds can undergo electrocyclic reactions of ring closure or ring opening. These reactions can occur under thermal conditions or under photochemical effect. In both of these cases the ring closure or opening can be of two basic processes. These are conrotatory and disrotatory ring closure. Conrotatory ring closure refers to bending of the p orbitals that are located on the terminal carbons on the HOMO orbital in the same direction to form new sigma bond between these two carbon atoms. As a result the conjugated pi orbitals framework is changed.

, This diagram explains the building of molecular orbitals. It is a good description of the reaction pathway qualitatively that help to understand the manner in which the reaction occurs. These correlation diagrams are based on connecting molecular orbitals in the diagram that have the same matching in energy and in symmetry. There are many books about this subject in general and about the use of correlation diagrams to understand how electrocyclic reactions proceed.

, They have nonplanar transition states that is very dependent energetically on the symmetry matching of the overlapping orbitals.

, Electrocyclic reactions can be investigated kinetically by the method of labeling using isotopes of hydrogen. These reactions have been investigated for particular systems and the rules are based on these results. Extension to other systems needs investigation for each of the particular system that needs to be done since chemistry in general and organic chemistry in particular is a non-rigorous science that is based on experimental data from previous research that was done on similar systems. Other effects can alter completely the predicted manner of reactivity of a given compound such as the solvent effect and the substituent effect.

Look for an increased number of sigma bonds to identify addition reactions.,
Look for an increased number of pi bonds to indicate elimination reactions.,

Take practice problems seriously.",How to Learn About the Types of Organic Reactions," In other words, look for a greater number of atoms than in the original molecule. This is usually allowed to happen by breaking a pi bond or bonding to a set of unpaired electrons in the molecule. Addition reactions do not “swap” one atom or group for another. They just add something new.Addition reactions usually happen when double or triple bonds are attacked. For example, if a double bond is present between two carbons, and if hydrogen was added across the bond, it would result in hydrogen being added to the molecule. No other species would leave.;
, This is the opposite of an addition reaction. Something will be taken away from the original molecule and leave behind electrons. These unbound electrons will either show up as a lone pair or form a pi bond in the molecule.If you remove hydrogen from a hydrocarbon chain, the result would be that the unpaired electrons go into a double bond between two of the carbons. This does not require anything else to be added, it only removes the hydrogen.

, A substitution reaction occurs when some group (A) on the molecule is removed and replaced by some new group (B). This does not necessarily change the number of pi or sigma bonds in the molecule, as you would see with addition and elimination reactions. Common types of substitution reactions are:Nucleophilic Substitution ― When one nucleophile replaces another nucleophile in the reaction.
Electrophilic Substitution ― When one electrophile replaces another electrophile in the reaction.
SN1 ― A substitution reaction that involves only one molecule in the transition state. In other words, the leaving group leaves first, and then the new group is free to attack the molecule.SN2 ― In this type of reaction, the transition state is formed from two molecules. This happens because the new group attacks the molecule at an available site, and the leaving group is forced to fall away., Rearrangements form isomers ― molecules that have exactly the same atoms present but in a different configuration. Isomers will have the same chemical formula, but different properties that are unique to their configuration. The number of bonds is usually unaffected in rearrangements, as well.There is a subset of rearrangement reactions know as tautomerization. This is when two isomers rapidly flip back and forth between each other.

, Oxidation-reduction (or Redox) reactions are very common in organic chemistry, as are radical reactions. You should be somewhat familiar with these reactions from general inorganic chemistry, but it is a good idea to review them. If you continue your pursuit of organic chemistry, you will encounter more complicated reactions that occur under specialized conditions, but they will follow the same basic foundations as all organic reactions., The word electrophile refers to “electron-loving” species. This applies to atoms, molecules, and ions. If it can accept an electron pair, it is considered an electrophile. Just remember that not all electrophiles attract electrons with the same intensity. Electrophiles with higher electronegativities will attract electrons better than those with lower electronegativities.Cations are good examples of electrophiles. Since they have a positive net charge, they are attracted to the negative charge of an electron. Halogens (Chlorine, Fluorine, etc.) are also strong electrophiles, since acquiring one electron will fill their outermost electron shell, making them more stable overall.

, Nucleophiles are the perfect compliment to electrophiles. A nucleophile is any species that is capable of donating a pair of electrons. Species with lower electronegativities will be more able to donate electrons, thus making them better nucleophiles than species with higher electronegativities.Anions boast a negative charge overall, and are often able to give up electrons in order to become more stable. This usually happens via ionic bonding. Alkali earth metals such as sodium also tend to be nucleophilic in nature since giving away an electron will stabilize their outermost electron shell.

, This is, in essence, just a way of looking at mechanisms consistently. You should read your mechanism as if the nucleophilic compound seeks out and reacts with the electrophilic compound. This will help you to remember where to start and where the electrons are going.


An example of this might be that you have a molecule containing a double bond between two of its carbons (pi electrons are usually able to form another bond with a new species), and a bromine (halogen) molecule attacks that double bond. The result would be that the double bond would be broken, and the bromine would be added to one of the two carbons (which carbon depends on the conditions and type of reaction).

, While organic chemistry is a huge subject, there are important underlying principles that govern the more complex reactions. If you become familiar with these principles and understand their applications, you will be able to see how they play out in the most complex set of organic reactions. Some of the most important foundations are:Stereochemistry ― This refers to the way that the shape and size of a molecule affects its reactivity.Resonance ― This is when a molecule has different possible electron configurations. For example, an electron pair could be found in a double bond or on a close by functional group. This flexibility provides stabilization for the molecule.Aromatization ― This takes the delocalization of electrons seen in resonance (the ability of electrons to be shared across the molecule) to a different level. In an aromatic molecule there are always (4n+2) pi electrons and they are delocalized across a conjugated pi bond system or in a ring (such as benzene).Functional Groups ― These groups of atoms are responsible for different characteristics of the molecules that they are attached to.

, This will allow you to preview the information that will be covered in lectures. You should take notes on what you read and make sure that they correspond to the notes you take during lecture. You should also write down any questions that you have while reading, and ask them if the lecture doesn’t answer them for you.

, You will benefit greatly by breaking the large amounts of information covered in an organic chemistry class down into notecards. The system you use for your notecards will depend on what information you wish to learn at the time. Do not throw away your note cards. Keep them to review each week, and you will be much better off for the final exam.For example, you could make a set of notecards for a series of addition reactions that you are studying. Likewise, you could make a set of notecards that cover the different types of reactions (addition, elimination, substitution, etc.). You could make several sets of notecards, such as the two mentioned, that organize the information in different ways.

, Research shows that cramming all of your studying into one massive session is not very effective. You will learn a lot more if you spread out your study time. Remember to take a study break every forty-five minutes to rest your brain.Be sure that you go back and review past material material each week. This will keep the material fresh, and can be done easily by reviewing your notecards.

, Even if you prefer to study alone, a is where you will discover different ways to look at organic reactions. Other students might be great at determining which reactions are SN1 or SN2, while you are better at identifying nucleophiles and electrophiles. This exchange of knowledge will benefit everyone.Another way to approach social learning is to tutor someone else, or find a tutor yourself.

, Working through practice problems will force your brain to recall the information that you have learned. This is a vital skill for taking the test. It is also a good idea to time yourself so that you can get faster at working problems. Try taking practice tests and work on completing them in the same amount of time that you will have in class."

Observe the color of bromine.",How to Detect Double Bonds in Organic Compounds1," Under normal conditions, bromine is a toxic yellow-orange liquid. Alkenes react easily summing bromine to the C-C double bonds originating brominated hydrocarbons which are colorless. On the other side saturated hydrocarbon don't react easily with halogens so it's possible to detect alkenes or compound containing unsaturated C-C bonds by observing a color change in bromine when an organic compound is mixed with it.

Organic reactions can usually proceed in one of two ways.,
The observation of these highly reactive and highly unstable carbon species is possible through special spectroscopic techniques such as mass spectroscopy.,
Reactions that proceed in a stepwise manner usually are not specific and do not give single product.,
The subject of reactive intermediates in organic chemistry is a whole topic of organic chemistry that is taught at the graduate level at universities that have strong program in this discipline of science.,
The investigation of the mechanisms of organic reactions uses also physical methods such as kinetic measurements of reaction rate.,
Organic compounds usually have good thermodynamic stability that is remarkable if we compare it with compounds of other atoms than carbon.,
Two main common intermediates that are encountered in many organic reactions are the electron deficient carbocation species and the negatively charged carbon ion that is called carbon ion.,
Intermediates are seen for example in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of benzene and its derivatives.,
Aromatic compounds are unusually stable from the thermodynamic point of view.,
Theoretical modeling of chemical transformations can be very useful in determining if a reaction pathway will be favorable or not and whether the reaction is likely to have intermediate structures or not.",How to Be Familiar With Various Types of Mechanisms of Organic Reactions," One of them is concerted reaction that takes place in one step with one transition state. The other type of reactions in organic chemistry is the non-concerted type of reactions. The latter type is the dominant type of most chemical reactions. Non-concerted organic reactions usually have intermediate structures that are highly reactive carbon species.
, The follow up of fragmentation patterns of chemical compounds in the gas phase using MS can show the existence of these reactive species by giving their molecular mass as part of the spectrum., On the other hand reactions that proceed in one step are usually more specific due to their concerted nature. Examples include the SN2 reaction in organic chemistry which usually proceeds in one step is stereospecific and gives only one single product. On the other hand SN1 reactions which occur in a stepwise manner with intermediates is not stereospecific and give more than one possible product that are usually mixture of enantiomers in the case of chiral starting compound., The investigation of the existence of reactive intermediates in the reaction pathway of organic reactions can give valuable information about the mechanism of the investigated reaction. Mechanisms of organic reactions are the subject that is researched by physical organic chemists that specialize in this area of study., The determination of the rate of the reaction whether first order or second order can give valuable information about the dependence of the rate of the reaction on the concentration of the reactants. Also another subject that is used in the investigation of the mechanism of reactions is called molecular dynamics of chemical reactions. This area is formally part of physical chemistry but physical organic chemistry can be considered as a branch of physical chemistry as applied to organic compounds., The fragmentation of the organic molecule by the effect of thermal energy or light can induce the molecule to dissociate into fragments. These fragments are highly unstable carbon species that electronically deficient so that they seek to combine with any possible compound that is present within its neighborhood. This process is driven by the energetically favorable product., By virtue of their charge these species are unstable thermodynamically and have inclination to bind with other chemical species in order to satisfy its electronic unstable structure., These intermediates in this case tend to restore the aromatic structure of the compound which is much more stable than the reactive intermediate. Also reactions that have complicated mechanisms are characterized also by the presence of chemical intermediates in its reaction pathway. An example is the formation of pyrrole from an amine and a diketone compound., In order for an aromatic compound to undergo a chemical transformation there must be an active destabilization of its stable structure. Aromatic compounds for this reason do not undergo concerted reactions and have reactive intermediates that characterize the mechanism of all aromatic compounds., This is mostly seen based on the energy balance of the participants in the reaction in addition to the matching of the symmetry of their frontier molecular orbitals. The best approach of research in this area as well as in other areas of chemistry is to perform research that involves two aspects one of them is the experimental research and the other is the computational research which can corroborate the experimental data."

Proofread.",How to Write a Physics Lab Report," For many lab reports, you will be required to start with a cover sheet. Check with your teacher to find out exactly what information should be included. Information that is typically found on the cover sheet includes:Your name and the name of your partner(s)
The title of your experiment
The date you conducted the experiment
Your teacher's name
Information that identifies which class you are in;
, The abstract is the first part of your report that your readers will see, but it should be the last thing you actually write because it is a summary of everything else you have included in your report. The purpose of the abstract is to provide potential readers with basic information about the experiment you conducted and the results you got so they can determine whether or not they are interested in reading the full report.Keep your abstract brief, but make it interesting enough that readers will want to continue.

, Depending on the nature of your experiment and the requirements of your class, you may want to add an introduction section to your report. This should explain the underlying theory, provide background information regarding the research that has already been done, and describe your motivation for conducting this specific experiment., The objective section of your report should be a few sentences that describe the purpose of your experiment. If you wish, you can state your hypothesis., The procedure or method section of your report should be a detailed explanation of exactly how you conducted your experiment. Go through each and every step you took, keeping in mind that a reader who is completely unfamiliar with your experiment should be able to read your procedure and repeat the experiment exactly the way you did it.If a diagram will help your audience understand your procedure, include it in this section.
You may be tempted to write this as a list, but it's best to stick to paragraph form.
Some teachers may require a separate section on the materials and apparatuses that were used to conduct the experiment.
If you are following instructions from a lab book, do not just copy the steps from the book. Explain the procedure in your own words to demonstrate that you understand how and why you are collecting each piece of data.

, Present the raw data that you collected during your experiment in this section of the report, making sure that it is clearly organized and includes units of measurement. A table is usually helpful for organizing data.You may include graphs or charts that highlight the most important pieces of data here as well, but do not begin to analyze the data quite yet.
Explain any reasonable uncertainties that may appear in your data. No experiment is completely free of uncertainties, so ask your teacher if you're not sure what to include.
Always include uncertainty bars in your graphs if the uncertainties of the data are known.Also discuss any potential sources of error and how those errors may have affected your experiment.

, If you used any equations to analyze your data, include a list of them in your report, along with one example of how you used it to calculate your results. If you used the equation multiple times throughout the experiment, you only need to write out one example.Some teachers may allow you to include your calculations in the data section of our report.

, The analysis is one of the most important parts of your report because it allows you to highlight your insights into what the data actually means and tell your teacher what you learned from it.Include information about how your results compare to your expectations or hypothesis, what implications these results have for the world of physics, and what further experiments could be conducted to learn more about your results.
You can also include your own ideas for improving upon the experiment.
Be sure to include any graphs that would be appropriate to illustrate your analysis of the data and help your readers better understand it.Some teachers may request that you create two separate analysis and conclusion sections.

, In addition to your scientific data, your lab report will be graded for writing mechanics, which includes grammar and spelling. While writing skills may not seem related to science, it is actually critical that scientists be able to clearly articulate their methods and conclusions. Without a well-written report, your lab results are useless.Bullet pointed lists are not appropriate for most sections of your report. You may be able to use them for short sections like your materials and apparatuses list.
Keep in mind that one of the main objectives of your lab report is to guide others in recreating your experiment. If you can't clearly explain what you did and how you did it, no one will ever be able to reproduce your results.

, Once you've made sure that your report doesn't contain any grammatical errors, you need to make sure your readers will actually be able to understand it. Read through it to look for sentences that are too long or unclear. Remember that if it doesn't make sense to you, it will be even more confusing for someone who is not familiar with your experiment.Active sentences are usually easier to understand than passive sentences, so try to minimize your use of the passive voice whenever possible. For example, if you wrote, ""These results are easily reproducible by anyone who has the correct equipment,"" try changing it to ""Anyone who has the correct equipment should be able to reproduce these results."" The passive voice is not always wrong, so don't be afraid to leave a sentence in the passive voice if you think it makes more sense that way.

, In order for your report to be comprehensible, it's important that you organize your ideas by topic. Try to only include one main point in each sentence you write. Group sentences that are thematically related into paragraphs, and start a new paragraph whenever you change topics.Don't jump ahead and discuss the results of the experiment before you get to that section. Just because you understand everything that happened with your experiment, does not mean your readers will. You need to walk them through it step by step.
Cut out any sentences that don't add anything of substance to your report. Your readers will only get frustrated if they have to read through a bunch of fluff in order to find your main point., When writing a lab report, you should avoid using the pronouns ""I,"" ""we,"" ""my,"" and ""our"" at all costs. The third person point of view sounds much more authoritative.For example, instead of writing, ""I noticed that the data we gathered was not consistent with our previous results,"" write, ""The data is not consistent with the previous results.""

, For the most part, you should always write your lab report in the present tense. Instead of writing, ""The data was consistent with the hypothesis"" write, ""The data is consistent with the hypothesis.""The past tense is appropriate for discussing your procedure and the results of past experiments.

, In order to help your readers understand your report and find the information they are looking for, be sure to clearly label each section. It is also important to label any charts, tables, or figures you include in your report so that you can refer back to them and your readers will know where to look., Always take the time to proofread your report before handing it in. Keep in mind that your word processor's spell checker will not pick up on misused words."

Choose the appropriate solvent.,
Dissolve the impure compound: To do so, place that compound in a test tube.,
Decolorize the solution.,
Remove solids by filtration.,
Crystallize the compound of interest.,
Collect and wash the crystals: To do this, separate the crystals from the ice-cold solvent by filtration.,
Dry the washed product: Final drying for a small amount of crystallized product can be done by squeezing the crystals between sheets of filter paper and allowing them to dry on a watch glass.

",How to Crystallize Organic Compounds," Remember the dictum ""like dissolves like"": Similia similibus solvuntur. For example, sugar and salt are water, but not oil, soluble -- and non polar compounds such as hydrocarbons will dissolve in nonpolar hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane.


The ideal solvent would have these properties:

It will dissolve the compound when the solution is hot but not when the solution is cold.
It will either not dissolve the impurities at all (so they can be filtered out when the impure compound is dissolved), or such that it will dissolve them very well (so they will remain in solution when the desired compound is crystallized out).
It will not react with the compound.
It is nonflammable.
It is nontoxic.
It is cheap.
It is very volatile (so it can be removed easily from the crystals).


It is often difficult to decide upon the best solvent; the solvent is often chosen by experimentation, or by using the most non-polar solvent available. Familiarize yourself with the following list of common solvents (from most polar to least polar). Note that solvents adjacent to one another are miscible (they will dissolve in each other). Commonly used solvents are in bold.


Water (H2O) is nonflammable, nontoxic, cheap, and will dissolve many polar organic compounds; its drawback is high boiling point (100 degrees C), making it relatively nonvolatile and difficult to remove from crystals.

Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is useful for oxidation reaction, but will react with alcohols and amines, and is therefore difficult to remove (boiling point is 118 degrees C).

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methyl sulfoxide (CH3SOCH3) is used mainly as solvent for reactions; rarely for crystallization. It boils at 189 degrees C, and is hard to remove.

Methanol (CH3OH) is a useful solvent that will dissolve compounds of higher polarity than will other alcohols. Boiling point: 65 deg. C.

Acetone (CH3COCH3) is an excellent solvent; its drawback is low boiling point of 56 °C (133 °F), allowing little difference in solubility of a compound at its boiling point and room temperature.

2-Butanone, methyl ethyl ketone, MEK (CH3COCH2CH3) is an excellent solvent with boiling point 80 °C (176 °F).

Ethyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5) is an excellent solvent with boiling point 78 °C (172 °F).

Dichloromethane, methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) is useful as a solvent pair with ligroin, but its boiling point, 35 °C (95 °F), is too low to make it a good crystallization solvent. It can, however, be cooled down to -78 deg. C using a dry ice/acetone bath,

Diethyl ether (CH3CH2OCH2CH3) is useful as a solvent pair with ligroin, but its boiling point, 40 °C (104 °F), is too low to make it a good crystallization solvent.

Methyl t-Butyl ether (CH3OC(CH3)3) is cheap, good replacement for diethyl ether given its higher boiling point, 52 °C (126 °F).

Dioxane (C4H8O2) is easy to remove from crystals; mild carcinogen; forms peroxides; boiling point 101 °C (214 °F).

Toluene (C6H5CH3) is an excellent solvent for crystallization of aryl compounds and has replaced the once commonly used benzene (a weak carcinogen); a drawback is high boiling point of 111 °C (232 °F), making it difficult to remove from crystals.

Pentane (C5H12) is widely used for nonpolar compounds; often used as solvent pair with another solvent. Its low boiling point means that it's more useful when used in conjuction with a dry ice/acetone bath.

Hexane (C6H14) is used for nonpolar compounds; inert; often used in a solvent pair; boiling point 69 °C (156 °F).

Cyclohexane (C6H12) is similar to hexane, but cheaper, and has boiling point 81 °C (178 °F).
Petroleum ether is a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons of which pentane is a chief component; cheap, and used interchangeably with pentane; boiling point 30–60 °C (86–140 °F).
Ligroin is a mixture of saturated hydrocarbons with properties of hexanes.Steps for choosing the solvent:





Put a few crystals of the impure compound in a test tube and add a single drop of the solvent, allow it to flow down by the side of the tube.
If the crystals dissolve immediately at room temperature, reject the solvent because too much of the compound will remain dissolved at low temperature, and try another solvent.
If the crystals do not dissolve at room temperature, warm the tube on a hot sand bath and observe the crystals. Add a drop more solvent if they do not dissolve. If they dissolve at the boiling point of the solvent and then crystallize again when cooled to room temperature, you have found an appropriate solvent. If not, try another solvent.
If after a process of trial and error -- and no single satisfactory solvent is found -- use a solvent pair. Dissolve the crystals in the better solvent (the one in which they are readily dissolved), and add the poorer solvent to the hot solution until it becomes cloudy (the solution is saturated with the solute). The solvent pair must be miscible with each other. Some useful solvent pairs are acetic acid-water, ethanol-water, acetone-water, dioxane-water, acetone-ethanol, ethanol-diethyl ether, methanol-2Butanone, ethyl acetate-cyclohexane, acetone-ligroin, ethyl acetate-ligroin, diethyl ether-ligroin, dichloromethane-ligroin, toluene-ligroin.;
, Crush large crystals with a stirring rod to promote dissolving. Add the solvent drop by drop. To remove insoluble, solid impurities, use excess solvent to dilute the solution and filter out the solid impurities at room temperature (see step 4 for filtration procedure), then evaporate the solvent. Prior to heating, place a wood applicator stick in the tube to avoid super heating (heating of the solution above the solvent's boiling point without actually boiling). The air trapped in the wood will come out to form nuclei to allow even boiling. Alternatively, porous porcelain boiling chips may be used. After solid impurities have been removed and the solvent evaporated, add solvent drop by drop, while stirring the crystals with a glass rod and warming the tube on a steam bath or sand bath, until the compound is completely dissolved with minimal amount of solvent.

, Skip this step if the solution is colorless or has only a light shade of yellow. If the solution is colored (which results from production of high-molecular weight by-products of chemical reactions), add excess solvent and activated charcoal (carbon), and boil the solution for a few minutes. The colored impurities will adsorb onto the surface of activated charcoal, due to its high degree of microporosity. Remove the charcoal with adsorbed impurities by filtration, as described in the next step.

, Filtration can be done by gravity filtration, decantation, or removal of solvent using a pipette. Generally, do not use vacuum filtration, as the hot solvent will cool during the process, allowing the product to crystallize in the filter.


Gravity filtration: this is the method of choice for removing fine charcoal, dust, lint, etc. Get three Erlenmeyer flasks heated on a steam bath or hot plate: one containing the solution to be filtered, another one containing a few milliliters of solvent and a stemless funnel, and the third containing several milliliters of the crystallizing solvent to use for rinsing. Place a fluted filter paper (useful since you are not using vacuum) in a stemless funnel (stemless to prevent the saturated solution from cooling and clogging the stem with crystals) over the second Erlenmeyer flask. Bring the solution to be filtered to a boil, grasp it in a towel, and pour the solution into the filter paper. Add boiling solvent from the third Erlenmeyer flask to any crystals formed on the filter paper and to rinse the first Erlenmeyer flask that contained the solution being filtered, adding the rinse to the filter paper. Remove excess solvent by boiling the filtered solution.
Decantation: This is used for large solid impurities. Simply pour off (decant) the hot solvent, leaving the insoluble solids behind.

Removal of solvent using a pipette: This is used for a small amount of solution and if the solid impurities are large enough. Insert a pipette with square tip into the bottom of the test tube (rounded bottom), and remove the liquid using suction, leaving solid impurities behind.

, This step assumes that any colored impurities and insoluble impurities have been removed by appropriate steps above. Remove any excess solvent by boiling it off or blowing it off with a gentle stream of air. Start from a solution saturated with the solute at the boiling point. Allow it to cool slowly to room temperature. Crystallization should begin. If not, initiate the process by adding a seed crystal or scratching the inside of the tube with a glass rod at the liquid-air interface. Once crystallization has begun, take care not to disturb the container to allow formation of large crystals. To promote slow cooling (which allows larger crystals to form), you can insulate the container with cotton or paper towels. Larger crystals are easier to separate from impurities. Once the container has completely cooled to room temperature, cool it in ice for about five minutes to maximize the amount of crystals.

, This can be done using the Hirsch funnel, the Buchner funnel, or by removal of the solvent using a pipette.


Filtration using the Hirsch funnel: Place the Hirsch funnel with non-fluted filter paper in a vacuum tight fitted flask. Place the filter flask in ice to keep the solvent cold. Wet the filter paper with the crystallization solvent. Hook the flask to an aspirator, turn on the aspirator, and ascertain that the filter paper is pulled down onto the funnel by the vacuum. Pour and scrape the crystals onto the funnel, and break the vacuum as soon as all liquid is removed from the crystals. Use a few drops of ice-cold solvent to rinse the crystallization flask and pour that onto the funnel while reapplying vacuum, and break the vacuum as soon as all liquid is removed from the crystals. Wash the crystals a few more times with ice-cold solvent to remove any residual impurities. At the end of washing, leave the vacuum on to dry the crystals.

Filtration using the Buchner funnel: Place a piece of non-fluted filter paper in the bottom of the Buchner funnel, and wet it with solvent. Fit the funnel tightly against a filter flask via a rubber or synthetic rubber adapter to allow vacuum suction. Pour and scrape the crystals onto the funnel, and break vacuum as soon as the liquid is removed into the flask as the crystals are left on the paper. Rinse the crystallization flask with ice-cold solvent, add this to the washed crystals, reapply vacuum, and break vacuum when the liquid is removed from the crystals. Repeat and wash the crystals as many times as needed. Leave the vacuum on to dry the crystals at the end.
Wash using a pipette: used for small amount of crystals to be washed. Insert a pipette with square tip into the bottom of the test tube (rounded bottom), and remove the liquid, leaving the washed solids behind.

Draw your net.,
Fold your net.,
Make more tetrahedrons using the same method.

,
Use each tetrahedron to represent a methyl (CH3) group, a CH2 group, or a CH group.",How to Make Models of Organic Chemistry Molecules1," This method is best for hydrocarbons. To draw the net:


Draw an equilateral triangle on a piece of paper. Start by drawing a line of the length you want, then use a protractor to measure a 60 degree angle from one end. Draw another line at 60 degrees to your first line. Then join up the other ends to make a triangle.
Add three more triangles on the edges of your first triangle (these must be the same size as the original.)
Put one tab on one edge of each outer triangle (all of them except the centre one.)
Cut it out.;
, Put glue on the top of each tab, then fold it into a tetrahedron (as indicated by the image).

,,


For a CH3 group, count one of the corners as a carbon and the other three as hydrogens. The image shows ethane, CH3CH3. Touching corners indicate a carbon-carbon bond.
For a CH2 group, have one edge of each tetrahedron touch the edge of another tetrahedron. This represents a double bond. If you use two tetrahedrons, you have ethene (CH2=CH2.)
For a CH group, have one face of one tetrahedron touch one face of another tetrahedron. This represents a triple bond. Using two tetrahedrons, you will have acetylene/ethyne (HCCH)

Realize that things can interfere.",How to Calculate Anion Gap," The normal range of sodium is 135 – 145 mEq/L. It is important to know the sodium level in your body. You can have your sodium levels tested through a blood test that your doctor can give.;
, A normal range of potassium is 3.5 – 5.0 mEq/L. There’s a different formula wherein you will no longer use the potassium level, though. This is because K⁺ is found to be too low in the plasma to count at times.


Since there is a formula that doesn't require potassium, you may skip this step.

, A normal range of chloride is between 97 – 107 mEq/L. Your doctor will test this, too.

, The normal range for bicarbonate is 22- 26 mEq/L. Again, this is done through the same series of tests.

, The normal value of an anion gap is 8 – 12 mEq/L if without potassium. However, if potassium is given, the normal range value will change to 12 – 16 mEq/L.


Note that all these electrolyte levels can be identified through a blood test.
Pregnant women may notice different levels, too. We'll discuss this in the next section.

, There are 2 formulas you can use in calculating an anion gap:


First formula: Anion gap = Na⁺ + K⁺ – (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻). This formula can be used if there is a value for potassium. However, the second equation is used more often than the first one.
Second formula: Anion gap = Na⁺ – (Cl⁻ + HCO₃⁻). You can see that potassium is omitted in this second equation. This formula is more frequently used than the other, but you can use either of the two depending on your preferences.

, Again, the normal value is 8 – 12 mEq/L if without potassium and 12 – 16 mEq/L with potassium.Here are two examples:


Example 1: Na⁺ = 140, Cl⁻= 100, HCO₃⁻= 23
AG= 140 – (98 + 23)
AG = 24

The anion gap is 24. Therefore, the individual is positive for having a metabolic acidosis.


Example 2: Na⁺ = 135, Cl⁻= 100, HCO₃⁻= 25
AG= 135 – (100 + 25)
AG = 10

The anion gap is 10. Therefore, the result is normal and the person does not have metabolic acidosis. It is within the normal range of 8 – 12 mEq/L., The anion gap (AG) measures the difference between sodium and potassium cations and the chloride and bicarbonate anions in patients who experience kidney problems and altered mental status -- in other words, your pH balance. It represents the unmeasured anion concentration in the plasma such as proteins, phosphates and sulfates. This is all fancy terminology for your body producing the right things at the wrong levels.


Determining the anion gap value is crucial in setting the arterial blood gas analysis or ABG. The basic concept is that net cation and anion charges must be equal to achieve balance in your body.

, This is mainly a measure for patients with kidney or gastrointestinal problems. This test does not definitely point toward any one condition. However, it does rule certain things out and narrow down the field of concern.


Anion gap reveals the presence of metabolic acidosis, where the pH levels in your body are off-kilter. It differentiates the causes of metabolic acidosis and helps confirm other findings. Ask your doctor to help wrap your brain around this process.
Let’s take for instance that a patient has lactic acidosis (where there's also a buildup of lactate. In this case, the serum bicarbonate levels will automatically reduce (because of the buildup) so that when you calculate for the anion gap, you’ll see that the anion gap increases.

, A serum anion gap sample is taken from your veins using a serum separator tube.Here's how it'll go:


A medical scientist or medical technologist extracts blood from a vein, likely in your arm.
He or she may ask you if you have a history of latex allergies. If you do, they'll use different materials to ensure you don't have an allergic reaction.
Inform them of any medical condition or medication that may cause excessive bleeding or if you have psychological issues associated with sharp items like needles.
Your specimen will be kept inside a bio-refrigerator and kept in a queue for examination. When all is said and done, your doctor will contact you to discuss the findings.

, Your doctor will correlate the diagnostic findings with how you look, feel, and the symptoms you report. Once the results are in and are definitive, your doctor should run you through what the next steps will be. If your physician thinks the results might be wrong, he may require another test to verify the results.


Decreased anion gap can be correlated to various conditions such as hypo-albuminemia and bromide intoxication. A normal result is expected when a patient is recovering from diabetic ketoacidosis or recovering from bicarbonate loss due to prolonged diarrhea.
An increase in anion gap may indicate lactic acidosis or renal failure. Interpretation of results may vary depending on various factors and underlying conditions experienced by the patient.
A ""normal"" anion gap for pregnant women is slightly different. During the first trimester, normal anion gap ranges from 10 to 20 mmol/L. During the second and third trimester, normal value decreases from 10 to 11 to maximum of 18 mmol/L, respectively.

, Collection errors can happen and interfere with your laboratory result. Timing, dilution and sample size matter a lot to get accurate findings. Delay in processing the collected specimen and exposure to air for long periods of time may cause an increase in bicarbonate levels, too. With this, anion gap may reduce by 2.5 mEq/L for every gram/dL albumin concentration deducted from the blood. Your doctor should be able to account for this (apart from avoiding it entirely).


An increase in anion gap requires further testing -- including testing for serum lactic acid, drug testing, testing your creatinine levels and serum ketones -- to rule out possible causes of anion gap acidosis.

, Make sure they are deep enough for sticks to fit snugly inside, but not too deep.Note that this does not accurately represent the actual geometry of each element's bonding. It only represents how each bonds to another.


For a carbon atom, poke 4 holes each at 90 degrees to each other.
For hydrogen, just poke 1 hole.
For oxygen, poke 2 holes on either side of the ball.
For nitrogen, poke 3 holes each at 120 degrees to each other.

,, For bonds, use short wooden sticks such as toothpicks or used matches. Place each stick into an atom and use them to connect your atoms together to make molecules. The image represents a molecule of ethane.

Do practice problems.,
Actively review your notes and textbook.,
Ask for help.,
Number your carbons.,
Recognize the relationships between properties.,
Use the modeling kits.,
Use reaction maps for synthesis problems.",How to Study Organic Chemistry Effectively1," The number one way to study organic chemistry is by doing practice problems. Problems are what you will see on tests and quizzes and they are how you prove your understanding. The more problems you do, the better your understanding will be. Once you have mastered one concept, move on to problems that are more difficult.Do a set of practice problems from your book every day to keep up with the material.;
, Reading through your notes is definitely a good place to start, but actively reviewing your notes is even better. Rewrite your notes and summarize the material. Draw concept maps or visual summaries to illustrate how everything works together.When you come across a compound, draw the structure for it.
Read through the notes before class every day so that you will know what is coming up.

, Your professor and teaching assistants will have office hours that are specifically available for students to ask questions and get help with the material. Take advantage of this time and actually go ask for assistance. They are there to help you learn and this is an opportunity to ask questions you might have been afraid to ask in class.Getting extra help from a one-on-one tutor can also be beneficial if you are really struggling.

, When answering questions in homework or on an exam, it is easy to lose track of the number of carbons. The number of carbons in the products should always equal the number of carbons in the reactants.You don’t have to number the carbons for proper labeling, just number them so you know how many there are and you can put them in the correct position in the products.

, Organic chemistry relies heavily on understanding how different molecules relate to each other. While there is rote memorization involved, it is much more important that you understand these basic interactions to succeed in organic chemistry. Understanding the reason behind why these trends exist is also important. To name a few examples:As the pKa of an acid increases, the stability of the conjugate base increases.
As the polarity of a molecule increases, the boiling point increases.
When you increase the chain length of a hydrocarbon, the boiling point increases.

, Modeling kits allow you build chemical structures in three dimensions. Being able to visualize the structure can help you understand a compound better than just looking at the 2D version written on the board.The modeling kit helps you avoid mistakes when answering questions on exams and homework.

, Reaction maps allow you to visualize all of the functional groups and the reactions that occur to produce them. You can use the reaction maps to string together reactions to get from one compound to the final compound.Once you have identified the functional groups in the reaction, work the problem backwards (from product to reactant) using the maps as a guide.

Pour a sample of your liquid into a container.,
Check that your liquid is the correct temperature.,
Place the hydrometer in the liquid.,
Read the specific gravity from the hydrometer.",How to Test the Specific Gravity of Liquids1," Make sure that the liquid in the container is deep enough to allow the hydrometer to float. If the hydrometer rests on the bottom of the container, you will not get an accurate reading. Leave room in the container for the hydrometer to displace some of the liquid, otherwise, you’ll end up with a spill.The shape, and material of the container is irrelevant as long as there is enough liquid present for the hydrometer to float properly.
;
, Your hydrometer will be calibrated to a specific temperature. If your liquid is at a different temperature, the density of the liquid will not match the calibration of the hydrometer. This will cause your reading to be incorrect.A common hydrometer calibration is 60 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15.6 degrees Celsius). You can use a thermometer to check the temperature of your liquid, and then heat or cool as needed.


, The hydrometer is a specialized glass tube that has a weighted end. Place it in the water with the weighted end down. Allow the hydrometer to settle and stop bobbing before taking a reading., The hydrometer is marked with different specific gravity measurements at different intervals. Once it stops floating, the water line will be at one of these marks. The number corresponding to this mark is the specific gravity of your liquid.The reading on the hydrometer is usually a decimal, but it is derived as a ratio of the density of your liquid to the density of water at a given temperature. In other words, if your hydrometer reads 1.1, that means your liquid was 1.1 times as dense as water at that temperature. Note that specific gravity is a unitless measurement.

You can look up the specific gravity of some common liquids. Examples are listed below:

Acetic Acid - 1.052

Acetone - 0.787

Beer - 1.01

Bromine - 3.12

Milk - 1.035

Mercury - 13.633

Make flash cards.,
Form a study group.,
Write in pen.,
Study every day.,
Attend class.,
Get proper sleep, exercise, and nutrition.,
Set up a good study space.",How to Study Organic Chemistry Effectively2," Organic chemistry is all about learning chemical structures and reactions. There is also a lot of vocabulary that is specific to the subject. It is very difficult to understand the material if you don’t know what all of the words mean. Use flash cards to help you learn the vocabulary.Once you have mastered the vocabulary, make new flashcards for reactions and structures.

, Study groups are a great way to check your understanding and gain new insight into the material. When explaining a concept to others, you may realize that there is something you were missing. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the material itself. At the same time, other members of the group can help you learn concepts that are difficult for you.Choose study partners that learn at the same rate you do. If the group is too fast or too slow for you, it won’t be as beneficial.

, When using a pencil, it is easy to just write everything down, erase, and then keep writing more. When you use a pen, you have to think through the material critically before writing anything down to avoid having to scribble things out.While this may not work for everyone, it is good to try it out and see if it helps you think ideas through properly before writing them down.

, Studying for an hour or two each day is a much better use of your time than trying to study for 5+ hours all at once. With smaller, more frequent study sessions, you can focus on individual concepts and not burn yourself out trying to cram all of the information into your brain at once.Break up your studying into large and small blocks of time. If you only have ten minutes, flip through some flashcards. If you have an hour or two, do practice problems.

, This may seem obvious, but a lot of effort put into learning material is just about showing up to class. Paying attention in class and taking relevant notes is also necessary. Be strategic about note-taking. Don’t take notes just to take notes. Listen to what the professor is saying and then summarize the information in your notes.If something you wrote during class doesn’t make sense, attend office hours to ask for clarification.

, The key to success when studying any subject is to maintain your health.Getting the proper amount of sleep, exercising a few times a week, and keeping a nutritious diet are all necessary to keeping yourself healthy and ready for work. Doing these three things will help keep your energy up and help you maintain the information that you are learning.


Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.
Make time for exercise, even if it’s just a walk with a friend.
Make an effort to eat more fruits and vegetables and stay away from sodas and excess caffeine.

, Choose a study space that works best for you. Do you get more done when there’s absolute silence or when there’s a little bit of background noise? A good study space has plenty of lighting, is a comfortable temperature, has minimal distractions, and is comfortable, but not too comfortable.Make sure you have plenty of space to spread out.
Keep your study space stocked with everything you will need (paper, calculator, scissors, snacks, etc.) so you won’t have to go hunting and get distracted.

Obtain a weight for the liquid in question.,
Obtain the weight of an identical volume of water.,
Calculate the ratio of the liquid’s weight to the weight of water.",How to Test the Specific Gravity of Liquids2," First, pre-weigh a container. Next, take the weight of the container again, but this time with a specified volume of your liquid inside. Subtract the weight of the container alone from the weight of the liquid filled container. The difference is the weight of your liquid.For example, if your container weighed 1.00 pound empty and 1.50 pounds with liquid in it, your equation would look like this ""1.00 lb - 1.50 lb = 0.50 lb"". Your liquid weighs 0.50 pounds.

Make sure the temperature of your liquid is noted when this weight is taken. You must compare it to water of the same temperature.


, Fill the same container to the same volume. Then, weigh the container and find the weight of that volume of water. You should not need to pre-weigh the container again, since you already know the weight of the empty container.Use the same formula to find the weight of the water: ""1.00 lb - 1.75 lb = 0.75 lb"". In this example, the water weighs 0.75 pounds.

Make sure that the water is at the exact same temperature as the liquid in question. Otherwise, results may not be accurate.


, Since you are dividing one weight by another, the units will cancel out. This makes specific gravity a unitless measurement. Use the ratio ""Wl / Wwater” where Wl is the weight of your liquid and Wwater is the weight of water.For example, if you weighed 100 mL of acetone at 25 degrees C, it would weigh 0.17314 pounds. Weighing the same volume of water at the same temperature would give you 0.22 pounds. To find the specific gravity of this acetone, you would solve 0.17314lbs/0.22lbs=0.787{\displaystyle 0.17314lbs/0.22lbs=0.787}. This is the specific gravity of acetone.

Obtain the density for the liquid in question.,
Obtain the density of an identical volume of water.,
Keep your liquids the same temperature.,
Calculate the ratio of the liquid’s density to the density of water.",How to Test the Specific Gravity of Liquids3," The density of a substance is equal to its mass divided by its volume. You can measure the mass on a scale and record the volume of the liquid used. Use the equation ""m / v = D"" where m is mass in grams or kilograms, v is volume in milliliters or liters, and D is density.For example, if you had a sample that was eight grams and nine milliliters, your equation would be ""8.00 g / 9.00 mL = 0.89 g/mL"".

Weigh an empty container first and record its weight. Next, fill your container with the desired liquid and weigh it again. The mass of your liquid is equal to the second measurement minus the first.


, Between -10 degrees Celsius and +30 degrees Celsius, the density of water can be rounded to 1.00 (assuming three significant figures). If you are using liquids that do not fall in that temperature range, you can measure the mass and the volume of your water and calculate the density. Alternatively, you can often find charts with the density of water at different temperatures., Substances expand when they are heated and contract when they are cooled. Since density is a measure of how much mass is in a given volume, the measurement is changed by the expansion and contraction due to temperature. If you want to get accurate specific gravity calculations, it is necessary that the liquid you are measuring and the water that you are using as a comparison are both at the same temperature., The units will cancel out in this equation, leaving you with a unitless quantity. That number is the specific gravity (or relative density) of your liquid. The ratio used will be ""Dl / Dwater” where Dl is the density of your liquid and Dwater is the density of your water.For example, if you were to take the density of acetone (0.787 g/mL @ 25 degrees C) and divide it by the density of water (1.00 g/mL @ 25 degrees C), you would get 0.787g/mL/1.00g/mL=0.787{\displaystyle 0.787g/mL/1.00g/mL=0.787}.

Learn about wave function.,
Understand the Schrödinger equation.,

Let go of classical notions of physics.",How to Understand Quantum Physics," In quantum mechanics, the quantum of action is the Planck constant, usually denoted as h. Likewise, for interacting subatomic particles, the quantum of angular momentum is the reduced Planck constant (the Planck constant divided by 2π) denoted by ħ and called ""h-bar"". The value of the Planck constant is extremely small, its units are those of angular momentum, and the notion of action is the more general mathematical concept. As the name quantum mechanics implies, certain physical quantities such as angular momentum can change only in discrete amounts, and not in a continuous (cf. analog) way.


For example, the angular momentum of an electron bound to an atom or molecule is quantized and can only have values that are multiples of the reduced Planck constant. This quantization gives rise to electron orbitals of a series of integer primary quantum number. In contrast, the angular momentum of a nearby unbound electron is not quantized. The Planck constant also plays a role in the quantum theory of light, where the quantum of light is the photon and where matter and energy interact via the atomic electron transition or ""quantum leap"" of the bound electron.
The units of the Planck constant can also be viewed as energy times time. For example, in the subject area of particle physics, the notion of virtual particles are messy particles that spontaneously appear out of the vacuum for a tiny fraction of a section and play a role in a particle interaction. The limit to the lifetime of these virtual particles is the energy (mass) of the particle times that lifetime. Quantum mechanics is a large subject area but every part of its mathematics involves the Planck constant.;
, Massy particles go through a classical-to-quantum transition. Even though the free electron displays some quantum properties (such as spin), as the unbound electron approaches the atom and slows down (perhaps by emitting photons), it undergoes a transition from classical to quantum behavior as its energy goes below the ionization energy. The electron is then bound to the atom and its angular momentum with respect to the atomic nucleus is restricted to quantized values of the orbitals it can occupy. The transition is sudden. One might compare this transition with that of a mechanical system that changes from displaying unstable to stable behavior or from displaying simple to chaotic behavior, or even a rocket ship slowing and going below escape velocity and entering orbit around some star or other celestial object. In contrast photons (which are massless) do not go through such a transition: photons just travel through space unchanged until they interact with other particles and then disappear. As you look into the night sky, the photons from some star traveled through light years of space unchanged then interacted with an electron in a molecule of your retina, transferred its energy and then otherwise disappeared.

, You'll need to be familiar with these, among them being:


The quantum realm follows rules quite different from the everyday world we experience.
Action (or angular momentum) is not continuous, but comes in small but discrete units.
The elementary particles behave both like particles and like waves.
The movement of a specific particle is inherently random and can only be predicted in terms of probabilities.
It is physically impossible to simultaneously measure both the position and the momentum of a particle beyond the accuracy allowed by the Planck constant. The more precisely one is known, the less precise the measurement of the other is.

, This postulates that all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties. A central concept of quantum mechanics, this duality addresses the inability of classical concepts like ""particle"" and ""wave"" to fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects.


For complete knowledge of matter duality, one must have concepts of Compton effect, photoelectric effect,de Broglie wavelength, and Planck's formula for black-body radiation. All these effects and theories proves the dual nature of matter.
There are different experiments for light set by scientists proves that light have dual nature i.e. particle as well as wave nature... In 1901, Max Planck published an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed spectrum of light emitted by a glowing object. To accomplish this, Planck had to make an ad hoc mathematical assumption of quantized action of the oscillators (atoms of the black body) that emit radiation. It was Einstein who later proposed that it is the electromagnetic radiation itself that is quantized into photons.

, The uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously known to arbitrarily high precision.In quantum physics, a particle is described by a wave packet, which gives rise to this phenomenon. Consider the measurement of the position of a particle. It could be anywhere. The particle's wave packet has non-zero amplitude, meaning the position is uncertain – it could be almost anywhere along the wave packet. To obtain an accurate reading of position, this wave packet must be 'compressed' as much as possible, meaning it must be made up of increasing numbers of sine waves added together. The momentum of the particle is proportional to the wave number of one of these waves, but it could be any of them. So a more precise position measurement – by adding together more waves – means the momentum measurement becomes less precise(and vice versa).

, A wave function or wave function is a mathematical tool in quantum mechanics that describes the quantum state of a particle or system of particles. It is commonly applied as a property of particles relating to their wave-particle duality, where it is denoted ψ(position,time) and where |ψ|2 is equal to the chance of finding the subject at a certain time and position.


For example, in an atom with a single electron, such as hydrogen or ionized helium, the wave function of the electron provides a complete description of how the electron behaves. It can be decomposed into a series of atomic orbitals which form a basis for the possible wave functions. For atoms with more than one electron (or any system with multiple particles), the underlying space is the possible configurations of all the electrons and the wave function describes the probabilities of those configurations.
In solving homework problems involving the wave function, familiarity with complex numbers is a prerequisite. Other prerequisites include the math of linear algebra, Euler's formula from complex analysis and the bra-ket notation.

, It is an equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes in time. It is as central to quantum mechanics as Newton's laws are to classical mechanics. Solutions to the Schrödinger equation describes not only molecular, atomic and subatomic systems, but also macroscopic systems, possibly even the whole universe.


The most general form is the time-dependent Schrödinger equation which gives a description of a system evolving with time.
For systems in a stationary state, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is sufficient. Approximate solutions to the time-independent. Schrödinger equations are commonly used to calculate the energy levels and other properties of atoms and molecules.

, Quantum superposition refers to the quantum mechanical property of solutions to the Schrödinger equation. Since the Schrödinger equation is linear, any linear combination of solutions to a particular equation will also be a solution of it. This mathematical property of linear equations is known as the superposition principle. In quantum mechanics such solutions are often made to be orthogonal, such as the energy levels of an electron. By doing so the overlap energy of the states is nullified, and the expectation value of an operator (any superposition state) is the expectation value of the operator in the individual states, multiplied by the fraction of the superposition state that is ""in"" that state.

, In quantum mechanics, the path of the particle is idealized totally in a different manner and the old quantum theory is just a toy model to understand the atomic hypothesis.


In Q.M., the path of the particle is imagined as if it has gone through many paths,in classical mechanics the path of particle is determined by its trajectory but, in Q.M there are multiple paths in which the particle can travel. This truth is hidden in the double slit experiment and in which the electron behaves as wave particle duality and this idea is clearly explained by Feynman`s path integral.
In Q.M., the normalization constant ensures the probability of finding the particle is 1.
Completely ignore the toy model (Bohr`s model) to understand the higher level of Q.M. The reason is simple––you can't determine the exact path of the electron in various orbital level.
If the Q.M approaches the classical limit (i.e) h tends to zero, the Q.M results somewhat approaches the results which are nearer to classical.
In Q.M., the classical result are obtained using the expectation value and the best example is Ehrenfest's theorem. It is derived using the operator method.

Engineering problems often contain the bare minimum of information needed to solve the problem. Carefully reading the problem allows you to dissect it and pull out the necessary information. For any information still needed, you will have to extract it from other sources such as steam tables (see Part 2).
Turbine problems typically ask you to find entering stream conditions (temperature and/or pressure), leaving stream conditions, actual work, reversible work, and/or turbine efficiency.;
,


Solving engineering problems becomes much easier if you draw a diagram. For turbine problems, steam always enters one side of the turbine at one temperature and pressure and leaves on the other side at a lower temperature and pressure. Shaft work always leaves the turbine.

,


For the sake of denoting variables, you should number the streams containing the flowing material (steam). Label the starting stream as ""1"" and, following the flow of the diagram, label subsequent streams in numeric order.

,


The values stated in the problem all correlate to particular variables. Sometimes, problems tell you directly what variable each value equates to, other times you must figure this out based on the unit attached to the value. Variables pertaining to a specific stream should be denoted with the numeric subscript of that stream.

,


To set up an energy balance for solving the problem, you must define the boundaries of the system. For turbine problems, it's best to define the boundaries of the system as the boundaries of the turbine itself. The steam entering the turbine, therefore, also enters the system. Steam leaving the turbine leaves the system. Shaft work leaves the system.

,


To set up the energy balance, you have to know if the system is open or closed. Because steam moves over the system boundaries, the system is considered to be open. The energy balance for open systems is H2-H1=Q+Ws. Since Q=0, this simplifies to H2-H1=Ws.
H2 - H1 = Ws
H2 = enthalpy (kJ/kg) of Stream 2
H1 = enthalpy (kJ/kg) of Stream 1
Ws = shaft work (kJ/kg) leaving the system

,


Engineering problems often force students to make conceptual assumptions in order to simplify them. Steam turbines are assumed to be adiabatic, meaning there is no transfer of heat energy, so Q=0.

,


Steam tables contain tabulated values for enthalpies, entropies, and saturation conditions. The conditions (temperature and pressure) of the stream dictate its corresponding tabulated values. You must reference them periodically from this point onward, when necessary, to solve for crucial variables.

,


In reality, no turbine process is completely reversible, but to solve problems involving efficiency, you must assume 100% reversibility. This means there is no change in entropy (isentropic process), so s1=s2 and corresponding steam table values at the streams' temperatures and pressures are assumed to be at the same entropy. If the entropy for the stream leaving the turbine is less than the lowest entropy listed on the superheated steam table at the given pressure, the steam in that stream is not completely vapor; it is a liquid-vapor mixture. When this occurs, you must compute steam quality to determine enthalpy for that stream.
Reversible quantities are denoted with an apostrophe.

,


Steam quality is the mass fraction of the stream that is vapor.
Its equation is q=(M-ML)/(MV-ML).
q = quality of the stream
M = property of the stream
MV = vapor property of the stream
ML = liquid property of the stream

,


Steam tables are tabulated in increments of either temperature or pressure. When stream conditions are not equal to an exact tabulated value, you must use linear interpolation to calculate the desired value.
Linear interpolation is given by: y = y1 + (x-x1)(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
y = the value you are looking for
x = the known value you are relating to the value you are looking for
x1 = the closest value less than x on the steam table; variables must match
x2 = the closest value greater than x on the steam table; variables must match
y1 = the corresponding value of y in the same row as x1
y2 = the corresponding value of y in the same row as x2

,


Turbine efficiency is the ratio of actual work to reversible work, given as a percentage.
Eta = (Ws / Ws') x 100
Eta = turbine efficiency
Ws = actual shaft work removed from system
Ws' = shaft work removed from system at constant entropy

Know that a pendulum is a weight hanging freely at the end of a string.,
To use a pendulum, pull the weight back and let go.,
Build a simple pendulum with string, a battery, and a yardstick for better understanding.,
Recognize the scientific vocabulary for pendulums.",How to Use a Pendulum1," Before you start using a pendulum, you need to know what it is and how it works. Luckily, a pendulum is no more than a hanging weight allowed to swing back and forth. The string is attached to a fixed point so that only the weight and string are moving. Hold the end of pendant necklace or yo-yo between your fingers and move the ""weight"" at the bottom. You've made your first pendulum!
A common example of a pendulum is the large swinging weight in a grandfather clock.;
, Make sure you keep the string taught and release the weight without pushing it. The weight will swing back and forth, returning to roughly the same height you dropped it from.


A pendulum will swing forever if nothing happens to slow it down or change its direction. In reality, outside forces like friction and air resistance will slow down a pendulum.

, If you learn through hands-on activities or want to teach children how pendulums work, you can quickly build a pendulum to experiment with:


Tie one end of a string to the middle of a yardstick or poll.
Tie the opposite end to a battery or other small weight.
Balance the yardstick on the backs of two identical chairs so that the battery hangs freely between them and can swing without hitting anything.
Pick up the battery, keeping the string taut, and release it so that it swings back and forth.

, Like most scientific pursuits it is only possible to understand and use pendulums if you know the words that describe them.



Amplitude: The highest point the pendulum reaches.

Bob: Another name for the weight at the end of the pendulum.

Equilibrium: The center point of a pendulum; where the weight rests when it is not moving.

Frequency: The number of times a pendulum swings back and forth in a set amount of time.

Period: The amount of time it takes a moving pendulum to return to the same spot.

Be aware that the spin is a relativistic quantum mechanical phenomenon that does not have a classical analogue.,
Use the Dirac equation.,
Use the Schroedinger equation.,
Note that there are correspondingly operators that depict the spin angular momentum.,
Learn about the Pauli matrices.,
Learn about the rule of spin conservation.,
Understand the Zeeman effect.",How to Study the Spin Concept in Quantum Theory," This is in contrast to many other physical concepts which have classical as well as quantum mechanical analogues such as the energy and momentum which are associated with a particle.;
, The spin of the electron is obtained mathematically by solving the relativistic quantum mechanical equation known as the Dirac equation. The relativistic quantum mechanical equation that fits the spin of non-integer values such as electrons which are fermions is the Dirac equation. On the other hand, the quantum mechanical equation for integer values of the spin is called the Klein-Gordon equation.


The spin of the electron is obtained mathematically by solving the Dirac equation for an electron.

, The non-relativistic quantum mechanical equation known as the Schroedinger equation does not give any information that is related to the spin of the electron. There are, in quantum mechanics, linear operators that represent the spin of the electron. This is in an analogy to the angular momentum operators which are physical properties that exist in classical as well as quantum mechanical systems.

, The operator that depicts the square of the total angular momentum is designated L*2. The analogous operator for the spin is the square of total spin angular momentum and is designated S*2.


L*2 and S*2 commute with the Hamiltonian. Therefore, they each have a common set of eigen functions common with the appropriate Hamiltonian.
The eigenvalues of L*2 and S*2 are also very similar in the mathematical formula with the difference in the variable that represent each operator.

, The spin operator Sz in the direction of the z axis and the square of the total spin angular momentum operator can both be represented using 2*2 matrices. These matrices are called Pauli matrices and are convenient representation of the spin operators in terms of matrices. The spin of the electron has a non-integer spin value that can be either 1/2 or -1/2. The electron is therefore a Fermion that obeys the Fermi-Dirac statistical mechanics.


This is in contrast to the integer value of the spin of bosons which can all fill the ground state energy level. Electrons in particular follow the Pauli principle of exclusion. This principle states that only two electrons with different spins can occupy the same orbital in an atom at a time.

, The transition between electronic levels in atoms and molecules must obey the rule of spin conservation, namely that an electron in a singlet state can be promoted only to another singlet state. Also, an electron in a triplet state can be promoted only to a triplet state. The spin of the electron is important in spectroscopic studies such as in transition metals chemistry. It is responsible for example for giving the magnetic properties of organometallic complexes. This is in addition to its being partly responsible for the color of the complex.

, The spin as well as the angular movement of the electron in the atom gives rise to magnetic moments that can interact with magnetic fields. This in turn gives rise to additional energies of the atoms and molecules, an example of which is the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect is the result of the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron due to its angular movement with the external magnetic field.


Also important is the phenomenon of spin-orbit coupling which involves the spin as well as the angular magnetic moment of the electron.

Understand the definition of the Schrödinger equation.,
Familiarize yourself with the history of the Schrödinger equation.,
Study the classical understanding of energy.,
Realize the difficulty of solving the Schrödinger equation.,
Be alert to the fact that the Schrödinger equation is a non-relativistic description of motion and energetics of electrons.,
Note that the Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly for simple systems such as the hydrogen atom and the particle in a box which is a modeling system for the electrons in the atom which are held by a force that restricts their motion.

",How to Study the Quantum Mechanical Equation of Schroedinger," The Schrödinger equation is a quantum mechanical differential equation that describes the energetics of atoms and molecules. In addition, its solution of atomic and molecular wave functions gives the shape and energy of the various atomic and molecular orbitals of the molecule under investigation. The Schrödinger equation is a linear differential equation which involves complex numbers.;
, It was formulated by the Austrian physicist, Erwin Schrödinger, in the early years of the 19th century. It was formulated after the discovery by the French physicist de-Broglie that matter can have wave properties. The Schrödinger equation includes wave as well as particle parameters. Its Hamiltonian is a differential form of the classical Hamiltonian, written in quantum mechanical operators form. It involves energy as well as momentum operators.

, Energy in the classical sense has a quantum mechanical form that is represented by a complex operator which includes a derivative with respect to time. Kinetic energy in the classical sense is written as P**2/2m, where P is the particle momentum and m is its mass. Momentum of classical mechanics has a quantum mechanical analogue that has a complex structure, written as an operator.

, Due to the presence of a potential energy term in the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, it is difficult to solve the Schrödinger equation accurately. The quantum mechanical Hamiltonian which involves the Schrödinger equation satisfies an eigenvalue relation which is written in the following operator form H(psi)= E(psi), where psi is the wave function. The solution of this differential equation for a particular system gives the energy of the system in addition to the wave function that describes its orbitals.


Due to its formidable mathematics, the solution of the Schrödinger equation, for many physical systems, is not possible to perform accurately. This is so due to the existence of potential energy perturbations that do not allow for exact solution of the equation. An example is the spin-orbit coupling in the hydrogen atom which is a relativistic effect that adds an extra potential energy term to the Hamiltonian due to the interaction of the electron spin and angular magnetic moment with a magnetic field that arises due to the relative motion of the nucleus around the electron.
The wave function that describes electrons is usually a complex wave function that involves imaginary numbers. Hamiltonian energies usually have real values that do not involve imaginary numbers. Hamiltonian operators in particular and operators in general that have real energy eigenvalues are called Hermitian operators. This is in contrast to non-Hermitian operators which do not represent physical variables and hence have complex energy values when solving the Schrödinger equation for these systems.

, It does not involve, for example, spin functions which are manifestations of relativistic effects that arise due to the solution of another quantum mechanical equation for particles that are called fermions and which have non-integer spin values. This equation is called the Dirac equation.


As an example, spin-orbit coupling in the hydrogen atom is not accounted for by the solution of the regular Schrödinger equation which does not involve relativistic forms of the Hamiltonian. L-S coupling or spin-orbit coupling arises naturally from the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom.

Know that pendulum experiments are a great way to teach the scientific method.,
Change the weight at the end of the string to teach about gravity.,
Change where you drop the weight to learn about amplitude.,
Change the length of the string.,
Dive deeper into pendulum physics to learn about inertia, energy transfer, and acceleration.",How to Use a Pendulum2," The scientific method has been the backbone of scientific research since the ancient Greeks, and pendulums are easy to tinker with and see instant results. When conducting any of the following experiments, take the time to formulate a hypothesis, talk about which variable you are testing, and compare the results.


Always do the experiment 5-6 times to make sure your results are consistent.
Remember to only try one experiment at a time-- otherwise you won't know what changed the pendulum's swing.

, One of the simplest ways to learn about gravity's effects is through a pendulum, and the results may surprise you. To see the effects of gravity:


Pull back the pendulum 10 centimeters and release it.
Use a stopwatch to time the period of the pendulum. Repeat 5-10 times.
Add a heavier bob to the pendulum and repeat the experiment.
The period and frequency will be exactly the same! This is because gravity affects all weights equally. A penny and a brick, for example, will fall at the same speed.

, When you pull the string higher you've increased the amplitude, or high point, of the pendulum. But does that change how fast the pendulum returns to your hand? Repeat the above experiment, but pull the pendulum back 20 centimeters this time instead of changing the weight.


If you did everything correctly, the pendulum period will not change.
Changing amplitude does not change frequency, a fact that will come in handy in trigonometry class, the science of sound, and many other fields.

, Repeat the experiment above, but instead of changing how much weight you've added or how high you've dropped it, use a much shorter or longer string.


This time you will definitely notice a change. In fact, changing the length of the string is the only thing that will change the period and frequency of a pendulum.

, For older students or aspiring physicists, pendulums are a great way to learn the relationships between acceleration, friction, and trigonometry . Search for ""pendulum equations,"" or devise your own experiments to find them. Some questions to consider:


How fast is the bob moving at the lowest point? How do you find the speed of the bob at any point?
How much kinetic energy does the bob have at any point in the pendulum? For help, use the equation: Kinetic Energy = .5 x Mass of Bob x Velocity2

How can you predict the period of a pendulum based on the string's length?

"
"
Adjust the length of the string to measure time.,
Use your pendulum to measure nearby vibrations, including earthquakes.,
Use a special pendulum called a Foucault Pendulum to prove that the earth rotates.",How to Use a Pendulum3," While pulling the string back farther and changing the weight doesn't change the period, lengthening or shortening the string does. This is how old clocks are made -- if you change the length of the pendulum perfectly you can make a period, or full swing, take two seconds. Count the number of periods and you know how much time has passed. Pendulum clocks are attached to gears so that every time the pendulum swings the second hand of the clock moves.
In a grandfather clock, the weight swinging one way makes the ""tick"" and swinging back makes the ""tock.""

, Seismographs, machines that measure the intensity and direction of earthquakes, are complex pendulums that move only when the earth's crust moves. Though calibrating a pendulum to only measure tectonic plates is incredibly complicated, you can turn almost any pendulum into a basic seismograph using a pen and some paper.


Tape a pen or pencil to the weight at the end of your pendulum.
Place a piece of paper under the pendulum so that the pen touches the paper and can leave marks.
Gently shake the pendulum, but not the string. The harder you shake the pendulum, the larger the marks on your piece of paper. This corresponds to a larger ""earthquake.""
Real seismographs have a rotating piece of paper so that you can see the earthquake's power over time.
Pendulums were used to measure earthquakes as early as 132 AD in China. , Though people knew that the earth spun on it's axis, Foucault's Pendulum was the earliest visible proof of the concept. To replicate it you'll need a large pendulum, at least 16 feet long with a weight over 25 pounds, to minimize outside variables like wind or friction. Put your pendulum in motion, moving enough so that it can swing for a long time.
As time progresses, you will notice that the pendulum is swinging in a different direction than you started it.
This happens because the pendulum moves in a straight line while the earth beneath it rotates.
In the northern hemisphere the pendulum will shift clockwise and in the southern it will shift counter-clockwise.
Though complicated, you can use a Foucault Pendulum to calculate your latitude using a trigonometric equation.

Learn how atomic energy is converted into electricity.,

Look at atomic power producer's websites online.",How to Study Atomic Energy Production," The electron cloud makes up most of the volume of an atom. This is the area in which you are likely to find negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus. It is important to realize, however, that despite the large percent of volume that the electron cloud makes up, its mass is so little that it is negligible., The center of the atom is known as the nucleus. This is where the mass of the atom is concentrated. The nucleus contains positively charged protons and neutral particles called neutrons. This mass is very compact and takes up very little space in the atom., Since all protons are positively charged, they repel each other. These strong repulsion forces would tear the nucleus apart, but they are overpowered by a force known as the strong nuclear force. The strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together despite the repulsive forces of protons. To generate nuclear energy, the strong nuclear force must be overcome. Only then is the stored energy in the nucleus released as heat, which can be converted into electricity.Usually the nucleus of an atom is very stable and is able to survive conditions such as chemical reactions and chemical transformations. This is true for all atoms of the periodic table except for the f-block group that is called the actinides group of atoms. This group of atoms is usually very unstable and undergoes radioactive decay instantly to give relatively more stable atoms with the release of nuclear energy that is manifested as heat and gamma-radiation.

, The method used to generate atomic energy from radioactive atoms is to destabilize the nucleus. This is done through the use of highly energetic neutrons that are used to bombard the nuclei of the heavy atom.The nucleus of the atom breaks apart and releases its stored nuclear energy in the form of heat which can be converted into electricity.Thus, the impetus for generating energy led scientists to investigate methods of destabilizing nuclei of radioactive atoms in order to induce it to decay radioactively with the release of a large amount of energy that can be used for generating electricity.

, This group contains elements such as uranium and plutonium. Other atoms can also be used for this purpose, but the price and availability of other actinides can be a hinderance. Actinides have a large number of protons and neutrons, making them more suitable to split for nuclear fission.Fission is the process by which large atoms break into smaller atoms releasing nuclear energy.

, Most commonly, you would use neutrons. Negatively charged particles will be repelled by the electron cloud surrounding the atom, and positively charged atoms will be repelled by the electrostatic forces in the nucleus. Neutrons avoid these interactions and more easily reach the nucleus with enough energy to start fission. The particles are propelled toward the atoms with some type of particle accelerating technology, such as a neutron gun.Neutrons have no net charge. They are neutral particles.

, Splitting an atom does not result in instant electricity. In fact, it mostly generates a lot of heat. To create usable (electric) energy, we use that heat to boil large quantities of water to turn turbines. The water is then recycled and pumped back into the steam generator. Water from a lake or other nearby source is used to keep the generator cool enough to avoid a meltdown, and the steam produced leaves from the large towers that are associated with nuclear plants.In addition, try to find out about the different types of models used as building structures, and find out what impacts different styles have on the power production process.

, The process of using nuclear reactions for the purpose of generating energy in a reactor must be a controlled process. The rate of fission must be closely monitored at all times. This is usually achieved by passing neutron particles through a medium such as heavy water. The heavy water slows down the neutrons so that they do not have enough velocity to trigger uncontrolled fission process of the nucleus.Uncontrolled nuclear fission is the principle behind the function of the atomic bomb, not nuclear energy production.
Heavy water is a term for the chemical compound D2O. This compound is made by replacing the hydrogen in water with deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen that contains a neutron).
Heavy water can sometimes be decomposed by the effect of the highly energetic neutrons. Other compounds that are used as medium for the slowing of the speed of the neutrons include the graphite form of carbon atoms.

, View the diagrams and photos they provide of their power producing structures. These photos will give you a good idea of how they look and operate. Different plants will have slightly different designs and technologies for harnessing the atomic energy released in a nuclear reaction.

Become ordained in the field of metaphysics.",How to Study Metaphysics," Start by understanding the basic concepts of physics, math, logic, and philosophy. It seems difficult but introductory level books and Internet research can help. These fields are all crucial to your learning about metaphysics in general.


Understand the philosophy of mathematics. Do not simply solve sums. Understand the concept of numbers and patterns in the universe.
Gain a sound understanding of concepts related to physics. Concentrate on Einstein’s theory of relativity which explains how motion works by moving at constant, relative speeds between different inertial frames of reference.;
, Metaphysics deals largely with understanding the difference between concrete and abstract objects. A concrete object is something quantifiable – a thing that you can physically touch or see. An abstract object is less definable because it is not something represented physically, but something embodied by an idea. For example, a number is an abstract object because it correlates to the idea of counting or measuring something. The physical thing being counted is a concrete object.An abstract object does not exist in any particular time or space (such as ideas, mathematical objects, and fictional entities). Abstract objects are often called “particulars” or “universals.”
Morality is considered causally inert because being good or bad doesn’t cause something to happen. It is merely an idea that qualifies or categorizes a thing.
Metaphysicians are mostly concerned with the nature of objects and their properties.

, Quantum physics posits that objects have a dual type of nature – what is known and what is not known. Simply, one cannot determine every unknown aspect about a particular object because there is always something beyond human knowledge, something unknown.Quantum physicists believe that determinism was proven incorrect with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle claims that there is a limit to what one can know about things; therefore, nothing can ever be fully known.

, Metaphysical Cosmology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the origin and development of the universe. It addresses questions about the universe beyond the scope of physical science.Cosmology is the study of how the world/universe operates. An example of a question cosmologists try to answer would be, “What is the purpose of the cosmos?”
Cosmogony is the study of how the world/universe originated. An example of a question cosmogonists try to answer is “Did the Big Bang event create the idea of time itself?”

, Determinism proposes that every event — including every human decision and action — is the ""inevitable and necessary consequence"" of prior occurrences.Determinists believe a human being's future depends on present and past events beyond the individual's influence. In philosophy it is believed that human decision is based on past events.
Since metaphysics is related to the study of questions about existence, creation, and what it all means, there is a clear link with religion. Deciding whether you believe in determinism or not is a key factor in furthering your personal understanding and study of metaphysics because this is the foundation of how people interact with the world. If there is no free will, then humanity’s relationship with the world is much different than if they do have free will. Your study of metaphysics hinges largely on how you personally understand this one aspect.

, Since metaphysics often focuses on the origins of the universe and the connection of humans to the universe, religion often comes in to play. Scientifically, the study of metaphysics deals with much more than just the religious aspects; however, those who want to teach and understand the more abstract elements of metaphysics usually do so under the umbrella of religion.Religion attempts to provide a metaphysical understanding of human existence, so the two are closely related.

, One way to learn about metaphysics in your free time is to spend some time browsing the topic on the internet. Of course, you’ll need to be careful about where you get your information – make sure you only read articles from reputable sources.


Any article from a .edu URL should contain information that was fact-checked by an expert in the field., If you are interested in expanding your knowledge about metaphysics, try to get involved in organizations that deal with this area of study. At the very least, you should read the organizations’ websites to stay up-to-date on new ideas in the field and information about further learning.


You can also try to subscribe to them on various social media platforms to get more access to relevant information that will interest you.
Consider following the Metaphysical Society,the Metaphysical Society of America,the World Metaphysical Association,and the New Hope Metaphysical Society., Many professional and academic organizations create regular newsletters that they send out to all of their members containing information regarding news in the field, updates on society issues, and interesting publications on the topic. You may have to pay a fee to get the newsletter, but it is a great way to get more information on a topic you’re interested in.


The Metaphysical Society of America has an email list that you can subscribe to in order to receive information from their organization.The Metaphysical Society also has a newsletter you can subscribe to., A great way to learn about a topic is by attending conferences hosted by organizations that are devoted to the study of that particular topic. To learn more about metaphysics, try to attend some conferences aimed at understanding metaphysical topics.


Consider attending the annual conference hosted by the Society for the Metaphysics of Science (SMS).Try to attend the annual meetings held by the Metaphysical Society., Primary texts are the foundational texts for any field of study. These are the books and academic articles that other scholars and researchers build on in their additional analyses of the topic.


For metaphysics, some important primary texts to familiarize yourself with include Aristotle’s “Metaphysics,” Plato’s Phaedo, and The Nature of Metaphysics by D. F. Pears., There are many institutions that offer courses on the metaphysical sciences – like the University of Metaphysical Sciences.These kinds of courses will allow you to study metaphysics with the help of trained professionals who will guide you in your journey toward understanding.


These courses will help you learn about various metaphysical philosophies as well as aid you in your path toward a career relating to the metaphysical sciences if that is what you desire.Some regular universities offer courses on metaphysics too.

, Getting a degree in metaphysics will allow you more prestige as a metaphysical teacher or counselor by supplying you with the academic/professional background necessary to foster the kind of trust and respect so often required in this field. A degree will help you acquire more job opportunities A degree in the field of metaphysics will help you achieve greater potential for opportunities to involve yourself in your chosen field, a greater understanding of the world around you, and better prospects in the field of metaphysics with regard to possible future employment.

, Many people who work as a metaphysical professional do so under the umbrella of religious affiliation. Since the law does not typically separate the religious from the spiritual, metaphysical practitioners usually become ordained in their field in order to teach and guide others in the study of metaphysics.To become ordained as a metaphysical practitioner, you will most likely need to enroll in a training program that offers ordination as an option. Consider a program like the two year course offered by the International Metaphysical Ministry (IMM) that ordains those who complete their training.While a metaphysical degree can help you establish yourself as a trained professional, becoming ordained in the field will legally allow you to teach your beliefs to others.

Begin with the wave equation.,

Solve the above differential equation for ψ~{\displaystyle {\tilde {\psi }}}.,
Transform back into the x{\displaystyle x} space.,
Arrive at the solution.",How to Solve the Wave Equation in One Dimension," The wave equation can be derived from various fields in physics, but all wave equations in one dimension must satisfy the form below, where ψ=ψ(x,t){\displaystyle \psi =\psi (x,t)} is the displacement function and c{\displaystyle c} is a constant. As usual, ψ(±∞)=0.{\displaystyle \psi (\pm \infty )=0.}


1c2∂2ψ∂t2=∂2ψ∂x2{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{c^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\psi }{\partial t^{2}}}={\frac {\partial ^{2}\psi }{\partial x^{2}}}}
;
, The point of integral transforms such as the Fourier transform is to simplify the problem in a different space. Once we are done, we then transform back into position space, as desired. In this article, we insert a normalization constant out front for symmetry with the inverse transform.

Let's start with the left side. We can pull the time derivatives out of the integral because the integral does not depend on time.


1(2π)1/2∫−∞∞1c2∂2ψ∂t2e−ikxdx=1c2∂2∂t21(2π)1/2∫−∞∞ψe−ikxdx=1c2∂2ψ~(k,t)∂t2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {1}{c^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\psi }{\partial t^{2}}}e^{-ikx}{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{c^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}}{\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\psi e^{-ikx}{\mathrm {d} }x\\&={\frac {1}{c^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}{\tilde {\psi }}(k,t)}{\partial t^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}



Now we move on to the right. We can perform integration by parts twice to get the −k2{\displaystyle -k^{2}} constant out of the integral.


1(2π)1/2∫−∞∞∂2ψ∂x2e−ikxdx=1(2π)1/2∫−∞∞−k2ψe−ikxdx=−k2ψ~(k,t){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\frac {\partial ^{2}\psi }{\partial x^{2}}}e^{-ikx}{\mathrm {d} }x&={\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }-k^{2}\psi e^{-ikx}{\mathrm {d} }x\\&=-k^{2}{\tilde {\psi }}(k,t)\end{aligned}}}



We have transformed into the k{\displaystyle k} space. Now, we equate the two results we just obtained (we move the c2{\displaystyle c^{2}} to the right) to obtain the wave equation in this space.


∂2ψ~∂t2=−k2c2ψ~{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}{\tilde {\psi }}}{\partial t^{2}}}=-k^{2}c^{2}{\tilde {\psi }}}




, This is a linear, homogeneous, ordinary differential equation, which is considerably easier to solve.

Set up the characteristic equation. For equations of this form, we try ψ~=erx,{\displaystyle {\tilde {\psi }}=e^{rx},} because derivatives of the exponential function are multiples of itself. Then, we see that (r2+k2c2)erx=0.{\displaystyle (r^{2}+k^{2}c^{2})e^{rx}=0.} Since erx{\displaystyle e^{rx}} can never be 0, we are looking for roots of the equation below. 


r2+k2c2=0{\displaystyle r^{2}+k^{2}c^{2}=0}



Solve the characteristic equation for r.{\displaystyle r.}


r=±ick{\displaystyle r=\pm ick}



By linearity, the general solution is ψ~=F~e−ickt+G~eickt,{\displaystyle {\tilde {\psi }}={\tilde {F}}e^{-ickt}+{\tilde {G}}e^{ickt},} where F~{\displaystyle {\tilde {F}}} and G~{\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}} are arbitrary constants. 


, Now that we have ψ~,{\displaystyle {\tilde {\psi }},} all we need to do is to transform back to obtain the physically meaningful result.


ψ(x,t)=1(2π)1/2∫−∞∞ψ~(k,t)eikxdk=1(2π)1/2∫−∞∞(F~e−ickt+G~eickt)eikxdk=1(2π)1/2∫−∞∞(F~eik(x−ct)+G~eik(x+ct))dk=F(x−ct)+G(x+ct){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\psi (x,t)&={\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\tilde {\psi }}(k,t)e^{ikx}{\mathrm {d} }k\\&={\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }({\tilde {F}}e^{-ickt}+{\tilde {G}}e^{ickt})e^{ikx}{\mathrm {d} }k\\&={\frac {1}{(2\pi )^{1/2}}}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }({\tilde {F}}e^{ik(x-ct)}+{\tilde {G}}e^{ik(x+ct)}){\mathrm {d} }k\\&=F(x-ct)+G(x+ct)\end{aligned}}}


, The general solution below, called d'Alembert's solution, describes one-dimensional waves, where F{\displaystyle F} and G{\displaystyle G} are any functions, as long as they contain their respective arguments x−ct{\displaystyle x-ct} and x+ct.{\displaystyle x+ct.} This solution describes a linear combination of waves propagating in the positive and negative x{\displaystyle x} directions, respectively. We can clearly see that c{\displaystyle c} denotes the velocity of the wave; for example, for light waves, c{\displaystyle c} denotes the speed of light. 


ψ(x,t)=F(x−ct)+G(x+ct){\displaystyle \psi (x,t)=F(x-ct)+G(x+ct)}

List down anything that is given to you to the side under a category labeled ""known"".,
Look for the unknown variables.,

Keep repeating the last step for each unknown quantity in turn.,
Put a box, circle, or underline your answer to make your work neat.

",How to Solve Any Physics Problem," It is just a problem, not the end of the world!;
, If it is a long problem, read and understand it in parts till you get even a slight understanding of what is going on.

, It cannot be emphasized enough how much easier a problem will be once it is drawn out. Ideally, a free body diagram is what you will draw, but even drawing how you imagine the wording of the problem inside your head (like a chart maybe) will make solving this problem easier. There are often marks awarded for drawing a correct diagram. Once you are done with this, try to bring this drawing into motion like a movie if you can. This is not really necessary but will give you a clear understanding of what is happening in the problem.

, e.g. you are given two velocities. Label the first V1 and set it equal to the value given. Label the other value V2 and set it equal to the value provided for it.

, Ask yourself, 'What am I solving for?' and 'What are the unknown variables in this problem?' List these to the side as well under a category labeled ""unknown"".

, If you are able to look up equations you do not remember exactly and think might be applicable to the problem, do so and write them down.

, At times there may be different formulas for the same set of variables and you may be confused as to which one to use. Hence when you memorize the formula, also remember the conditions in which they hold good ( conditions under which that formula can be applied). for example: - v = u + at can be applied only when the acceleration is constant. So in a question if the acceleration is not constant, you will know you are not supposed to use this equation here. This may also help to increase the subject understanding in general.

, Take your formula and try to solve for one variable at a time. Solve for each variable that is listed under the ""unknown"" category. Try to solve for variables that you can determine easily first.

, If you can't do one, try others first as you may be able to work it out when you have information from other answers.

Position the flashlight or the laser pointer at one end of the row of cards.,
Move the flashlight or laser pointer so it does not hit the center of the first card.",How to Prove That Light Travels in a Straight Path1," This experiment will allow you to create a light pinhole, which will show you how light travels in a straight line by filtering it through a hole. To create a light pinhole, you will need the following supplies:Three index cards.
A piece of modeling clay or sticky tack. You can also use double sided tape.
A flashlight or a laser pointer.
A hole puncher.
A ruler.;
, To do this without any excessive measuring, use the ruler to draw two diagonal lines on an index card that connect the opposite corners of the card. Repeat this for the other two cards.


Take the hole puncher and punch a hole at the center of the card where the two lines intersect. Do this for the other two cards.

, The cards need to stand vertically, at equal distance from each other, and in a straight line for this experiment to work.


Form a stand for the cards using the clay so the cards are straight and upright. Use the ruler to ensure the cards are two to five inches from each other.
You can also use double sided tape to attach the cards to a surface in a vertical position. Do not cover or obstruct the hole in the center of the cards with modeling clay or tape.

, Hold the flashlight in your hand so it hits the center of the hole in the first card. Turn on the flashlight or the laser pointer.


Note that the light can be seen through all the holes. You should be able to see the light go through all the holes and land on a wall or surface beyond the last index card.

, You will note that the light does not travel beyond the card. This illustrates that light will travel in a straight line when it hits a non reflective material like the index card.

Calculate the viscosity of the liquid.",How to Measure Viscosity," Viscosity measures a liquid’s resistance to flow.A fluid with high viscosity flows very slowly, like honey. A fluid with low viscosity flows quickly, like water. The unit for viscosity is a pascal second (Pa s)., This experiment will take measurements of a sphere and its passage through liquid to calculate viscosity. The equation for viscosity is  /9v where ps is the density of the sphere, pl is the density of the liquid, g is acceleration due to gravity, a is the radius of the sphere, and v is the velocity of the sphere., Density is mass per unit volume of an object and is designated with a p. In this equation you need to measure the density of both the sphere, ps, and the liquid, pl, it is passing through. The radius of the sphere, a, can be found by measuring the circumference of the sphere and dividing that by 2π. The acceleration due to gravity, g, is a constant dependent on the atmosphere of the planet you’re on. In this case, you are on earth so g is 9.8m/s2.The velocity of the sphere, v, is calculated during the experiment and is the time it takes an object to travel a specific distance in meters per second (m/s). 
, To calculate viscosity of a liquid, you will need a sphere, a graduated cylinder, a ruler, a stopwatch, the liquid in question, a scale, and a calculator.This experiment has many steps, but when followed correctly, they will allow you to calculate the viscosity of any liquid.

 The sphere can be a small marble or steel ball. Make sure its diameter is no greater than half the diameter of the graduate cylinder so it can easily be dropped into the cylinder. 

 A graduated cylinder is a plastic container that has graded markings on the side that allow you to measure volume. 

 You can use a watch instead of a stopwatch, but your measurements will be more accurate with a stopwatch.

 The liquid must be clear enough to see the marble as it’s dropped through the liquid. Try testing many different liquids with different flow rates to see how their viscosities differ. 


, The density of both the sphere and the liquid are needed to perform the viscosity calculation. The formula for density is d=m/v{\displaystyle d=m/v}, where d is density, m is the mass of the object, and v is the volume of the object.

 Measure the mass by placing the sphere on a balance. Record the mass in grams (g).

 Determine the volume of a sphere using the formula V= (4/3) x π x r3, where V is volume, π is the constant 3.14, and r is the radius of the sphere. You can find the radius by measuring around the center of the sphere to get its circumference and then dividing the circumference by 2π. 

 You can also find volume by measuring the displacement of water in a graduated cylinder. Record the initial water level, place the sphere in the water, and record the new water level. Subtract the initial from the new water level. This number equals the volume of your sphere in milliliters (mL).

 Calculate density with the formula d=m/v{\displaystyle d=m/v}. The unit for density is g/mL.


, Using the same density formula from above, you will next calculate the density of the liquid in question.

 Measure the mass of the liquid by first weighing the empty graduated cylinder. Pour your liquid into the graduated cylinder and then weigh it again. Subtract the mass of the empty cylinder from that of the cylinder with the liquid in it to obtain the mass of the liquid in grams (g).

 To find volume of the liquid, simply determine the amount of liquid you poured into the graduated cylinder by using the graded markings on the side of the cylinder. Record the volume in milliliters (mL).

 Use the formula d=m/v{\displaystyle d=m/v} and your measurements to calculate the density of the liquid in g/mL. 


, Slowly pour your experimental liquid into the graduate cylinder, filling the cylinder about halfway to three-quarters of the way to the top.

Draw a mark at the top of the cylinder about 2.5 centimeter (1 in) (1 in) from the top of the liquid.

 Draw a second mark about 2.5 centimeter (1 in) (1 in) from the bottom of the graduated cylinder.

 Measure the distance between the top and bottom marks. Place the bottom of the ruler at the bottom mark and record the distance to the top mark.


, Drop the ball into the liquid and start the stopwatch when the bottom of the ball reaches the mark at the top of the cylinder. When the ball reaches the mark you made at the bottom of the cylinder, stop the stopwatch.

 Liquids with low viscosities are going to be more difficult to measure with this method because it will be harder to accurately start and stop the stopwatch.

 Repeat this step at least three times (the more times you repeat, the more accurate your measurement will be) and average the three times together. To find the average, add up the times for each trial and divide by the number of trials you performed. 


, Velocity is a measurement of distance traveled over elapsed time to travel that distance. The formula for velocity is v=d/t{\displaystyle v=d/t} where v is velocity, d is distance traveled, and t is time.

 Using your measurements, plug them into the equation v=d/t{\displaystyle v=d/t} to find the velocity of the sphere. 


, Plug the information you have obtained into the formula for viscosity: viscosity = /9v where ps is the density of the sphere, pl is the density of the liquid, g is acceleration due to gravity (a fixed value of 9.8 m/s2), a is the radius of the sphere, and v is the velocity of the sphere.For example, let’s say the density of your fluid is 1.4 g/mL, the density of your sphere is 5 g/mL, the radius of the sphere is 0.002 m, and the velocity of the sphere is 0.05 m/s.

 Plugging into the equation: viscosity = /(9 x 0.05) = 0.314 Pa s

Gather your materials.,
Place the objects on the black paper.,
Have one person hold the flashlight and one person hold the mirror.,
Turn on the flashlight.",How to Prove That Light Travels in a Straight Path2," This experiment will use the reflection of light on objects to show how light moves in a straight line. You need to conduct this experiment with someone else, as one person will hold the flashlight and one person will hold the mirror. You will need the following supplies:Two to three sheets of black paper.
A flashlight.
A small mirror.
Small objects like buttons, bottle caps, or dimes.

, Lay the black paper down on the ground in a lowly lit room or, if possible, a dark room. Then, place two to three small objects in the center of the paper.

, The person with the flashlight will sit in front of the objects with her back to the objects.The other person will hold the small mirror so it is facing the objects.

, The person will then turn on the flashlight so it is shining away from the objects.


The other person will use the small mirror to reflect the flashlight so it hits the objects. Move close to the light, at an angle, to catch the light so it hits the objects.
You may need to position more than one mirror to create a light path that shines on the objects. Play around with reflecting the light on the mirrors until the light hits the objects. You can also move the objects around the room to create a more complicated light path, using the flashlight as the light source.
This experiment shows that light travels in a straight line in the air. But it also bounces off of a reflective surface, like a mirror. The angle of the light as it bounces off the mirror will be the same as the angle of the light as it hits the mirror. The mirror reflects the light and changes its path from a straight line to an angled straight line.

Place the ruler in the water.",How to Prove That Light Travels in a Straight Path3," This experiment will illustrate that light travels in a straight line in the air but it will bend when it hits a certain surface, like water and oil. To conduct this experiment, you will need:A large glass jar.
Access to water.
One cup of oil.
A ruler.
A spoon.

, Fill the jar halfway with water.


Make sure the jar is large enough to fit the ruler.

, Spoon oil into the jar so it forms a solid layer of oil on the surface of the water.

, Position it so it is vertical in the water and you can see the numbers on the side of the ruler.


Note that the numbers appear stretched or magnified as the light rays bend in the oil and the water. Move the ruler from side to side to note the different appearances of the ruler numbers in the oil and in the water.
This will show that light travels at different speeds in different mediums, such as air, oil, and water. It will travel in a straight line in the air, but it will bend when it changes speed due to contact with a certain medium, like oil or water.

Start revising early.,

Make use of learning aids to retain information better.,
Learn some things by heart.,
Test yourself.,
Study with someone else.,
Learn all the equations.,
Revise everything taught in class.,
Have the right equipment.,
Get a good night's sleep.,
Use your time wisely.,
Read the exam questions carefully.,
Get to the point quickly but show your working.,
Have confidence.",How to Pass a Physics Exam," You will not grasp the concepts of physics the night before the exam. You must follow a gradual learning process over a period of months.;
, This is common sense. Unless you are a super computer, you will not remember everything in one go, so you will need to be able to read it again. And again, and again until it is second nature to you. You should be able to answer any question at any time, only at this time will you have revised enough.

, For example, use visual aids such as mind maps or diagrams. Make audio aids such as songs and rhymes. It can also help to draw large posters or drawings of some of the concepts and place this on the wall near your bed; study this before going to sleep each night.


Write formulas on Post-It notes or other scraps of paper. Pin these up around the house, including the bathroom. Learn as you're doing regular activities around the house.
Summarize all of your physics notes. Type them all up. Put them into a text to speech program. Listen to this audio file at night while you sleep.

, It is a good idea to learn as many equations and definitions as possible by heart; that way, you get to concentrate on the problems, rather than worrying about what the equation is or scratching your head over what something means.

, In the weeks leading up to the exam, do tests so that you can see whether you're understanding the information properly. Try to find old exams or test papers to do. If you can't get these, look for exam questions online and do those.


Some schools allow access to old exam papers, while other schools don't. Ask before assuming you can't get them.
There are numerous online sites with physics questions and quizzes. This includes revision sites, school sites, university sites and sites from physics fans.

, Team up with friends or fellow students and hold a regular study group. You can ask each other for help in understanding the concepts; you can also quiz one another.


Teach each other. It's actually a great way of learning.

, This can be hard to do, but about 75 to 95 percent of physics questions involve an equation or two. If you do maths, this will be easier than you think, but even if you do not, don't worry about it. A Google search or two can help you with the ones you do not fully understand.

, This includes any missed lessons; just because you weren't there doesn't mean it won't come up in the exam. Get notes from someone else if you've missed a class or more.

, This does not mean have a ruler, or a pen, find that pen you know you will get you the results. You should know what type of pen you want to use, as having to use one you are unfamiliar with can put you off. Be prepared as soon as possible.

, Sleep as normal, as breaking the cycle can be worse than sleeping for about five hours.

, It goes without saying that if you waste your time on one question, rather than moving on, this can be very dangerous. If you ever want to do a physics paper perfectly, you need to know that answering more questions equal more marks (hopefully). The standard time mark ratio is one mark to one minute, but sometimes changes.

, Do not rush ahead assuming you don't need to read it closely; a small change might be present that throws off everything you've assumed.

, Do not repeat your discussion points, as this is wasteful and it demonstrates a lack of clear thinking. Whatever your answers, always show how you reached them. When you make errors (such as transposing numbers or adding up inaccurately), sometimes the working can help score you at least something for the question because it demonstrates that you at least knew the methodology and tried to use it.

, Unlike the English test, physics wants you to be as cocky as anything. You need to show this exam who is the master, and they only way to this is by tackling every question as if you are a physics ace.


Do be careful not to be overconfident, as you will stay thinking that you are actually a physics ace rather than actually being one, and that will only end badly.

Relax.,
Minimize your reference checks.,
Analyze the units.,
Understand how the formula is structured.,
Make sure that you can focus.,
Learn how to derive formulae.,
Train your memory.",How to Memorize Math and Physics Formulas," Maths and Physics problems are not meant to be studied under stress. Relax your mind. By doing this, you will be able to focus more on your task.

, Many people think that once they take a glance at a formula, it is in their mind, but when they wake up the next day, they are shocked to realize that the formula leaked out during the night. This is why it is a good idea to practice solving a problem with the formula without looking it up. You must do this as many times as you can. Repetition leads to Memorization.

, Put the raw units of each variable into the formula and see if you can get the units of the answer.

, You already have a decent gut feeling about the concept. Make sense of the formula. For instance, a = F / m. F is on the top of the fraction. That makes sense, since if you exert more force on an object, it will speed up more quickly. Mass is on the bottom of the fraction, since more mass means more inertia, making the object more difficult to accelerate. The opposite formula (a = m / F) does not make sense. Using this incorrect formula, a strong force (large number on the bottom of the fraction) would cause a smaller acceleration, which does not make sense.

, Do you ever study while you are hungry or thirsty? How does it feel? You always feel reluctant to focus because you are in a rush to go grab some pizza. If you start to feel hungry or thirsty, quit studying those formulas and satisfy yourself with some food or drink.

, That way you can memorize just the bare minimum number of formulae that you need to derive the rest from. For example, the formulae in List of mole concept formulae and List of circular motion formulae are all you will ever need to learn in order derive the other formulae involving only the variables on those pages.

, Each time you learn a new formula that tells you how to compute one quantity in terms of other quantities, get a friend to randomly pick one of the formulae you previously learned in your current course and describe it and then put up with the boredom of struggling to remember what the formula was until which ever comes first of you getting it right or 4 hours going by without you ever looking in the book to see what the formula was during those 4 hours. If those 4 hours are not yet up, get your friend to randomly pick one of the formulae they haven't already picked and struggle to recall it until you get it right and keep going until which ever comes first of using up all the formulae or 4 hours going by. Each time you do that, you will make yourself better at extracting weaker memories back into your consciousness making it easier to learn formulae in the future.

Spin the shaft as fast as possible.",How to Make a Simple Electric Generator," Cardboard will serve as the frame and support for your simple generator. Use a ruler to measure a cardboard strip that is 8 centimetres (3.1 in) by 30.4 centimetres (12.0 in). Cut this strip out with scissors or a utility knife. This single piece will be folded to form the frame., Use a ruler to measure along the length of the cardboard. Make your first mark at 8 centimetres (3.1 in). Your second mark should be at 11.5 centimetres (4.5 in), and your third mark should be at 19.5 centimetres (7.7 in). The final mark will be at 22.7 centimetres (8.9 in).This creates segments of 8 centimetres (3.1 in), 3.5 centimetres (1.4 in), 8 centimetres (3.1 in), 3.2 centimetres (1.3 in), and 7.7 centimetres (3.0 in). Do not cut these segments.

, Fold the cardboard along each mark. This will make your flat piece of cardboard into a rectangular frame. This frame will house the components of your electric motor., Push a nail through the center of the cardboard frame. Make sure you go through all three pieces of cardboard that are folded into the center. This will create the hole for your shaft. You can now insert a metal shaft, or use the nail as your shaft.The metal shaft does not have to be anything in particular. Any piece of metal that will fit through the hole and come all the way out the other side of the frame is acceptable. The nail you use to make the hole will work perfectly.

, Make several turns around the cardboard box with enamel coated copper wire (#30 magnet wire). Wind 200 feet (61 m) of wire as tight as you can. Leave about 16 to 18 inches (40.6 to 45.7 cm) of wire loose on each end to connect to your meter, light bulb, or other electronic device. The more ""turns"" or winds you make around the cardboard frame, the more power your generator should produce., Use a knife or a wire stripper to remove the insulation from each end of the wire. Remove about 2.54 centimetres (1.00 in) of insulation from each side. This will allow you to connect the wire to an electronic device., Attach the two wires you have loose at the ends of the windings to a red LED, #49 miniature bulb, or a 1.5V grain-of-wheat lamp. Or, connect the test leads from an AC voltmeter or multimeter to them. Keep in mind that you are producing a very low voltage, and larger devices (e.g. a regular light bulb) will not be powered by this generator., Use a high strength hot melt glue or epoxy to glue four ceramic magnets to the shaft. You want the magnet to be stationary with respect to the shaft. The magnets should be glued onto the shaft after the shaft has been inserted into the frame. Allow the glue to dry for several minutes (the instructions on the container can tell you exact drying times for your type of glue).For best results, use 1x2x5 cm ceramic magnets (these can be found online for a reasonable price). Glue them so that two magnets are facing the coil with their north side, and two are facing the coil with their south side.

, This allows you to see if the ends of the magnets hit the inside of the frame. The magnets must turn freely, but as close as possible to the walls of the frame. Again, having the magnet's ends as close the copper wire windings as possible will increase the ""exciting"" action of the magnetic fields the magnet produces., You may want to wind a string around the end of the shaft, then pull it sharply to turn the magnets. You could even just spin it with your fingers. As the shaft turns, you should get a small voltage (enough to light a 1.5 volt light bulb).You could improve the power output by putting a pinwheel on the end of the shaft and connecting it to an electric fan to turn the wheel. Keep in mind that this is only good to demonstrate the operation of the generator since you use more electricity turning it than you create.

Begin with the spacetime interval in the boosted frame.,
Recall the Lorentz transformations.,
Substitute these expressions into the spacetime interval.,
Simplify the resulting expression.,
Relate γ2{\displaystyle \gamma ^{2}} with β2{\displaystyle \beta ^{2}}.",How to Show Spacetime Invariance," We consider two reference frames - a stationary coordinate frame, and a ""boosted"" frame that is moving at some velocity relative to us. We use primes to denote quantities measured in the boosted frame. 

(cΔt′)2−(Δx′)2{\displaystyle (c\Delta t^{\prime })^{2}-(\Delta x^{\prime })^{2}};
, For simplicity, we will deal with 1+1 dimensions instead of 3+1, for the quantities perpendicular to the boost direction are unchanged. Below, γ=11−v2c2{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}} is the Lorentz factor and β=vc{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {v}{c}}} is the velocity in terms of the speed of light. Writing the transformations this way sheds light on the symmetry of space and time. 


Δx′=γ(Δx−βcΔt){\displaystyle \Delta x^{\prime }=\gamma (\Delta x-\beta c\Delta t)}

cΔt′=γ(cΔt−βΔx){\displaystyle c\Delta t^{\prime }=\gamma (c\Delta t-\beta \Delta x)}

,

(γ(cΔt−βΔx))2−(γ(Δx−βcΔt))2{\displaystyle (\gamma (c\Delta t-\beta \Delta x))^{2}-(\gamma (\Delta x-\beta c\Delta t))^{2}}

, Factor out the γ2{\displaystyle \gamma ^{2}} and expand. Cancel like terms and collect the 1−β2{\displaystyle 1-\beta ^{2}} attached to both (cΔt)2{\displaystyle (c\Delta t)^{2}} and (Δx)2.{\displaystyle (\Delta x)^{2}.}
γ2=γ2=γ2=γ2(1−β2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\gamma ^{2}\\=\;&\gamma ^{2}\\=\;&\gamma ^{2}\\=\;&\gamma ^{2}(1-\beta ^{2})\end{aligned}}}
,

Recall that γ=11−v2c2.{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}.} This can alternatively be written as γ=11−β2.{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}.}

Now we square both sides.


γ2=11−β2{\displaystyle \gamma ^{2}={\frac {1}{1-\beta ^{2}}}}



Here, it is obvious that γ2(1−β2)=1{\displaystyle \gamma ^{2}(1-\beta ^{2})=1} is an identity, and thus cancels itself out. Since our final result is independent of the velocity of the boosted frame, we have shown that the spacetime interval is measured to be the same in any inertial reference frame. Note that this does not apply to accelerated frames, or scenarios where gravity is non-neglectable. 

(cΔt′)2−(Δx′)2=(cΔt)2−(Δx)2{\displaystyle (c\Delta t^{\prime })^{2}-(\Delta x^{\prime })^{2}=(c\Delta t)^{2}-(\Delta x)^{2}}

Determine the mass of the object.,
Calculate the volume of the object through direct measurement.,
Calculate the volume of the object using displacement.,
Calculate the density.",How to Measure the Density of Metals1," Mass is the amount of matter in an object and its unit is grams. It is measured by weighing the object directly.

 Place the object on an accurate scale and record the mass in your notebook.

 Alternatively, you can measure mass by using a balance. Place your object on one side and place weights of known mass on the other side until both sides are balanced. The total mass of the balance weights is equal to the mass of your object. 

 Make sure object is dry so that absorbed water does not affect the accuracy of the weighing.
;
, If the object is regularly shaped and uniform—such as a cylinder or rectangular prism—you can measure its dimensions with a ruler and calculate the volume with a simple equation.

 Measure the length and radius if it is a cylinder or length, width, and depth if it is a rectangle.

 Record your dimensions in millimeters or centimeters. 

 Calculate volume using the formula for the shape of your object. For example, volume of a cylinder is length times pi times radius squared, while the volume of a rectangle is the product of length width and depth.

 Units of volume are centimeters cubed. 


, Measuring dimensions of objects that are irregularly shaped can be difficult and lead to inaccurate measurements and calculations of density. By measuring the amount of water displaced by an object, you can easily determine its volume without complex formulas. Fill a graduated cylinder with enough water to completely submerge the object, but not overflow. 

 Record the water level of the beaker. 

 Gently place the object in the beaker ensuring that it is fully submerged. 

 Record the new water level of the beaker.

 Subtract the new water level from the starting water level. This is the volume of the object in cubic centimeters. Liquids are generally measured in milliliters however one milliliter is equal to one cubic centimeter. , Density is defined as mass divided by volume. To finish your measurement of density, divide the mass you measured by the volume you calculated. The result is the density of the metal measured in g/cm cubed.

 Density=Mass/Volume{\displaystyle Density=Mass/Volume}


"
"
Fill containers with liquids of known density.,
Test the object in the liquids.,
Estimate the density of your object.",How to Measure the Density of Metals2," Choose liquids of various high and low densities. Your estimate will be more accurate if you have a number of liquids of various densities.

 Place your object in the different liquids to see if it sinks or floats. 


, An object immersed in a fluid of similar density will float within the fluid. If it is less dense, it will float, but if it is more dense, it will sink.

 Drop your object in a fluid of known density. 

 If it sinks, try putting it in a different fluid that is more dense. If it floats, put it in a fluid that is less dense. 


, Archimedes’ principle states that an object submerged in a fluid will produce a buoyant force equal to the weight of fluid displaced. When your object floats within the fluid, you have found the approximate density of the object.

Measure water with a graduated cylinder.,
Pour the water into a soda can.,
Set the can over your fuel source.,
Measure the initial temperature of the water.,
Ignite the fuel under the water.,
Take a final temperature reading of the water.,
Find the difference in temperature.,
Multiply the temperature difference by the specific heat of water.,
Factor in the mass of the water.,
Realize that your system loses some energy.",How to Measure Thermal Energy Released from a Flame," It is important to know exactly how much water you are using. This will allow you to calculate how much energy was used to heat the water. Use a graduated cylinder to accurately measure 100 milliliters (3.4  fl oz) of water for the experiment. Record this amount in a notebook., A soda can will conduct heat more efficiently than a glass cylinder. Be careful not to spill any of the water. It is important that the amount of water you recorded is correct., Since heat rises, you will get the most heat transfer if the can is placed directly over the fuel source. Use a stand or build a simple apparatus of some kind to hold the can a few inches above the fuel source. Use metal to hold the can in place.Materials like wood or plastic might melt or catch fire.


, Without the initial temperature of the water, you will be unable to know how much heat was absorbed. Put a thermometer into the water and take a reading. Write down the reading so that your remember it exactly.

For example, your initial reading might be 20 °C (68 °F). It is best to take the measurement in Celsius, as this will simplify your math later on.


, Use a match or grill lighter to ignite the fuel. Common fuels to test include peanut oil, vegetable oil, methanol, or ethanol. This step should be done by or with a supervising adult.Wear gloves and goggles to protect your eyes and hands.


, After all of the fuel has burned, or you extinguish it, you will need a second temperature reading. Use the same thermometer and insert it into the water. Record the final temperature for use in calculating the energy released by burning the fuel.

Your final reading should be higher than your initial reading. For example, it might be around 24 °C (75 °F), depending on your fuel.


, Subtract the initial temperature from the final temperature. This will tell you how much the water temperature was changed by the burning fuel underneath. Convert this number to Celsius if you your measurements were not in Celsius.

You can convert a number from Fahrenheit to Celsius by using the equation C=(F−32)x5/9{\displaystyle C=(F-32)x5/9} where C is the temperature in Celsius and F is the temperature in Fahrenheit.

An example is 24 °C (75.2 °F) - 20 degrees Celsius = 4 degrees Celsius.


, The specific heat of water is the amount of heat it takes to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. For water, the specific heat is one calorie per gram Celsius. That means it takes one calorie to heat one gram of water by one degree Celsius.The unit for specific heat is written as 1 calorie / (gram x degrees Celsius).

Multiplying this by the temperature difference yields 4 °C (39.2 °F) x 1 calorie / (gram x degree Celsius) = 4 calories / gram.


, Now, multiply the product of the heat difference and specific heat by the amount of water you used. One milliliter of water is equal to one gram of water. Make sure you are using the unit grams.This will yield your energetic release. 4 calories / gram x 100 grams (3.5 oz) = 400 calories.


, While some of the heat released is going directly up and into the water, your system is not perfect. Some heat will be lost to the surrounding air. A small amount of heat will also be absorbed by the can itself. There is little that can be done to compensate for the heat loss. If you are trying to do highly precise experiments, you may invest in a commercial calorimeter, but even then you will not be one hundred percent efficient."

Choose the item whose resistance you wish to measure.,
Plug the test leads into the correct test sockets.,
Turn on the multimeter and select the best testing range.,
Touch the multimeter leads to the ends of the component you are testing.,
Turn off the multimeter.",How to Measure Resistance1," For the most accurate measurement, test the resistance of a component individually. Remove the component from the circuit or test it before you install it. Testing the component while still in the circuit can cause inaccurate readings from other components.If you are testing a circuit or even just removing a component, be sure that all power to the circuit is turned off before proceeding.;
, On most multimeters, one test lead will be black and the other will be red. A multimeter often has multiple testing sockets, according to whether it is being used to test for resistance, voltage, or amperage (current). Usually the right sockets to test for resistance are labeled ""COM"" (for common) and one labeled with the Greek letter omega, Ω, which is the symbol for ""ohm"".Plug the black lead into the socket labeled ""COM"" and the red lead into the socket labeled ""ohm"".

, The resistance of a component can range from ohms (1 ohm) to megaohms (1,000,000 ohms). In order to get an accurate reading of resistance you must set the multimeter to the proper range for your component. Some digital multimeters will automatically set the range for you, but others will need to be set manually. If you have a general idea of the range of resistance just set it to that range. If you’re unsure, you can determine the range through trial and error.


If you don’t know the range, start with the middle range setting, usually 20 kilo-ohms (kΩ).
Touch one lead to the end of your component and the other lead to the opposite end.
The number on the screen will either be 0.00, OL, or the actual value of resistance.If the value is zero, the range is set too high and needs to be lowered.
If the screen reads OL (overloaded) the range is set too low and needs to be increased to the next highest range. Test the component again with the new range setting.
If the screen reads a specific number such as 58, that is the value of the resistor. Remember to take into account the range applied. On a digital multimeter the upper right-hand corner should remind you of your range setting. If it has a kΩ in the corner, the actual resistance is 58 kΩ.
Once you get in the right range, try lowering the range one more time to see if you can get a more accurate reading. Use the lowest range setting for the most accurate resistance readings.

, Just as you did when you were setting the range, touch one lead to one end of the component and the other lead to the opposite end. Wait until the numbers stop going up or down and record that number. This is the resistance of you component.


For example, if your reading is .6 and the upper right corner says MΩ the resistance of your component is 0.6 mega-ohms.

, When you are done measuring all of your components, turn off the multimeter and unplug the leads for storage.

Set up the optics bench:


Begin with the optics bench in front of you with the 0 centimeter (0.0 in) mark on your left.,
Retrieve the following materials: linear translator, light sensor & aperture mount, and rotary motion sensor.,
This new apparatus is to be mounted onto the optics bench.,
Connect all sensors to the PASCO interface.

,
Make your final adjustments:


Select one of the double slits from the multi-slit apparatus, at this point it doesn’t matter which one, by spinning the multi-slit wheel until the appropriate slit is mostly in line with the diode laser.,
Perform the experiment:


Select a set of appropriate double slits from the multi-slit apparatus and spin them into position.",How to Perform Young's Double Slit Experiment,"
Install the diode laser at the 0 centimeter (0.0 in) mark facing towards the right. This should require little effort.
Mount the multi-slit apparatus to its appropriate mount. This may require some force and will make a clicking sound when properly installed. Assembly should prove to be rather simple.
Install the newly assembled multi-slit apparatus on the optics bench between the 5 and 10 cm mark. Adjustment will be made later in the experiment to both position and slit settings.;
,


Remove one of the screws from the linear translator that secures the grooved bar and pull it out away from frame of the linear translator.
Install the rotary motion sensor onto the grooved bar. This can be achieved by sliding the grooved bar into the square hole in the center of the rotary motion sensor. One important note is that the set of mounted pulleys on the rotary motion sensor should be facing upwards when installed properly.
Replace the grooved bar to its original position and reinsert the screw.
You should notice that one end of the connecting rod is slightly smaller in diameter and is threaded. In one hand hold the connecting rod with the threaded end up. Place the aperture mount on the rod followed by the light sensor making sure that the aperture of the light sensor is firmly against the rotating disk consisting of varying sized apertures.
Simply screw in the connecting rod (Hand tighten only).
Mount this newly created piece by placing the connecting rod into the last remaining hole of the rotary motion sensor, so that the light sensor apparatus is upright.
Tighten the retention screw on the rotary motion sensor (Hand tighten only).

, On the bottom of the linear translator you should notice a threaded rod with a nut. Also take notice that the optics bench has a narrow slit running through the center of the track and that from either end slightly below the surface of the optics bench this slit opens up into a wider channel just big enough for the nut on the bottom of the linear translator.


Adjust the position of the nut until it enters the highest channel and the linear translator is resting on the raised surface of the optics bench.
Slide the linear translator down the track until the light sensor is approximately 1 meter (3.3 ft) from the multi-slit apparatus. This may require moving the multi-slit apparatus closer to the diode laser.

,, You will be able to feel a slight popping as each slit grouping reaches this position.
Turn the diode laser on by connecting the power supply and flipping the switch on the back of the diode laser. Note that beside the on/off switch there are two knobs. One will adjust the diode laser in the vertical direction and the other in the horizontal direction.
At the other end of the optics bench adjust the aperture setting of the light sensor mount until slit #3 is selected.
With the laser on, adjust both the horizontal and vertical knobs until you have created an interference and diffraction pattern (looks like a line of light) that shines through the narrow slit of the light sensor apparatus that you just adjusted, insuring that that the pattern is also perpendicular to slit #3.
Setup your computer, including a graph on Data Studio plotting intensity vs. distance.

, One thing to keep in mind when choosing is that the smaller the slit size the harder it will be to detect maximums of higher m values.
Turn off the lights and adjust the computer screen in order to reduce ambient light.
Turn on the diode laser.
Move the rotary motion sensor to one side of the linear translator.
Click 'Start' on Data Studio to begin collecting data.
Slowly and smoothly move the rotary motion sensor to the other side of the linear translator.
Click 'Stop' to finish collecting data.
Be sure to collect the following data for a more in-depth analysis and save/print out your graph.

Slit Distance = d (Values may be found on the multi-slit apparatus)
Slit Size = a (Values may be found on the multi-slit apparatus)
Distance from multi-slit apparatus to the light sensor = l
Distances from central maximum to other maximums (see graph) = x

If you don’t know the range, start with the middle range setting, usually 20 kilo-ohms (kΩ).
Touch one lead to the end of your component and the other lead to the opposite end.
The needle will swing across the screen and stop in a specific spot, indicating the resistance of your component.
If the needle swings all the way to the top of the range (the left side), you will need to increase the range setting, zero out the multimeter, and try again.
If the needle swings all the way to the bottom of the range (the right side), you will need to decrease the range setting, zero out the multimeter, and try again.
Analog multimeters must be reset or zeroed out every time the range setting is altered and before testing the component. Touch the ends of both leads together to short the circuit. Ensure the needle is set all the way to zero using the Ohms Adjustment or Zero Control after the leads have been touched to each other.

, Just as you did when you were setting the range, touch one lead to one end of the component and the other lead to the opposite end. The resistance range on a multimeter goes from right to left. The right side is zero and the left side goes up to around 2k (2,000). There are multiple scales on an analog multimeter so be sure to look at the scaled labeled with an Ω that goes from right to left.


As the scale goes up, the higher values are clustered closer together. Setting the correct range is crucial to being able to get an accurate reading for your component.

, Once you have touched the leads to the component, the needle will settle somewhere in between the top and bottom of the scale. Check to make sure you are looking at the ohm scale and record the value where the needle is pointing to. This is the resistance of your component.


For example if you had set the range to 10 Ω and the needle stopped at 9, the resistance of your component is 9 ohms.

, When you are finished using the multimeter, you want to make sure it is properly stored. Setting the voltage to a high range before turning it off ensures that it won’t be damaged the next time it is used if someone doesn’t remember to set the range first. Turn off the multimeter and unplug the leads for storage.

Test resistance on components not in a circuit.,
Test only components that are powered off.,
Check for diodes in the circuit.,
Watch your fingers.",How to Measure Resistance3," Measuring resistance on a component in a circuit will cause inaccurate readings because the multimeter is also measuring resistance from the other components in a circuit as well as the one being tested. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to test resistance on components in circuit.

, Current flowing through a circuit will cause inaccurate readings, as the increased current will create a higher resistance. Also, the additional voltage could damage the multimeter. (For this reason, testing the resistance of a battery is not advised.)


Any capacitors in a circuit being tested for resistance should be discharged before testing. Discharged capacitors may absorb charge from the multimeter's current, creating momentary fluctuations in the reading.

, Diodes conduct electricity in only 1 direction; thus, reversing the position of the multimeter's probes in a circuit with diodes will cause different readings.

, Some resistors or components need to be held in place to maintain contact with the multimeter's probes. Touching the resistor or the probe with your fingers can cause inaccurate readings due to your body absorbing current from the circuit. This is not a significant problem when using a low-voltage multimeter, but it can be a problem when testing resistance with a high-voltage multimeter.


One way to keep your hands off components is to attach them to a testing board, or ""breadboard"" when testing for resistance. You can also attach alligator clips to the multimeter probes to keep the terminals of the resistor or component in place while testing.

Wrap your electronic device in a plastic layer.,
Cover every inch of the device in aluminum foil.,
Alternate plastic and aluminum foil.",How to Make a Faraday Cage1," Wrap your device in plastic wrap, or place it in a plastic bag. This will put a barrier between the device and the conductive aluminum layer. It can also serve as a waterproof layer for extra protection.You can wrap the item in cloth to help prevent edges from poking holes in the plastic and/or aluminum layers, though this is not necessary.;
, The aluminum foil will act as the conducting layer. There should be no tears or gaps in the foil. Use your hands to mold the foil around the entire device. This will serve as the first of three layers of aluminum foil.The foil is referred to as a conductive layer. The metal allows radiation to travel along its surface, while the plastic insulating layers prevent it from traveling through to your device., You should cover every inch of the device in at least three layers of aluminum. Protection can be maximized by adding plastic layers in between each layer of aluminum foil. This will create alternating layers of conductive and nonconductive materials and shield your device from harmful electromagnetic radiation.A Faraday cage is designed to protect devices from an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) blast. This is a high intensity blast of radiation that comes from a weapon or a naturally powerful source (e.g. the sun).You can also use a Faraday cage to block a cell phone or radio from getting reception. In this case, you would need fewer layers since the radiation is much weaker than an EMP blast.
Adding adhesives like glue between each layer will make your faraday cage more sturdy and permanent, but it will be harder to remove.

Lead a study group.,
Sign up to be a tutor or teaching assistant in a class.",How to Learn Physics," Physics can be a difficult subject to master and outside distraction will make it even more difficult. Removing distractions and having a quiet place to learn will make it easier to focus.


Libraries are a great place to learn with quiet areas and access to resources.;
, Though you may have one official textbook, there are hundreds of books on physics. One book may offer a different take on the same topic that will make more sense to you.Go to the library and find information on the topic you’re struggling with in multiple books.
Read the different explanations to find the one that makes the most sense to you.

, If you don’t understand something, ask someone to help you out. Talk through concepts and problems with other students or professors. There is no shame in asking a question if something doesn’t make sense to you.


Ask questions early and often. The material builds upon itself so if you don’t have a firm understanding of the basics, you will easily get lost later on.
Get a tutor if you are really struggling to understand the material.

, There are many open courseware options available online that can assist in your studies. Interactive modules and problems are a great way to form a solid foundation of physics basics.


Look for content offered by universities.

, Blocking out time to study will help you stay on task and make progress every day. Once you get set in the routine, studying at that time will become automatic.


Find at least an hour in your schedule to study each day.
Let your friends and family know not to bother you during this time.

, There are a lot of formulas and although you may be able to look them up, solving problems is easier when you can write down the formulas without looking.


Use flashcards to help you memorize everything.

, The first step to solving a problem is writing down all of the knowns in the question. Sometimes there will be information in the problem that isn’t actually necessary to solve it.


Go through the problem and identify the variables that are relevant to solving the problem.
Determine what the question is asking. Many times, the problem doesn’t directly ask a question, but you have to figure out what the problem is asking given the information provided.

, Physics is a very visual subject and drawing diagrams is extremely helpful in determining how to solve a problem.


Force diagrams are very common in physics and help you determine magnitude and direction of a force. Diagrams are also essential for problems pertaining to electricity and magnetism.

, Many problems will require multiple equations to fully complete. After writing known information and determining what the problem is asking, you can figure out which equations are necessary.


If you haven’t fully memorized the equations yet, make a quick reference sheet of relevant formulas.

, The best way to master a new subject is to practice it. Start with simple problems and do as many as it takes until you truly understand that concept. Move your way up to more complicated problems as you master each topic.


Your textbook should have many practice problems with answers in the back.
Always check your work with an answer key to make sure you are solving problems correctly.
Do problems with friends. If you get stuck, you can work through it together.

, If you truly understand a topic, you should be able to easily explain it to someone in a way that allows them to also understand. In addition, teaching material will enhance your own learning and recall. Try teaching physics to your friends or parents.
If you find it difficult to explain, review that topic in more detail.

, Forming study groups can be helpful for many reasons. Oftentimes, you might understand something better than your colleague and be able to explain it to them, or vice versa. Forming study groups is a great way to learn, teach, and have fun with the material.


Set up a time that works well for everyone and stick to it.

, By registering as a tutor you will have repeated opportunities to teach physics to others. As you help other students learn, you will gain a greater understanding of the topics yourself.


Check your university learning center for open opportunities.

First and foremost: Ask yourself ""is physics for me?"",
There is practically only one reason to get a Ph.D. in physics: to be a physicist.",How to Get a Ph.D. in Physics1," Can you become so interested in something that you're willing to do it for the next 50 years? Are you doing it because you're interested or are you doing it for the ""glory""? People who go into physics because they want to be the next Feynman or Einstein are soon disappointed. You have a successful career in physics because you enjoy it and find it compelling.;
, It's a tough road, but very rewarding. You get to use your mind for a living, which is a rare privilege. You'll work with people from around the world. The time flies when you're really into a subject. And you get to grow old with other physicists - for the most part you'll find that they have wonderful senses of humor: quirky and creative.

Find a conductive container.,
Line the inside of the container with plastic wrap.,
Place your devices inside.",How to Make a Faraday Cage2," A stainless steel trash can with a tight closing lid will work very well. You can look for other metal containers or boxes. This will serve as a first line of defense against electromagnetic radiation., Once you have chosen a trash can or another container, line the inside with a layer of plastic wrap. This protects your devices from touching the conductive surfaces of the trash can, and it also provides protection against flooding.For added insulation, you can line the inside of the can with cardboard before the plastic layer goes in.You can add layers of foil and additional layers of plastic wrap inside to increase the effectiveness of the Faraday cage. More layers will make the cage more effective, even if the layers themselves are thin.

, Once you have lined your trash can, place your devices inside the can. The best practice is to cover each device individually in its own small Faraday cage (such as the simple aluminum foil Faraday cage). You can also purchase a Faraday bag and place the items in that bag. The trash can will serve as an extra layer of protection.Once the devices are inside, you can attach the lid with adhesives or bolt it on for a more sturdy cage. It is also wise to tie the cage down to a beam or bolt it to the wall using a metal strap to make your cage a permanent fixture.

Undergraduate curriculum: Of course, you should take the courses required to complete an undergraduate degree in physics.,
Undergraduate performance: Your application will be evaluated using four criteria: 1) grades, 2) GRE scores, 3) your institution (internationally recognized physics program is best), and 4) undergraduate research experience.,
Undergraduate experience: You should definitely obtain experience with a physics research program, by working with a faculty member or an undergraduate research program.,
To choose the research you do, go to your undergraduate adviser to determine which opportunities are available in your department.",How to Get a Ph.D. in Physics2," For the most part, the other courses you choose don't matter, though a minor or a double-major in math can't hurt. You can take courses in other areas that you find interesting, since it's mostly the GPA that matters when applying to graduate school. However, you should ensure that your coursework includes the highest-level quantum mechanics and electromagnetism courses. Also, statistical mechanics can be really useful.

, Different schools place different levels of priority on these items. For the most part, you can assume that each factor matters equally.

, This means an activity that usually doesn't give college credit. It plays three roles: 1) you get experience in a lab, so you get an idea of what you're getting into, 2) you establish a close relationship with a faculty member who can write you a strong recommendation, and 3) you have evidence that you can function in the field of physics. Fortunately, most of these jobs pay - you can work hard over the summer and work part-time over the year. It is never too early to get started.

, Always interview upper class students to help you avoid bad programs. A web search will also help you identify summer programs outside your college. The advantage of these external programs is that they typically are run by extremely reputable institutions, and one of your recommendations will come from outside your college faculty.

You don't need to worry about the general sections as much.,
Make sure you'll get the results in time for the grad school applications.

,
Choosing a grad school: It's tough to tell whether you'll enjoy a particular grad school.",How to Get a Ph.D. in Physics3," Get practice exams and preparation manuals. You can never be too ready. You may even want to take it a couple of times, just to increase your odds of getting a good score (ask whether it's to your advantage first).

, There is a wide range of topics. *Do not assume* that the questions will only be from the courses you've taken. In all likelihood, there will be questions from courses you haven't completed yet.

, Of course, the better score the better, but you'll probably already be good at the quantitative and analytical problems, and the verbal section doesn't matter as much. You should definitely take a look at the practice tests, though, to see where you might have trouble and know if you should prepare.

,, Talk to the faculty you're most familiar with, and see if they feel strongly about certain schools. That way, you'll be more likely to choose a school is compatible with your interests, and more importantly, the faculty member will be an ally in the process and will probably increase the odds of you being accepted.

Once you're accepted and have started grad school: Believe it or not, the grades you get in your graduate courses aren't nearly as important as your qualifying exams and research performance.,
Preparing for the qualifying exam: It's like an advanced physics GRE, and you can't prepare enough.",How to Get a Ph.D. in Physics4," The qualifying exam is a major hurdle, and determines whether you'll be able to start your Ph.D. research. The sooner you pass the exam, the better - you'll get your pick of thesis advisers if you pass quickly. Programs can vary, but usually the exam is 1/2-1 day long, covers all topics, and should be passed by the end of your primary coursework.

, Ask students who've survived the process how you can do the same.

Finding a thesis adviser: in most cases, you should try to get a thesis adviser as soon as possible.,
Oral exam: Take your oral exam when your thesis adviser says you're ready.,
Research activities: Read lots of journal papers in your field.,
Try to get a couple of refereed publications under your belt.",How to Get a Ph.D. in Physics5," Being a teaching assistant is great experience, but you've got to focus on graduating eventually. *You should choose a topic and adviser you'll enjoy!* This can't be stressed enough. If you choose an adviser or topic for any other reason, you may not enjoy the work, and your performance will suffer. Additionally, many students who choose an unnecessarily difficult course end up hating physics and leaving the field. Remember, you'll be doing this for decades.

, Usually, the oral exam is *much* easier than the written exam. The exam is to determine whether you're ready to start your thesis work. You'll be asked questions on your research topic, and you'll probably also be asked some general physics questions as well. Always try to answer a question. Perhaps you won't know how to solve the problem, so you should show that you have an understanding of the underlying physics. Most times a student doesn't answer all the questions completely or correctly. Some oral exam committees will even ramp up the difficulty of the questions until they're out of your league, just to see how you perform. Practice reasoning out loud and keep chipping away at a problem - this is always better than just saying you don't know.

, It's painful at first (you may not understand a word of it) but it gets much easier over time. You need to become conversant in your research field.

, It means a lot when you're trying to find a position after grad school. Also, try to present a couple papers at conferences. It'll get you more exposure and it's a great (but sometimes stressful) way to see how your research fits into the rest of the field.

Writing your thesis: Ouch, ouch, ouch.,
A *major* problem is that you'll probably get distracted by something you're writing about at the time.,
Start with the outline.,
Filling in the verbiage is usually the worst part.,
When you write, *only* write.",How to Get a Ph.D. in Physics6," Nearly every one hates this part. You probably like your thesis topic, but writing hundreds of pages about it can be really horrible. If you have some publications, definitely use them to fill chapters. Just add more general comments, but the description and figures save you labor and definitely should be included in your thesis anyhow.

, You'll be tempted to explore some topics further or you'll be reminded of something you meant to do earlier. And your mind will probably be trying to find *anything* else to think about.

, You fill in the verbiage last, usually. Figure out what you need to say, divide it into chapters, and work on the supporting figures next. You'll need plenty of figures and tables to support your conclusions. Additionally, reviewers on your committee may not read *every* word, but they usually look at all of the figures and read the captions to get the gist of what's going on.

, it often helps to say it out loud - explain the items as if you're giving a complete talk on the subject, and record it. Then you'll have everything covered and it makes sense - you just have to translate it to a more passive tense.

, Give yourself a time span where you allow yourself no option of doing anything else but writing. Sometimes it helps to write in the same office/coffee shop/etc. with another student working on their thesis, if you both can keep each other on task. You can take breaks together and take the heat off a bit.

Go faster than light.,
Dive through a wormhole.,
Travel forward and let the future figure it out.",How to Go Back in Time1," When you travel at speeds approaching the speed of light, time slows down for you relative to the outside world. If you could travel faster than the speed of light, the time dilation would technically allow you to reach your destination before you even have left, effectively traveling back in time. Unfortunately, the speed of light is the ultimate stop sign in the universe. By the rules of Einstein's Special Relativity, it takes an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a slower-than-light object to the speed of light—the faster you go, the more massive you become and the more energy it takes to accelerate your further. Traveling faster than light would require technology we don't have yet, and that is likely impossible.

Relativity does technically allow for faster-than-light particles called tachyons, but there is no evidence that tachyons exist, or that they could be used to transmit meaningful information (like you) if they did.;
, Wormholes are theoretical warps in the fabric of reality that connect two points of space-time by a shorter distance than they are separated by in the larger continuum. Wormholes could connect distant galaxies, separate universes, and even different times. Much like traveling faster than light, however, the practicalities of stable wormhole creation and travel likely make this option impossible.


Ideas in quantum physics suggest that our universe is full of wormholes—tiny ones smaller than atoms that form and collapse in the briefest instants at the level of reality's quantum foam. Harnessing and expanding one to a size humans could move through, however, might cause a feedback loop that collapses the wormhole before you could use it for time travel.

, If you really have to go back in time but haven't found a way to overcome the practical problems of faster-than-light travel or wormhole creation, you could travel forward in time to a far future out of reach of your natural lifetime. Perhaps in the future, people will have developed advanced technologies that make backward time travel possible, and you can convince them to send you back to your historical destination. Under the laws of physics, travel into the future is much more achievable than travel into the past.


Take a trip at speeds near the speed of light. Special relativity predicts that if you travel at near light speed, time will slow down for you relative to slower frames of reference. So if you spend a few years zooming away from the Earth and back, you will return to find that more years have passed on Earth than have passed for you.
Freeze yourself in suspended animation. Though the technology has hardly been perfected, it may be possible to freeze a human body and thaw it many years later unchanged and un-aged. If you could make yourself such a time capsule, you could last beyond your lifetime and awaken in an age far into the future.

Prepare the materials for the motor.,
Place the head of the screw on the magnet.,
Hold the AA battery’s positive end (the one with the divot extending out) just above the sharp point of the screw.,
Complete the circuit.",How to Make a Homopolar Motor1," You’ll need a neodymium magnet, a wood screw, a spool of thin-gauged (1.3 millimeter / 16 gauge) copper wire, wire cutters, needle-nose pliers, and a AA battery. Ensure you’re using wire which is uncoated, nonmagnetic, and somewhat pliable. Coated copper wire is generally made of multiple thin copper filaments woven into a rope-like wire. This type of wire is too weak to maintain a bendable shape, a quality which you’ll want it to have later.


The magnet should be a flattened cylinder with a diameter no larger than about one centimeter. Be careful not to let small children play with the magnet. Also, do not place it on or near electronics equipment, including tablets, phones, or MP3 players.;
, In other words, the point of the screw should be sticking straight up from the magnet, whose flat head is affixed to the magnet. The head of the screw should be perfectly centered on the magnet, with an equal amount of space along the entire perimeter between the edge of the magnet and the edge of the screw’s head.


If you want to adjust the position of the screw on the magnet, you should be able to slide it around. If you want to use another screw for some reason (or suddenly realize you need to hang up a picture with the screw), try pushing it off the magnet rather than trying to pull it straight out.

, Pinch the battery between your thumb and middle finger. Lower the battery onto the screw so that the point of the screw makes contact with the approximate center of the battery’s positive pole. The battery should now be above the screw, which should be above the battery, in a vertical line.

, With your free hand, bring one end of the copper wire up to the negative pole (the flat end) of the battery. Pinch the wire in place on top of the negative pole with your index finger. Bring the other end of the copper wire down to the battery and make contact with it. The nail and magnet assembly should spin.


You may hear a low hum or buzz when the circuit is complete.
If it does not spin, try reversing the polarity of the magnet by removing the screw, turning the magnet over, then reattaching the screw.

Defending the thesis: This is by far the easiest part.,
Enjoy, and have a great career.

",How to Get a Ph.D. in Physics7," Unless your adviser is *really* sadistic, you won't be asked to defend until you're almost sure to pass. You'll have to give a talk on the subject = stick only to the main points in your thesis. Remember to do this like a talk at a conference, not like an exam. Most of the questions won't involve quantitative derivations, especially when it's a topic of current interest in your field. Defending your thesis is the easiest of all these steps - it's more of a celebration of the completion of your thesis than a trial.

Reminisce to relive your past.,
Revisit places you left long ago.,
Call back your old contacts.,
Look at old pictures and examine mementos.,
Buy the perfume or cologne that you used to put on.,
Listen to songs you used to love.,
Play your childhood games.,
Write down the memories that you resurrect.",How to Go Back in Time2," You don't need a wormhole to take a walk down memory lane. Instead, travel to the past using your memories. Long-term memories can be hard to dig up at first, but with a little stimulus you will soon start remembering vivid details and recalling long-forgotten emotions from days gone by. You'll feel like you are traveling back in time, even if your body stays in the present.

, Your former neighborhood, your primary school, your old church, the site of your first job, places you took memorable vacations. Even if these places have changed a lot, you will still start to remember details about them—and your time there. Try to remember what each room was for, the people you saw in each house, the colors and details of the buildings.
, These can be college or high-school friends, or even earlier friends if you can get in touch with them. Go with them to visit your old haunts and talk about everything you had lived together before you separated. If you haven't seen this person in a long time, meet in the last place you saw each other.

, Photos can be a great way to rekindle your lost days. Take a deep look into your albums whenever you want to revisit your past life. Take out any memorable objects you kept from your past and examine them, hold them in your hand, try to think about where you got them and how you used them.

, Smells are very evocative for triggering memories. If you never applied a distinctive scent, try to find a scent that one of your loved ones once applied.

, Maybe you're a bit embarrassed about your childhood musical tastes, but if there are songs you haven't heard in many years, listening to them again can be a great way to feel like you are back in the past. Try finding them on YouTube.

, Don't worry if you don't remember the rules exactly. Find the games that made you the happiest as a child, and give them another shot. You'll be surprised at the memories that they can bring back.

, Once you get the time travel train going, keep the ball rolling by writing down every detail that comes to mind.

Place the neodymium magnet on the flat end of the battery.,
Bend your wire into a heart shape.,
Use the measurements of the battery/magnet assembly to adjust its shape.,
Make small adjustments to the heart-shaped wire you’ve crafted.,
Start the motor.",How to Make a Homopolar Motor2," A neodymium magnet is a rare-earth magnet made of neodymium and is extremely strong. Apply your magnet carefully to the bottom of the battery. Place the battery/magnet assembly on a flat surface.

, Measure the whole height of the battery/magnet assembly. Obtain a heart-shaped template from a coloring book or print one from your computer. Lay the template on a flat surface. Find the center of your copper wire and place it over the point from which the acute angle of your heart template radiates. From there, the wire should curve up and away from the central point before swooping back down towards the base of the battery.

, Ensure that the central point of the wire heart will sit on the positive pole and the bottom will close around the magnet. The two ends of the wire should close around the battery on either side, forming a closed loop. The wire should touch the sides of the battery without pinching it so tightly that movement of the wire around the battery is limited or impossible when it starts spinning.

, Fine-tuning the wire shape may require repeated sessions of placing it on the battery/magnet assembly, checking for symmetry and balance, and widening or tightening the loop formed by the two “arms” of the heart which meet around the base. Ensure the loop around the magnet does not come into contact with the table; if it does, it will cause friction which impedes the speed and efficacy of your homopolar motor.

, Once your wire shape is ready, you can set it on the positive pole of the battery. Watch the wire shape spin round & round. If you’re in a relationship, this homopolar motor design functions as an easy DIY romantic gift.

Begin by making a loop which fits around the magnet.,
Twist the wire up into a semi-corkscrew.,
Change the wire’s direction into a perfectly vertical line.,
Make a tiny dancer.Instead of a heart shape, bend the copper wire into the shape of a ballerina, arms outstretched.,
Angle the wire up in a ninety degree turn and pull the wire into a roughly circular shape about the size of a nickel.",How to Make a Homopolar Motor3," Just like the heart-shaped copper wire, this homopolar motor uses a simple AA battery sitting atop a neodymium magnet in a vertical position with its positive pole oriented above the negative pole. Loop some copper wire around the magnet. You need not make the whole loop touch the base; an ovular loop which touches the battery at just two points is as acceptable as a circular loop which grips the whole magnet.

, Once the loop around the base is complete, bend the wire up and away from the loop around the magnet. The corkscrew’s diameter should be just a few millimeters wider than that of the battery. Stop the corkscrew about halfway up the length of the battery.

, At a point about three millimeters above the highest point on the battery, press the wire inwards at a ninety degree angle toward the center of the positive pole. Once the wire is over the positive pole’s central divot, bend it down so that it touches the divot, then races back up and away from the divot in a hairpin turn.

, Begin by turning the wire, now pointing straight up, in a ninety degree bend about one and a half inches above the positive pole of the battery. Approximately one centimeter along this length, pull the wire into a hairpin turn, angling it back toward the ninety degree turn you just made.

, This will be the dancer’s head. Once on the other side of the dancer’s “neck,” bring the wire back down on the other side of the dancer, mirroring the bends you just made. You should end up with a “T” shape with a circle above the central junction. You cannot end where you began, though (touching the central divot on the positive pole of the battery), and so will need to clip the wire at a point about half a centimeter above the positive pole of the battery.


It may help to use a template or outline you’ve drawn or printed from the internet when shaping the wire into the ballerina form. You can print the ballerina outline or template, then lay the wire over it, bending along the outline to get the desired shape.

Two tanks are connected by a valve.",How to Solve a Basic Heat Transfer Problem in Thermodynamics1," One tank contains 2 kg of carbon monoxide gas at 77⁰ C and 0.7 bar. The other tank holds 8 kg of the same gas at 27⁰ C and 1.2 bar. The valve is opened and the gases are allowed to mix while receiving energy by heat transfer from the surroundings. The final equilibrium temperature is 42⁰ C. Using the ideal gas model, determine the final equilibrium pressure, in bar; the heat transfer for the process in kJ


Note It is easier to solve the problem by working with just variables, and then at the last step plug in the values. This same method will be followed here.;

Learn how current theories of physics should be modified.",How to Learn and Understand the Quantum Theory of Matter and Radiation," The quantum theory of matter and electromagnetic radiation was formulated in the beginning of the 19th century in response to conflicting results of experiments that were done in physics of atomic material. The theory of classical motion by Isaac Newton was the prevalent theory of classical bodies motion such as the motion of bodies under the influence of the gravitational field the earth. These laws of Newton were used to explain phenomena such as rocket propulsion and building of skyscrapers.
, These laws worked fine for systems on macroscopic scales. Certain experiments in physics that were done on the atomic scale could not be rationalized based on the laws of classical motion by Isaac Newton. An example is the explanation of the black body radiation. This is a theoretical model that is used to model and simulate the physics of remote stars such as the prediction of their temperature and their atomic content. The theoretical models of the black body radiation could not fit the experimental results appropriately using the laws of Newton., Suggestions to quantize the energy terms in these equations gave satisfactory results in accordance with the experimental values. This hypothesis of quantization of energy and other physical variables is the essence of the quantum theory of matter and radiation. This theory holds well for many problems in physics and theoretical chemistry such as the harmonic oscillator problem and the rigid body rotor. Also the application of the quantum theory to the hydrogen atom was very successful in predicting its chemical and physical properties., The main equation that is used in solving problems in quantum theory is the Schroedinger equation. This is a partial differential equation that was formulated based on the finding of wave-particle duality of matter by a French physicist who's name is Debroglie. The wave-particle duality was validated by experimental results using the photoelectric effect and Compton effect as well. The wave-particle nature of light was also confirmed by similar experiments of diffraction and interference of light. This theory has however some drawbacks and controversial concepts such as the concept of zero point energy., This concept assumes the existence of finite minimal energy of quantum systems that is not zero in its value. This fact contradicts the natural physical laws of the universe which are based on the postulate that all nonliving systems tend toward maximum thermodynamic stability and minimum states of energy content. This theory however is still credible until nowadays and it gives satisfactory theoretical predictions about physical phenomena commensurate with the experimental values., The application of this theory in other fields of physics was done for example on fields theory. The formulation quantized theories other than this theory was also successful to particle physics for example. The attempts to formulate quantum theory of gravity is still not achievable due to conflicts between the macroscopic nature of gravitational systems and the microscopic nature of quantum systems. This controversy could not be settled using our current quantum and gravitational theories based on Newton and quantum theories. The concept of dark matter is also an ambiguous and controversial concept of astrophysics. This concept is still not validated theoretically and experimentally., Also the recent discovery of the variable nature of the speed of light gives question marks about the validity of Einstein theories of relativity. Many theories in physics are based in its mathematical formulations on this theory such as the prediction of the existence of black holes. The theory of relativistic quantum theory therefore needs to be modified to account for the variable nature of the speed of light., Also relativistic quantum field theory needs to be modified to account for the same reason. In addition particle physics is dependent in its formulations on the theory of relativity such as string theory and the grand unified theory. Concepts of quantum theory therefore have to be applied to other systems very cautiously due to pitfalls that can occur with controversial concepts in theories of physics."

ct′=γ(ct−βx)x′=γ(x−βct){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}ct^{\prime }&=\gamma (ct-\beta x)\\x^{\prime }&=\gamma (x-\beta ct)\end{aligned}}}

Here, β=vc{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {v}{c}}} and γ=11−v2c2,{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}},} the Lorentz factor.
;
, Gamma can be written in many different ways, a few of which are listed below. It is important to be able to recognize the Lorentz factor no matter how it is written.


γ=dtdτ=11−β2{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }t}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}}


, Rapidity ξ{\displaystyle \xi } is a dimensionless quantity that is related to velocity β.{\displaystyle \beta .}

In special relativity, rapidity is a more natural quantity to work with because, unlike velocity, rapidity is linearly additive via tanh−1⁡β3=tanh−1⁡β1+tanh−1⁡β2,{\displaystyle \tanh ^{-1}\beta _{3}=\tanh ^{-1}\beta _{1}+\tanh ^{-1}\beta _{2},} where ξ=tanh−1⁡β.{\displaystyle \xi =\tanh ^{-1}\beta .}


, Graph the function ξ=tanh−1⁡β,{\displaystyle \xi =\tanh ^{-1}\beta ,} for it illustrates some important properties of rapidity. 

First, when |β|≪1,tanh−1⁡β≈β.{\displaystyle |\beta |\ll 1,\tanh ^{-1}\beta \approx \beta .} In other words, rapidity reduces to Newtonian velocity at everyday speeds. This confirms that our definition of rapidity is compatible with Newtonian mechanics.

Second, tanh−1⁡β{\displaystyle \tanh ^{-1}\beta } has a domain of (−1,1),{\displaystyle (-1,1),} but a range of (−∞,∞).{\displaystyle (-\infty ,\infty ).} As you approach the speed of light, rapidity starts to increase faster and faster until it becomes infinite at light speed. 


, Using hyperbolic trigonometric identities, one can rewrite γ{\displaystyle \gamma } and βγ{\displaystyle \beta \gamma } in terms of ξ.{\displaystyle \xi .} The latter quantity is often seen in special relativity. All three basic hyperbolic functions are listed below.


β=tanh⁡ξ{\displaystyle \beta =\tanh \xi }


γ=cosh⁡ξ{\displaystyle \gamma =\cosh \xi }


βγ=sinh⁡ξ{\displaystyle \beta \gamma =\sinh \xi }


, The relative ease of hyperbolic derivatives makes this parameterization attractive. 


ct′=ctcosh⁡ξ−xsinh⁡ξx′=xcosh⁡ξ−ctsinh⁡ξ{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}ct^{\prime }&=ct\cosh \xi -x\sinh \xi \\x^{\prime }&=x\cosh \xi -ct\sinh \xi \end{aligned}}}


, 4-vectors are objects that are useful in special relativity because they transform linearly under the Lorentz transformations. They are the Minkowski space analog of regular vectors in Euclidean space. 

There are two types of 4-vectors in special relativity: contravariant and covariant. Contravariant vectors are what we normally think of as vectors - they inversely change under a change in reference axes (a change in basis) to preserve their coordinate-independent properties, such as their magnitude. 4-position and 4-velocity are contravariant 4-vectors. In index notation, superscript indices indicate the presence of contravariance. 


Covariant vectors change the same way under a change in basis, and are denoted by subscript indices. An example of a covariant vector would be the gradient. We can also define the covariant form of a contravariant vector by applying the appropriate metric tensor to lower the index. In steps 4 and 7, we normalize the 4-vectors by doing exactly this.


, The metric is a tensor that is fundamental to special relativity. This metric will be used in this section to manipulate 4-vectors. In the below definition, μ{\displaystyle \mu } and ν{\displaystyle \nu } are indices running from 0 to 3. 


ημν=(10000−10000−10000−1).{\displaystyle \eta _{\mu \nu }={\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&0\\0&-1&0&0\\0&0&-1&0\\0&0&0&-1\\\end{pmatrix}}.}

This is the timelike Minkowski metric that yields a positive spacetime interval for timelike events (see step 4). Some authors define the spacelike metric, which negates the signs.

In 3-dimensional Euclidean space, the corresponding metric looks identical to the 3x3 identity matrix. When performing transformations in Euclidean space, you are in fact multiplying by this metric in the process.


, 4-position is a 4-vector that describes coordinates in both space and time, called events. 


Xμ=(ct,x,y,z){\displaystyle X^{\mu }=(ct,x,y,z)}


, When the 4-position is normalized, the resulting Lorentz scalar describes the spacetime interval, an invariant quantity - one that is unchanged under changes in reference frames. The spacetime interval is the Minkowski space analog of the magnitude of a vector in Euclidean space. 


XμXμ=XμXνημν(cτ)2=(ct)2−x2−y2−z2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}X^{\mu }X_{\mu }&=X^{\mu }X^{\nu }\eta _{\mu \nu }\\(c\tau )^{2}&=(ct)^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}\end{aligned}}}

As a consequence of our definition of the Minkowski metric, when (cτ)2>0,{\displaystyle (c\tau )^{2}>0,} the spacetime interval is said to be timelike. When (cτ)2<0,{\displaystyle (c\tau )^{2}<0,} it is said to be spacelike. Finally, when (cτ)2=0,{\displaystyle (c\tau )^{2}=0,} the interval is said to be light-like or null.  


, In Newtonian mechanics, velocity is easy to define as the time rate of change of position, since time is independent of reference frame. However, special relativity does not posit absolute time. The way we get around this is by taking the rate of change of 4-position with respect to proper time, because the spacetime interval as written in terms of proper time is invariant. Here, we will take the derivative with respect to cdτ{\displaystyle c{\mathrm {d} }\tau } to convert to dimensionless units, though 4-velocity is typically defined without the 1c{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{c}}} factor.


Vμ=dXμcdτ{\displaystyle V^{\mu }={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }X^{\mu }}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}}


, It is not immediately obvious how this should be rewritten, given that time is relative. 

Use the chain rule to rewrite the derivatives with respect to coordinate time t.{\displaystyle t.}


dXμcdτ=(cdtcdτ,dxcdτ,dycdτ,dzcdτ)=(dtdτ,dxdtdtcdτ,dydtdtcdτ,dzdtdtcdτ){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }X^{\mu }}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}&=\left(c{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }t}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }},{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }},{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }},{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}\right)\\&=\left({\frac {{\mathrm {d} }t}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }},{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }t}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }},{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }y}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }t}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }},{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }z}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }t}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}\right)\end{aligned}}}



Recall that β=vc{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {v}{c}}} and γ=dtdτ.{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }t}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}.}


dXμcdτ=(γ,βxγ,βyγ,βzγ)=(γ,βγ){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }X^{\mu }}{c{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}&=(\gamma ,\beta _{x}\gamma ,\beta _{y}\gamma ,\beta _{z}\gamma )\\&=(\gamma ,\beta \gamma )\end{aligned}}}



In the last step, we compressed the spatial components of the 4-vector. Notice again that our definition outputs a dimensionless 4-velocity. This convenience will be seen in the derivation.


,


VμVμ=VμVνημν=γ2−(βγ)2=γ2(1−β2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}V^{\mu }V_{\mu }&=V^{\mu }V^{\nu }\eta _{\mu \nu }\\&=\gamma ^{2}-(\beta \gamma )^{2}\\&=\gamma ^{2}(1-\beta ^{2})\end{aligned}}}

Recall that γ2=11−β2.{\displaystyle \gamma ^{2}={\frac {1}{1-\beta ^{2}}}.} This is excellent, as we recognize that 4-velocity is automatically normalized.


VμVνημν=1{\displaystyle V^{\mu }V^{\nu }\eta _{\mu \nu }=1}



If we defined 4-velocity in units of velocity, the Lorentz scalar would be c2.{\displaystyle c^{2}.} We are now ready to begin the derivation. 


, For simplicity, we will work in 1+1 dimensions.


Vμ=(γβγ)=(cosh⁡ξsinh⁡ξ){\displaystyle V^{\mu }=\left({\begin{matrix}\gamma \\\beta \gamma \end{matrix}}\right)=\left({\begin{matrix}\cosh \xi \\\sinh \xi \end{matrix}}\right)}

It is easy to see here why 4-velocity is automatically normalized, since cosh2⁡ξ−sinh2⁡ξ=1.{\displaystyle \cosh ^{2}\xi -\sinh ^{2}\xi =1.}


, Note the use of the chain rule.


dVμdτ=(sinh⁡ξdξdτcosh⁡ξdξdτ)=(sinh⁡ξcosh⁡ξ)dξdτ{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }V^{\mu }}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=\left({\begin{matrix}\sinh \xi {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\xi }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}\\\cosh \xi {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\xi }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}\end{matrix}}\right)=\left({\begin{matrix}\sinh \xi \\\cosh \xi \end{matrix}}\right){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\xi }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}}


, The comoving frame is inertial for a moment of time with respect to the object. All we need to do is to apply a Lorentz transformation to boost to that frame. 


(cosh⁡ξ−sinh⁡ξ−sinh⁡ξcosh⁡ξ)(sinh⁡ξcosh⁡ξ)dξdτ=(01)dξdτ{\displaystyle \left({\begin{matrix}\cosh \xi &-\sinh \xi \\-\sinh \xi &\cosh \xi \end{matrix}}\right)\left({\begin{matrix}\sinh \xi \\\cosh \xi \end{matrix}}\right){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\xi }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=\left({\begin{matrix}0\\1\end{matrix}}\right){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\xi }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}}

This confirms that proper acceleration is simply the rate of change of rapidity with respect to proper time. Boosting to comoving frames is how we deal with acceleration in special relativity. 

You can check that this process works by applying the Lorentz transformation to the 4-velocity. The resulting quantity (10){\displaystyle \left({\begin{matrix}1\\0\end{matrix}}\right)} simply describes that object's 4-velocity within the comoving frame - it is moving in time, but not in space, as we would expect.


,

If dξdτ{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\xi }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}} is constant, than it can be dimensionally written as dξdτ=1τ0.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\xi }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}={\frac {1}{\tau _{0}}}.}

Then, separating variables and integrating gives ξ=ττ0,{\displaystyle \xi ={\frac {\tau }{\tau _{0}}},} so the 4-velocity becomes (coshττ0sinhττ0).{\displaystyle \left({\begin{matrix}\cosh {\frac {\tau }{\tau _{0}}}\\\sinh {\frac {\tau }{\tau _{0}}}\end{matrix}}\right).}


, Integrating generates constants which can be disregarded. Remember that since we defined 4-velocity with an extra c{\displaystyle c} factor, we must add that as we integrate.


(ctx)=(cτ0sinhττ0cτ0coshττ0){\displaystyle \left({\begin{matrix}ct\\x\end{matrix}}\right)=\left({\begin{matrix}c\tau _{0}\sinh {\frac {\tau }{\tau _{0}}}\\c\tau _{0}\cosh {\frac {\tau }{\tau _{0}}}\end{matrix}}\right)}


, The solution to constant acceleration is hyperbolic motion, as recognized by the hyperbolic functions, analogous to parabolic motion in Newtonian mechanics.


ct=cτ0sinhττ0x=cτ0coshττ0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}ct&=c\tau _{0}\sinh {\frac {\tau }{\tau _{0}}}\\x&=c\tau _{0}\cosh {\frac {\tau }{\tau _{0}}}\end{aligned}}}

If τ≥0,{\displaystyle \tau \geq 0,} then the equations describe a hyperbola in the first quadrant on the spacetime diagram. In the coordinate axes, the hyperbola starts at the point (0,cτ0),{\displaystyle (0,c\tau _{0}),} shown as a green dot. When the diagram is scaled to ct{\displaystyle ct} such that the time axis has units of distance, light rays are graphed as red dotted lines with a slope of 1. The light beam emitted at t=0{\displaystyle t=0} is shown as a red dot and generates a light cone.

Because the hyperbola has those lines as asymptotes, the light ray and the object’s trajectory will never intersect each other. Furthermore, in the coordinate frame, any light that is emitted after the light beam emitted at t=0{\displaystyle t=0} will never reach the object either. 

Therefore, the object cannot be affected by those light rays in any way, creating an apparent event horizon. The object, in a limited sense, is able to ""outrun"" light, as long as it keeps accelerating.

The concept really is that simple, although your math textbook might describe it as the ""change in velocity over time.""Acceleration also describes the direction something is moving, which you can include as a written description or as part of the math:


Usually, if an object is accelerating right, up, or forward, people write it as a positive (+) number.
If an object accelerates left, down, or backward, use a negative (-) number for acceleration instead.;
, As mentioned above, acceleration is the change in velocity over the change in time. There are two ways to write this as a math formula:



aav = Δv/Δt (The symbol Δ or ""delta"" just means ""change."")

aav = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti) In this equation, vf is the final velocity, and vi is the initial, or starting, velocity

, For example, if a car goes from parked on the sidewalk to moving at a velocity of 500 meters/second to the right, the initial velocity is 0 m/s, and the final velocity is 500 m/s right.


From now on, we'll use positive numbers to describe motion to the right, so we don't have to specify the direction every time.
If the car starts out going forward and ends up going backward, make sure to write the final velocity as a negative number.

, For instance, the car might take 10 seconds to reach the final velocity. Unless the problem says otherwise, this usually means tf = 10 seconds and ti = 0 seconds.


Make sure your velocities and times are written in consistent units. For instance, if your velocity is written in miles per hour, the time should be written in hours as well.

, Put the velocities and time into the formula to find the average acceleration. In our example:


aav = (500 m/s - 0 m/s)/(10s - 0s)
aav = (500 m/s)/(10 s)

aav = 50 m / s / s This can also be written as 50 m/s2.

, The average acceleration describes how rapidly the velocity changed during the time we're examining, on average. In the example above, the car was speeding up to the right, and each second it sped up by an average of 50 m/s. Note that the details of the exact movement can change, as long as the car ends up with the same total change in velocity and change in time:


The car could start at 0 m/s and accelerates at a constant rate for 10 seconds, until it reaches 500 m/s.
The car could start at 0 m/s, accelerate rapidly to 900 m/s, then slow down to 500 m/s by the 10th second.
The car could start at 0 m/s, stay still for 9 seconds, then jump to 500 m/s very rapidly in the 10th second.

, Although velocity always specifies a direction, it can be tedious to keep writing ""up"" or ""north"" or ""toward the wall."" Instead, most math problems will assume the object is moving along a straight line. Moving in one direction on this line gets described as a positive (+) velocity, and movement in the other direction is negative (-) velocity.


For example, a blue train is moving east at 500 m/s. A red train is moving west equally fast, but since it is in the opposite direction, it is traveling at -500 m/s instead.

, Acceleration is the change in velocity over time. If you're confused about whether to write acceleration as positive or negative, check the change in velocity and see what comes out:


vfinal - vinitial = + or - ?

, Let's say a blue train and a red train move away from each other with a speed of 5 m/s. We can picture these on a number line, with the blue train moving at +5 m/s along the positive side of the number line, and the red train moving at -5 m/s along the negative side. If each train starts to accelerate until it reaches 2 m/s faster in the direction it is moving, does each train have positive or negative acceleration? Let's check:


The blue train is moving faster along the positive side, so it's increasing from +5 m/s to +7 m/s. The final velocity minus the initial velocity is 7 - 5 = +2. Since the change in velocity is positive, so is the acceleration.
The red train is moving faster along the negative side, so it starts out -5 m/s but ends up going -7 m/s. The final velocity minus the initial velocity is -7 - (-5) = -7 + 5 = -2 m/s. Since the change in velocity is negative, so is the acceleration.

, Let's say a plane starts out traveling at 500 miles per hour, but then slows down to 400 miles per hour. Although it's still moving in a positive or forward direction, the plane's acceleration was negative, because it's moving less quickly forward than before. You can check this the same way as the examples above: 400 - 500 = -100, so the acceleration is negative.


Meanwhile, if a helicopter is moving -100 miles per hour and accelerates to -50 miles per hour, it has experienced positive acceleration. This is because the change in velocity was in the positive direction: -50 - (-100) = +50, even though the change was not enough to reverse the helicopter's direction.

This is simply a fancy way of saying that these forces are usually represented as the same number regardless of where or how they're used. It's a smart idea to memorize the most common constants (and their units) — often, they won't be provided on tests. Below are a few of the most frequently-used constants in physics:


Gravity (on earth): 9.81 meters/second2

Speed of light: 3 × 108 meters/second
Molar gas constant: 8.32 Joules/(mole × Kelvin)
Avogadro's number: 6.02 × 1023 per mole
Planck's Constant: 6.63 × 10-34 Joules × seconds;
, In physics, the relationships between the many, many different forces acting in the universe are described with equations. Some of these equations are very simple, while some are enormously complex. Having the simplest equations memorized and knowing how to use them is critical when tackling both simple and complex problems. Even difficult and confusing problems are often solved by using several simple equations or modifying these simple equations so that they fit new situations. These basic equations are the easiest part of physics to learn, and if you know them well, the odds are that you will at least know some part of every complex problem you face. Just a few of the most important equations are:Velocity = Change in position/Change in time (dx/dt)
Acceleration = Change in velocity/Change in time
Current velocity = Initial velocity + (Acceleration × time)
Force = Mass × acceleration
Kinetic energy = (1/2)Mass × velocity2

Work = Displacement × force
Power = Change in work/Change in time
Momentum = Mass × velocity

, Having your simple equations memorized is one thing — understanding why these equations work is another entirely. If you can, take time to learn how each basic physics equation is derived. This gives you a much clearer understanding of the relationship between the equations and makes you a more versatile problems-solver. Since you essentially understand how the equation ""works"", you'll be able to use it much more effectively than if it's simply a rote, memorized string of characters in your mind.


For example, let's look at a very simple equation: Acceleration = Change in velocity/Change in time, or a = Delta(v)/Delta(t). Acceleration is the force that causes an object's velocity to change. If an object has an initial velocity of v0 at time t0 and a final velocity of v at time t, the object can be said to accelerate as it changes from v0 to v. Acceleration can't be instantaneous — no matter how fast it occurs, there will be some time difference between when the object is traveling at its initial velocity and when it reaches its final velocity. Thus, a = (v - v0/t - t0) = Delta(v)/Delta(t).

, Math is often said to be ""the language of physics."" Becoming an expert in the fundamentals of math is a great way to improve your ability to master physics problems. Some complex physics equations even require specialized mathematical skills (like taking derivatives and integrals) to be solved. Below are just a few math topics that can help you perform physics problems, in order of complexity:


Pre-algebra and algebra (for basic equations and ""find the unknown"" problems)
Trigonometry (for force diagrams, rotation problems, and angled systems)
Geometry (for problems dealing with area, volume, etc.)
Precalculus and calculus (for taking derivatives and integrals of physics equations — usually advanced topics)

, Physics problems often contain ""red herrings"" — information that isn't needed to solve the problem. When reading a physics problem, identify the pieces of information that you are given, then determine what you are trying to solve for. Write the equation(s) you'll need to solve the problem, then assign each piece of information in the problem to the appropriate variables. Ignore information that isn't needed, as this can slow you down and make the correct path for solving the problem more difficult to find.


For example, let's say that we need to find the acceleration that a car experiences as its velocity changes over two seconds. If the car weighs 1,000 kilograms, starts moving at 9 m/s and ends at 22 m/s, we can say that v0 = 9 m/s, v = 22 m/s, m = 1,000 t = 2 s. As noted above, the standard acceleration equation is a = (v - v0/t - t0). Note that this doesn't take the object's mass into account, so we can ignore the fact that the car weighs 1,000 kg.
Thus, we would solve as follows: a = (v - v0/t - t0) = ((22 - 9)/(2 - 0)) = (13/2) = 6.5 m/s2


, Forgetting to label your answer or using the incorrect units is a sure-fire way to miss easy points. To make sure you get full credit for whatever problem you're doing, be sure to label your answer with its correct units based on the type of information being expressed. Some of the most commonly-used units for common measurements in physics are listed below — note that, as a general rule, physics problems almost always use metric/SI measurements:


Mass: Grams or kilograms
Force: Newtons
Velocity: meters/second (sometimes kilometers/hour)
Acceleration meters/second2

Energy/Work: Joules or kilojoules
Power: Watts

, Physics problems are usually models of real-world situations — that is, they simplify the actual way that things work to make the situation easier to understand. Sometimes, this means that forces that can change the outcome of a problem (like, for instance, friction) are deliberately left out of the problem. However, this is not always the case. If these minor details aren't explicitly left out of the problem and you have enough information to account for them in your answer, be sure to include them for the most accurate answer.


For example, let's say that a problem asks you to find the rate that a 5 kilogram wooden block accelerates along a smooth floor if pushed with a force of 50 newtons. Since F = m × a, the answer may seem to be as simple as solving for a in the equation 50 = 5 × a. However, in the real world, the force of friction will act against the forward motion of the object, effectively reducing the force it's being pushed with. Leaving this out of the problem will result in an answer that has the block accelerating slightly faster than it actually would.

, An average-difficulty physics problem can easily involve a dozen or so mathematical calculations. An error in any of these can cause your answer to be off, so pay close attention to your math as you work and, if you have time, double-check your answer at the end to make sure your math ""adds up.""


While simply re-doing your work is one way to check your math, you may also want to use common sense to relate your problem to real life as a way of checking your answer. For example, if you're trying to find the momentum (mass × velocity) of an object moving in the forward direction, you wouldn't expect a negative answer, since mass can't be negative and velocity is only negative if it's in the ""negative"" direction (i.e., opposite the ""forward"" direction in your frame of reference). Thus, if you get a negative, answer, you've probably made an error in your calculations somewhere along the line.

, Ideally, you shouldn't come across new physics concepts for the very first time in class. Instead, try, reading upcoming lessons in your textbook the day before they'll be covered in class. Don't fixate on the precise mathematics of the topic — at this stage, focus on grasping the general concepts and trying to grasp what is being discussed. This will give you a solid foundation of knowledge upon which you'll be able to apply the mathematical skills you'll learn in class.

, During class, the teacher will explain the concepts you encountered in your pre-reading and clarify any areas of the material that you don't understand well. Take notes and ask plenty of questions. Your teacher will probably go through the mathematics of the topic. When he or she does so, try to have a general idea of ""what's happening"" even if you don't remember the exact derivations of each equation — having this sort of ""feel"" for the material is a huge asset.


If you have lingering questions after class, talk to your teacher. Try to make your questions as specific as possible — this shows the teacher that you were listening. If the teacher isn't busy, she or he will probably be able to schedule an appointment to go over the material with you and help you understand it.

, To finish off the task of studying and polish your physics knowledge, take a few moments to go over your notes as soon as you have a chance at home. Doing this will help you retain the knowledge you've gained from the day's class. The longer you wait after you take your notes to review them, the more difficult to remember they will be and the more ""foreign"" the concepts will seem, so be proactive and cement your knowledge by reviewing your notes at home.

, Just like math, writing, or programming, solving physics problems is a mental skill. The more you use this skill, the easier it will become. If you're struggling with physics, be sure to get plenty of practice solving problems. This will not only prepare you for exams but will help make many concepts clearer as you make your way through the material.


If you're not happy with your grade in physics, don't be content to simply use the problems assigned in your homework for practice. Make the extra effort to complete problems you wouldn't normally encounter — these can be problems in your textbook that aren't assigned to you, free problems online, or even problems in physics practice books (usually sold at academic bookstores).

, You don't have to try to endure a difficult physics course by yourself — depending on your schooling situation, there may be literally dozens of ways to get help. Seek out and use any help resources you need to get a better understanding of your physics material. Though some help resources can cost money, most students have at least a few free options available to them. Below are just a few ideas of who and what to seek out if you need physics help:


Your teacher (via after-school appointment)
Your friends (via study groups and homework sessions)
Tutors (either privately-hired or as part of a school program)
Third-party resources (like physics problem books, educational sites like Khan Academy, and so on)

Read books that will help.,

Reconcile.,

Do problems, using symbols and not numbers.",How to Develop Conceptual Thoughts for Understanding Physics," There is a range of books that will break down the complex subjects into digestible examples that help you to really grasp the concepts. You'll still need to think hard but you'll have fun in the process. Great examples include: Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick & Walker - the latest editions, University Physics or any native authors your school/college may recommend.


Be sure not to buy books of inferior quality, as these will just put you off learning. If you're not sure, ask your teachers about which books to buy.;
, Physics becomes tougher or easier depending upon how much you think. There will inevitably be instances during your reading when you will get stuck and you must ask yourself at that moment - why would this happen? How can this happen? Push yourself through the questions to come up with answers.


For example, the book could say ""Since the forces on the particle in Y direction add up to zero, it has zero acceleration in Y direction"" . Easy one, you think and say to yourself, ""that's like obvious"", you have a feeling for it.
It may say this: ""If a body is kept on top of another, the latter feels weight of the former"". Here you must stop and see if it is so, and you will find out that the statement is incorrect in its terms, and on top of that, it is not fundamentally true. Sadly, you will find such statements written in poorly written or badly explained books.
The book then may say, ""In a freely falling lift, a body's apparent weight becomes zero"". You should think to yourself about the statement. It's true, but very easily misinterpreted.

, There may come times when your reasoning gives you different answers; in such a case, go to the fundamental law to find out what is actually the reason why what the book says happens, happens.


For instance, see the last example in step 2. Weight of a body near a planet, W = G M m / r^2, where G is universal constant, M and m are masses of planet and object and r is the distance between the center of masses of the two, the actual definition. Now think to yourself whether a being in a freely falling lift would replace the planet beneath you? With some brain churning, you will say that step 2's last example is wrong, ""that ain't gonna happen!"". Well done friend, good job.

, Now if you knew that step 2 last example was written by some reputable author, you may think over your statement again. Well, you should but do not discard the great result you have obtained by using your brain, which is 100% correct, and try to reconcile your answer with what book says... for this, look at the word 'apparent'. It suggests that weight appears to be zero and not that weight itself is zero. This is because many people think that when we stand on a bathroom scale and it gives us a reading, that that's our weight. (Actually, it's our mass - the bathroom scale gives us mass by calculating weight). Scale measures weight by measuring the force we exert on it when we stand on it. In a freely falling lift, the force we exert on it is zero. Hence, the weighing machine you are standing on in a freely falling lift, will say that your weight is zero! So th apparent weight is zero and thereby you have reconciled your answer with what the book said.

, If you follow this approach, many times you will find great results and huge insights which will set you on a totally different level of understanding. In each case, you must record what you have just derived by your own reasoning in a notebook. Do this every time you derive something by this method. Humans forget at a tremendous rate, so recording is important.

, Doing problems will strengthen your concepts and after having done a problem, analyze your problem's answer for various parameters being changed. That will develop your concepts even further, plus it will tell you whether your answers are correct or not.


For example: You could check what would be acceleration of a block on a frictionless wedge when its angle goes to pie/2 radians, you should get g, 9.8 m/s^2 downwards.

, When a ket acts on a bra, the result is an operator. 


|↑n⟩⟨↑n|=(cos⁡θ2eiϕsin⁡θ2)(cos⁡θ2e−iϕsin⁡θ2)=(cos2⁡θ2e−iϕcos⁡θ2sin⁡θ2eiϕcos⁡θ2sin⁡θ2sin2⁡θ2){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|\uparrow _{\mathbf {n} }\rangle \langle \,\uparrow _{\mathbf {n} }\!|&={\begin{pmatrix}\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}\\e^{i\phi }\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}&e^{-i\phi }\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}\end{pmatrix}}\\&={\begin{pmatrix}\cos ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}&e^{-i\phi }\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}\\e^{i\phi }\cos {\frac {\theta }{2}}\sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}&\sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}\end{pmatrix}}\end{aligned}}}

This is a Hermitian operator, and it must, as we are working with an orthonormal basis and real eigenvalues.


, We see that cos2⁡θ2=12(1+cos⁡θ),{\displaystyle \cos ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}={\frac {1}{2}}(1+\cos \theta ),} and sin2⁡θ2=12(1−cos⁡θ).{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}={\frac {1}{2}}(1-\cos \theta ).} Therefore, part of the operator can be written as below.


12I+12cos⁡θσz{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}I+{\frac {1}{2}}\cos \theta \sigma _{z}}


, On the off-diagonal, we see that the signs of the complex exponential directly correspond to σy.{\displaystyle \sigma _{y}.} Using Euler's formula and the double angle trig identity, we can expand out the exponential and write out the σx{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}} and σy{\displaystyle \sigma _{y}} terms as such. 


12sin⁡θcos⁡ϕσx+12sin⁡θsin⁡ϕσy{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\sin \theta \cos \phi \sigma _{x}+{\frac {1}{2}}\sin \theta \sin \phi \sigma _{y}} 

Putting it all together, the projection operator can be written algebraically below.


Pn=12(I+sin⁡θcos⁡ϕσx+sin⁡θsin⁡ϕσy+cos⁡θσz){\displaystyle P_{\mathbf {n} }={\frac {1}{2}}(I+\sin \theta \cos \phi \sigma _{x}+\sin \theta \sin \phi \sigma _{y}+\cos \theta \sigma _{z})}




, We see that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices above are simply the magnitudes of the unit vector n{\displaystyle {\mathbf {n} }} written out in spherical coordinates, so we can use the dot product as a shorthand notation. It is easy to verify that there is a sign change for projections of the down-state.


Pn=12(I+n⋅σ){\displaystyle P_{\mathbf {n} }={\frac {1}{2}}(I+{\mathbf {n} }\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }})}


P−n=12(I−n⋅σ){\displaystyle P_{-{\mathbf {n} }}={\frac {1}{2}}(I-{\mathbf {n} }\cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }})}

Begin with the definition and properties of the time-evolution operator.,
Consider an infinitesimal change in time U^(t+dt){\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t+{\mathrm {d} }t)}.,
Use the definition of the derivative.,
Consider the case where H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} is time-independent.,
Use the Taylor series to evaluate U^(t)|E⟩{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)|E\rangle }.",How to Derive the Schrödinger Equation," 

This operator U^(t){\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)} translates a quantum state |ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } forward in time. 


U^(t)|ψ(0)⟩=|ψ(t)⟩{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)|\psi (0)\rangle =|\psi (t)\rangle }



It is defined by the generator of time-translations H^,{\displaystyle {\hat {H}},} the Hamiltonian, which moves the time-evolution operator away from the identity operator.


U^(dt)=1−iℏH^dt{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}({\mathrm {d} }t)=1-{\frac {i}{\hbar }}{\hat {H}}{\mathrm {d} }t}



Dimensional analysis suggests that H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} should have dimensions of Planck's constant divided by time, or energy. Hence the Hamiltonian is known as the energy operator.

If we assume that the state |ψ(0)⟩{\displaystyle |\psi (0)\rangle } is normalized, then the state at any other time must satisfy the normalization condition as well. Therefore, U^{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}} and H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} must both be unitary operators. Because these operators are unitary, they are also Hermitian operators.


⟨ψ(0)|U^†U^|ψ(0)⟩=⟨ψ(t)|ψ(t)⟩=1{\displaystyle \langle \psi (0)|{\hat {U}}^{\dagger }{\hat {U}}|\psi (0)\rangle =\langle \psi (t)|\psi (t)\rangle =1}


;
, 

We recognize that the translation of a state forward in time by t{\displaystyle t} and then by dt{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }t} can be written as U^(dt)U^(t).{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}({\mathrm {d} }t){\hat {U}}(t).} Then we simply substitute.


U^(t+dt)=U^(dt)U^(t)=(1−iℏH^dt)U^(t){\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t+{\mathrm {d} }t)={\hat {U}}({\mathrm {d} }t){\hat {U}}(t)=\left(1-{\frac {i}{\hbar }}{\hat {H}}{\mathrm {d} }t\right){\hat {U}}(t)}


U^(t+dt)−U^(t)=(−iℏH^dt)U^(t){\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t+{\mathrm {d} }t)-{\hat {U}}(t)=\left(-{\frac {i}{\hbar }}{\hat {H}}{\mathrm {d} }t\right){\hat {U}}(t)}




, 

The derivative of an operator is defined in the same manner as the derivative of a function.


dU^dt=limΔt→0U^(t+Δt)−U^(t)Δt{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }{\hat {U}}}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=\lim _{\Delta t\to 0}{\frac {{\hat {U}}(t+\Delta t)-{\hat {U}}(t)}{\Delta t}}}



Rearranging terms, we see that the time-evolution operator must satisfy the following equation.


iℏdU^dt=H^U^{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }{\hat {U}}}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}={\hat {H}}{\hat {U}}}



Strictly speaking, this is an operator equation. If we allow it to act on the initial state |ψ(0)⟩,{\displaystyle |\psi (0)\rangle ,} then we obtain the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Solutions to this equation can rarely be written in closed form. In practice, this equation is dealt with by substituting the appropriate Hamiltonian into the equation and then numerically evaluating.


iℏddt|ψ(t)⟩=H^|ψ(t)⟩{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}|\psi (t)\rangle ={\hat {H}}|\psi (t)\rangle }




,

If H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} is time-independent, then we may obtain an expression for U^{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}} by making an infinite number of infinitesimal time translations. This can be written in a convenient manner that takes advantage of the matrix exponential. As n{\displaystyle n} grows larger, the number of translations grows, but the translations become smaller. 


U^(t)=limn→∞n=e−iH^t/ℏ{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)=\lim _{n\to \infty }\left^{n}=e^{-i{\hat {H}}t/\hbar }}



When H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} is time-independent, we deal with the time-independent Schrödinger equation, an eigenvalue equation. We find the energy eigenstates and their corresponding energies. We label the energy eigenstate as |E⟩.{\displaystyle |E\rangle .} These eigenstates play an important role in quantum mechanics. 


H^|E⟩=E|E⟩{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}|E\rangle =E|E\rangle }




, 

It is easy to see how the time-evolution operator acts on an eigenstate of H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} if we use the Taylor expansion. If H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} repeatedly acts on an eigenstate, then we see that H^n|E⟩=En|E⟩.{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}^{n}|E\rangle =E^{n}|E\rangle .} Therefore, when H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} acts on its eigenstate, H^{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}} can be replaced by the eigenvalue E{\displaystyle E} describing the energy of |E⟩.{\displaystyle |E\rangle .}


e−iH^t/ℏ|E⟩=|E⟩=|E⟩{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}e^{-i{\hat {H}}t/\hbar }|E\rangle &=\left|E\rangle \\&=\left|E\rangle \end{aligned}}}


e−iH^t/ℏ|E⟩=e−iEt/ℏ|E⟩{\displaystyle e^{-i{\hat {H}}t/\hbar }|E\rangle =e^{-iEt/\hbar }|E\rangle }



The state merely gains an overall phase, which does not affect any of its observables, hence the notion of time-independence. Such states are often referred to as stationary states.

Design an experiment.,
Find support.,
Keep precise records.,
Evaluate the results.,

Draw a conclusion.,
Share your results.,
Understand the peer-review process.,
Build upon your theory.",How to Develop a Theory," Look for patterns between seemingly unrelated things. Explore the root causes behind everyday events, and try to predict what will happen next. If you already have the seed of a theory in your head, observe the subjects of that idea and try to gather as much information as possible. Write down the ""hows,"" the ""whys,"" and the links between things as you piece them together.If you don't have a theory or a hypothesis in mind, you can begin by making connections. If you walk through the world with a curious eye, you may be suddenly struck by an idea.;
, In general, a scientific law is the description of an observed phenomenon. It doesn't explain why the phenomenon exists or what causes it. The explanation of the phenomenon is called a scientific theory. It is a common misconception that theories turn into laws with enough research.For instance: Newton's Law of Gravity was the first to mathematically describe how two different bodies in the universe interact with each other. However, Newton’s law doesn’t explain why there is gravity, or how gravity works. It wasn’t until three centuries after Newton, when Albert Einstein developed his Theory of Relativity, that scientists began to understand how and why gravity works.

, Learn what has already been tested, proven, and refuted. Find out everything that you can about your subject, and determine whether anyone has asked the same questions before. Learn from the past so that you don't make the same mistakes.Use existing knowledge to better understand your subject. This includes equations, observations, and existing theories. If you are addressing a new phenomenon, try to build upon related theories that have already been proven.
Find out whether anyone has already developed your theory. Before you go any further, try to make reasonably sure that no one else has already explored this topic. If you can't find anything, feel free to develop your theory. If someone has already made a similar theory, read through their work and see if you can build on it.

, A hypothesis is an educated guess or proposition that aims to explain a set of facts or natural phenomena. Propose a possible reality that follows logically from your observations – look for patterns, and think about what might cause those things to happen. Use an ""if, then"" form: ""If is true, then is true,"" or ""If is true, then is untrue."" Formal hypotheses contain an ""independent"" and a ""dependent"" variable. The independent variable is a potential cause that you can tweak and control, while the dependent variable is a phenomenon that you observe or measure.


If you are going to use the scientific method to develop your theory, then your hypothesis must be measurable. You cannot prove a theory without numbers to back it up.
Try to come up with several hypotheses that might explain your observations. Compare these hypotheses. Consider where they overlap and where they split.
Example hypotheses: ""If skin cancer is related to ultraviolet light, then people with a high exposure to UV light will have a higher frequency of skin cancer."" or ""If leaf color change is related to temperature, then exposing plants to low temperatures will result in changes in leaf color."", Be careful not to confuse the two. A theory is a well-tested explanation for why a pattern exists, while a hypothesis is only a predicted reason for this pattern. A theory is always backed by evidence. A hypothesis, however, is only a suggested possible outcome, and it may or may not hold true., According to the scientific method, your theory must be testable.Develop a way to test whether each hypothesis holds true. Be sure to perform your test in a controlled environment: try to isolate the event and your proposed cause (the dependent and independent variable) from anything that might complicate the results. Be precise, and look out for external factors.


Make sure that your experiments are repeatable. In most cases, it is not enough to simply prove a hypothesis once. Your peers should be able to recreate your experiment themselves and get the same results.
Have peers or advisers review your testing procedure. Ask someone to look over your work and confirm that your logic is sound. If you are working with partners, make sure that everyone gives their input.

, Depending on your field of study, it may be hard to run complex experiments without access to certain equipment and resources. Scientific gear can be expensive and tricky to procure. If you are enrolled in a university, speak with any professors and researchers who might be able to help.


If you aren't in school, consider reaching out to professors or graduate students at a local university. For instance, contact the physics department if you want to explore a theory of physics. If you find a far-away university that is doing a lot of exciting research in your field, consider emailing them despite the distance.

, Again, experiments must be reproducible: other people must be able to set up a test in the same way that you did and get the same result. Keep accurate records of everything you do in your test. Be sure to keep all your data.


If you're in academia, there are archives which store the raw data gathered in the process of scientific research. If other scientists need to find out about your experiment, they can consult these archives or ask you for your data. Make sure that you can provide all the details.

, Compare your predictions against each other and against the outcomes of your experiments. Look for patterns. Ask yourself whether the results suggest anything new, and consider whether there's anything that you've forgotten. Whether or not the data confirms the hypothesis, look out for hidden or ""exogenous"" variables that may have influenced the results.

, If the results do not support your hypothesis, reject the prediction as incorrect. If you are able to prove the hypothesis, then the theory is one step closer to being confirmed. Always document your results with as much detail as possible. If a test procedure and its results cannot be reproduced, it will be much less useful.


Make sure that the results do not change each time you do the experiment. Repeat the tests until you're sure.
Many theories get abandoned after being refuted by experiment. However, if your new theory explains something that previous theories can't, it may be an important scientific advance.

, Determine whether your theory is valid, and make sure that your experimental results are repeatable. If you accept the theory, you should not be able to disprove it with the tools and information at your disposal. Do not, however, try to spin your theory into absolute fact. , You will likely amass a lot of information in your quest to prove your theory. When you are confident that your results are repeatable and your conclusions are valid, try to distill your theory into a form that others can study and understand. Lay out your process in a logical order: first, write an ""abstract"" that summarizes your theory; then, lay forth your hypothesis, your experimental procedure, and your results. Try to distill your theory into a series of points or arguments. Finally, end the paper with an explanation of your conclusions.


Explain how you defined your question, the approach you took, and how you tested it. A proper report will walk the reader through every relevant thought and action that brought you to your conclusion.
Consider your audience. If you want to share your theory with peers in your field, write an formal paper explaining your results. Consider submitting your work to an academic journal. If you want to make your findings accessible to the general public, try distilling your theory into something more digestible: a book, an article, or a video.

, In the scientific community, theories are not generally considered valid until they have been peer-reviewed. If you submit your findings to an academic journal, another scientist may decide to peer-review—that is to say, test, consider, and replicate—the theory and process that you have put forward. This will either confirm the theory or leave it in limbo. If the theory survives the test of time, others may eventually try to expand your idea by applying it to other subjects.

, Your thought process does not need to end after you share your theory. Indeed, you may find that the act of writing up your ideas forces you to consider factors that you've been ignoring. Don't be afraid to keep testing and revising your theory until you're completely satisfied. This may mean more research, more experiments, and more papers. If your theory is large enough in scope, you may not ever be able to flesh out the implications in their entirety.


Don't be afraid to collaborate. It can be tempting to keep your intellectual sovereignty, but you may find that your ideas take on new life when you share them with peers, friends, and advisers.

Substitute and solve.",How to Derive Addition of Velocities in Special Relativity," When boosting in the x{\displaystyle x} direction, the y{\displaystyle y} and z{\displaystyle z} components remain unaffected.


ct′=γ(ct−βx)x′=γ(x−βct){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}ct^{\prime }&=\gamma (ct-\beta x)\\x^{\prime }&=\gamma (x-\beta ct)\end{aligned}}}

Here, β=vc{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {v}{c}}} and γ=11−v2c2,{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}},} the Lorentz factor. The choice of variables with the scaling of the time dimension to units of distance allows for the symmetry of spacetime to shine.

However, there are minus signs in the transformations given. For sake of consistency with the final answer, we will use the inverse Lorentz transformations. The only differences are the swapping of the prime symbols and the change in sign - boosting back to the coordinate frame is akin to boosting in the negative direction.


ct=γ(ct′+βx′)x=γ(x′+βct′){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}ct&=\gamma (ct^{\prime }+\beta x^{\prime })\\x&=\gamma (x^{\prime }+\beta ct^{\prime })\end{aligned}}}
;
, It is important to understand that these transformations hold with (infinitesimal) changes in position dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} and time cdt,{\displaystyle c{\mathrm {d} }t,} something that is guaranteed by the linearity of the transformations. 


dx=γ(dx′+β1cdt′)cdt=γ(cdt′+β1dx′){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathrm {d} }x&=\gamma ({\mathrm {d} }x^{\prime }+\beta _{1}c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime })\\c{\mathrm {d} }t&=\gamma (c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime }+\beta _{1}{\mathrm {d} }x^{\prime })\end{aligned}}}

Here, β1{\displaystyle \beta _{1}} is the relative velocity between the laboratory and moving frames.

It should be obvious to you that space and time exhibit symmetries from these equations.


, Divide dx{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x} by cdt,{\displaystyle c{\mathrm {d} }t,} and note that γ{\displaystyle \gamma } cancels out.


dxcdt=dx′+β1cdt′cdt′+β1dx′{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{c{\mathrm {d} }t}}={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x^{\prime }+\beta _{1}c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime }}{c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime }+\beta _{1}{\mathrm {d} }x^{\prime }}}}


, Divide the fraction on the right by cdt′.{\displaystyle c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime }.}


dxcdt=dx′cdt′+β11+β1dx′cdt′{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{c{\mathrm {d} }t}}={\frac {{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x^{\prime }}{c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime }}}+\beta _{1}}{1+\beta _{1}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x^{\prime }}{c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime }}}}}}

Here, dxcdt=β3{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x}{c{\mathrm {d} }t}}=\beta _{3}} is the velocity of the object as measured from the laboratory frame, while dx′cdt′=β2{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }x^{\prime }}{c{\mathrm {d} }t^{\prime }}}=\beta _{2}} is the velocity of the object as measured from the moving frame (where the object was emitted from). 


, The word ""addition"" is somewhat misplaced here, as the addition is clearly nonlinear. Below, we write it in dimensionless form.


β3=β1+β21+β1β2{\displaystyle \beta _{3}={\frac {\beta _{1}+\beta _{2}}{1+\beta _{1}\beta _{2}}}}

In terms of dimensional velocities, the formula reads v3=v1+v21+v1v2c2.{\displaystyle v_{3}={\frac {v_{1}+v_{2}}{1+{\frac {v_{1}v_{2}}{c^{2}}}}}.} From the c2{\displaystyle c^{2}} factor, we can confirm that velocities much less than the speed of light reduce to the familiar velocity addition v3=v1+v2.{\displaystyle v_{3}=v_{1}+v_{2}.}


, β1=34,β2=34.{\displaystyle \beta _{1}={\frac {3}{4}},\beta _{2}={\frac {3}{4}}.} 
,


β3=34+341+(34)(34)=642516=96100{\displaystyle \beta _{3}={\frac {{\frac {3}{4}}+{\frac {3}{4}}}{1+\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)\left({\frac {3}{4}}\right)}}={\frac {\frac {6}{4}}{\frac {25}{16}}}={\frac {96}{100}}}

Two velocities moving at 3/4ths the speed of light nonlinearly add up to 0.96c, and so relativity saves itself. Of course, with the check that special relativity ensures all velocities are less than the speed of light comes the check that Galilean relativity incorrectly adds velocities.


,

Set β2=1,{\displaystyle \beta _{2}=1,} and let β1{\displaystyle \beta _{1}} be the relative speed between laboratory frame and moving frame. The scenario describes a photon emitted from and moving in the direction of the moving frame, where β3{\displaystyle \beta _{3}} is the velocity of the photon in the laboratory frame. 


, Note the domain of β{\displaystyle \beta } is (−1,1).{\displaystyle (-1,1).}


β3=β1+11+(β1)(1)=1.{\displaystyle \beta _{3}={\frac {\beta _{1}+1}{1+(\beta _{1})(1)}}=1.}

Thus, the speed of light is shown to be invariant, at any relative velocity between the laboratory frame and the moving frame.

Note that an inertial reference frame moving at the speed of light is undefined.

The second container will be empty and provide additional volume to facilitate the expansion. Use a valved hose or pipe to connect these containers., Check the valve between the containers to confirm that it is closed. Use a cylinder of compressed air to force air into the first container.

Consider the problem.",How to Derive the Headlight Effect in Special Relativity," 4-momentum P{\displaystyle P} is the relativistic analog of linear momentum in Newtonian mechanics, upgraded to include an additional time component. This time component describes energy, so 4-momentum unifies linear momentum and energy into a single mathematical object. Below, we write 4-momentum as a row vector to save space, even though it should be thought of as a column vector.  


P=(Ec,px,py){\displaystyle P=\left({\frac {E}{c}},p_{x},p_{y}\right)}
;
, The 4-momentum of a photon from the source's rest frame then depends on the angle relative to the velocity of the source v,{\displaystyle v,} which we will say points in the +x{\displaystyle +x} direction. Below, we assume that all photons are emitted with the same energy. 


P=(Ec,Eccos⁡θ,Ecsin⁡θ){\displaystyle P=\left({\frac {E}{c}},{\frac {E}{c}}\cos \theta ,{\frac {E}{c}}\sin \theta \right)}

Try not to let the c{\displaystyle c} constants throw you off - think of them less as constants and more as unit conversion factors. 


, This is the frame moving in the −x{\displaystyle -x} direction with respect to the source. The result of this signage is that we have positive quantities on the off-diagonal of the Lorentz transformation. Note that we denote primes for the coordinate frame, not the moving frame.

This is the headlight effect. 


, Because of its non-intuitiveness, a visual has been inserted above as viewed from the coordinate frame of reference. 

The vertical lines are the result of the angle transformations. Assuming a 180 degree vision, we can see that an observer moving at a relativistic velocity can also see slightly behind her as well.

The color denotes the relativistic Doppler effect. We can see that the observer's view in front of her has become blueshifted, and the blueshifting view becomes more concentrated near the center of her field of view. At fast enough velocities, she can see blueshifted infrared, and even microwave and radio waves, as visible light.






To the right is the view of a tunnel from her reference frame. As she moves faster, it will seem that she is moving backwards at first, but this is not the case - her field of view is actually becoming wider. Her view also gradually becomes blueshifted in front of her and redshifted behind her, corresponding to the narrowing cone in the first animation. Remember, in her reference frame, she is not moving, but everything else is.

Also of note is how the tunnel gradually becomes warped. This is a consequence of relativity of simultaneity. In Newtonian mechanics, it is assumed that an observer is seeing the top and bottom of a wall at the same time, so the vertical lines are straight. This is not the case in special relativity. Due to the finite speed of light, light near the middle reaches her before light at the top and bottom, so the tunnel appears convex-shaped. 


, A light source moving at β=35{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {3}{5}}} emits photons at angles of θ=±π2{\displaystyle \theta =\pm {\frac {\pi }{2}}} - in other words, straight above and below. What are the angles relative to the direction of velocity in the coordinate frame?


Solution: use the headlight effect formula to obtain the angles we are interested in. Observe that the angles will transform the same way in either direction.

Integration of both sides gives the following expression: F1*L=nRT*ln(V)

,
Use this equation to relate the work that is done by the force F1 that acts on the photon to the volume expansion work that is done by an ideal gas of photons.,
Compare this to entropy of an ideal chemical gas as it is usually derived from the second law of thermodynamics that has the following infinitesimal value: dE=TdS-PdV


At constant temperature or for an isothermal process this value is equal zero.,
Use this to obtain the following expression about the second low of thermodynamics:


TdS=PdV

,
Divide both sides of the equation by the temperature T one gets the following expression about the entropy:


dS=(P/T)*dV

,
Use the ideal gas equation PV=nRT and isolate the value of P/T one gets the following expression:


(P/T)=nR/V

,
Substitute this value of P/T into the above equation gives the following differential equation:


dS=(nR/V)*dv

,
Integrate both sides one gets the following expression for the entropy:


S=nR*ln(V)

,
Remember that


F1*L=nRT*ln(V)

,
Obtain a value of the entropy in terms of the work of the force F1.,
Isolate the entropy from this expression to give the following equation for the entropy:


S=F1*L/T

,
Notice that this equation shows the dependence of the entropy of the photons on the temperature.

,
Recall that Q=TdS, then one can immediately get the relation:



Q=F1*L







,
Interpret the equation to say that the work of the force F1 is equal to the heat content of the ideal gas.

",How to Derive Entropy of an Ideal Gas of Photons," This equation has the following form: F=F1*(c/v);
, The mathematical details of this expansion is also described in detail in that article.

, Also in a different article the kinetic energy of a given photon was developed using this equation of forces also. The value of the kinetic energy of a photon was shown to follow this equation: (1/2)*m*(v**2)=F1*L

, The physical meaning of this equation is describing a form of kinetic energy associated with the force F type. Also it says that we can associate a hypothetical mass m with the given photon. This form of kinetic energy is shown to be equivalent to the work that is done by the force F1 along the distance L.

,,, This then gives the following expression: F1*dl=PdV

,,,, This expression was developed because it is necessary for the derivation of the entropy of the ideal gas of photons.

, Therefore we have at T=Constant






CvdT=0

Take initial temperature readings of the gas.,
Allow the gas to expand into both containers.,
Take a final temperature reading.",How to Demonstrate the Cooling of Expanding Gas2," After you have pressurized the first container, let the gas sit undisturbed for approximately five minutes. This should be sufficient time for the temperature to equilibrate and provide an accurate reading. Take a temperature reading of the gas inside the container and record it as your initial temperature.Using a container with a lid or stopcock is ideal. This way you can insert the thermometer into the stopcock to measure the temperature without letting gas escape.

, Open the valve. The gas will move from the high pressure container to the low pressure container until it reaches equilibrium. This is known as expansion.

, Once the gas has expanded, take a second temperature reading. Record this reading as your final temperature. Notice that this temperature should be lower than your initial temperature."
"
Consider the ideal gas law.,
Realize that gas molecules interact with each other.,
Keep in mind that a truly adiabatic system does not exist.",How to Demonstrate the Cooling of Expanding Gas3," The ideal gas law describes the behavior a hypothetical gas in which molecules do not interact with each other, except for totally elastic collisions. Elastic collisions will result in no net energy change. According to this law, if volume increases and pressure is held constant, temperature would increase. Thus it is clear that real gases do not behave in an “ideal” way. The equation describing this behavior is the infamous PV=nR:P = Pressure
V = Volume
n = Moles of Gas
R = Ideal Gas Constant
T = Temperature

, The primary difference between ideal and real gases is that real gases have molecules that interact in non-elastic ways. That is to say, the energetic state of the molecules changes based on how they interact with each other. This means that heat will rise in a smaller volume of gas (due to more collisions between molecules) and will fall when the same amount of gas occupies a larger volume., It is important to realize that adiabatic conditions are theoretical. There is no such thing as a perfectly insulated system, and there will be some heat exchange with the outside universe. That said, if measurements are taken quickly enough, that exchange can be negligible for this experiment."

Clean the hydrometer before putting it away.",How to Calibrate a Hydrometer," Most hydrometers come with a test jar for measuring and taking readings. Fill this with the same water you will use for the brewing process.If you are using special water from a well or you add tablets to change the pH of the brew water, it must be the same water in the measuring cylinder. This will be the reference sample used for calibration.


Using the same water controls for any other variables that might affect the hydrometer reading and ensures an accurate calibration.;
, Store the test jar with the water next to your brewing station. If you keep them next to each other, they should have the same temperature. Keeping your reference sample (the water) as close to the brew as possible will limit variations in reading due to temperature.Most hydrometers are calibrated to a reference temperature of 60°F (20°C). If your brew temperatures vary from this point, you might find some differences in your readings.

, Spin the hydrometer in the water to get rid of any bubbles that might affect the reading and ensure the hydrometer isn’t touching the sides of the test jar. Read the bottom of the meniscus (the U-shape formed by the water due to surface tension). Write down the reading of the reference sample.Let’s say you took a reading and the reference sample reads 1.003.

, After recording the reference sample reading, clean the hydrometer and take a reading of your brew sample. Remember to twist the bulb to remove bubbles and make sure the instrument doesn’t touch the walls of the container.


Let’s say the brew sample reads at 1.051.

, Ideally, the water reference sample will read 1.000. If this is the case, you do not need to do any calculations with your brew sample. It is more likely that the reading will be slightly higher or lower than 1.000. In our example, the reference sample read 1.003, therefore, you need to subtract 0.003 from your brew sample. If the brew sample is 1.051, then the calibrated sample reading is 1.051 – 0.003 = 1.048.Similarly, if the reference sample read 0.998, you would need to add 0.002 to the brew sample to get an accurate reading.

, A hydrometer is a glass device that has a bulbous, weighted end designed to float in a liquid and a narrow, long stem with a graduated scale on the other end. It is used to measure the specific gravity of a liquid. Specific gravity is the density of a liquid compared to water.The bulbous end is placed into the liquid in question while the narrow stem will stick out of the liquid.
When placed in a liquid, the hydrometer will sink and the reading is taken based on how far it sinks.

, Hydrometers are specifically calibrated to work at a given temperature. Most hydrometers are calibrated to a reference temperature of 60°F (20°C).When you purchase the hydrometer, the manual should tell you the temperature at which the hydrometer can be used.


For best results, take readings of your liquid at the reference temperature.

, Many hydrometers come with a test jar. This is filled with the liquid you want to measure instead of placing the hydrometer directly into your container of liquid. Add the liquid to the jar and then place the hydrometer with the bulb side down. It is okay if some of your liquid spills out.Make sure the hydrometer is not touching the walls of the test jar.

, Reading the hydrometer can be tricky because of the meniscus. Surface tension causes the water to stick to the sides of the hydrometer and creates the meniscus (the concave shape of the water against the sides of a surface). Be sure to look at the hydrometer at eye level and read the level below the meniscus.Spin the hydrometer to remove any bubbles that might be stuck to the bulb affecting the reading.
Wait for the hydrometer to stop bobbing before taking a reading.
Ensure the hydrometer is not touching the walls of the test jar.

, To keep your hydrometer in good working order, make sure you clean it well and place it back in its protective packaging for storage. The instrument will last longer and give you more accurate readings over time if you take care of it properly.


Clean out the test jar as well. A dirty test jar will give you inaccurate results the next time you use it.

Determine the shape of your object.,

Calculate the volume.,
Calculate the volume of the object using displacement.,
Fill a graduated cylinder with water.,
Gently place the object in the beaker.,
Subtract the new water level from the starting water level.,
Determine the mass of the object.,
Calculate the volume of your object.,
Calculate the density.",How to Calculate Volume and Density," Knowing the shape of an object allows you to choose the proper formula and make the necessary measurements to calculate the volume.

 A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional object, in which every point on the surface is an equal distance from the center. In other words, a sphere is a ball-shaped object.A cone is a 3-dimensional solid that has a circular base and a single vertex (the point of the cone). Another way to think of this is that a cone is a special pyramid that has a circular base.A cube is a three-dimensional shape that has six identical square faces.A rectangular solid, also known as a rectangular prism, is similar to a cube in that it is a three-dimensional shape with six sides, but in this case, the sides are rectangular instead of square.A cylinder is a three-dimensional shape that has two identical flat ends that are circular in shape, and a single curved side that connects them.A pyramid is a three-dimensional shape with a polygon for a base, and lateral faces that taper at an apex (the point of the pyramid).A regular pyramid is a pyramid in which the base of the pyramid is a regular polygon, meaning that all of the sides of the polygon are equal in length, and all of the angles are equal in measure.If your object has an irregular shape, you can use the displacement method to determine volume.
;
, Each shape has its own formula that calculates how much three-dimensional space that object occupies. Below are the formulas for the objects listed above. Check out How to Calculate Volume for more detailed notes and images on these formulas. 

 Sphere:  V=43πr3,{\displaystyle V={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3},} where r is the radius of the sphere.

 Cone:  V=13πr2h,{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}\pi r^{2}h,} where r is the radius of the circular base and h is the height of the cone.

 Cube: V=s3,{\displaystyle V=s^{3},} where s is the length of any edge.

 Rectangular prism: V=lwh,{\displaystyle V=lwh,} where l is the length of a side of a rectangular face, w is the width of a rectangular face, and h is the height of the prism.

 Cylinder: πr2h,{\displaystyle \pi r^{2}h,} where r is the radius of the circular base and h is the height of the cone.

 Pyramid: V=13Bh,{\displaystyle V={\frac {1}{3}}Bh,} where B is the area of the base of the pyramid and h is the height of the pyramid.


, The measurements you need to take will be determined by the shape of your object. For most objects you will need the height, but will only need the radius if the shape is circular or length and width for objects with rectangular faces.

 The radius of a circle is half of the diameter. Measure the diameter by placing a ruler across the middle of the circle and reading the end of the ruler. Calculate the radius by dividing the diameter by 2. 

 Finding the radius of a sphere requires slightly more effort, but can be done in a number of ways detailed in how to find the radius of a sphere.

 The length, width, and height of objects can be measured with a ruler starting at one end of the object and recording where it stops on the other end of the object. 


, Now that you have determined the shape, which formula to use, and made the necessary measurements, you can calculate volume. By plugging in the values of your measurements and doing the math. Your finished product is the volume of your object.

 Remember to express your answer in cubic units. Whether you are using metric or SI, the unit of volume will always be cubic. Be sure to always add units to the end of your calculation. 


, Measuring dimensions of objects that are irregularly shaped can be difficult and lead to inaccurate measurements and calculations of volume. By measuring the amount of water displaced by an object, you can easily determine its volume without complex formulas.This method can also be used to determine the volume of a regular shape.


, A graduated cylinder is a piece of lab equipment that has graduated markings on the outside and allows you to measure the volume of liquids. Make sure the graduated cylinder is large enough to contain your object. You want to fill it with enough water to completely submerge the object, but not overflow. Record the starting water level of the beaker.

 When you record the starting volume of water, be sure to look at the water at eye level and record the value at the bottom of the meniscus. The meniscus is the curve that the water takes when it comes in contact with another surface., Take care not to drop the object in the water as this can lead to some water splashing out of the graduated cylinder. Ensure that your object is fully submerged. Record the new water level of the beaker, again at eye level paying close attention to the meniscus.

 If any water overflows when you place the object in the beaker, try again with a larger graduated cylinder or use less water. 


, The amount of water the object displaces is equal to the volume of the object itself measured in cubic centimeters. Liquids are generally measured in milliliters, however, one milliliter is equal to one cubic centimeter.For example, if you started with 35 mL of water and ended with 65 mL of water, the volume of your object is 65 – 35 = 30 mL or 30 cm3


, The amount of matter in an object is the mass of that object.It is measured directly by weighing the object on a scale and its unit is grams.

 Find an accurate scale and place the object on it. Record its mass in your notebook.

 You can also measure mass with a balance. With your object on one side, place weights of known mass on the other side until both sides of the scale are balanced. The mass of your object is equal to the total mass of the balance weights.

 It's important to make sure your object is dry before weighing. This ensures that absorbed water does not affect the accuracy of the weighing.


, If your object has a regular shape, calculate the volume using one of the methods detailed above. If the shape is irregular, calculate the volume using the displacement method also detailed above.
, Density is defined as mass divided by volume. To finish your measurement of density, divide the mass you measured by the volume you calculated. The result is the density of the metal measured in g/cm3.

 For example, calculate the density ρ{\displaystyle \rho } of a substance with a volume of 8 cm3 and a mass of 24 g.

 ρ=MV=24 g8 cm3=3 g cm−3{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\rho &={\frac {M}{V}}\\&={\frac {24{\rm {\ g}}}{8{\rm {\ cm^{3}}}}}\\&=3{\rm {\ g\ cm^{-3}}}\end{aligned}}}

Plug in the known variables and solve.,
Check your answer by multiplying the wavelength by the frequency.,
Use scientific notation to avoid calculator rounding errors.,
Do not change frequency when a wave enters a different medium.",How to Calculate Wavelength," To find the wavelength of a wave, you just have to divide the wave's speed by its frequency. The formula for calculating wavelength is: Wavelength=WavespeedFrequency{\displaystyle Wavelength={\frac {Wavespeed}{Frequency}}}.Wavelength is commonly represented by the Greek letter lambda, λ{\displaystyle \lambda }.

Speed is commonly represented by the letter v{\displaystyle v}.

Frequency is commonly represented by the letter f{\displaystyle f}.

 λ=vf{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {v}{f}}}
;
, Speed can be represented using both metric and imperial units. You may see it as miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), meters per second (m/s), etc. Wavelength is almost always given in metric units: nanometers, meters, millimeters, etc. Frequency is generally expressed in Hertz (Hz) which means “per second”.Always keep units consistent across the equation. Most calculations are done using strictly metric units. 

 If the frequency is in kilohertz (kHz) or the wave speed is in km/s you will need to convert these numbers to Hertz and m/s by multiplying by 1000 (10 kHz = 10,000 Hz). 


, If you want to calculate the wavelength of a wave, then all you have to do is plug the wave's speed and wave's frequency into the equation. Dividing speed by frequency gives you the wavelength.For example: Find the wavelength of a wave traveling at 20 m/s at a frequency of 5 Hz.

 Wavelength=WavespeedFrequency{\displaystyle Wavelength={\frac {Wavespeed}{Frequency}}}λ=vf{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {v}{f}}}λ=20m/s5Hz{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {20m/s}{5Hz}}}λ=4m{\displaystyle \lambda =4m}




, You can rearrange this equation and solve for speed or frequency if given wavelength. To calculate speed given frequency and wavelength, use v=λf{\displaystyle v={\frac {\lambda }{f}}}. To calculate frequency given speed and wavelength, use f=vλ{\displaystyle f={\frac {v}{\lambda }}}.For example: Find the speed of a wave with wavelength 450 nm and frequency 45 Hz. v=λf=450nm45Hz=10nm/s{\displaystyle v={\frac {\lambda }{f}}={\frac {450nm}{45Hz}}=10nm/s}.

 For example: Find the frequency of a wave with wavelength 2.5 m and speed 50 m/s. f=vλ=50m/s2.5m=20Hz{\displaystyle f={\frac {v}{\lambda }}={\frac {50m/s}{2.5m}}=20Hz}.


, The formula for energy involving wavelength is E=hcλ{\displaystyle E={\frac {hc}{\lambda }}} where E{\displaystyle E} is the energy of the system in Joules (J), h{\displaystyle h} is Planck’s constant: 6.626 x 10-34 Joule seconds (J s), c{\displaystyle c} is the speed of light in a vacuum: 3.0 x 108 meters per second (m/s), and λ{\displaystyle \lambda } is the wavelength in meters (m).The energy of a photon is usually given to solve these types of problems. 


, You can rearrange the equation with algebra to solve for wavelength. If you multiply both sides of the equation by wavelength and then divide both sides by energy, you are left with λ=hcE{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {hc}{E}}}. If you know the energy of the photon, you can calculate its wavelength.This equation can also be used to determine the maximum wavelength of light necessary to ionize metals. Simply use the energy required for ionization and solve for the corresponding wavelength., Once you have rearranged the equation, you can solve for the wavelength by plugging in the variables for energy. Because the other two variables are constants, they are always the same. To solve, multiply the constants together and then divide by the energy.For example: Find the wavelength of a photon with an energy of 2.88 x 10-19 J.

 λ=hcE{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {hc}{E}}}= (6.626∗10−34)(3.0∗108)(2.88∗10−19){\displaystyle {\frac {(6.626*10^{-34})(3.0*10^{8})}{(2.88*10^{-19})}}}=(19.878∗10−26)(2.88∗10−19){\displaystyle ={\frac {(19.878*10^{-26})}{(2.88*10^{-19})}}}=6.90∗10−7meters{\displaystyle =6.90*10^{-7}meters}.

 Convert to nanometers by multiplying by 10-9. The wavelength equals 690 nm. 




, If you found the right value for the wavelength, multiplying by the frequency should get you the wave speed you started with. If it doesn't, check your math. If you are using a calculator, make sure you have typed the numbers in correctly.

For example: What is the wavelength of a 70 Hertz sound wave traveling at 343 meters per second?

You follow the instructions above and get an answer of 4.9 meters.

Check your work by calculating 4.9 meters x 70 Hz = 343 meters/second. This is the wave speed you started with, so your answer is correct.




, Wavelength calculations often involve very large numbers, especially if you're working with light speed. This can lead to rounding errors on your calculator. Prevent this by writing your numbers in scientific notation.For example: Light travels through water at about 225,000,000 meters per second. If the wave's frequency is 4 x 1014 Hz, what is its wavelength?

The wave speed in scientific notation = 2.25 x 108. The frequency is already written in scientific notation.


Wavelength=wavespeedfrequency{\displaystyle Wavelength={\frac {wavespeed}{frequency}}}=2.25∗1084∗1014=2.254∗106{\displaystyle ={\frac {2.25*10^{8}}{4*10^{14}}}={\frac {2.25}{4*10^{6}}}}=0.563∗10−6meters{\displaystyle =0.563*10^{-6}meters}=5.63∗10−7meters{\displaystyle =5.63*10^{-7}meters}.




, Many word problems involve a wave that crosses the boundary from one medium to another. A common mistake here is calculating a new frequency for the wave. In fact, the frequency of the wave remains the same when it crosses the boundary, while the wavelength and wave speed change.For example: A light wave with frequency f, speed v, and wavelength λ crosses from air to a medium with refractive index 1.5. How do these three values change?

The new speed is equal to v1.5{\displaystyle {\frac {v}{1.5}}}.

The frequency remains constant at f.

The new wavelength is equal to newspeednewfrequency=v1.5f=v1.5f{\displaystyle {\frac {newspeed}{newfrequency}}={\frac {\frac {v}{1.5}}{f}}={\frac {v}{1.5f}}}.

Define the generic formula.,
Find the projected area A.,
Calculate wind pressure.,
Determine the drag coefficient for the object in question.,
Calculate the wind load.,
 For example, let’s say you want to determine the wind load on an antenna that is 3 feet long with a diameter of 0.5 inches in a gust of 70mph winds.",How to Calculate Wind Load2," The generic formula for wind load is F = A x P x Cd where F is the force or wind load, A is the projected area of the object, P is the wind pressure, and Cd is the drag coefficient.This equation is useful for estimating the wind load on a specific object, but does not meet building code requirements for planning new construction.
, This is the area of the two-dimensional face that the wind is hitting.For a full analysis, you will repeat the calculation for each face of the building. For example, if a building has a west face with an area of 20m2, use that value for A to calculate the wind load on the west face.

The formula to calculate area depends on the shape of the face. For a flat wall, use the formula Area = length x height. Approximate the area of a column face with Area = diameter x height.

For SI calculations, measure A in square meters (m2).

For imperial calculations, measure A in square feet (ft2).


, The simple formula for wind pressure P in imperial units (pounds per square foot) is P=0.00256V2{\displaystyle P=0.00256V^{2}}, where V is the speed of the wind in miles per hour (mph).To find the pressure in SI units (Newtons per square meter), instead use P=0.613V2{\displaystyle P=0.613V^{2}}, and measure V in meters per second.This formula is based on the American Society of Civil Engineers code. The 0.00256 coefficient is the result of a calculation based on typical values for air density and gravitational acceleration.Engineers use a more accurate formula to take into account factor such as the surrounding terrain and type of construction. You can look up one formula in ASCE code 7-05, or use the UBC formula below.

If you're not sure what the wind speed is, look up the peak wind speed in your area using the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) standard. For example, most of the U.S. is in Zone A with 86.6 mph wind, but coastal areas might lie in Zone B (100 mph) or Zone C (111.8 mph).


, Drag is the force that air exerts on the building, affected by the building's shape, the roughness of its surface, and several other factors. Engineers typically measure drag directly using experiments, but for a rough estimate you can look up a typical drag coefficient for the shape you are measuring. For example:The standard drag coefficient for a long cylinder tube is 1.2 and for a short cylinder is 0.8. These apply to antenna tubes found on many buildings.

 The standard coefficient for a flat plate such as the face of a building is 2.0 for a long flat plate or 1.4 for a shorter flat plate.

 The drag coefficient has no units. 


, Using the values determined above, you can now calculate wind load with the equation F = A x P x Cd.
,

 Start by estimating the projected area. In this case, A=dw=(3ft)(0.5in)(1ft/12in)=0.125ft2{\displaystyle A=dw=(3ft)(0.5in)(1ft/12in)=0.125ft^{2}}

 Calculate the wind pressure: P=0.00256V2=0.00256(702)=12.5psf{\displaystyle P=0.00256V^{2}=0.00256(70^{2})=12.5psf}.

 For a short cylinder the coefficient of drag is 0.8.

 Plugging into the equation: F=APCd=(0.125ft2)(12.5psf)(0.8)=1.25lbs.{\displaystyle F=APCd=(0.125ft^{2})(12.5psf)(0.8)=1.25lbs.}

 1.25 lbs is the amount of wind load on the antenna.

Define the formula developed by the Electronic Industries Association.,
Understand the variables of the equation.,
Determine projected area.,
Calculate wind pressure.,
Determine the drag coefficient for the object in question.,
Calculate the exposure coefficient, Kz.,
Calculate the gust response factor, Gh.,
Calculate the wind load.",How to Calculate Wind Load3," The formula for wind load is F = A x P x Cd x Kz x Gh, where A is the projected area, P is wind pressure, Cd is the drag coefficient, Kz is the exposure coefficient, and Gh is the gust response factor. This formula takes a few more parameters into account for wind load. This formula is generally used to calculate wind load on antennas.
, In order to use an equation properly, you must first understand what each variable stands for and what its associated units are.

 A, P, and Cd are the same variables used in the generic equation. 

 Kz is the exposure coefficient and it is calculated by taking into account the height from the ground to the midpoint of the object. The units of Kz are feet.  

 Gh is the gust response factor and it is calculated by taking into account the entire height of the object. The units of Gh are 1/feet or ft-1.


, The projected area of your object is dependent upon its shape and size. If the wind is hitting a flat wall, the projected area is easier to calculate than if the object is rounded. Projected area will be an approximation of the area that the wind comes in contact with. There is no one formula for calculating projected area, but you can estimate it with some basic calculations. Units for area are ft2.

 For a flat wall, use the formula Area = length x width, measuring the length and width of the wall where the wind is hitting it.

 For a tube or column, you can also approximate the area using length and width. In this case, the width will be the diameter of the tube or column.


, Wind pressure is given by the equation P = 0.00256 x V2, where V is the speed of the wind in miles per hour (mph). The unit for wind pressure is pounds per square foot (psf).

 For example, if the wind speed is 70 mph, the wind pressure is 0.00256 x 702 = 12.5 psf.

 An alternative to calculating wind pressure at a particular wind speed is to use the standard for various wind zones. For example, according to the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) most of the U.S. is in Zone A with 86.6 mph wind, but coastal areas might lie in Zone B (100 mph) or Zone C (111.8 mph).


, Drag is the net force in the direction of flow due to pressure on the surface of an object.The drag coefficient represents the drag of an object through a fluid and is dependent upon the shape, size, and roughness of an object.

 The standard drag coefficient for a long cylinder tube is 1.2 and for a short cylinder is .8 These apply to antenna tubes found on many buildings.

 The standard coefficient for a flat plate such as the face of a building is 2.0 for a long flat plate or 1.4 for a shorter flat plate.

 The difference between drag coefficients for flat and cylinder items is approximately 0.6.

 The drag coefficient has no units.


, Kz is calculated using the formula (2/7), where z is the height from the ground to the midpoint of the object.

 For example, if you have an antenna that is 3 ft long and 48 ft off the ground, z would be equal to 46.5 ft. 

 Kz = (2/7) = (2/7) = 1.1 ft.


, Gust response factor is calculated with the equation Gh = .65+.60/where h is the height of the object.

 For example, if you have an antenna that is 3 ft long and 48 ft off the ground, Gh = .65+.60/= .65+.60/(51/33)(1/7) = 1.22 ft-1


, Using the values determined above, you can now calculate wind load with the equation F = A x P x Cd x Kz x Gh. Plug in all of your variables and do the math.

 For example, let’s say you want to determine the wind load on an antenna that is 3 feet long with a diameter of 0.5 inches in a gust of 70mph winds. It is placed on top of a 48 ft high building.

 Start by calculating the projected area. In this case, A = l x w = 3 ft x (0.5in x (1 ft/12 in)) = 0.125 ft2.

 Calculate the wind pressure: P = 0.00256 x V2 = 0.00256 x 702 = 12.5 psf.

 For a short cylinder the coefficient of drag is 0.8.

 Calculate the exposure coefficient: Kz = (2/7) = (2/7) = 1.1 ft.

Define the UBC ’97 formula.,
Determine projected area.,
Determine Ce, the combined height, exposure, and gust response factor.,
Determine the pressure coefficient for the object in question.,
Determine the wind stagnation pressure.,
Determine importance factor.,
Calculate the wind load.",How to Calculate Wind Load4," This formula was developed in 1997 as part of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) for calculation of wind load. The formula is F = A x P, were A is the projected area and P is the wind pressure; however, this formula has an alternate calculation for wind pressure.

Wind pressure (PSF) is calculated as P= Ce x Cq x Qs x Iw, where Ce is the combined height, exposure and gust response factor, Cq is a pressure coefficient (it is equivalent to the drag coefficient in the previous two equations), Qs is wind stagnation pressure, and Iw is importance factor. All of these values can be calculated or obtained from the appropriate tables.


, The projected area of your object is dependent upon its shape and size. If the wind is hitting a flat wall, the projected area is easier to calculate than if the object is rounded. Projected area will be an approximation of the area that the wind comes in contact with. There is no one formula for calculating projected area, but you can estimate it with some basic calculations. Units for area are ft2.

 For a flat wall, use the formula Area = length x width, measuring the length and width of the wall where the wind is hitting it.

 For a tube or column, you can also approximate the area using length and width. In this case, the width will be the diameter of the tube or column.


, This value is chosen based on table 16-G of UBC and takes into account three terrain exposures with various heights and Ce values for each.

 “Exposure B is terrain with buildings, trees or other surface irregularities covering at least 20 percent of the surrounding area and extending 1.6 kilometers or more from the site.”

 “Exposure C has terrain that is flat and generally open, extending 0.8 km or more from the site.”

 “Exposure D is the most severe, with basic wind speeds of 129 km/hr or greater and terrain that is flat and unobstructed facing large bodies of water.”


, The pressure coefficient, Cq, is the same as the drag coefficient (Cd). Drag is the net force in the direction of flow due to pressure on the surface of an object.The drag coefficient represents the drag of an object through a fluid and is dependent upon the shape, size, and roughness of an object.

 The standard drag coefficient for a long cylinder tube is 1.2 and for a short cylinder is .8 These apply to antenna tubes found on many buildings.

 The standard coefficient for a flat plate such as the face of a building is 2.0 for a long flat plate or 1.4 for a shorter flat plate.

 The difference between drag coefficients for flat and cylinder items is approximately 0.6.

 The drag coefficient has no units.


, Qs is the wind stagnation pressure and is equivalent to the wind pressure calculation from the previous equations: Qs = 0.00256 x V2, where V is the speed of the wind in miles per hour (mph).

 For example, if the wind speed is 70 mph, the wind stagnation pressure is 0.00256 x 702 = 12.5 psf.

 An alternative to this calculation is to use the standards set for various wind zones. For example, according to the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) most of the U.S. is in Zone A with 86.6 mph wind, but coastal areas might lie in Zone B (100 mph) or Zone C (111.8 mph).


, Iw is the importance factor and can be determined using table 16-K of the UBC. It is a multiplier used in calculating loads that takes into account the use of the building. If a building contains hazardous materials, its importance factor will be higher than that of a traditional building.

 Calculations for buildings with standard use have an importance factor of one.  


, Using the values determined above, you can now calculate wind load with the equation F = A x P = A x Ce x Cq x Qs x Iw . Plug in all of your variables and do the math.

 For example, let’s say you want to determine the wind load on an antenna that is 3 feet long with a diameter of 0.5 inches in a gust of 70mph winds. It is placed on top of a 48 ft high standard building in an area with an exposure B terrain.

 Start by calculating the projected area. In this case, A = l x w = 3 ft x (0.5in x (1 ft/12 in)) = 0.125 ft2.

 Determine Ce. Based on table 16-G, using the height of 48 ft and exposure B terrain, Ce is 0.84.

 For a short cylinder the coefficient of drag or Cq is 0.8.

 Calculate Qs: Qs = 0.00256 x V2 = 0.00256 x 702 = 12.5 psf.

 Determine importance factor. This is a standard building therefore, Iw is 1.

 Plugging into the equation: F = A x P = A x Ce x Cq x Qs x Iw = 0.125 x 0.84 x 0.8 x 12.5 x 1= 1.05 lbs. 

 1.05 lbs is the amount of wind load on the antenna.

Define the forces on either end of the strand.,
Account for acceleration.,
Account for rotational acceleration.,
Understand that tension due to gravity changes throughout a swinging object's arc.,
Account for friction.",How to Calculate Tension in Physics1," The tension in a given strand of string or rope is a result of the forces pulling on the rope from either end. As a reminder, force = mass × acceleration. Assuming the rope is stretched tightly, any change in acceleration or mass in objects the rope is supporting will cause a change in tension in the rope. Don't forget the constant acceleration due to gravity - even if a system is at rest, its components are subject to this force. We can think of a tension in a given rope as T = (m × g) + (m × a), where ""g"" is the acceleration due to gravity of any objects the rope is supporting and ""a"" is any other acceleration on any objects the rope is supporting.


For the purposes of most physics problems, we assume ideal strings - in other words, that our rope, cable, etc. is thin, massless, and can't be stretched or broken.
As an example, let's consider a system where a weight hangs from a wooden beam via a single rope (see picture). Neither the weight nor the rope are moving - the entire system is at rest. Because of this, we know that, for the weight to be held in equilibrium, the tension force must equal the force of gravity on the weight. In other words, Tension (Ft) = Force of gravity (Fg) = m × g.

Assuming a 10 kg weight, then, the tension force is 10 kg × 9.8 m/s2 = 98 Newtons.


;
, Gravity isn't the only force that can affect the tension in a rope - so can any force related to acceleration of an object the rope is attached to. If, for instance, a suspended object is being accelerated by a force on the rope or cable, the acceleration force (mass × acceleration) is added to the tension caused by the weight of the object.


Let's say that, in our example of the 10 kg weight suspended by a rope, that, instead of being fixed to a wooden beam, the rope is actually being used to pull the weight upwards at an acceleration of 1 m/s2. In this case, we must account for the acceleration on the weight as well as the force of gravity by solving as follows:

Ft = Fg + m × a
Ft = 98 + 10 kg × 1 m/s2

Ft = 108 Newtons.




, An object being rotated around a central point via a rope (like a pendulum) exerts strain on the rope caused by centripetal force. Centripetal force is the added tension force the rope exerts by ""pulling"" inward to keep an object moving in its arc and not in a straight line. The faster the object is moving, the greater the centripetal force. Centripetal force (Fc) is equal to m × v2/r where ""m"" is mass, ""v"" is velocity, and ""r"" is the radius of the circle that contains the arc of the object's motion.


Since the direction and magnitude of centripetal force changes as the object on the rope moves and changes speeds, so does the total tension in the rope, which always pulls parallel to the rope towards the central point. Remember also that the force of gravity is constantly acting on the object in a downward direction. So, if an object is being spun or swung vertically, total tension is greatest at the bottom of the arc (for a pendulum, this is called the equilibrium point) when the object is moving fastest and least at the top of the arc when it is moving slowest.
Let's say in our example problem that our object is no longer accelerating upwards but instead is swinging like a pendulum. We'll say that our rope is 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) long and that our weight is moving at 2 m/s when it passes through the bottom of its swing. If we want to calculate tension at the bottom of the arc when it's highest, we would first recognize that the tension due to gravity at this point is the same as when the weight was held motionless - 98 Newtons.To find the additional centripetal force, we would solve as follows:

Fc = m × v2/r
Fc = 10 × 22/1.5
Fc =10 × 2.67 = 26.7 Newtons.
So, our the total tension would be 98 + 26.7 = 124.7 Newtons.




, As noted above, both the direction and magnitude of centripetal force change as an object swings. However, though the force of gravity remains constant, the tension resulting from gravity also changes. When a swinging object isn't at the bottom of its arc (its equilibrium point), gravity is pulling directly downward, but tension is pulling up at an angle. Because of this, tension only has to counteract part of the force due to gravity, rather than its entirety.


Breaking gravitational force up into two vectors can help you visualize this concept. At any given point in the arc of a vertically swinging object, the rope forms an angle ""θ"" with the line through the equilibrium point and the central point of rotation. As the pendulum swings, gravitational force (m × g) can be broken up into two vectors - mgsin(θ) acting tangent to the arc in the direction of the equilibrium point and mgcos(θ) acting parallel to the tension force in the opposite direction. Tension only has to counter mgcos(θ) - the force pulling against it - not the entire gravitational force (except at the equilibrium point, when these are equal).
Let's say that when our pendulum forms an angle of 15 degrees with the vertical, it's moving 1.5 m/s. We would find tension by solving as follows:

Tension due to gravity (Tg) = 98cos(15) = 98(0.96) = 94.08 Newtons
Centripetal force (Fc) = 10 × 1.52/1.5 = 10 × 1.5 = 15 Newtons
Total tension = Tg + Fc = 94.08 + 15 = 109.08 Newtons.




, Any object being pulled by a rope that experiences a ""drag"" force from friction against another object (or fluid) transfers this force to the tension in the rope. Force from friction between two objects is calculated as it would be in any other situation - via the following equation: Force due to friction (usually written Fr) = (mu)N, where mu is the friction coefficient between the two objects and N is the normal force between the two objects, or the force with which they are pressing into each other. Note that static friction - the friction that results when trying to put a stationary object into motion - is different than kinetic friction - the friction that results when trying to keep a moving object in motion.


Let's say that our 10 kg weight is no longer being swung but is now being dragged horizontally along the ground by our rope. Let's say that the ground has a kinetic friction coefficient of 0.5 and that our weight is moving at a constant velocity but that we want to accelerate it at 1 m/s2. This new problem presents two important changes - first, we no longer have to calculate tension due to gravity because our rope isn't supporting the weight against its force. Second, we have to account for tension caused by friction, as well as that caused by accelerating the weight's mass. We would solve as follows:

Normal force (N) = 10 kg × 9.8 (acceleration from gravity) = 98 N
Force from kinetic friction (Fr) = 0.5 × 98 N = 49 Newtons
Force from acceleration (Fa) = 10 kg × 1 m/s2 = 10 Newtons
Total tension = Fr + Fa = 49 + 10 = 59 Newtons.

Plug the known factors into the equation.,
Solve the equation.",How to Calculate Specific Heat," It's important to be familiar with the terms that are used for calculating specific heat before you learn the formula for specific heat. You'll need to know how to recognize the symbol for each term and to understand what it means. Here are the terms that are commonly used in the equation for calculating the specific heat of a substance:


Delta, or the ""Δ"" symbol, represents the change in a variable.

For example, if your first temperature (T1) is 150ºC, and your second temperature (T2) is 20ºC, then ΔT, or the change in temperature, represents 150ºC - 20ºC, or 130ºC.


The mass of the sample is represented by ""m"".
The amount of heat is represented by ""Q"". The amount of heat is represented by ""J"", or Joules.
""T"" is the temperature of the substance.
Specific heat is represented by ""Cp"".

, Once you become familiar with the terms used for calculating specific heat, you should learn the equation for finding the specific heat of a substance. The formula is: Cp = Q/mΔT.


You can manipulate this formula if you want to find the change in the amount of heat instead of the specific heat. Here's what it would look like:

ΔQ = mCpΔT



, First, you should look at the equation to get a sense of what you need to do to find the specific heat. Let's look at this problem: Find the specific heat of 350 g of an unknown material when 34,700 Joules of heat are applied, and the temperature rises from 22ºC to 173ºC with no phase change.

, Once you're comfortable with the problem, you can write down each known and unknown variable to have a better sense of what you're working with. Here's how you do it:


m = 350 g
Q = 34,700 Joules
ΔT = 173ºC - 22ºC = 151ºC
Cp = unknown

, You know the value of everything except ""Cpc"", so you should plug the rest of the factors into the original equation and solve for ""Cp"", Here's how you do it:


Original equation: Cp = Q/mΔT

c = 34,700 J/(350 g x 151ºC)

, Now that you've plugged the known factors into the equation, just do simple arithmetic to solve it. The specific heat, or final answer, is 0.65657521286 J/(g x ºC).


Cp = 34,700 J/(350 g x 151ºC)
Cp = 34,700 J/(52850 g x ºC)
Cp = 0.65657521286 J/(g x ºC)

Lift parallel vertical loads using a pulley.,
Lift loads using a pulley with non-parallel vertical strands.,
Use multiple strands to support a hanging object.",How to Calculate Tension in Physics2," Pulleys are simple machines consisting of a suspended disk that allows the tension force in a rope to change direction. In a simple pulley configuration, the rope or cable runs from a suspended weight up to the pulley, then down to another, creating 2 lengths of rope or cable strands. However, the tension in both sections of rope is equal, even if both ends of the rope are being pulled by forces of different magnitudes. For a system of two masses hanging from a vertical pulley, tension equals 2g(m1)(m2)/(m2+m1), where ""g"" is the acceleration of gravity, ""m1"" is the mass of object 1, and ""m2"" is the mass of object 2.


Note that, usually, physics problems assume ideal pulleys - massless, frictionless pulleys that can't break, deform, or become separated from the ceiling, rope, etc. that supports them.
Let's say we have two weights hanging vertically from a pulley in parallel strands. Weight 1 has a mass of 10 kg, while weight 2 has a mass of 5 kg. In this case, we would find tension as follows:

T = 2g(m1)(m2)/(m2+m1)
T = 2(9.8)(10)(5)/(5 + 10)
T = 19.6(50)/(15)
T = 980/15
T = 65.33 Newtons.



Note that, because one weight is heavier than the other, all other things being equal, this system will begin to accelerate, with the 10 kg moving downward and the 5 kg weight moving upward.

, Pulleys are often used to direct tension in a direction other than up or down. If, for instance, a weight is suspended vertically from one end of the rope while the other end is attached to a second weight on a diagonal slope, the non-parallel pulley system takes the shape of a triangle with points at the first weight, the second weight, and the pulley. In this case, the tension in the rope is affected both by the force of gravity on the weight and by the component of the pulling force that's parallel to the diagonal section of rope.

Let's say we have a system with a 10 kg weight (m1) hanging vertically connected by a pulley to a 5 kg weight (m2) on a 60 degree ramp (assume the ramp is frictionless).To find the tension in the rope, it's easiest to find equations for the forces accelerating the weights first. Proceed as follows:

The hanging weight is heavier and we're not dealing with friction, so we know it will accelerate downward. The tension in the rope is pulling up on it, though, so it's accelerating due to the net force F = m1(g) - T, or 10(9.8) - T = 98 - T.
We know the weight on the ramp will accelerate up the ramp. Since the ramp is frictionless, we know that the tension is pulling it up the ramp and only its own weight is pulling it down. The component of the force pulling it down the ramp is given by sin(θ), so, in our case, we can say that it's accelerating up the ramp due to the net force F = T - m2(g)sin(60) = T - 5(9.8)(.87) = T - 42.63.
Acceleration of the two weights are the same, thus we have (98 - T)/m1 = (T - 42.63) /m2. After a little trivial work to solve this equation, finally we have T = 60.96 Newton.



, Finally, let's consider an object hanging from a ""Y-shaped"" system of ropes - two ropes are attached to the ceiling, which meet at a central point from which a weight hangs by a third rope. The tension in the third rope is obvious - it's simply tension resulting from the gravitational force, or m(g). The tensions in the other two ropes are different and must add up to equal the gravitational force in the upward vertical direction and to equal zero in either horizontal direction, assuming the system is at rest. The tension in the ropes is affected both by the mass of the hanging weight and by the angle at which each rope meets the ceiling.


Let's say in our Y-shaped system that the bottom weight has a mass of 10 kg and that the two upper ropes meet the ceiling at 30 degrees and 60 degrees respectively. If we want to find the tension in each of the upper ropes, we'll need to consider each tension's vertical and horizontal components. Nonetheless, in this example, the two ropes happens to be perpendicular to each other, making it easy for us to calculate according to the definitions of trigonometric functions as follows:

The ratio between T1 or T2 and T = m(g) is equal to the sine of the angle between each supporting rope and the ceiling. For T1, sin(30) = 0.5, while for T2, sin(60) = 0.87
Multiply the tension in the lower rope (T = mg) by the sine of each angle to find T1 and T2.
T1 = .5 × m(g) = .5 × 10(9.8) = 49 Newtons.

T2 = .87 × m(g) = .87 × 10(9.8) = 85.26 Newtons.

, The first leg will be the thickness of the object. The second leg will be the distance between the 2 marks on the back of the object. The third leg, the hypotenuse, is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the other 2 sides.

, Knowing the dimensions of the triangles, the angles at the boundary between the air and the surface of the object can be calculated using trigonometry. The angle on the air side of the interface is the angle of incidence. The angle on the object side of the interface is the angle of refraction.

, The refractive index of the object is the sine of the angle of incidence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction.

Find the mass of the falling object.,
Know the acceleration due to the gravity of the Earth.,
Calculate the downward pull of gravity.",How to Calculate Terminal Velocity2," This should be measured in grams or kilograms, in the metric system.


If you are using the imperial system, remember that pounds is not actually a unit of mass, but of force. The unit of mass in the imperial system is the pound-mass (lbm), which under the gravitational force on the surface of the earth would experience a force of 32 pound-force (lbf). For example, if a person weighs 160 pounds on earth, that person is actually feeling 160 lbf, but their mass is 5 lbm.

, Close enough to the earth to encounter air resistance, this acceleration is 9.8 meters per second squared, or 32 feet per second squared.

, The force with which the falling object is being pulled down equals the object's mass times acceleration due to gravity, or F = MA. This number, multiplied by two, goes in the top of the terminal velocity formula.


In the imperial system, this is the lbf of the object, the number that is commonly called weight. It is more properly the mass in lbm times 32 feet per second squared. In the metric system, the force is the mass in grams times 9.8 meters per second squared.

Figure out the drag force that is opposing the downward pull of gravity.",How to Calculate Terminal Velocity3," For an object falling through the Earth's atmosphere, the density is going to change based on the altitude and the temperature of the air. This makes calculating terminal velocity of a falling object especially difficult, as the density of the air will change as the object loses altitude. However, you can look up approximate air densities in textbooks and other references.As a rough guide, the density of air at sea level when the temperature is 15 °C is 1.225 kg/m3.

, This number is based on how streamlined the object is. Unfortunately it is a very complex number to compute, and involves making certain scientific assumptions. Do not attempt to calculate drag coefficient yourself without the help of a wind tunnel and some serious aerodynamic math. Instead look up an approximation based on a similarly shaped object., The last variable you need to know is the sectional area being presented by the object to the medium. Imagine the silhouette of the falling object seeing when looking up from directly beneath it. That shape, projected onto a plane, is the projected area. Again, this is a difficult value to calculate with anything but simple geometric objects.

, If you know the velocity of the object, but not the drag force, you can use the formula to calculate the drag force. This is (C*ρ*A*(v^2))/2.

, You need something to monitor the time with. A stopwatch or timer app on a smartphone or tablet works well for this.

,, Be sure to count only when the marked arm or blade returns to the position at which it started.

, This is how many revolutions per minute, or RPM, the object makes.


Instead of stopping the count at 1 minute, you may want to count for 2 or 3 minutes and then divide the count by the number of minutes to get the RPM if the object rotates slowly. This will help you avoid estimating a partial rotation if the object does not return to its original position at the end of 1 minute.
If the object rotates quickly, you may instead want to count for only 15 seconds and then multiply the result by 4 to get the RPM.You can relate the RPM of an object turned by wind to the actual wind speed by first finding the circumference traveled by one of the object’s arms in one rotation. You then convert this distance to either miles or kilometers and multiply that by the RPM to determine how much distance the object rotated through in 1 minute. Multiply this by 60 to determine how much distance was traveled in 1 hour, and you’ll have the wind speed"

You can measure the impedance of any electrical circuit or component. The result will tell you how much the circuit resists the flow of electrons (the current). There are two different effects that slow the current, both of which contribute to the impedance:Resistance (R) is the slowing of current due to effects of the material and shape of the component. This effect is largest in resistors, but all components have at least a little resistance.
Reactance (X) is the slowing of current due to electric and magnetic fields opposing changes in the current or voltage. This is most significant for capacitors and inductors.;
, Resistance is a fundamental concept in the study of electricity. You'll see it most often in Ohm's law: ΔV = I * R.This equation lets you calculate any of these values if you know the other two. For instance, to calculate resistance, write the formula as R = ΔV / I. You can also measure resistance easily, using a multimeter.


ΔV is the voltage, measured in Volts (V). It is also called the potential difference.
I is the current, measured in Amperes (A).
R is the resistance, measured in Ohms (Ω).

, Reactance only occurs in AC circuits (alternating current). Like resistance, it is measured in Ohms (Ω). There are two types of reactance, which occur in different electrical components:


Inductive reactance XL is produced by inductors, also called coils or reactors. These components create a magnetic field that opposes the directional changes in an AC circuit.The faster the direction changes, the greater the inductive reactance.
Capacative reactance XC is produced by capacitors, which store an electrical charge. As current flow in an AC circuit changes direction, the capacitor charge and discharges repeatedly. The more time the capacitor has to charge, the more it opposes the current.Because of this, the faster the direction changes, the lower the capacitive reactance.

, As described above, inductive reactance increases with the rate of change in the current direction, or the frequency of the circuit. This frequency is represented by the symbol ƒ, and is measured in Hertz (Hz). The full formula for calculating inductive reactance is XL = 2πƒL, where L is the inductance measured in Henries (H).The inductance L depends on the characteristics of the inductor, such as the number of its coils.It is possible to measure the inductance directly as well.
If you're familiar with the unit circle, picture an AC current represented with this circle, with one full rotation of 2π radians representing one cycle. If you multiply this by ƒ measured in Hertz (units per second), you get a result in radians per second. This is the circuit's angular velocity, and can be written as a lower-case omega ω. You might see the formula for inductive reactance written as XL=ωL, This formula is similar to the formula for inductive reactance, except capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the frequency. Capacative reactance XC = 1 / 2πƒC.C is the capacitance of the capacitor, measured in Farads (F).


You can measure capacitance using a multimeter and some basic calculations.
As explained above, this can be written as 1 / ωC.

, Total impedance is simple if the circuit has several resistors, but no inductors or capacitors. First, measure the resistance across each resistor (or any component with resistance), or refer to the circuit diagram for the labeled resistance in ohms (Ω). Combine these according to how the components are connected:Resistors in series (connected end to end along one wire) can be added together. The total resistance R = R1 + R2 + R3...
Resistors in parallel (each on a different wire that connects to the same circuit) are added as their reciprocals. To find the total resistance R, solve the equation 1/R = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3 ...

, If there are only inductors in the circuit, or only capacitors, the total impedance is the same as the total reactance. Calculate it as follows:Inductors in series: Xtotal = XL1 + XL2 + ...
Capacitors in series: Ctotal = XC1 + XC2 + ...
Inductors in parallel: Xtotal = 1 / (1/XL1 + 1/XL2 ...)
Capacitors in parallel: Ctotal = 1 / (1/XC1 + 1/XC2 ...)

, Because one of these effects increases as the other decreases, these tend to cancel each other out. To find the total effect, subtract the smaller one from the larger.You will get the same result from the formula Xtotal = |XC - XL|

, You can't just add the two together, because the two values are ""out of phase."" This means that both values change over time as part of the AC cycle, but reach their peaks at different times.Fortunately, if all of the components are in series (i.e. there is only one wire), we can use the simple formula Z = √(R2 + X2).The mathematics behind this formula involves ""phasors,"" but it might seem familiar from geometry as well. It turns out we can represent the two components R and X as the legs of a right triangle, with the impedance Z as the hypotenuse., This is actually a general way to express impedance, but it requires an understanding of complex numbers. This is the only way to calculate the total impedance of a circuit in parallel that includes both resistance and reactance.


Z = R + jX, where j is the imaginary component: √(-1). Use j instead of i to avoid confusion with I for current.
You cannot combine the two numbers. For example, an impedance might be expressed as 60Ω + j120Ω.
If you have two circuits like this one in series, you can add the real and imaginary components together separately. For example, if Z1 = 60Ω + j120Ω and is in series with a resistor with Z2 = 20Ω, then Ztotal = 80Ω + j120Ω.

A state is denoted by a ket vector |ψ⟩.{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle .} In order to denote useful information, we need a basis with which to work with. Typically, we will set the z{\displaystyle z} axis as a basis for states that we will work with in this article, much like how we can choose Cartesian coordinates to represent the components of linear momentum or an electric field. Other bases can be chosen as well - for example, the x{\displaystyle x} axis can just as easily be a basis for which we describe the state |ψ⟩.{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle .}

In the z{\displaystyle z} basis, the state can be written as follows. 


|ψ⟩=c+|↑z⟩+c−|↓z⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =c_{+}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle +c_{-}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle }



As we can see, |ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } is written in the z{\displaystyle z} basis consisting of the up and down states. These basis elements form a complete set, so that these two basis elements are all that is needed to describe the particle's spin in the z{\displaystyle z} direction. The constants in front of the kets are called probability amplitudes and are in general complex numbers. The vector space that describes spin-1/2 particles (and particles in quantum mechanics in general) is called a Hilbert space, which is basically a glorified Euclidean space. 

Classically, a particle should always be in a definitive state - either spin up or spin down. As we will see, this is not necessarily the case in quantum mechanics - a particle can be in a superposition of two states at the same time!
;
,

The most basic operation done is the inner product (the dot product is an inner product). The inner product ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩{\displaystyle \langle \phi |\psi \rangle } is described by the ket |ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } being acted upon by the bra vector ⟨ϕ|.{\displaystyle \langle \phi |.} As you may know, inner products return a scalar as a result. The physical significance of the inner product is that it describes the probability amplitude for the particle initially in the state |ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } to be found in the state |ϕ⟩.{\displaystyle |\phi \rangle .}

Using our knowledge of the inner product, we can now write the state |ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } in terms of inner products. Remember that when a bra meets a ket, they form a bracket (inner product) and are consequently just numbers. 


|ψ⟩=|↑z⟩⟨↑z|ψ⟩+|↓z⟩⟨↓z|ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =|\uparrow _{z}\rangle \langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle +|\downarrow _{z}\rangle \langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle }




,

Since the basis elements are orthonormal, the inner product of the up state with the down state is 0 (and vice versa). 


⟨↓z|↑z⟩=⟨↑z|↓z⟩=0{\displaystyle \langle \downarrow _{z}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle =\langle \uparrow _{z}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle =0}



In contrast, the inner product of a basis vector with itself is 1, as determined by our normalization condition.


⟨↑z|↑z⟩=⟨↓z|↓z⟩=1{\displaystyle \langle \uparrow _{z}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle =\langle \downarrow _{z}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle =1}



Our basis elements |↑z⟩{\displaystyle |\uparrow _{z}\rangle } and |↓z⟩{\displaystyle |\downarrow _{z}\rangle } were chosen so that they are orthonormal. If we were to start with a particle in the up state and measure the spin, there would be no chance that we would find the particle in the down state, and vice versa. However, we would find that there is a 100% chance that a particle in the up state is measured to be in the up state. 

Since the state is normalized, we expect that the inner product of the state with itself is also 1. 


⟨ψ|ψ⟩=1{\displaystyle \langle \psi |\psi \rangle =1}




, We know that every observable must have a real value, but we just said that the amplitudes are generally complex numbers. In order to find the actual probability, we take the modulus squared of the inner product.

The probability that an arbitrary state |ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } can be found in the up state is denoted by |⟨↑z|ψ⟩|2.{\displaystyle |\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}.} Since the amplitude may be complex, the modulus squared is the amplitude multiplied by its complex conjugate. We denote conjugates by the ∗{\displaystyle *} symbol.


|⟨↑z|ψ⟩|2=⟨↑z|ψ⟩∗⟨↑z|ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}=\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ^{*}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle }




,


|ψ⟩=i3|↑z⟩+23|↓z⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle ={\frac {i}{\sqrt {3}}}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle +{\sqrt {\frac {2}{3}}}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle }


, To find the probability amplitude for the particle to be found in the up state, we take the inner product for the up state and the down state.


⟨↑z|ψ⟩=i3⟨↑z|↑z⟩+23⟨↑z|↓z⟩=i3{\displaystyle \langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ={\frac {i}{\sqrt {3}}}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle +{\sqrt {\frac {2}{3}}}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle ={\frac {i}{\sqrt {3}}}}


⟨↓z|ψ⟩=i3⟨↓z|↑z⟩+23⟨↓z|↓z⟩=23{\displaystyle \langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ={\frac {i}{\sqrt {3}}}\langle \downarrow _{z}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle +{\sqrt {\frac {2}{3}}}\langle \downarrow _{z}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle ={\sqrt {\frac {2}{3}}}}


, The probability is the modulus squared. Remember that the modulus squared means to multiply the amplitude with its complex conjugate.


|⟨↑z|ψ⟩|2=−i3i3=13{\displaystyle |\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}={\frac {-i}{\sqrt {3}}}{\frac {i}{\sqrt {3}}}={\frac {1}{3}}}


|⟨↓z|ψ⟩|2=2323=23{\displaystyle |\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}={\sqrt {\frac {2}{3}}}{\sqrt {\frac {2}{3}}}={\frac {2}{3}}}


, We can clearly see that these probabilities sum to 1, so our given state is normalized.


|⟨↑z|ψ⟩|2+|⟨↓z|ψ⟩|2=13+23=1{\displaystyle |\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}+|\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}={\frac {1}{3}}+{\frac {2}{3}}=1}


,

We first recall the arbitrary state written in terms of the z{\displaystyle z} basis.


|ψ⟩=|↑z⟩⟨↑z|ψ⟩+|↓z⟩⟨↓z|ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =|\uparrow _{z}\rangle \langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle +|\downarrow _{z}\rangle \langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle }



The state |ψ⟩{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle } can be written in terms of a column vector. Recall that a classical vector such as linear momentum can be written as p=(px,py,pz),{\displaystyle {\mathbf {p} }=(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}),} where we have abandoned the unit vectors. The vector can then be written as a column vector. However, we need to first establish a basis. Our basis for the linear momentum vector is obvious from the subscripts, indicating Cartesian coordinates. However, when writing the state for the spin angular momentum of a particle, we must first understand which basis we are writing the state in. Any basis is fine - the state does not change with a change in coordinates - but the representation does change. 

We can write our arbitrary state as the following, where the inner products have made it clear that we are expressing the state in the z{\displaystyle z} basis. As with writing out the state explicitly in part 1, we could've just as easily written the state in the x{\displaystyle x} basis, or any other direction. 


|ψ⟩→(⟨↑z|ψ⟩⟨↓z|ψ⟩){\displaystyle |\psi \rangle \to {\begin{pmatrix}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle \\\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle \end{pmatrix}}}




, Notice how simple the vectors are.


|↑z⟩=(⟨↑z|↑z⟩⟨↓z|↑z⟩)=(10){\displaystyle |\uparrow _{z}\rangle ={\begin{pmatrix}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle \\\langle \downarrow _{z}|\uparrow _{z}\rangle \end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}}}


|↓z⟩=(⟨↑z|↓z⟩⟨↓z|↓z⟩)=(01){\displaystyle |\downarrow _{z}\rangle ={\begin{pmatrix}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle \\\langle \downarrow _{z}|\downarrow _{z}\rangle \end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\end{pmatrix}}}


, In bra-ket notation, the inner product is linear in the second argument - that is, the ket vector, while it is antilinear (conjugate-linear) in the first argument - that is, the bra vector. Therefore, when writing the corresponding bra, we must take the transpose and take the complex conjugate of all the elements in the vector. 


⟨ψ|=(⟨ψ|↑z⟩⟨ψ|↓z⟩)=(⟨↑z|ψ⟩∗⟨↓z|ψ⟩∗){\displaystyle \langle \psi |={\begin{pmatrix}\langle \psi |\uparrow _{z}\rangle &\langle \psi |\downarrow _{z}\rangle \end{pmatrix}}={\begin{pmatrix}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ^{*}&\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ^{*}\end{pmatrix}}}


, Inner products consist of two vectors and output a scalar, so when two combine, the usual rules of matrix multiplication apply. 

Let's take the inner product of the state with itself. We see that the formulation of matrix mechanics is consistent with our expectations.


⟨ψ|ψ⟩=(⟨↑z|ψ⟩∗⟨↓z|ψ⟩∗)(⟨↑z|ψ⟩⟨↓z|ψ⟩)=⟨↑z|ψ⟩∗⟨↑z|ψ⟩+⟨↓z|ψ⟩∗⟨↓z|ψ⟩=|⟨↑z|ψ⟩|2+|⟨↓z|ψ⟩|2=1{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\langle \psi |\psi \rangle &={\begin{pmatrix}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ^{*}&\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ^{*}\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle \\\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle \end{pmatrix}}\\&=\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ^{*}\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle +\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ^{*}\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle \\&=|\langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}+|\langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle |^{2}=1\end{aligned}}}




, 

Rewrite the state in the z{\displaystyle z} basis as a column vector.


|ψ⟩=13(i2){\displaystyle |\psi \rangle ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {3}}}{\begin{pmatrix}i\\{\sqrt {2}}\end{pmatrix}}}



Calculate the amplitudes.


⟨↑z|ψ⟩=(10)13(i2)=i3{\displaystyle \langle \uparrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ={\begin{pmatrix}1&0\end{pmatrix}}{\frac {1}{\sqrt {3}}}{\begin{pmatrix}i\\{\sqrt {2}}\end{pmatrix}}={\frac {i}{\sqrt {3}}}}


⟨↓z|ψ⟩=(01)13(i2)=23{\displaystyle \langle \downarrow _{z}|\psi \rangle ={\begin{pmatrix}0&1\end{pmatrix}}{\frac {1}{\sqrt {3}}}{\begin{pmatrix}i\\{\sqrt {2}}\end{pmatrix}}={\sqrt {\frac {2}{3}}}}



Since these were the same inner products as found last time, it follows that the probabilities will be the same. 

Although we never actually use any matrices in this article, it turns out that they are crucial to matrix mechanics, as they represent operators. For example, when the spin angular momentum operator S^z{\displaystyle {\hat {S}}_{z}} acts on an eigenstate of the operator, the result is the eigenstate times the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenstate. The eigenvalue is the quantity actually observed in the lab, while the very act of applying an operator corresponds to a measurement made by a detector.

When just calculating probabilities, there is no advantage in using matrix mechanics over directly taking the inner products. However, when dealing with additional topics such as expectation values, uncertainties, and eigenstates/eigenvalue problems, matrices must be used for clarity and simplicity.

, Mass is the amount of matter in an object.  To measure the mass of an object, you can use a balance.  In physics, there is a rule: you have to measure things in SI units which all the scientists in the world use.  The SI unit for mass is kilogram or kg.
, Velocity is the speed and the direction that the object travels. Right now, we will only concentrate on the speed part. You can calculate the velocity of an object by dividing the distance that the object traveled by the time it took to travel the distance.  Again, you have to measure velocity in SI unit.  The SI unit for velocity is m/s (meters per second).
,, That is the momentum!  The measurement for momentum is kg*m/s.

For example, when the mass of an object is 4kg{\displaystyle 4kg} and its velocity is 2.5ms{\displaystyle 2.5{\frac {m}{s}}}, then its momentum is equal to 4kg⋅2.5ms=10kg⋅ms{\displaystyle 4kg\cdot 2.5{\frac {m}{s}}=10{\frac {kg\cdot m}{s}}}.

Count the number of teeth on the driver gear.,
Count the number of teeth on the driven gear.,
Find the ratio of the driver gear and driven gear.,
Calculate the RPM of the driven gear.",How to Calculate RPM2," The driver gear is the gear connected to a motor or other power source, usually by an axle. The driver gear’s rate of rotation is known.


For the purposes of this example, we’ll treat the driver gear as having 80 teeth and a rotation rate of 100 rpm.

, The driven gear is the gear whose teeth mesh with those of the driver gear. The driver gear’s teeth push the teeth of the driven gear, which causes the entire driven gear to rotate. This is the gear whose rate of rotation we’re trying to find.


For this example, we’ll assume two different driven gear sizes, one that’s smaller than the driver gear, and one that’s larger than the driver gear.
The smaller driven gear will have fewer teeth than the driver gear. Our smaller gear will have 20 teeth.
The larger driven gear will have more teeth than the driver gear. Our larger gear will have 160 teeth.

, To find the ratio of the two gears, you divide the number of teeth in one gear by the number of teeth in the other. Although the correct way is to always divide the number of teeth of the driver gear by those of the driven gear or vice versa, we’ll divide the larger number by the smaller number.


For our driven gear that has 20 teeth, we’ll divide the number of teeth the driver gear has, 80, by 20 to get 80 / 20 = 4.
For our driven gear that has 160 teeth, we’ll divide that number by the number of teeth the driver gear has, 80, to get 160 / 80 = 2.

, How we figure this depends on whether the driven gear is smaller or larger than the driver gear.


If the driven gear is smaller than the driver gear, we multiply the result of the ratio between the driver and driven gear by the RPM of the driver gear. For our smaller driven gear with 20 teeth, we multiply the RPM of the driver gear, 100, by the result of 4 from the previous step to get 100 x 4 = 400RPM for the driven gear.
If the driven gear is larger than the driver gear, we divide the result of the ratio between the driven and driver gear into the RPM, of the driver gear. For our lager driven gear with 160 teeth, we divide the RPM of the driver gear, 100, by the result of 2 from the previous step to get 100 / 2 = 50RPM for the driven gear."

Determine the muzzle velocity of the bullet.,
Determine the twist rate imparted by the barrel.,
Convert the muzzle velocity into the same unit per second as the unit of the twist rate.,
Divide by the result by the length of the twist rate.,
Multiply by 60.",How to Calculate RPM3," Muzzle velocity is how fast the bullet travels through the gun barrel when it is fired. It is commonly measured in feet per second (fps, ft/s) or meters per second (m/s).


For this example, we’ll assume a muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second (609.6 m/s).

, The insides of gun barrels feature spiral grooves, or rifling, that cause the bullet to spin. This spin helps to stabilize the flight of the bullet as it leaves the barrel muzzle and speeds toward its target. Twist rate is specified as a a ratio of 1 spin to a length in either inches or millimeters.For our purposes, we’ll assume a twist rate of 1:10 inches (1:254 mm).
The smaller the twist rate, the more spin will be imparted to the bullet by the rifling inside the gun barrel. Too much spin can lead to bullets blowing up or actually impairing accuracy for short-range shooting., How you convert depends on whether you’re working with feet and inches or with metric units.If the twist rate is given as 1 per a length in inches and the muzzle velocity is given in feet per second, you multiply the muzzle velocity by 12 to convert it to inches per second.
For our example muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second, multiplying by 12 gives 2000 x 12 = 24,000 inches per second.
If the twist rate is given as 1 per a length in millimeters and the muzzle velocity is given in meters per second (m/s), you multiply the muzzle velocity by 1000 to convert it to millimeters per second (mm/s).
For the metric measure of 609.6 m/s, multiplying by 1000 gives 609.6 x 1000 = 609,600 mm/s.

, This will give you the rotation expressed in rotations per second.Dividing the muzzle velocity of 24,000 inches per second by the length of 10 inches gives 24,000 / 10 = 2400 rotations per second.
Dividing the muzzle velocity of 609,600 mm/s by the length of 254 mm gives 609,600 / 254 = 2400 rotations per second. (As expected, the results are the same whether using feet and inches or their equivalent measures in metric units.)

, There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the bullet will make 60 times as many rotations in a minute as it does in a second.Multiplying 2400 rotations per second times 60 gives 2400 x 60 = 144,000RPM.

Problem 1.,
Problem 2.",How to Calculate Half Life," Exponential decay occurs in a general exponential function f(x)=ax,{\displaystyle f(x)=a^{x},} where |a|<1.{\displaystyle |a|<1.}

In other words, as x{\displaystyle x} increases, f(x){\displaystyle f(x)} decreases and approaches zero. This is exactly the type of relation we want to describe half-life. In this case, we want a=12,{\displaystyle a={\frac {1}{2}},} so that we have the relationship f(x+1)=12f(x).{\displaystyle f(x+1)={\frac {1}{2}}f(x).}
;
, Of course, our function does not depend on generic variable x,{\displaystyle x,} but time t.{\displaystyle t.}


f(t)=(12)t{\displaystyle f(t)=\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)^{t}}

Simply replacing the variable doesn't tell us everything, though. We still have to account for the actual half-life, which is, for our purposes, a constant. 

We could then add the half-life t1/2{\displaystyle t_{1/2}} into the exponent, but we need to be careful about how we do this. Another property of exponential functions in physics is that the exponent must be dimensionless. Since we know that the amount of substance depends on time, we must then divide by the half-life, which is measured in units of time as well, to obtain a dimensionless quantity.

Doing so also implies that t1/2{\displaystyle t_{1/2}} and t{\displaystyle t} be measured in the same units as well. As such, we obtain the function below.


f(t)=(12)tt1/2{\displaystyle f(t)=\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)^{\frac {t}{t_{1/2}}}}


, Of course, our function f(t){\displaystyle f(t)} as it stands is only a relative function that measures the amount of substance left after a given time as a percentage of the initial amount. All we need to do is to add the initial quantity N0.{\displaystyle N_{0}.} Now, we have the formula for the half-life of a substance.


N(t)=N0(12)tt1/2{\displaystyle N(t)=N_{0}\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)^{\frac {t}{t_{1/2}}}}


, In principle, the above formula describes all the variables we need. But suppose we encountered an unknown radioactive substance. It is easy to directly measure the mass before and after an elapsed time, but not its half-life. So let's express half-life in terms of the other measured (known) variables. Nothing new is being expressed by doing this; rather, it is a matter of convenience. Below, we walk through the process one step at a time.

Divide both sides by initial amount N0.{\displaystyle N_{0}.}


N(t)N0=(12)tt1/2{\displaystyle {\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}=\left({\frac {1}{2}}\right)^{\frac {t}{t_{1/2}}}}



Take the logarithm, base 12,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}},} of both sides. This brings down the exponent.


log1/2(N(t)N0)=tt1/2{\displaystyle \log _{1/2}\left({\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}\right)={\frac {t}{t_{1/2}}}}



Multiply both sides by t1/2{\displaystyle t_{1/2}} and divide both sides by the entire left side to solve for half-life. Since there are logarithms in the final expression, you'll probably need a calculator to solve half-life problems.


t1/2=tlog1/2(N(t)N0){\displaystyle t_{1/2}={\frac {t}{\log _{1/2}\left({\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}\right)}}} 




, 300 g of an unknown radioactive substance decays to 112 g after 180 seconds. What is the half life of this substance?


Solution: we know the initial amount N0=300 g,{\displaystyle N_{0}=300{\rm {\ g}},} final amount N=112 g,{\displaystyle N=112{\rm {\ g}},} and elapsed time t=180 s.{\displaystyle t=180{\rm {\ s}}.}

Recall the half-life formula t1/2=tlog1/2(N(t)N0).{\displaystyle t_{1/2}={\frac {t}{\log _{1/2}\left({\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}\right)}}.} Half-life is already isolate, so simply substitute and evaluate. 


t1/2=180 slog1/2(112 g300 g)≈127 s{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t_{1/2}&={\frac {180{\rm {\ s}}}{\log _{1/2}\left({\frac {112{\rm {\ g}}}{300{\rm {\ g}}}}\right)}}\\&\approx 127{\rm {\ s}}\end{aligned}}}



Check to see if the solution makes sense. Since 112 g is less than half of 300 g, at least one half-life must have elapsed. Our answer checks out.


, A nuclear reactor produces 20 kg of uranium-232. If the half-life of uranium-232 is about 70 years, how long will it take to decay to 0.1 kg?


Solution: We know the initial amount N0=20 kg,{\displaystyle N_{0}=20{\rm {\ kg}},} final amount N=0.1 kg,{\displaystyle N=0.1{\rm {\ kg}},} and the the half-life of uranium-232 t1/2=70 years.{\displaystyle t_{1/2}=70{\rm {\ years}}.}

Rewrite the half-life formula to solve for time. 


t=(t1/2)log1/2(N(t)N0){\displaystyle t=(t_{1/2})\log _{1/2}\left({\frac {N(t)}{N_{0}}}\right)}



Substitute and evaluate.


t=(70 years)log1/2(0.1 kg20 kg)≈535 years{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t&=(70{\rm {\ years}})\log _{1/2}\left({\frac {0.1{\rm {\ kg}}}{20{\rm {\ kg}}}}\right)\\&\approx 535{\rm {\ years}}\end{aligned}}}

Remember to check your solution intuitively to see if it makes sense.

Know the heat capacity formula.,
Find the difference in temperature for changes of multiple degrees.,
Add the appropriate units to your answer to give it meaning.,
Know that this equation works for cooling objects as well.",How to Calculate Heat Capacity1," Heat Capacity of an object can be calculated by dividing the amount of heat energy supplied (E) by the corresponding change in temperature (T). Our equation is: Heat Capacity = E / T.


Example: It takes 2000 Joules of energy to heat a block up 5 degrees Celsius -- what is the heat capacity of the block?
Heat Capacity = E / T
Heat Capacity = 2000 Joules / 5 C
Heat Capacity = 400 Joules per degree Celsius (J/C);
, For example, if I want to know the heat capacity of a block, and I know it took 60 Joules to raise the block from 8 degrees to 20 degrees, I need to know the difference between the two temperatures to get my heat capacity. Since 20 - 8 = 12, the temperature of the block changed by 12 degrees. Therefore:


Heat Capacity = E / T
Heat Capacity of the block = 60 Joules / (20C - 8C)
60 Joules / 12 C
Heat Capacity of the Block = 5 J/C

, A heat capacity of 300 means nothing if you don't know how it was measured. Heat Capacity is measured by energy needed per degree. So if we measure the energy in joules, and the change of temperature in Celsius, our final answer will represent how many Joules we needed per degree Celsius. Thus we would represent our answer as 300 J/C, or 300 Joules per degree celsius.


If you measure heat energy in calories and temperature in Kelvin, your final answer would be 300 C/K.

, When something becomes two degrees colder, it loses the exact same amount of heat as it would gain to become 2 degrees warmers. Thus, if you are asked, ""What is the heat capacity of an object if it loses 50 Joules of energy and drops 5 degrees Celsius,"" you can still use our equation:


Heat Capacity: 50J / 5C
Heat Capacity = 10 J/C

Determine how many protons and neutrons are found in the isotope in question.,
Calculate the total theoretical mass of the nucleus.,
Subtract the experimental mass of the neutron from the theoretical mass.",How to Calculate Mass Defect," Use a periodic table and remember that certain isotopes of an element may have a different number of neutrons.;
, Multiply the amount of protons by its mass in atomic mass units (approximately 1.007276u) and add it to the amount of neutrons multiplied by its mass (approximately 1.008665u). Note that your teacher may provide you a specific value to use for these masses, or specify how many significant digits you are required to use.

, This difference is the mass defect! You can convert it to kilograms and use Einstein's E=mc^2 to calculate the binding energy required to hold the nucleus together.

Set up the equation.,
Multiply the variables.,
Analyze your results.",How to Calculate Fluid Pressure1," The equation for fluid pressure is independent of the mass or volume of the liquid. Instead, fluid pressure is the product of the density of the liquid, the height of the liquid above the object, and gravity. Since gravity and liquid densities are fixed (for the most part), the height of the liquid is the largest variable in the equation.The equation reads as Pfluid = ρgh, where ρ is the density of the liquid, g is the force of gravity, and h is the height of the liquid.;
, To solve the equation, you take the product of the three variables. You can use a calculator, or do the calculations on your own. There are also online calculators that will do this calculation for you.For example, if you had a fluid that with a density of (1.08 x 103 kg/m3) and was 5.00 m high, you would multiply (1.08 x 103 kg/m3) x 9.81 m/s2 x 5.00 m. In this case, you would get the answer of 5.30 x 104.

, Make sure that your results add up logically. You should not get a reading for negative fluid pressure. You also should compare different measurements to see if they follow the expected trends. For example, more dense liquids will exert more pressure at the same height. The same liquid will exert more pressure when the height is higher.Since water is more dense than oil, you can expect water to exert more fluid pressure than oil at the same height.

Know that specific heat refers to the energy needed to raise one gram by one degree.,
Use the heat capacity formula to find a material's specific heat.,
Use specific heat to find the energy needed to raise any material to any temperature.,
Know the specific heat of common materials.",How to Calculate Heat Capacity2," When you find the heat capacity of one unit of something (1 gram, 1 ounce, 1 kilogram, etc), you've found this object's specific heat. Specific heat tells you the amount of energy needed to raise each unit one degree. For example, it takes .417 Joules to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius. So, water's specific heat is .417 J/C per gram.


The specific heat of a material is constant. That means that all pure water has the same specific heat-- .417 J/C.

, Finding it is easy, simply divide your final answer by the mass of the object. This tells you how much energy was need for each bit of the object, like how many joules changes the temperature in just one gram of ice.


Example: ""I have 100 grams of ice. It takes 406 Joules to raise the temperature of ice 2 degree Celsius-- what is the specific heat of ice?""'
Heat Capacity for 100g Ice = 406J / 2C
Heat Capacity for 100g Ice = 203 J/C
Heat Capacity for 1g Ice = 2.03 J/C per gram
If you are confused, think of it this way -- it takes 2.03 Joules to raise every single gram of ice one degree. So, if we have 100 grams of ice we need 100 times as many Joules to heat it all.

, A material's specific heat is tells you how much energy is needed to raise one unit (usually 1 gram) a single degree. To find the heat needed to raise any object to any temperature, we simply multiply all of the parts together. Energy Needed = Mass x Specific Heat x Temperature Change. The answer is always in your unit of energy such as Joules.


Example:"" If the specific heat of aluminum is .902 Joules per gram, how many Joules does it take to raise 5 grams of aluminum 2 degrees Celsius?
Energy Needed = 5g x .902J/C x 2C
Energy Needed = 9.2 J

, To help practice, learn the common specific heats that you might see on a test or encounter in real life. What can you learn from them? Notice, for example, that the specific heat of metals is much lower than wood -- this is why a metal spoon heats up quicker than wood if left in a hot cup of chocolate. Lower specific heats mean an object gets hot faster.


Water: 4.179 J/C
Air: 1.01 J/C
Wood: 1.76
Aluminum: .902 J/C
Gold: .129 J/C
Iron: .450"

Measure the volume of your liquid.,
Weigh the liquid.,
Calculate the liquid’s density.",How to Calculate Fluid Pressure2," Pour 100 mL of liquid into a pre-weighed graduated cylinder. Make sure that your measurement is correct, and then write the volume down as 100 mL. You can write in a lab journal or notebook., Put the sample of liquid on a scale. Measure the mass of 100 mL of your liquid. Subtract the weight of the graduated cylinder from the total weight to obtain the mass of your liquid.The measurement shown on the scale is the total mass of the liquid and the cylinder.

, Density is equal to the mass of the liquid divided by the volume of the liquid. In this case, you have measured both. You will simply divide the mass by 100 mL.For example, if your liquid had a mass of 125 g, you would divide that by 100 mL. Your resulting answer would be 1.25 g/mL

"
"
Consider the meaning of each variable.,
Study the units involved.,
See fluid pressure as one force acting on an object.,
Apply fluid pressure concepts.",How to Calculate Fluid Pressure3," The density of the liquid is significant because it tells you how much mass your liquid has per unit of volume. Gravity then exerts a force on that mass to pull it down. Finally, the height of the liquid tells you how much liquid is above the object experiencing the pressure., The units for fluid pressure are pascals or sometimes millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The pascal is an S.I. unit for pressure. The mmHg unit (and similar units that denote a height of some liquid) comes from the dependency of pressure on height., The force that is exerted on some object by fluid pressure is only one force. There could many forces acting on the same object. For example, air pressure and fluid pressure are often added together to obtain a “total pressure” acting on some object., Once you have calculated fluid pressure for a liquid or set of liquids, you can use them for varying applications. For example, understanding the fluid pressure of water would be important to building a water tower that can hold water at a certain height. This is also important for use in mercury thermometers, or other systems that use liquids as measurements.

Put a medium bowl inside a large bowl.,
Fill the medium bowl to the brim with water.,
Place a small, floatable wooden object on a gram scale and note the measurement.,
Place the wood in the water.,
Place another, separate container on the gram scale and note the measurement.,
Remove the wood from the medium bowl, then remove the medium bowl from the large bowl.,
Pour the spilled water from the large bowl into the container on the scale and note the measurement.

,
Subtract the mass of the container (Step 5) from the combined mass of the water and the container (Step 7).,
Compare the mass of the spilled water with the mass of the wood (Step 3).,
Repeat the experiment with a non-floatable object such as a rock.",How to Demonstrate Archimedes' Principle,";
, Don't let it overflow.

, A building block, a coaster, or a chunk of scrap wood will work provided that it’s small enough to fit in the medium bowl.


Do not confuse this with a regular scale. Grams are a unit of mass, not weight. Many cheap digital kitchen scales, for example, measure in grams.

, It will float but some of the water will be “displaced” – i.e., will spill into the large bowl.

, Leave it on the scale.

, Be very careful not to spill.

,, The result is the mass of the spilled water.

, They should be identical.

, Find its mass, place it in the water, and then compare that with the mass of the displaced water. They will not be the same. Why? Because the rock was too dense to float in the water; in other words, the water didn’t have enough “buoyancy force” (i.e., ability to float an object) to hold up the rock, which sank. Since the object could not remain buoyant, the buoyancy cannot equal the weight of the displaced water.

Define the variables of the equation.,
Understand what is meant by energy.,
Define what mass means.,
Realize that mass and energy are equivalent.The equation states that mass and energy are the same thing and tells you how much energy is contained inside a certain amount of mass.,
Understand where usable energy comes from.,
Apply Einstein’s equation to make energy conversion more efficient.,
Discover the technologies made possible by E=mc2.",How to Understand E=mc2," The first step to understanding any equation is to know what each variable stands for. In this case, E is the energy of an object at rest, m is the object's mass, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.


The speed of light, c is constant in all reference frames and is roughly equal to 3.00x108 meters per second. In the context of Einstein's relativity, the c2 functions more as a unit conversion factor than a constant. As such, it is squared as a result of dimensional analysis - energy is measured in joules, or kg m2 s-2, so adding the c2 ensures that the relationship between energy and mass is dimensionally consistent.;
, There are many forms of energy including thermal, electrical, chemical, nuclear and more.Energy is transferred between systems giving power to one system while taking it away from another.


Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, it can only take a different form. For example, coal has a lot of potential energy that turns into thermal energy when it is burned.

, Mass is generally defined as the amount of matter in an object.There are also a few other definitions of mass. There exists ""invariant mass,"" and ""relativistic mass."" Invariant mass is mass that remains unchanged no matter what frame of reference you are in. Relativistic mass, on the other hand, depends on the object's velocity. In the equation E = mc2, m refers to the invariant mass. This is very important, because this means that your mass does not grow as you go faster, contrary to popular belief.
It’s important to understand that mass and weight are different. Weight is the gravitational force felt by an object, while mass is the amount of matter in that object. Mass can only change if the object is physically altered, while weight changes depending on the gravity of the environment the object is in. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) while weight is measured in newtons (N).
Like energy, mass can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can also change form. For example, an ice cube can melt into a liquid, but it still has the same mass in both states.

, Essentially, the equation explains that a small amount of mass is full of a large amount of energy., Most of our consumable energy comes from the burning of coal and natural gas. Burning these substances takes advantage of their valence electrons (unpaired electrons in the outermost shell of an atom) and the bonds they make with other elements. When heat is added, these bonds break and the energy released is used to power our communities.


Obtaining energy this way is not very efficient and is costly to the environment.

, E=mc2 tells us that there is much more energy stored inside the nucleus of an atom than in its valence electrons.The energy released from splitting an atom is much higher than that of breaking electron bonds.


Nuclear power is based on this principle. Nuclear reactors cause fission (the splitting of atoms) to occur and capture the massive amount of energy released.

, E=mc2 has enabled the creation of many new and exciting technologies, some of which, we can’t imagine living without:PET scans use radioactivity to see inside the body.
The equation allowed for the development of telecommunications with satellites and rovers.
Radiocarbon dating uses radioactive decay based on the equation to determine the age of ancient objects.
Nuclear energy provides cleaner and more efficient energy sources to our society.

The time-independent equation is an eigenvalue equation, and thus, only certain eigenvalues of energy exist as solutions.


H^|ψ(x)⟩=E|ψ(x)⟩{\displaystyle {\hat {H}}|\psi (x)\rangle =E|\psi (x)\rangle }
;
,

In the one-dimensional particle in a box scenario, the Hamiltonian is given by the following expression. This is familiar from classical mechanics as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, but in quantum mechanics, we assume that position and momentum are operators.


H^=p^22m+V(x){\displaystyle {\hat {H}}={\frac {{\hat {p}}^{2}}{2m}}+V(x)} 



In position space, the momentum operator is given by p^=−iℏddx.{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}=-i\hbar {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}.} 


H^=−ℏ22md2dx2+V(x){\displaystyle {\hat {H}}=-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}}{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+V(x)} 



Meanwhile, we let V(x)=0{\displaystyle V(x)=0} inside the box and V(x)=∞{\displaystyle V(x)=\infty } everywhere else. Because V(x)=0{\displaystyle V(x)=0} in the region that we are interested in, we may now write this equation as a linear differential equation with constant coefficients.


−ℏ22md2ψdx2=Eψ{\displaystyle -{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}\psi }{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}=E\psi }



Rearranging terms and defining a constant k2=2mEℏ2,{\displaystyle k^{2}={\frac {2mE}{\hbar ^{2}}},} we arrive at the following equation.


d2ψdx2+k2ψ=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}\psi }{{\mathrm {d} }x^{2}}}+k^{2}\psi =0}




, This equation is familiar from classical mechanics as the equation describing simple harmonic motion. 

The theory of differential equations tells us that the general solution to the above equation is of the following form, where A{\displaystyle A} and B{\displaystyle B} are arbitrary complex constants and L{\displaystyle L} is the width of the box. We are choosing coordinates such that one end of the box lies at x=0{\displaystyle x=0} for simplicity of calculations. 


ψ(x)=Asin⁡kx+Bcos⁡kx,0<x<L{\displaystyle \psi (x)=A\sin kx+B\cos kx,\quad 0<x<L} 



Of course, the solution is valid only up to an overall phase, which does change with time, but phase changes do not affect any of our observables, including energy. Therefore, for our purposes, we will write the wavefunction as only varying with position ψ(x),{\displaystyle \psi (x),} hence the usage of the time-independent Schrödinger equation.


, Remember that V(x)=∞{\displaystyle V(x)=\infty } everywhere outside the box, so the wavefunction must vanish at the ends.


ψ(0)=Asin⁡(k⋅0)+Bcos⁡(k⋅0)=0{\displaystyle \psi (0)=A\sin(k\cdot 0)+B\cos(k\cdot 0)=0}


ψ(L)=Asin⁡(kL)+Bcos⁡(kL)=0{\displaystyle \psi (L)=A\sin(kL)+B\cos(kL)=0}

This is a system of linear equations, so we may write this system in matrix form.


(01sin⁡kLcos⁡kL)(AB)=0{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\sin kL&\cos kL\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}A\\B\end{pmatrix}}=0}




, In order for the above homogeneous equation to have nontrivial solutions, the determinant must vanish. This is a standard result from linear algebra. If you are not familiar with this background, you may treat this as a theorem.

The sine function is 0 only when its argument is an integer multiple of π.{\displaystyle \pi .}


−sin⁡kL=0kL=nπ, n∈Z{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}-\sin kL&=0\\kL&=n\pi ,\ n\in {\mathbb {Z} }\end{aligned}}}



Recall that k=2mEℏ2.{\displaystyle k={\sqrt {\frac {2mE}{\hbar ^{2}}}}.} We may then solve for E.{\displaystyle E.}  


kL=2mEnℏ2L=nπ{\displaystyle kL={\sqrt {\frac {2mE_{n}}{\hbar ^{2}}}}L=n\pi }


En=ℏ2π22mL2n2{\displaystyle E_{n}={\frac {\hbar ^{2}\pi ^{2}}{2mL^{2}}}n^{2}}



These are the energy eigenvalues of the particle in a box. Because n{\displaystyle n} is an integer, the energy of this system can only take on discrete values. This is a chiefly quantum mechanical phenomenon, quite unlike classical mechanics, where a particle can take on continuous values for its energy.

The energy of the particle can only take on positive values, even at rest. The ground-state energy E1{\displaystyle E_{1}} is called the zero-point energy of the particle. The energy corresponding to n=0{\displaystyle n=0} is not allowed because this physically represents that no particle is in the box. Because the energies increase quadratically, higher energy levels are spread out more than lower energy levels.

We will now proceed to derive the energy eigenfunctions. 


, We know from the constraint of the wavefunction at x=0{\displaystyle x=0} that B=0{\displaystyle B=0} (see the first equation in step 4). Therefore, the wavefunction will only contain one term from the general solution of the differential equation. Below, we substitute k=nπL.{\displaystyle k={\frac {n\pi }{L}}.}


ψn(x)=Asin⁡nπxL, n∈Z{\displaystyle \psi _{n}(x)=A\sin {\frac {n\pi x}{L}},\ n\in {\mathbb {Z} }}


, Normalizing will determine the constant A{\displaystyle A} and will ensure that the probability of finding the particle in the box is 1. Since n{\displaystyle n} can only be an integer, it is convenient to set n=1{\displaystyle n=1} here, as the only purpose of substituting a value is to obtain an expression for A.{\displaystyle A.} It is helpful to know the integral ∫0πsin2⁡xdx=π2{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }\sin ^{2}x{\mathrm {d} }x={\frac {\pi }{2}}} when normalizing.


1=∫ψ∗(x)ψ(x)dx=∫0LA∗Asin2⁡nπxL, n∈Z{\displaystyle 1=\int \psi ^{*}(x)\psi (x){\mathrm {d} }x=\int _{0}^{L}A^{*}A\sin ^{2}{\frac {n\pi x}{L}},\ n\in {\mathbb {Z} }}


1|A|2=∫0Lsin2⁡πxLdx, u=πxL=∫0πLπsin2⁡udu=Lππ2{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {1}{|A|^{2}}}&=\int _{0}^{L}\sin ^{2}{\frac {\pi x}{L}}{\mathrm {d} }x,\ u={\frac {\pi x}{L}}\\&=\int _{0}^{\pi }{\frac {L}{\pi }}\sin ^{2}u{\mathrm {d} }u\\&={\frac {L}{\pi }}{\frac {\pi }{2}}\end{aligned}}}


A=2L{\displaystyle A={\sqrt {\frac {2}{L}}}}


, This is the description of a particle inside a box, surrounded by infinite potential energy walls. While n{\displaystyle n} can take on a negative value, the result would simply negate the wavefunction and result in a phase change, not an entirely different state. We can clearly see why only discrete energies are allowed here, because the box only allows those wavefunctions with nodes at x=0{\displaystyle x=0} and x=L.{\displaystyle x=L.} 


ψn(x)=2Lsin⁡nπxL, 0<x<L{\displaystyle \psi _{n}(x)={\sqrt {\frac {2}{L}}}\sin {\frac {n\pi x}{L}},\ 0<x<L}

Slide on your boots.,
Take a final look.",How to Put on a Cleanroom Suit," One of the easiest ways to noticeably contaminate an area is by shedding hair. Hair falls from your head to the floor or work surface. With it come proteins and bacteria that will contaminate the cleanroom. You will be required to wear a hood or hairnet of some kind to prevent any hair from falling in the cleanroom (this includes facial hair)., The small details matter in a cleanroom. Things like eyelashes and eyebrows also need to remain separated from the cleanroom. In addition to that, many clean room materials may be hazardous to the eyes. This means that goggles will be worn to serve a dual purpose ― protect the cleanroom from your eyes, and protect your eyes from the cleanroom., Your gloves should come from a plastic container. They should be free of powder and should not allow powders or liquids to be transferred. If you are working with solvents, you should be sure that your gloves are appropriate for that particular solvent (will not react with/be degraded by the solvent). Glove manufacturers will provide this information for all of their gloves., Hairnets and gloves are a good start, but they aren’t sufficient to keep a cleanroom clean. The most common way that people contaminate their environment is by leaving behind skin flakes. Skin flakes are small particles of skin that are shed from your body everyday. To combat these tiny contaminants, your torso, arms, and legs must be contained in coveralls. The coveralls also protect your body from the materials in the cleanroom., Before entering a cleanroom, you will need to be covered from head to toe ― literally. Boots are an important part of your clean room suit. They cover your shoes to prevent particles coming off of the bottom of your shoes and being left in the cleanroom. Even if these particles are left on the floor, they can be stirred up and wind up contaminating the cleanroom workspace., The pre-changing area, otherwise known as changing room 1, will be your first stop before entering the cleanroom. Before entering changing room one, you should remove all makeup, jewelry, and electronics. You should also wear a hair cover and indoor shows into changing room 1.Make sure that you have kept up with personal hygiene. You should have showered approximately six hours before entering changing room 1.

, As you enter changing room 1, there will be a sticky mat. This mat is used to trap the particles on the bottoms of your shoes and ensure that as few as possible are brought into the changing room. You should only be wearing inside shoes into the changing room., Once in changing room one, you can remove any clothing that you will not be wearing under your cleansuit. This helps to minimize contamination carried into changing room 2. These clothes are left in changing room 1 and are not carried into changing room 2., Use the washing liquid provided in changing room 1 to wash your hands. Afterword, you can dry them with a paper towel. Finish this step by disinfecting your hands with the disinfectant provided in changing room 1. You are now ready to move onto changing room 2., Gloves will be individually wrapped in plastic. Do not tear the plastic wrapper. Instead, use the scissors provided to cut the wrapper where indicated. Put the gloves on your hands., The passover bench separates the “dirty” side of the changing room from the “clean side.” Disinfect this bench before proceeding. Then, lay the overalls and boots on the passover bench until you are ready to put them on.Note that the overalls and boots will also be in individually wrapped plastic bags.

, Your facemask will protect your face from any pathogens or dangerous chemicals in the room. Likewise, it will be one more layer of protection to prevent your body from contaminating the cleanroom. Remove the mask from its packaging and tie it on. Take care to only touch the straps, and if necessary, the nosepiece.Once the mask is tied, disinfect your gloves.
Use the scissors to open the packaging.

, Your hood will be in separate packaging from the mask. Remove it from the packaging and put it on. You should only touch the lower fringe of the hood and the straps when putting it on.Use the scissors to open the packaging, and disinfect your gloves once you finish putting on the hood.

, Touch only the waist, the legs, and the cuffs of the overalls to remove them from the packaging. Put on the overalls, but do not allow them to touch any surface (including the floor). Also, avoid contact between the outside of the overalls and your body, this contact will lead to contamination.Disinfect your gloves after completing this step.
Once the overalls are on, the cuff of the gloves should go overtop of the cuff of the overalls.

, The last thing you will put on is your boots. For this step, you will use the crossover bench as a barrier. Slide one boot on, making sure that it only touches the floor on the clean side of the room (your other foot should still be on the dirty side of the bench). Next, slide the other boot on ensuring that the second boot only touches the floor on the clean side of the room. At this point, you cannot go back to the dirty side of the room.Again, disinfect your gloves.

, Once you have finished putting on your cleanroom suit, examine the suit for any tears. The changing room should have a mirror that you can use to see your entire suit and ensure that it has been donned properly and is intact. If the suit is correct and intact, you may enter the cleanroom."

Add about ½ pound (226 g) of food per day for each 1000 worms.,
Harvest your vermicompost after about six months.",How to Prepare Vermicompost," Worm bins are premade vermicompost containers. Many gardening or organic supply stores sell them. If you don’t buy a worm bin, buy a 20 gallon storage container from the store. Make sure it’s opaque so light won’t get in.This container holds the bedding, food scraps, and worms. It also regulates the amount of moisture in the bedding and blocks light.
Make sure that whichever container you buy has a lid. Otherwise, you’ll have to improvise and cover it with black plastic, like a trash bag.;
, If you buy a premade worm bin, it may have air holes already. If you buy a storage container, use a power drill to cut ½ inch (1.27 cm) holes in the bottom, sides, and lid of the bin. Drill about 20 holes in the bin.Drill five holes each in the lid and the bottom, and at least three holes on each side of the bin.
The worms won't leave through these holes because of their aversion to light, but you can cover the holes with wire screen or mesh if you want.

, Get two cinderblocks, two chunks of 4x4 wood, or something else that will keep the bin off the ground. Lay out a large sheet of plastic in the part of your house where you want the worm bin. Put the blocks on the plastic and put the bin on the blocks., The best types of worms to use in a vermicomposting operation are red wigglers, or ‘’Eisenia Foetida’’. African earthworms, or Eudrillus engenial, and composting worms, or Peronyx excavatus are also good options.Call local organic-gardening or other garden stores to see if they sell worms. If not, research online. You’ll find many companies or individuals to order worms from.
Worms are generally sold by the pound, and one pound tends to be around 1000 worms. 1000 worms is generally enough to start with.

, Worms need bedding that retains moisture well, so newspaper and cardboard are ideal. Tear the newspaper into long, 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide strips. Shred cardboard into similar sized strips. Shred enough to fill the bin about eight inches (20.3 cm) high.Paper from a phone book also works well. Don’t use glossy paper or paper with ink other than the ink used for newsprint. It may be harmful for the worms.
Toilet paper or paper towel rolls and cardboard egg cartons work great, too.

, Your worms need moisture to live and breath, so it’s important for the bedding to be wet before you add the worms later on. Soak the bedding after you shred it or spray it down after it’s in the bin. Make sure that all of the bedding is completely wet.It may work best to shred the bedding and then soak it in water in a separate container for 15 minutes or so. It’s better for it to be slightly too wet than too dry.
Don’t wet the bedding until you are ready to fully construct your worm bin. Otherwise, it may dry out and need to be wet again.

, When water has soaked into the bedding, spread it evenly across the bottom of the bin. The bedding should fill at least the bottom eight inches (20 cm) or so of the bin, so that there is enough room for the worms to settle in. Fluff it up as you spread it around., Since worms naturally live in the soil, they’ll feel more at home in your vermicompost bin if you add some soil. Get a shovelful or so from outside, or purchase some dirt from the garden store. Spread it as an even layer across the bedding.Soil is necessary because it adds grit to the worms diet which helps them digest the food better.
If the soil is dry, be sure to soak it completely with water before adding it to the bin.

, Save about one pound (.45 kg) of food scraps and spread it across the soil. The best food scraps to use are peels, rinds, cores, leaves, and seeds from fruits and vegetables. Crushed eggshells, tea bags, and coffee grounds also work well.It’s especially important to avoid adding meat or bones and any type of dairy product. Also avoid bread and excessive amounts of citrus.
Research what is good for vermicompost before you put it in the bin. If you have something you want to add but you aren’t sure, check before you add it.

, Worms typically eat food that has already broken down quite a bit. For this reason, it’s helpful to let the food decompose in the worm bin for a little bit before you add the worms. Three days is a minimum, but don’t wait longer than two weeks to add the worms.

If you’re worried about the smell, set the bin outside for this initial decomposing period. Once the worms are in the bin, they help keep the smell down.

, Open the lid of the worm bin and spread a hole in the middle of the bedding. Pour the worms into this hole, rather than across the top. The worms will feel more at home this way, like they are partly underground.If this feels like they are too cramped, make two holes in the bedding and put about half of the worms into each hole.

, Vermicomposting is not always an exact science. Generally, 1000 worms can compost ½ pound (226 g) per day. If you know your family will create more waste than that, add more worms to the bin.If you produce more food on some days, save the food scraps and add them later so that it averages out to about four pounds (1.8 kg) total for the whole week.
These worms reproduce in the worm bin, so you’ll eventually have more than 1000 anyway. However, the rate of reproduction is inconsistent and you can’t count the worms very easily.

, Check the bin weekly to see how much bedding is left. When all of the bedding has been converted to compost, it’s harvest time. Push it all to one side, then add new wet bedding. Slowly scoop out the compost but leave the worms in the bin.


Again, this is not an exact figure. You may have some compost ready after two or three months.
If you want, harvest the compost a little bit at a time rather than taking it all out at once.

Add boiling water to a beaker or other container.,
Fill a balloon with air.,
Wrap a string around the widest part of the balloon.,
Place the balloon in the container.,
Watch as the balloon gets larger.,
Move the balloon to the freezer.,
Observe the size of the balloon.",How to Demonstrate Charles's Law1," You should leave room to put a balloon in the container as well. Adding about 100 mL of water to a 1000 mL (1 L) beaker will work in most cases. Avoid spilling the water on yourself or anyone else to avoid injury., Blow into the balloon with your mouth, or use a pump to fill it. Do not overfill the balloon ― you want to leave room for the gas inside to expand. It is best to use a party balloon instead of a water balloon. This decreases the chance that the balloon will pop. If you plan to put the balloon into the container, do not blow it up so large that it will not fit in the opening.

, By wrapping a piece of string around the balloon, you can get an accurate measurement of how big the balloon is in the beginning. Either mark or cut the string at at the widest part of the balloon. Remove the string from the balloon and measure it with a ruler. This measurement is the original circumference of your balloon. You will want to compare this to the size of the balloon once the air inside heats up., This will allow heat from the water to transfer to the air inside the balloon. If the balloon does not fit inside the container, another option is to put it on top of the container. The heat transfer may be a little less efficient, but it will still have the same effect on the balloon.

, The increase in temperature will force the air to increase its volume, thus expanding the balloon. It will look like the balloon is growing or inflating inside the container. Use another piece of string to measure the circumference of the balloon when heated. Now, you can compare it to the original circumference.


Do not let the balloon expand too much, as this may cause it to pop.

, Now that you have added heat to expand the balloon, removing the heat will allow the balloon to deflate. To observe this, you will need to move the balloon from the heat source (your container of boiling water) and into a cold environment. You should leave the balloon in the freezer for at least a couple of hours before removing it., When you remove the balloon from the freezer, immediately measure the circumference with a third piece of string. This way, you can compare it to your first two measurements. It should not only be smaller than it was in the warm container, but should be even smaller than it was when you first inflated it. This is because you removed heat from the gas inside the balloon, which forced the gas (and in turn the balloon) to decrease in volume."

Add a small amount of water to an Erlenmeyer flask.,
Place the flask on a hot plate or burner.,
Put the open end of a balloon over the opening of the flask.,
Observe the expansion of the balloon.,
Move the flask to an ice bath.,
Observe the suction on the balloon.",How to Demonstrate Charles's Law2," You do not need to fill the flask. The less water you add, the faster you will be able to bring it to a boil. However, make sure that you do add enough water so that you don’t boil it off too quickly. About 75 mL should do nicely.

, This will serve as a heat source for your water. Make sure you heat the water to the boiling point. This will force air to expand out of the top of the flask and also generate water vapor to fill the balloon., Remember that the flask is being heated. You should use gloves to avoid burning your hands as you secure the balloon over the opening of the flask. Make sure that the balloon is far enough down on the neck of the flask that it does not pop off easily.It may be easier and safer to put the balloon on the flask before heating the water.

, Securing the balloon over the top of the flask will create a seal and only allow the air to expand into the balloon. This expansion of air into the balloon will cause the balloon itself to expand. Do not let the balloon get so large that it pops., To prepare the ice bath just put water and ice into a container. This is a very easy and fast way to cool the contents of the flask. Use gloves to transfer the flask from the heat source to the ice bath., The rapid cooling of the gas inside of the flask and balloon will cause the volume of the gas to decrease. As the volume decreases, the volume of the balloon will also decrease, causing it to shrink. As the gas cools even more and contracts even more, the volume of the gas shrinks so much that the pressure outside the flask pushes the balloon completely inside the flask."

Consider the relationships at play between ideal gas properties.,
Make sure that your units are correct.,
Use k to construct your equation.,
Solve the equation for the unknown variable.",How to Demonstrate Charles's Law3," It was shown by Jacques Charles and then later by Joseph Gay-Lussac that the temperature of a gas is directly related to the volume when pressure and mass of the gas remain constant. This means that, for a given gas, the volume of the gas divided by the temperature of the gas will yield the same number for each volume-temperature combination., Volume should be measured in liters. Temperature should be measured in Kelvin. If your values are in different units, you should use dimensional analysis to convert them to the correct units before proceeding. Otherwise, your calculations will not be correct., The initial volume (V1) of a gas divided by the initial temperature (T1) of that gas is equal to some constant, k. If the volume or temperature of that gas is altered, both values will change such that the new volume (V2) divided by the new temperature (T2) will also be equal to the same constant, k. Since V1/T1=k and V2/T2=k, V1/T1=V2/T2., When given a problem to solve, you will be provided some of the measurements and asked to calculate a missing piece of the equation. Scan the problem for all given values and place them in the appropriate part of the equation. Once you have all known values in your equation, just rearrange the equation so that your unknown value is alone, and then do the arithmetic. You will have used Charles’s Law to solve your problem."

, Plan to plant reforestation trees at a 8 x 8-foot spacing. This would mean that you would need 681 reforestation seedlings per acre.


If finances allow, order containerized seedlings instead of bare root seedlings. Studies show that containerized trees used for reforestation projects grow better than bare root seedlings. Containerized seedlings also have less culls (seedlings unsuitable for planting) than bare root seedlings.

, Trees planted for reforestation stress less and get a better start in the spring when planted in the fall. Planting too late in the spring will subject the seedlings to summer's hot weather before they have a chance to establish a solid root system.

, This will remove the low-quality trees and brush that may have been left during harvesting and may compete with the new seedlings. Push these woody leavings into windrows between the rows where the reforestation seedlings are to be planted.


You may choose to burn, mulch, or chop this debris as well.

, These specialized reforestation tools dig a hole deep enough for the seedling's roots and are designed to make reforestation planting go faster.


Power augers are motor-driven hole-diggers that are to be used by 1 to 2 people. However, they are heavy and may be difficult to use for the inexperienced planter.
Planting bars and dibbles are specialized tools dig the seedling's hole in 1 step. Place 1 foot (0.3 m) on the step, drive the tool into the soil, and then push it away from you to make a wedge-shaped hole for the seedling.
Hoedads are L-shaped tools with curved or straight blades.

, These are specialized canvas bags that allow planters to haul hundreds of seedlings at a time.

,, Do not allow the roots to curl back up and form a J-shape.

, Make sure all the air pockets are removed around the seedling's roots.

, These pieces of plastic or wire tubing will discourage deer from nibbling on the tender seedlings and increase their survival rate.

Enjoy caring for tardigrades.",How to Find and Care for a Pet Tardigrade (Water Bear)," These critters may be microscopic, but they are very cool! Tardigrades, also called water bears, are some of the most amazing animals on Earth, and live just about everywhere you can imagine. They can survive:Temperatures as low as -200 °C (-328 °F) and as high as 151 °C (304 °F)
Freezing in a block of ice
Lack of oxygen for days, possibly months
Lack of water for decades
Levels of X-ray radiation 1,000 times the lethal human dose
Many noxious chemicals
Boiling alcohol
Low pressure of a vacuum, like that of space
Extreme pressure, up to six times greater than found at the deepest part of the ocean;
, Many tardigrades are aquatic, but the easiest place for humans to find them is in damp moss, lichen, or leaf litter. Search in forests, around ponds, or even in your backyard. Your best bet is to look in damp places, where tardigrades are active. You can get a sample of dry habitat if nothing else is available, since it may contain tardigrades in an extreme hibernation state (cryptobiosis), waiting for water to rejuvenate them., Put the sample in a paper bag or envelope so it can dry out a little. (A plastic bag will trap the water and encourage mold to grow, which will block your view of the animals.)You can take samples of several different kinds of moss, lichen, or leaf litter to see whether tardigrades like one more than another.
Soft lichen is more likely to have tardigrades than hard, crusty lichen. You can even find water bears in the powdery lichen that grows on rocks and brick walls.

, You only need a tiny pinch of the material in each petri dish. If you don't have a petri dish, you can use any small, clear plastic container. Blister packs that used to hold pills are a good option., Add water, preferably distilled or rainwater, until there is one centimeter in the petri dish. Let soak for 8 to 24 hours, to make the water bears active., Squeezing or shaking their habitat will release the microscopic creatures into the water.

, Most tardigrades are about a quarter to a half millimeter long. That's almost at the range of human sight, a little smaller than a period.It only takes a microscope with about 15x or 30x magnification to spot one.If you don't have one, look for a cheap stereo microscope online., Set the microscope up over the petri dish and focus it on the moss. It helps to shine a powerful flashlight horizontally, through the side of the petri dish. This will make the tardigrades and other creatures glow white.Look for an animal with four pairs of stubby legs, waving and grasping in slow motion to move its blobby body.The last pair of legs faces backward, so you might mistake it for a tail or the end of its body.


If there is a water bear, you've struck the jackpot. Pour the water back to the moss to set up a home for it.
If you don't see any after moving the petri dish around for a while, replace the water and try again with a different piece of moss until you find one.

, Water bears suck out juices from moss, algae, and lichen to feed.Put a bit of plant matter in once a month, or replace the old stuff if it starts to turn moldy or decompose.


Water Bears also eat nematodes, little worm-shaped creatures, and rotifers, tiny plankton. Try to find nice, wet moss for the Water Bears as that is most likely to contain their prey.
Some tardigrades live in freshwater and others live in saltwater. Stick to water and plants from the same type of environment where you collected your tardigrades.

, Tardigrades will usually survive in a dry state, but it's not guaranteed. Be nice to your water bears and keep them wet.


Dried out tardigrades are smaller and completely immobile. You might not be able to spot them, but you'll see them again if you give them a good soak.

, They won't mind if you look at them under the microscope once in a while. If you're lucky, you might see them shedding their hard outer cuticle, laying eggs, or hatching."

Close your eyes.,
Wet your finger.,
Turn your head.,
Listen to the wind.",How to Determine Wind Direction1," You want to be more in tune to your other senses, especially your sense of touch. Closing your eyes eliminates the visual messages coming to your brain and allows you to focus fully on your other senses. This way, you will be able to concentrate on feeling the wind with your skin., Stick your index finger down in water to get it wet. Hold your finger up and away from your body. The side of your finger that gets cool is the side that the wind is blowing from.If you put your finger in your mouth to get it wet (which works well when there is no water nearby), be sure that you get it wet all the way around.

, Turn to face the direction you think the wind is coming from. The skin on your face will be more sensitive to a light wind than somewhere like your hands. Keep turning until you feel that you are facing directly into the wind., If you are facing directly into the wind, it should sound the same in both ears. You can turn your head left to right and listen to the wind. Keep repositioning your body until the wind sounds the same in both sides."

Watch the ripples.,
Look out to a horizontal plane.,
Observe upwind and downwind.",How to Determine Wind Direction2," Look for a dark pool of water. Watch how the ripples flow over the water. These ripples are formed by the wind pushing the water and breaking its surface. The ripples will flow in the direction of the wind., As you are looking out over the water, find a horizontal (left to right) stretch of water that is roughly 15 yards (14 m) wide. Observing the direction of this strip is a more accurate representation of wind direction than watching individual ripples. The strip will travel the same direction that the wind is blowing., When detecting subtle variations in wind direction, such as on a sailboat, you should be looking forward and back. Watch how the wind is affecting the water in front of you by observing a horizontal stretch of ripples in front of you. Also, glance back behind you to see how the wind is behaving there. This allows you to observe changes in the wind directly rather than waiting for your boat to react.Whether you are looking forward or back, you will use the same technique of identifying a horizontal stretch and observing the ripples.

Tie tassels to an object.,
Make an anemometer.,
Hang a wind sock.,
Install a weather vane.",How to Determine Wind Direction3," Perhaps the simplest of all wind monitoring devices is a tassel or piece of string. Tie a lightweight string or tassel to an object and let it dangle. As the wind blows, the string or tassel will blow right along with it. The wind is blowing in the direction that the tassel points., You can make devices, such as an anemometer, to measure wind direction. These can be simple homemade devices, or complex precision tools. Either way, the anemometer cups the wind and spins, indicating both the direction and intensity of the wind., A wind sock is a device that has one large opening attached to a pole or base. The opening on the other end is much narrower. As the wind blows through the sock, it will turn to point in the direction that the wind is blowing., A weather vane is designed to point directly into the wind. One side of the weather vane will be a narrow, pointed end (usually resembling the tip of an arrow). The other end is made wider to catch the wind. As the wind blows, you can see the arrow point directly into the wind. You must put the weather vane on a sturdy base or pole."

Decide what sort of trees will be part of the Great Tree Hunt.,
Decide how you will divide up the challenge.,
Decide how much time to give the participants.,
Put the challenge together.,
Ask participants to record their findings in a record book or online.,
Award the participants.,
Share the findings.",How to Go on a Great Tree Hunt," This will involve those creating the hunt (teacher, parent, guardian, club leader etc.) knowing what sort of trees are in the community and perhaps even going for a walk or cycle around the area to find good specimens for the Great Tree Hunt. All of the trees must be in walking or cycling distance from your ""headquarters"" and perhaps even closer if you need to keep a close eye on those participating. Alternatively, an adult can accompany each group, team or individual undertaking the Great Tree Hunt.;
, If it is a class, then groups are probably viable. If it is a club, perhaps pairs and if it is a home exercise, it might be best done as a family exercise. It could also be done as an individual challenge. The method of dividing up the Great Tree Hunt is really up to your requirements and resources.

, This will also determine the length and complexity of the challenge. If you are holding a club-meet, you might want to finish the challenge in a few hours or a day. If it is a class exercise, you might ask teams to complete it over a week or so. At home, you might spend an afternoon one weekend, or perhaps several weekends in a row. Again, it all depends on your availability and resources, along with the ease of reaching the trees in your community.

, Prepare a list of questions that will have to be answered by the participants. Questions could be along the lines of:


What is the oldest tree in your community?
What is the tallest tree in your community?
Is there a tree of historical significance? What is this significance?
What is the widest tree?
What is the biggest tree? (Note that this should be a combination of tall and big, separate from the tallest/widest categories)
What is the sweetest scented tree?
Which dead tree is the home to many animals?
Which live tree is the home to many animals?
Where is the largest stand of trees in your community?

, You might even consider setting up a wiki program private to your participants so that they can share their findings and ideas. Encourage all of the participants to explain their findings, not just provide one line answers. For example, when they find a dead tree filled with life, ask them to elaborate on why dead trees are important to the continued preservation of other lives in the ecosystem.

, The way in which you do this will again depend on the motivations for undertaking the Great Tree Hunt. If it is a class project, the students might get marks as a team; marks for findings, marks for writing up the project, marks for team work etc. If it is at home, you might provide gold stars and perhaps present the children with a tree of their own to plant in the backyard. For a club, consider having a speech from each team at the end to summarise the findings and award prizes based on the most illustrative and interesting findings.

, It can be a really good idea to share your findings with the wider community after the project is completed. It is likely that there will be numerous community members interested in the findings. The participants might consider holding an open information night for the community, or producing a recycled pamphlet summarizing the findings and distributing it in local libraries, councils, schools etc. And if your teams created a wiki, open it up to the public to add their information as well!

Lead by example.,
Participate in outdoor activities together.,
Foster nature in your own backyard.,
Share nature with other kids and families.",How to Get Children Interested in Conservation1," It doesn’t hurt to tell your kids how important the environment is, but this verbal assurance will carry a lot less clout than practicing your values and acting as an example for them. Indeed, studies have shown that having a parent or other adult role model who shows a vested interested in the outdoors can greatly predispose a child to interest and engagement in the environment.For example, show them how much you love nature activities like hiking, bird-watching, or gardening by allotting time to these activities in your daily life.;
, Instilling love for the environment in your children is easiest if you teach them to enjoy and appreciate it from an early age. This can be difficult in modern conditions as children have less contact with the natural world around them, but studies have shown that it’s important to make time and opportunities for them to connect with nature.Show them not just how beautiful the natural landscape is, but how enjoyable it is to do different activities within it.


Activities like hiking, beach strolls, rock climbing, camping, mountain biking, and skiing are great ways to show your kids how exhilarating and diverse nature can be. Keep your nature trips fun and educational by having them look for signs of wildlife on the trail or organizing a scavenger hunt.If you don’t live nearby any mountains, oceans, or other beautiful natural attractions, fret not! You can still take your kids to the local park, community garden, or reservoir. The wildlife probably won’t be as populous or varied, but you can still find lots of beautiful animals and vegetation to get your kids interested.

, Teach your children the value of conservation by making your own little patch of property into a miniature nature preserve. You’ll show them how important it is to be proactive as a conservationist, and you’ll also get to spend valuable time together doing constructive, cooperative activities.


You can encourage and nurture local wildlife by setting up feeders for birds, squirrels, and butterflies. Your backyard will also become more inviting to wildlife if you make room in your backyard for natural shelters like caves and rock piles.Planting evergreens, dense shrubs, and other vegetation native to the area will show your kids how important plant life is to the environment, while also providing food and shelter to local wildlife., Studies have shown that kids learn to love and connect with nature much more easily when they do so with other peers.This is because they naturally explore and learn through social engagements and playing, so the more opportunities you give them to connect with nature while bonding with other kids, the more chance you have of them developing a lasting interest in the environment.


Official groups and organizations like the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts can be a good way to do this, but you can also take informal measures, such as going on camping trips with other families.

Find a laboratory that tests soil.,
Collect soil samples for the test.,
Hire an environmental consultant to conduct testing.,
Decide if the likelihood of contamination justifies testing.,
Look for previous soil tests conducted on the property.,
Follow all recommendations for any elevated toxin levels.,
Identify the most likely soil toxins.,
Recognize the risks of toxic exposure.,
Take practical safety measures.,
Be cautious but don’t panic.",How to Know if There Are Toxins in Local Soil," Doing some detective work about a property’s history, past uses, and proximity to current or former sources of contaminants can give you a good idea about whether there are excess levels of toxins in the soil. If you need to be certain, though, soil testing done in a laboratory is the gold standard.Contact your local or state department of environmental resources (or similar government entity) for a list of laboratories that conduct soil testing.
You will normally receive the results of the testing within two to three weeks.;
, The actual soil collection component of the process is not all that complicated, and can actually be turned into a science experiment for teens.However, proper testing does require that soil samples be taken from a number of locations on a property, and be done carefully and according to plan in order to ensure the most accurate results.Identify areas of the land in question that are low-use (like an overgrown hillside) and high-use (such as where children play or where you garden). Sketch and label a simple map of the property if that helps.
Regardless of the size of the property, collect at least four samples from each high-use area and at least four samples total from low-use areas.
Remove all grass and rocks from the testing area. Dig a small hole six inches (15 cm) deep in the soil. Scrape the sides of the hole with a spoon and fill a small glass jar or small zip-close bag with the soil. Clean the spoon before using it to collect another sample. Fill the hole back in.
Label each sample jar or bag with your name, the collection date, what you want tested (lead and arsenic, for example), and the location within the property (""near the swing set,"" for instance). Keep samples in a cool, dry place until they can be delivered to the lab. Refrigerate them if it will take more than a week to get them to the lab.
You can save money by mixing all samples from low-use areas into a single composite sample, but always keep samples from high-use areas separate.

, If you feel more comfortable letting the pros handle the entire process, you can hire an environmental consultant to evaluate the piece of land in question and collect samples for testing as needed. If a site’s history or location makes soil contamination very likely and possibly very dangerous, you should perhaps be even more inclined to hire professionals to collect and test samples.Unless you absolutely need to know for sure, soil testing may not be warranted for a property based on a low likelihood of dangerous contamination. (After all, it costs money, and sometimes a good bit of money, to do proper testing.) A good environmental consulting firm should be willing and able to tell you whether or not soil testing is advisable.

, If you remain unsure as to whether to conduct soil testing, consider using the following checklist to help make up your mind. The more factors that apply to your property, the more important testing becomes. Determine if the property:has or once had on it any buildings painted before 1978 (when lead paint was banned in the U.S.).
has or had pesticides or fertilizers used on it regularly.
is on or near a current or former industrial site.
is near a high-traffic roadway (where lead concentrations from now-banned leaded gasoline are often still high).
has older pressure treated lumber (which once contained arsenic) on it.
has a history of petroleum spills on it or near it.
has been used as an auto repair garage or junkyard.
has been a site for furniture refinishing operations.
is built on a landfill or is near one.
has had any structure fires (which can release toxins) occur on it.

, If you do not have the option of testing the soil (due to cost, for instance, or because the property in question is not yours to test), investigating a property’s history can turn up many useful clues. Beyond helping you determine the overall likelihood of contamination, a search of old property records and files may turn up prior tests conducted on the land in question.Many U.S. states — including New York, to name an example — require disclosure of prior environmental testing (including soil tests) whenever a property is sold. Before buying a property, sift through the mountain of papers you receive for any such prior test results., If you do decide to have soil testing done, make sure you know what to do with the results. Especially if the results come without recommendations, you should consider employing the services of a professional consultant to interpret the findings and help plot out your recommended response.


For example, if you have test results for lead, which is the most common cause of heavy metals poisoning via soil, know what is recommended if your results come back at 50 parts per million or 500 ppm. , When you think of soil toxins, you might envision toxic chemicals that have leached into the soil from pesticides or illegal waste dumping. In most cases, however, the most likely toxic substances you’ll find in your local soil are heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, iron, lead, chromium, copper, zinc, nickel, and mercury. Such heavy metals occur naturally in soil, but human activity is usually to blame whenever they are found in potentially dangerous concentrations.Among the heavy metals, lead is the most common soil-based cause of human poisoning. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers a soil concentration of 400 parts per million (ppm) or more to be hazardous. Arsenic is also a common problem.
While heavy metal toxins like lead have spread widely and can appear in worrisome concentrations just about anywhere, other toxins are usually dependent upon the current or prior uses of the soil — such as for agriculture, mining, waste disposal, or manufacturing., Every toxin is different, and has different impacts upon the human body. Practically all of them, however, are more dangerous to children, because kids are smaller (which makes internal toxin concentrations higher) and they are more likely to ingest soil (intentionally or not).If you are concerned about a particular toxin, research it and find out how it enters and impacts the human body. Lead, for instance, when ingested in excessive amounts, accumulates in the soft tissues of the body (such as your internal organs) and eventually in bones and teeth. Excessive lead accumulation can negatively impact the nervous system, kidneys and other organs, and brain development in children, among other problems., Generally speaking, most soil toxins are only a concern if you disturb the soil in question — by planting a garden, for instance. Common heavy metal toxins lead and arsenic don’t get absorbed into the vegetables you plan to eat, but they can “hitch a ride” with the dirt on the plants and on your hands, shoes, clothing, etc., and eventually into your mouth.Lead concentrations tend to be highest near building foundations (due to lead paint) and heavily-traveled roads (due to leaded gasoline), so avoid planting gardens or letting children or pets dig in those areas.
Soil toxins can be inhaled along with dirt particles, but are usually ingested. For your protection (and especially for the protection of children): wash food plants or flowers thoroughly before bringing them inside; wash dirt off shoes, clothing, toys, and hands and faces regularly; dampen dusty patches of soil before gardening or playing there, and cover bare patches of dirt with grass, plants, or clean soil; and consider using raised planting beds with clean soil for gardening., Reading about the prevalence of soil toxins may tempt you to keep your kids and dog inside, but there is no need to overreact. When practical measures (like cleaning dirt off things before they come inside and steering clear of areas that are more likely to have higher concentrations of toxins) are taken, the likelihood of negative health consequences is typically low.


For instance, it is generally considered safe to grow food in soil with a lead concentration of 300 ppm (75% of the EPA limit), as long as the dirt is thoroughly cleaned off everything.Or, if you are wary of composting out of fear of introducing pesticides or fungicides that are in your food scraps, know that the benefits far outweigh the minimal risks of adding dangerous amounts of such toxins to your soil.If you need to be sure for your peace of mind, have the soil tested.

Show your children how you practice conservation in your own life.,
Donate money and join advocacy groups.,
Teach children that they are custodians of the natural world.,
Encourage political action.",How to Get Children Interested in Conservation2," Your children will notice and mirror your behavior and values, so you should make it clear that you are environmentally conscientious and take steps in your daily life to contribute to conservation efforts. Show them how you sort and recycle all disposable household materials, pick up litter when out at the park or on walks in the neighborhood, save electricity and water in the household, and sign petitions for wildlife or environmental groups when out and about.


If you begin a recycling initiative at work or volunteer for a political action group, make sure your kids know about this activity. It will provide a good example of civic responsibility for them, and maybe even inspire them to take similar initiative at school.

, In addition to showing your kids daily recycling and conservation habits, you should also let them see you do “adult” things like donating money to philanthropic organizations, as well as joining advocacy groups like the Audubon Society and the Nature Conservancy. This will show them how you incorporate your love of nature and sense of responsibility into your adult life, and, consequently, how important it is to support good charities through monetary donations.


You can even involve your kids in this donation by using various charity websites which make it easier for children to participate in the giving process., While you are teaching your kids to love and enjoy nature, you should also teach them that they are responsible for taking care of the nature they are enjoying. By telling them they are expected to pitch in and help conserve the environment, you are helping them understand the impact of their actions and developing their sense of ethics.You can start teaching this lesson with small actions of daily responsibility. For example, make sure they throw away their trash when outdoors, sort their recyclable containers into the appropriate bin, and put out water and food for the bird and wildlife feeders.When camping, you should make sure you show your kids how to be an accountable outdoorsman. Review proper campfire safety procedures and the importance of not disturbing the wildlife., Get educated with your child about current legislation affecting the environment, and then teach your child how ordinary citizens can influence this legislative process. Have your kids write letters to a Senator, Mayor, Governor other representative, or show them how to sign petitions or attend conservation protests. This teaches the child to be active in the political process and feel they can affect large-scale change.


If your children are a bit older, you can have them volunteer with you for various conservation organizations, community gardens, or wildlife preserves.It can be a good idea to get your kids involved in a mixture of fun projects and those which are not so glamorous: for example, have them volunteer for animal shelters, as well as for park and highway litter cleanup.

Introduce conservation concerns in a fun and interactive way.,
Explain problems in manageable and concrete terms.,
Encourage problem solving.,
Give kids active, community-building projects.,
Discuss examples of positive change.,
Get creative.",How to Get Children Interested in Conservation3," Kids are more likely to get interested in tasks and projects at school if you present the information in a fun and engaging way. Of course, field trips are great for getting kids excited, but you don’t have to rely on extracurricular or out-of-the-classroom activities to attract and involve your kids in conservation.


Children as young as preschool age can start getting engaged with nature and conservation in the classroom. For example, have the kids collect and bring in natural artifacts like bark, leaves, rocks, and feathers. Construct a communal nature wall with these objects, creating a piece of art in the room which everyone can touch and discuss.You can ‘hook’ older children on conservation issues by sponsoring a whale or other endangered animal. This lets kids get excited about the exotic animal, as well as feel like they can make concrete change, even from the remote position of your classroom., Since children have limited world experience, they are often easily overwhelmed or find it difficult to connect new information to their daily lives. You can address this challenge by breaking information into smaller chunks and couching them in accessible language which is relevant to daily life.For example, don’t say, ""Birds all over the world are endangered.” Not only is this language elevated, but the generalization of the statement makes it sound abstract and overwhelming to a child. Say instead, ""Lots of birds lose their nests when people cut down lots of trees.” This allows kids to picture flesh-and-blood birds and imagine the problem as a simple and understandable scenario.

, Instead of presenting a solution, explain to the child what is going on, and ask them to think of a solution. For example, ask the kids the following question: ""Humans need to build houses, but animals also need that space for their homes. How do you think we could work this out?""


Small group activities can be particularly helpful for this kind of problem solving.Assign each small group the task of coming up with a solution to the conservation problem which has been posed. The members of the group can work together to brainstorm and propose a resolution, and then present their ideas to the other small groups in the classroom.
Be sure to present both sides of the issues in order to encourage complex thinking and understanding. For example if you’re assigning a problem-solving activity regarding oceanic life and overfishing, say something like, ""Overfishing is bad, because it kills off lots of species. But fishermen work very hard and need those fish to feed their families.""

, Kids should learn about being a good member and contributor to society at home, but they should also get involved at school. Have your class get involved in projects like gardening and planting trees, and assign in-class tasks like science fair projects about saving water and electricity.


Consider giving extra credit for ecologically-minded practices like riding bikes to school or organizing a recycling collection.

, While it's important to let children know how urgent conservation issues are, you don't want them to feel hopeless, discouraged, or impotent. In order to make them feel empowered and eager to tackle the problems you're discussing in class, take the time to include examples of successful change in your lessons.


For example, bring up the multiple species which have been taken off the Endangered Species Act since 1978 due to successful conservation measures.Outline the specific measures that were taken, and discuss how or why these remedial actions proved effective.

, While it might seem like science and social studies are the disciplines most suited to teaching environmental awareness, don’t limit your classroom learning about conservation to these subjects. In fact, studies have shown that artistic and creative approaches to learning about and connecting with nature can be extremely effective.Think about using a variety of art and creative resources and activities. Have students view paintings of natural landscapes and wildlife, and ask them to process their feelings about the visual art. You can also use literature to introduce them to and educate them about nature.
Don’t just have your kids read or look at literature and art; have them make their own! Get your classroom to write their own plays and stories or paint their own pictures. This helps them imagine themselves as active participants in the situations and problems you’re talking about, as well as to link their own lives to these situations."

If you live alone, then add 14 points to your carbon footprint.
If you share a house or apartment with one other person, then add 12 points.
If you share a house or apartment with two people, then add 10 points.
If you share a house or apartment with three people, then add 8 points.
If you share a house or apartment with four people, then add 6 points.
If you share a house or apartment with five people, then add 4 points.
If you share a house or apartment with more than five people, then add 2 points.;
, A smaller home makes a smaller impact on the environment. Take the size of your home into account as you calculate your impact.If you have a large house, then add 10 points to your score.
If you have a medium sized house, then add 7 points.
If you have a small house, then add 4 points.
If you live in an apartment, then add 2 points.

, The types of food that you eat can also have an effect on your carbon footprint. You will have a higher carbon footprint if you eat meat regularly, and you will have a lower carbon footprint if you eat no meat or animal products at all.If you eat meat on a daily basis, then add 10 points.
If you eat meat a few times per week, then add 8 points.
If you are a vegetarian, then add 4 points.
If you are a vegan, then add 2 points.
You would also add 12 points if most of the food you eat is prepackaged convenience food, such as frozen pizza, cereal, and potato chips. If you have a good balance of fresh and convenience food, then just add 6 points. If you only eat fresh, locally grown food, then add 2 points.

, Your water consumption from appliances is also important to consider as you calculate your carbon footprint. Consider how many times per week you run your dishwasher and/or washing machine.If you run your dishwasher or washing machine more than 9 times per week, then add 3 points. If you run it 4 to 9 times, ten add 2 points. If you run it 1 to 3 times, then add 1 point. If you don’t have a dishwasher, then add nothing.
If you have a dishwasher and a washing machine, then perform the calculation twice.

, The amount of new items that you buy for your household can also affect your carbon footprint. If you buy lots of new things, then your score will be higher than someone who does not buy anything or who only buys secondhand items.If you buy more than 7 new pieces of furniture, electronics, or other household gadgets per year, then add 10 points.
If you purchase between 5 and 7 items, then give yourself 8 points.
If you purchase between 3 and 5 items, then give yourself 6 points.
If you purchase less than 3 items, then give yourself 4 points.
If you purchase almost nothing or only secondhand items, then give yourself 2 points.

, The more trash cans you fill each week, the larger your carbon foot print will be. Count up how many times you fill your garbage cans each week and then assign points based on these numbers.If you fill four garbage cans each week, then add 50 points.
If you fill three garbage cans each week, then add 40 points.
If you fill two garbage cans per week, then add 30 points.
If you fill one garbage can per week, then add 20 points.
If you fill half of a garbage can or less per week, then add 5 points.

, If you do not recycle, then add 24 points to your score. However, if you do recycle, then start with 24 points and subtract 4 points for each type of item that you recycle. You can subtract four points for each of the following recycling categories:Glass
Plastic
Paper
Aluminum
Steel
Food waste (composting)

, You will also need to consider your travel, including how far you travel in a personal vehicle, how far you travel with public transportation, and how far you travel by plane for vacations.For your personal vehicle usage, add 12 points if you travel more than 15,000 miles. Add 10 points if you travel 10,000 to 15,000 miles. Add 6 points if you travel 1,000 to 10,000 miles. Add 4 points if you travel less than 1,000 miles. Add nothing if you don’t have a car.
For public transportation, add 12 points if you travel more than 20,000 miles. Add 10 points if you travel 15,000 to 20,000 miles. Add 6 points if you travel 10,000 to 15,000 miles. Add 4 points if you travel 1,000 to 10,000 miles. Add 2 points for less than 1,000 miles. Add nothing if you do not use public transportation.
For flights, add 2 points if you only travel short distances, such as within your state. Add 6 points if you travel further distances, such as to a nearby state or country. Add 20 points if you travel far, such as to another continent.

, After you have calculated your points for each category, add them up to get your carbon footprint score. The lower the score the better. If your score is less than 60 points, then you are making a small impact on your planet. If it is higher than 60, then you might want to look for some ways that you can reduce your impact.

Dump the contents of the tray back into the water.,
Rinse all of the equipment thoroughly.,
Wash your hands carefully.",How to Pond Dip," If you're buying a net for pond dipping, choose one with a pole that’s long enough to reach the water. If you have to lean too far over the water, you may lose your balance, and you don't want to fall in the water! Also make sure the net has small enough holes that things won’t slip right through the net.Your height may affect the length of pole you need. Make sure it is long enough that you can reach the water but not so long that it becomes hard to use.
For the best results, use a net that’s more like mesh than like a typical string net.;
, Bend a wire hanger into a circle. Attach a pair of pantyhose to the hanger with strong tape so that the opening of the pantyhose goes around the hanger frame. Tie the legs into a knot and cut them off below the knot. Attach a long pole to the hook of the hanger with strong tape.It may look a little silly, but it's a simple and effective net if you need one!

, When you scoop up specimens from the water, you’ll dump them into a tray to look at. Choose a shallow, wide tray for the best result. A white tray helps you see the creatures better. A small dark bucket would make it pretty hard to see anything.Find a container that fits your needs. It can be a wide mouth butter tub, or a plastic basin you’d wash dishes in. A shallow tray is easier to examine things in than a deep bucket-like container.

, Use a magnifying class to see the creatures more clearly. Look at a guide book to identify what you are seeing and learn more about ponds. You'll have more fun if you can really see what you're looking at and find out what it is.Look online or at your local library for pond-life guide books. Your local parks and recreation department may offer a guide designed for your local pond environment.

, Create a mini pond environment for your critters to swim around in while you look at them. Use the tray to scoop up some pond water and set it on a flat spot on the ground. This gives the specimens a place to move around while you observe them., Find a place at the edge of the water where you can easily reach the net in. If there is a dock, this is a great place because it is sturdy. Find vegetation because pond creatures love to swarm around plants. Look in the water and see where the most action is.Make sure that wherever you stand won’t cause you to slip and fall into the water.

, Don't thrust the net into the water quickly, or you'll scare the creatures away. That makes it hard to catch them! Make sure you don't scrape the bottom or you'll only pull out a bunch of mud., Move the net slowly through the water so you don’t stir up too much mud from the bottom. A figure-eight motion helps you catch creatures as they flee when they feel the water move. You want to get as many little pond friends as you can.Swirl the net in a figure-eight a few times. You’ll pick up some vegetation and pond-slime, which is okay. Within all of that, plenty of creatures will be hiding.

, After passing the net through the water, pull the net out. Make sure the opening faces up so you don’t lose anything from the net. Turn it over gently and dump the contents of the net out into your observation tray. Don't spill anything on the ground, or the creatures won't be too happy!Use the hand that’s not holding the net to dump it out, but make sure you don’t squeeze the net. It’s important to be gentle so you don’t squash anything that’s in the net.

, Grab a stick and gently spread the plants and slime out around the tray. Small pond creatures hide in the plant material. Be careful not to poke the plant matter too hard or you might smash something. Watch the critters begin to scurry out of the slime!, You’ll be able to see some of the specimens with your naked eye, but a magnifying glass gives you a closer look. Watch the small creatures swim around and observe the variations in the plant matter you picked up. Bet you didn't know one little net would catch so much!Use a plastic spoon to lift individual specimens out of the tray so you can look at them in an isolated environment.

, A colorful guide book tells you about all of the plants and animals in the water, but you could look things up on your phone too. See how many different things you can identify in the water., After you’ve spent some time looking at all the pond-life in your catch, return it all safely back into the water. Stand at the edge where you dipped and lower the tray all the way to the water. Gently pour the contents back into the pond.Be sure to walk carefully so you do not spill the tray. Any creatures you drop on the grass may die because they won’t have a way to get back to the water.

, If you have a clean water source, like a water spigot, nearby, rinse the net and tray completely. You also don’t want to transfer any bacteria from one pond to another if you pond dip in multiple locations. Some creatures wouldn't like germs from another pond.If you can’t clean the equipment onsite, wrap it in trash bags to transport it somewhere you can clean it all.

, Anytime you pond dip, make sure you wash yourself with hot water and soap. You may be grimy from touching things and pond water contains lots of bacteria that you don’t want to transfer around. This is especially important if you’ll be eating soon after pond dipping."

Add 5 to 12 tons CO2 emission if you own a car.,
Find your total fuel usage.,
Multiply your fuel gallons by a conversion factor.,
Check your monthly utility bills.,
Consider any offsets you have made.",How to Calculate Your Carbon Footprint2," Owning a car means that the car had to be manufactured and this adds to your carbon footprint. However, keep in mind that the total production footprint of your car is for the lifetime of your car. Therefore, the longer you drive it, the lower the impact will be over time. Start by adding between 5 and 12 tons of CO2 emissions depending on the size of your car.If you have a compact or economy sized car, then add 5 tons of CO2 emissions.
If you have a medium sized car, such as a sedan, then add 9 tons of CO2 emissions.
If you have a large vehicle, such as an SUV or truck, then add 12 tons of CO2 emissions.

, The amount that you drive your car each year can also have an effect on your carbon footprint. You will have a larger carbon footprint if you drive your car frequently. Check your vehicle’s mileage and miles per gallon and then plug these into a simple equation.Use the equation: total miles driven / miles per gallon = total fuel usage.
For example, 8,000 / 40 mpg = 200 gallons of fuel used

, To convert the total gallons of fuel you have used driving your car into CO2 emission, you will need to multiply the total by a conversion factor of 22.Use the equation total fuel used X 22 = CO2 emission.
For example, 200 gallons X 22 = 4400 pounds of CO2

, Some utility companies will tell you what your carbon footprint was for the month. Check your utility bill to see if you can find this information. If not, then check your utility bills to find out what your usage was and plug the numbers into some simple equations to find out what your impact was.Multiply your kilowatt hours by 1.85. For example, 67 hrs X 1.85 = 123.95 lbs of CO2.
Multiply your natural gas usage (therms) by 13.466. For example, 19 therms X 13.466 = 255.854 lbs of CO2.
Multiply gallons or propane used by 13. For example, 3 gallons of propane X 13 = 39 lbs of CO2.
Multiply gallons of fuel used by 22. For example 15 gallons of fuel X 22 = 330 lbs of fuel.

, If you purchased any carbon offsets or did something to offset some of your carbon usage, then you can subtract the amount of carbon that you offset from your totals.For example, on tree can absorb a ton of carbon over its lifetime, so if you have a midsized sedan, then planting nine trees could offset the production footprint of your car.Check out non-profit groups that plant trees to help offset emissions. You can donate to have a tree planted and offset some of your emissions.

Make sure your state allows cyanuric acid.,
Understand the benefit of cyanuric acid.,
Be sure to buy stabilized chlorine for your pool.,
Test your pool regularly.",How to Test for Cyanuric Acid1," Every state has different laws and different levels they allow, from 30 ppm as the maximum to 100 ppm as the maximum. It’s essential you know what you are testing for, depending on your location.;
, In the right amounts, cyanuric acid protects the chlorine in a pool from ultraviolet sunlight, thereby reducing the amount of chlorine lost over time. As a result, the pool stays disinfected longer and more effectively. In high amounts, however, cyanuric acid can reduce the effectiveness of chlorine as a disinfectant. Bacteria can build up in the water when this happens and create a health risk., Many pool owners unknowingly add cyanuric acid to their pools because of the kind of chlorine they are adding. When buying chlorine for your pool, choose sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione (“dichlor”) or trichloro-s-triazinetrione (“trichlor”).

, Once a week, set a time that you check for cyanuric acid levels. If you have concerns that your cyanuric acid levels aren’t under control, test more often."

Get a testing kit.,
Fill the plastic vessel with sample water.,
Add the turbidity solution.,
Wait one minute.,
Transfer the resulting solution into the test tube.,
Stop when the black dot disappears.,
Check the liquid level.,
Run the test over, if the level is too high or too low.,
Adjust your water as needed and retest.",How to Test for Cyanuric Acid2," A turbidity testing kit, also called a ""disappearing dot"" test, should come with a special glass test tube, a separate plastic vessel, and chemical reagent packets. While each kit can vary by manufacturer, many also come with a plastic pipette and a spoon or stirring rod.The glass test tube should have a black dot or black line at the bottom of the tube. This mark is crucial to the testing process, so make sure that it is there.
Sometimes the test tube and the plastic vessel are connected, but there should at least be two separate compartments.

, Collect water into the plastic vessel of the testing kit. Be sure to use the amount indicated in the test instructions (25 ml is common). You can do this by directly scooping the water up with the plastic vessel.Some testing kits will provide a plastic vessel that has a lid. When this is the case, you can mix the reagent into the sample water by capping the vessel and shaking it for 30 seconds or so.

, Pour one packet of the chemical reagent into the sample water. Use the provided spoon or stirring rod to gently mix the powder into the water until it dissolves. If your kit does not have a spoon or rod provided, use a plastic or glass spoon.

, Doing so will allow the necessary chemical reaction to occur. The reagent reacts with the cyanuric acid in the water to create turbidity, or cloudiness. Cloudier water indicates a higher concentration of cyanuric acid.

, Use the pipette to transfer the testing solution into the marked test tube, one drop at a time. Stand the test tube on a white or light surface so that the black mark is easy to spot. Look into the test tube from above as you drop the testing solution inside.

, As soon as you are no longer able to see any of the black mark at the bottom of the tube, stop dropping water inside. Make sure that you are viewing the test tube from the top and not the side., Read the graduated line on the test tube that hits the surface of the testing liquid. This line will tell you the concentration of cyanuric acid in your sample. If the mark disappears when the liquid is under the 100 ppm mark, the cyanuric acid concentration is greater than 100 ppm. If it disappears above the 10 ppm mark, it is lower than 10 ppm. The ideal range for pool water is between 30 and 50 ppm.

, If the level of cyanuric acid is above 100 ppm, you will need to dilute another water sample and try the test again to determine the exact value. Take another sample, measuring out only 20 ml of pool water. Add 20 ml of distilled water to the sample water and mix to combine. Run through the test in the same exact way as before, but this time, use the newly prepared diluted sample.

, Add as much cyanuric acid or fresh water to the pool as needed and retest the levels after the acid has had a chance to distribute itself evenly. This typically takes about four hours. Retest the water using the same steps performed to test the water the first time.

Purchase a package of testing strips.,
Read the instructions.,
Lower a strip into the pool water.,
Compare the color on the strip with the color chart.,
Adjust the water as needed and retest.",How to Test for Cyanuric Acid3," Cyanuric acid strips have a unique chemical composition that is sensitive to the presence of cyanuric acid. Cyanuric acid testing strips are sold separately instead of being sold in kits since you can submerge the strip directly into the water without collecting a sample. Make sure that the package of testing strips you purchase comes with a color identification chart., There is some difference between the strips, so make sure that you are using them properly. If any of the instructions vary from those indicated here, follow those instructions instead of these since they apply to the specific product you have on hand., When you are ready to test the water in your pool, remove one strip and submerge the test patch portion into the water for 30 seconds. Chemicals in the testing strip react with cyanuric acid in the water, producing a color on the testing patch of the strip., Remove the strip from the water and compare the color to the color identification chart that came with your testing strips. The color or shade on the testing strip should correspond to a color on the identification chart. Each color will indicate a certain level of cyanuric acid, and those levels should be marked on the chart.

, If you need to add cyanuric acid or dilute the pool water based on the amount detected by the testing strip, do so now and retest the level of cyanuric acid again afterward. You need to give the cyanuric acid a chance to distribute itself evenly throughout the water before retesting. The test strip instructions may provide further insight on how long to wait, but usually, you should wait at least four hours.

Start by learning what you can about the oceans.,
Know what not to put down your drains.,
Dispose of your trash with care.,
Keep your plumbing in good shape and use water sparingly.,
Learn the difference between sustainably caught seafood and non-sustainably caught seafood.,
Join a beach or underwater clean-up group.,
Carpool.,
Enthuse your kids in the love of oceans.,
Keep your boat green.,
Avoid bathing in the ocean with soap.,
Focus your career on marine conservation.",How to Help Prevent Damage to Our Oceans," This will instill awe, respect, and most likely a passion in you for all things sea, and the more you know, the more you will understand the importance of doing our bit to care for the oceans. Some of the things to read up on include the problems of overfishing, the impacts of climate change on the ocean, the impact of agricultural/industrial/sewage waste in the oceans, and the ways in which ocean systems work. Learn about the species in the ocean, and the geological features and hazards, and finally, but importantly, learn about how much human beings rely on the oceans for everything from livelihood and nutrition, to relaxation and hobbies.


If you don't already know about such events as the depletion of the Grand Banks codfish fishery, read up on them and learn about how centuries of fishing sustainably has been overtaken by huge industrial fishing boats, nets much larger than several football fields, and factory trawlers. If you're not concerned yet, then consider that scientists are very worried, to the point of saying that there will be no fish for us to pull from the seas in 50 years if we continue to carry on fishing as we are now.Scientists have recently found out that the Earth has run out of room to expand fisheries, so we're left with what we have already depleted.;
, Pollution from drains can often end up in the seas and it's here that you can do a great deal as a householder, by following these simple steps:


Do not dispose of paint, solvents, cleaners, pesticides, or other chemicals down the drain. Know what is hazardous waste and find out about local collection and recycling programs in your area.

Dispose of used motor oil properly. Find out if your city or town has a recycling program, or ask if local auto shops can help.
Never dump chemicals onto soil or roads, or down storm drains.
Use pesticides and herbicides sparingly or not at all. Even if you don't live near the sea, much of the run-off from your garden ends up down the drain, which wends its way down to the sea eventually. Tolerate a few bugs (many can actually help your garden) or use natural pest control methods. Crowd out weeds, smother them, or pull them by hand.
Use ocean-friendly products. Paints, soaps, nail polish, and other chemicals can harm the ocean life.
Dispose safely of mercury items such as old batteries, thermometers, and Compact Fluorescent Light-bulbs (CFL). Hand them in to your local mercury disposal center to make sure they are disposed of properly and efficiently.

, The manner in which you get rid of your household and business trash matters a great deal. Some items can create enormous harm if they reach the oceans, such as the plastic ring six-pack holders used for cans/bottles, and plastic bags. Sea animals and birds get caught in these items, or ingest them as ""food"", and suffer slow, agonizing deaths.


If you must purchase items with plastic six-pack holders, cut the top into small pieces prior to disposal.

Recycle as much as you can. The more, the better, so it goes nowhere else than into the virtuous cycle of humans reusing our own junk.
Hold on to your balloons. Many of them land in the ocean and lose their color. Animals think they are jellyfish or other tasty morsels, swallow them, and die painfully, often by starvation as the balloon blocks their ability to feed.
Reduce the amount of trash coming out of your house by not even bringing home items that end up as trash. Use reusable bags, leave packaging with the store (ask them to reduce it in future), buy unprocessed food products without packaging, prefer stores and items that have less packaging, and simply buy less.

, Not only does this ensure that your house retains its worth and guards you and your family's health, maintaining your plumbing and having regular checks on it is important for ensuring that nothing untoward is leaking seaward. Moreover, don't waste water; water tends to find its way back to the sea eventually and the more fresh water you use, the more you are depleting a precious resource. And the more we add to water by way of cleaning products, personal hygiene products, medicines, and other added chemicals and items, the more we increase the potential for polluting the sea.


If your house is served by a septic system, make sure it is inspected and pumped out every three years.
Never allow raw toilet waste to enter the ocean from your property. Not only is this unhygienic for human users of the ocean (and therefore usually regulated) but it harms the sea life as well.
Install water-saving toilets. These save you money and save on how much water is used and needs to be treated.
Install shower heads that restrict the flow of water. Faucet flow can be likewise restricted.
Take shorter showers, use timers in the garden for watering, turn off the water when brushing your teeth, and ensure that your washing machine and dishwasher are fill before doing a washing load.
If you can install a gray-water system for your home, this can be of enormous benefit as you will be able to reuse a lot of your household water for watering the garden and other suitable external uses.
Cover your pool to prevent loss by evaporation. A covered pool can cut the loss of water by up to 90 percent.Support budget measures as needed to upgrade municipal waste-water treatment systems to improve pollution control.

, Only purchase seafood that has been harvested in a sustainable manner and voice your concerns about unsustainable methods on your blog, through letters and petitions to companies and to companies responsible for poor fishing practices, and by contacting your local representative. There are many seafood guides available online that help guide you in knowing which fish are caught sustainably; for example, in the United States, The Monterey Bay Aquarium runs a program called ""Seafood Watch"" that includes a pocket-sized guide that you can download. Such pocket guides are available for many parts of the world, just do an online search for more information.


Support stores and supermarkets that sell sustainably caught seafood.
Choose to go to restaurants that support the sale of sustainably caught seafood. Point out to those restaurants that don't sell sustainable catch that you're not going to patronize them until they do and that you will also ask your family and friends to steer clear until the restaurant changes its policies.

, If you want to get hands on and do something really useful, clean-up is a great way to get involved. Beach clean-ups are usually organized locally by community groups or municipalities, and in some places they're even country-wide on specific dates. These are great for family outings because children will be able to help collect trash from the shoreline and will have a real sense of achievement once it's done. For underwater clean-ups, you'll need to know how to dive but this is just as satisfying, knowing that you're removing the plastic bags, plastic items, twine, containers, etc., that inevitably find their way to the ocean.


Don't litter. This simple decision can make a huge difference; every piece of litter near the seaside has the potential to end up in the ocean, whether it makes its way there by wind, tides, or by animal carriers. Put all of your trash in designated trash bins or take it home for proper disposal.
Volunteer at a local wildlife preserve located near a body of water to help out on a cleanup effort. Your work will be appreciated.
Consider donating your time or money to a non-profit organization whose mission includes ocean conservation.

, This can help you take the fast lane to work or school, as well as helping you to conserve gasoline. You might consider buying a hybrid car, which uses regenerative braking and saves gasoline and money. Also, you could use mass transit, such as trains or buses. Doing this allows you to do things such as reading the newspaper or actually enjoy your coffee, which you couldn't do peacefully while driving. Diesel, gas, and smokestack emissions can lead to haze, toxic emissions, or acid rain, which can lead to harmful effects in the oceans.

, Children are fantastic ambassadors for the sea; they love beaches, they love learning about sea life, and they're usually keen on swimming, boat rides, and other sea activities. Take them to the beach as often as you can and spend time talking to them about the sea, the dunes, the animals they can see, and answer their questions about the ocean. Explain to them why it is important to take care of the ocean.


Take a litter bag with you when you visit the beach and pick up visible litter, such as fishing line, plastic bags, bottles, and other trash. Naturally, don't stick your fingers inside containers or under anything that might harbor a biting beastie; use your common sense and take gardening gloves if you're concerned about touching things with your bare hands.

, When cleaning and sprucing up your boat, think about the ocean. Most of what you're doing on a boat will end up in the ocean, so it's important to be thoughtful about the impact of your activities. Prefer cleaning solutions, paint, varnish, etc., that have been approved as ocean-friendly. If you're not sure, contact your local boating association or a local marine environment association for more details relevant to your area, and read wikiHow's How to boat green for more details.

, Soap pollutes the ocean and can cause illness in fish. Even biodegradable soaps can cause harm in the ocean. Do extensive research before making your decision., If you're really keen about doing your part to protect the oceans, a career focused on the oceans might be the way to go for you. There are plenty of options, including becoming a marine biologist, a government fisheries expert, an oceans law expert, an oceans management expert, an environmentally friendly boat cleaner, a shoreline zoologist or botanist, or even an oceans policy adviser in government or a political party.

Store the solution in a cool, dark place, such as a cupboard or closet.",How to Prepare Citric Acid Solution," You can find it at many grocery stores, Middle Eastern or kosher markets, cooking stores, health food stores, or bulk food stores. It is sometimes in the canning/preservation section and sometimes labeled ""sour salt."" Purchase at least 1 lb. (454 g) in order to make an adequate amount of citric acid solution.






;
,, Citric acid reacts with several metals, which is why it can be used as a metal cleaner. (This also explains why orange juice placed in an unlined metal canteen quickly takes on an unpleasant metallic taste.)

Make sure they are thoroughly cleaned before use to avoid possible contamination of the solution and fungal growth.

, Solutions with higher and lower concentrations of citric acid have differences in regards to potency, shelf life, and cost.

A higher concentration of citric acid solution will store better than a lower concentration solution. A good measure is 1 lb. (454 g) of citric acid powder to 1 pint (470 ml) of water.
However, a lower concentration solution of 1 lb. (454 g) of citric acid to 2 pints of water (940 ml) also works, is more economical, and results in the convenient ratio of one fluid ounce (30 ml) of the solution being equivalent to one-half ounce (14 g) of the dry powder.













, Place 1 lb. (454 g) of citric acid powder in a non-metallic pot. Set the pot aside.








, Bring your choice of 1 or 2 pints (470/940 ml) of water to a boil in a non-metallic pot.

Utilizing a microwave-safe container is an option, but always be careful when boiling water in a microwave. It can superheat and then rapidly boil over when disturbed. Check the water frequently and when removing, wear an oven mitt and carefully give the container a nudge to make sure it does not want to boil over. Also place a wooden chopstick or similar item in the water before heating (it will attract the bubbles so they don't all form at once).













, Please be careful with the boiling water! Using a non-reactive tea kettle might be an option.








, Using filter paper or cheesecloth, strain the solution through into another non-metallic pot or bowl to remove any solids that haven't dissolved.








, This makes the transfer to your storage container safer, and will prevent a tightly-sealed plastic storage bottle from crushing (imploding, really) as a hot liquid cools inside it.








, Pour the solution into an air-tight, non-metallic container. Make sure it is thoroughly clean (boiling glass or heavy-duty plastic containers for 5-10 minutes is an option). Choose a container with a tight-fitting lid. Use a funnel to pour the solution into the container(s).








, When stored properly, the solution can last for up to two years.

Cultivate micro-critters.,
Add fish or shrimp to the system.",How to Build a Self Sustaining Ecosystem1," If you are just starting with building ecosystems, you may want to start small. The smaller your container, the harder it is to maintain a self-sustaining environment. Larger containers allow for the inclusion of multiple diverse species and give everything room to grow. All containers must be clear to let in light.A small glass bowl is fast to set up and doesn’t take up much space. Small bowls are good for beginners because you can experiment with what works for you. They are harder to keep sustained because there isn’t much space for growth and diversity.
Medium aquariums (10-30 gallons) have more space for growth, but are more expensive and still limited in the size for growth.
Large aquarium (60-200 gallons) have ample space for growth and diversity and are most likely to be successful; however, they are very expensive and hard to make room for.;
, Fluorescent lighting is important for the growth of the plants in your ecosystem. It is recommended to provide 2 to 5 watts per gallon of water for a freshwater aquarium.Incandescent lighting will not help your plants grow.

, The substrate is the soil of the aquarium that allows the plants to anchor and grow. It must be properly established before doing anything else to foster an environment of growth and recycling of nutrients.If using a small bowl, start with 1 inch of sand and then add about ½ inch of pea gravel on top.
For medium to larger aquariums, start with 2 inches of sand and about 1 ½-2 inches of pea gravel on top.
Sand and pea gravel can be purchased from a pet store or obtained from a nearby pond.

, The water is important because it will establish the first source of food for the fish and other organisms: algae and microorganisms. You can start with distilled/bottled water, dechlorinated tap water, or water from a previous fish tank or aquarium.If you use distilled/bottled water or dechlorinated tap water, mix some fish flakes in with the water to encourage growth.
Adding some water from an already established tank will also help growth because it will already have the essential nutrients.

, When choosing plants you want to consider: how fast they grow (how often you’ll have to trim them), the size of the plant, whether they’re edible for fish and snails, and where in the aquarium they will grow (from the bottom, from the surface, from branches). To cultivate a diverse environment, include some of the following:Bottom growth: Hair grass, corkscrew grass, or green rotala
Surface Growth: Duckweed, lotus
Branches: crystalwort, Java moss, Christmas moss, phoenix moss
You want to make sure the plants are well-established (let them grow and become rooted) before adding fish or snails to the ecosystem.

, The next step in the food chain of your ecosystem is to add micro-critters such as small pond snails, daphnia, and micro-planarians. These will serve as food for all of the fish that don’t eat plants or algae. Aged aquarium media is a good way to seed your tank. This can be purchased at the fish or pet store.Most of these organisms can’t be seen by eye, but you should wait at least two weeks for them to get fully established before adding fish.

, Once the plants and microorganisms have been established you can start to introduce larger fish into the tank. You want to start with smaller organisms like a guppy, Endler’s livebearer, or cherry shrimp and only add one or two at a time. These fish also reproduce quickly and serve as a great diet for larger fish.If you have a larger aquarium, you can add more and varied fish. Balancing your fish is tricky and takes time. Make sure each species has time to adjust before adding more into the mix.

Be a mindful consumer.",How to Help Save the Environment1," If you're not using it, turn it off. This goes for lights, televisions, computers, printers, and so on.


Put timers on lamps and use them to turn off lamps at the same time each day. Timers like these can be found in hardware stores and they can be plugged into outlets, then control the power to your lamp.
You can also find heaters and fans that have timers on them. So if it's cold or hot during the night it will switch off for you. Most of the timers go for an hour and then automatically switch off.;
, Leaving devices plugged in, such as laptop chargers or toasters, can use ""phantom"" energy. Even when an appliance is turned off, it may still use power because the applications on the electronics will constantly use electricity.It is best to unplug anything that you do not anticipate using in the next 36 hours (or more).


Use a power strip to turn lots of things off with the flip of a single switch. You can plug all your devices in one area—say, your computer—into a power strip. When you're done, simply turn the power strip off with the switch.
Measure the energy your devices use or look up typical energy use. To measure usage yourself, use a Kill-a-Watt. You plug an appliance in through the Kill-A-Watt, and it measures the power use. This tool can also tell you whether a particular appliance or device draws power when it is turned off.

, Air drying leaves your clothes smelling fresh and is environmentally friendly. Tumble dryers are among the biggest energy users in most households, after the refrigerator and air conditioner. If you do use a dryer, make sure to keep the vent clear, for safety as well as efficiency.


Also, when using a washing machine, make sure you have a full load of dirty clothes. Do not just put a couple of dirty clothes into the washing machine as that wastes water. Instead make sure you have a full load of dirty clothing to conserve the water and electricity.
If you want, you can also hand wash clothes in a sink or buy a energy efficiency washing machine that doesn't use a lot of water.

, Air conditioners use a great deal of electricity. Use natural ventilation or a fan to keep cool, as much as possible.


If you do use an air conditioner, set it to a slightly lower temperature than outside. Remember that setting the temperature lower uses more electricity, and it won't cool things off any faster.

, If you are not using certain rooms in your house, close the vents in these rooms, and close the doors. Doing this consistently will reduce the amount of energy squandered by heating or cooling seldom occupied spaces.

, Instead of using exercise equipment, use a real bicycle (or a unicycle), or walk to get to nearby destinations or for pleasure. Calisthenics, push-ups, and other bodyweight exercises work, as well.

, Bundle yourself up and lower your thermostat by a few degrees. Aim to set your thermostat at 68°F (20 °C) in the winter, perhaps even lower at night. Every degree above this will generate about 6-8% additional energy output., The average family of four in the U.S. uses about 400 gallons (1,514 L) of water every day.Make conscious choices to lower your consumption of water.


Take shorter showers or fill the bathtub only one-quarter to one-third full.
Turn off the faucet while you brush your teeth.
Install low flow faucets (taps) or aerators, low-flow shower heads, and low-flush toilets.
Run your dishwasher only when it is completely full.
Wash full loads of laundry in a washing machine. Choose a front-load machine if possible.
If you hand wash your car, park it on your lawn and use buckets and sponges. Use the hose to rinse. Use a hose nozzle to stop the water or turn the hose off between rinses. Keep in mind, however, that the soap and other cleaning products might go down the storm drain (if you have one), leading to pollution.
If you have a swimming pool, use pool covers to reduce evaporation and keep leaves out.
Plant drought tolerant landscaping, and consider xeriscaping. Maintain your outdoor irrigation and water no more than is necessary.

, If you have curbside recycling, use it. Be sure to separate your recycling into glass, metal, paper and so on.


Take special trips to a recycling center if you don’t have curbside recycling, or if you need to recycle certain materials not accepted by your recycling service.

, Anything you use only a few times and throw away consumes resources only to spend centuries in a landfill.


Carry your own reusable cup or water bottle, eating utensils, and cloth shopping bags with you. Pack a waste-free lunch.
Use rechargeable batteries instead of disposable batteries. Batteries not only take up landfill space, as they can't be incinerated. They also can leak acid into the Earth.
Dispose properly of hazardous waste. Many materials, including batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, e-waste (most anything with batteries or a plug), cleaning products, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, automotive fluids, and paint, should never be disposed of in a landfill, sanitary sewer, or storm sewer. Instead, contact your city for proper disposal opportunities.

, Don't unwind a mile of it for one little wipe. Be reasonable. Go easy on the paper towels, too, and use a washable cloth or sponge for most of your kitchen cleanup.


For the paper products you do use, look for products made from 80-100% recycled paper, preferably with a high post-consumer content.
For most household cleaning, look for reusable terry cleaning cloths. They are inexpensive, especially when bought in bulk, and can be washed and reused hundreds of times.

, Cloth diapers have come a long way from the things with pins and plastic covers. You will save a fortune (especially if you have more than one child), keep potentially dangerous chemicals away from your baby's skin, and do a good thing for the planet while you're at it.

Select a site.,
Create a seed bed of freshly worked soil and roto-till the area to a depth of 1 to 4 inches (2.5 to 10 cm).,
Plant the seeds.,
Plant potted seedlings.,
Mulch.,
Year one: Most prairie plants are perennials.,
Year two: During the second growing season, residual seeds from the first season may still germinate and some of the faster-growing native plants will begin to establish themselves.,
Year three: By the third year (and in the years to follow) your patience will begin to pay off.",How to Restore a Native Prairie," When selecting a site, first note your location. Are you in an area where native grassland historically existed, or do you live in an area that was mostly forested? You can only reclaim an area back into native prairie if you are in a location where the native prairie once was prevalent 100 years or so ago. Look for areas with maximum sun exposure and lack of competition. Trees, especially those with a high surface root density like maple and basswood, shade out prairie species and compete for soil nutrients and water. Spruce trees and most other conifers are not good in prairies. Such trees are found in more northerly climates, and are indicative of areas where prairie was non-existent, such as in mountain regions.


Prepare your site. In early- to mid-spring, clear the site of existing vegetation. Seeds, if broadcast into existing vegetation, have relatively little chance of success, particularly if the existing vegetation easily out-competes the seedlings trying to establish themselves. If weeds, turf or other vegetation currently exist on your site, they will need to be eliminated. Note, however, that certain weeds and other vegetation may be native to your location. Never assume that a weed is always non-native.

If you prefer a more natural method, or if you wish to avoid a chemical process, you can hand-pull the weeds from the area. While this will take a lot more time and much more labour, the weeds can be fully eliminated this way.






Natural prairies were maintained by wildfires. Depending on nearby physical and political conditions it may be possible to do controlled burns. Typically local fire authorities need to be involved. One common mistake is to do the burn in springtime, since it is believed that the likelihood of the fire getting out of control is reduced. From an ecological perspective, spring burns are less than helpful. Instead a summer burn should be attempted, with great care. It would be best to burn off very small areas at a time, with fire fighting crews standing by.






Using chemical means to kill unwanted vegetation has its pros and cons whether 'conventional' or 'natural'. Be sure to read the label to ensure plantback restrictions and re-entry intervals will suit your project. Glyphosate, paraquat, or glufosinate will kill all annual plant species and harm perenials while dicamba or 2,4,-D are mostly effective of broadleaves however be careful when the temps get close to 80 degrees as it can move and harm untreated plants. Depending on project size sometimes the safer option is to pull the weeds. Doing so will help your prairie become a self-sustaining ecosystem.
If the existing vegetation is tall and/or dense, it will be necessary to remove the dead plant material. It can be burned off or it can be mowed and then mulched or raked away. Also consider utilizing livestock to graze down the area if mowing is unfeasible and impractical. Utilizing natural herbivores like cattle and sheep is much more natural and beneficial to the land than burning money, time and fuel mowing your prairie-reclamation site.


, Keep in mind that weed seeds frequently lie dormant beneath the soil surface and germinate after they have become exposed to sun and rain. If your area was initially densely populated with weeds, especially problem weeds such as quack grass, thistle, leafy spurge or sweet clover, allow the weed seeds to germinate and begin growing. Then repeat the weed elimination and tilling process. This second round is optional, but does produce a cleaner, more receptive seed bed. Finally, rake the soil to create a smooth, firm seed bed. This improves the condition of the seed bed, giving seeds better soil contact, increasing the odds each will germinate and grow.


If the soil structure lacks organic material and looks like it is made up of just clay, add a thin layer of peat (1/4 to 1/2 inch or 0.6 to 1.25 cm deep) on top of the ground, then mix it in with the roto-tiller.Complete a soil sample to ensure that your soil pH and fertility needs are where they need for success. If needed you may need to add some lime to the soil to adjust the pH or fertilizer to address nutrient deficiencies to get the plants started healthy. N-P-K are required by all plants and addressed on a fertilizer bag. Some prefer natural fertilizer (aka manure) - this has its own challenges as it often brings weed seeds with it, however it has a lot of other advantages when used correctly.

, The best time to seed is from the spring thaw to late summer (or to early August in North America). In the fall, seeding can take place from September 20 through freeze-up in the US and Canada. On prepared seed beds on sites with little competition from other plants, winter seeding can also be effective.


A suggested planting density is 500 cubic centimeters of seed (about a full 8-ounce plastic cup of seed) for each square meter. Look for seed from locally-established plants (as in grasses and forbs that already exist), since they'll be better adapted to the site.Focus on native plant species for a native prairie. See the Tips below for more details on preparing the seeds.

It is highly recommended before you even purchase seeds to research the grasses and forbs that are truly native to your area. Certain plants that may be found along road-allowances or on the edges of fields may not be native plants at all. While it is nearly impossible to prevent growth of certain exotic, non-native plants to grow in the prairie region (such as Kentucky bluegrass, crested wheatgrass and smooth brome grass in the dry mixed-grass prairie region of southwestern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada), it should be possible to learn to identify the plants that are already established in your area and determine if they are native or not. Plant books that cover your area will be able to help you assess and evaluate certain vegetation, as well as spending the money and time to attend local plant ID classes and rangeland horticulture clinics.


Hand planting is the simplest and most reliable method of seeding. Adjustable hand-held spreaders may work with the grass seed although they tend to get clogged. Wildflower seed should always be hand planted.

Be sure that the wildflower seed you are planting is indeed native wildflowers and not flowers that are mostly non-native.


Spread grass seed first. To ensure even coverage, divide the seed in half and plant the first half over the entire area. Work slowly and carefully. Plant the second half at a perpendicular angle to the first seeding. Lightly rake the grass seed into the soil to ensure soil contact.
Wildflower seed should be planted last and can be spread evenly or concentrated in bands or swaths across your prairie area. Much of this seed is quite small. Spreading it thinly will produce the best results. Do not rake in the flower seeds.
Watering at this point is helpful but not necessary. Native prairie species should be well adapted to rainfall conditions on your site, and watering may encourage non-native species (weeds) to germinate. If you do decide to water, it is important to follow through until the seedlings are established. Watering to begin germination and then letting the soil dry out can prove disastrous for sprouting seedlings.Fertilization is also unnecessary. Studies have shown that fertilizing native grassland areas either encouraged encroachment of non-native grasses or had no effect on plant growth in such areas at all. Fertilizing, like watering, may also encourage weeds to grow instead of the native plants you worked hard to plant in your reclamation site.

, If you wish to include them, these should be added after seeding. Potted seedlings can be planted anytime from spring thaw to freeze-up, although those planted in mid-summer may require supplemental watering. Seedlings can be planted throughout the site or in designated areas of the project. Ideally, natural rainfall will provide enough water, but dry weather during the first 10 days may necessitate supplemental watering.


If you're starting the seedlings yourself, they should germinate about 8 weeks before planting and be hardened for about a week before planting. Hardening means gradually getting the plants used to outdoor conditions by leaving them outside at the site for a little more time each day., While mulching is not required, it does provide some erosion control and aids in soil moisture retention. Mulch lightly (soil visible through mulch) with clean oat or wheat straw. Make sure not to use hay, because it may contain seeds you do not want to introduce to your area.

, Although perennial seeds will germinate the first year, the young seedlings' root growth will be two to three times their above-ground growth, and they may not flower until the second or third year. While this lack of visual growth can be frustrating, keep in mind that it is the strong root system of prairie perennials which enables them to be nearly maintenance-free at maturity.


During this early stage of growth, weeds will take advantage of the lack of above-ground vegetation and appear on your site. To minimize the effects of tall weeds shading prairie seedlings and to prevent these weeds from setting seed, you should plan to cut your planting one, two, or even three times during its first growing season. This is generally done on 30-day intervals using a scythe, mower or line trimmer. Scything is often best, as an uneven removal of plant will open up the canopy in many spots to encourage growth of the seeded seedlings. The cutting height should be kept at five to eight inches in height. Mowing is also effective, but it is important to keep the blade set as high as possible. Hand weeding is also useful during the first growing season, especially to remove individual noxious weeds. These and invading woody plants may have to be treated with spot spraying, if necessary. Also consider using small livestock like sheep or goats to consume these weeds and to add their own fertilizer to the soil. Goats and sheep will often readily eat weeds and have a smaller impact on a newly established area than large animals like cattle or horses, which will trample, pug (or put holes in the ground) and/or pull out plants that are not weeds but native plants still trying to establish their root systems.;
, There might still, however, be a need for weed control and one mowing might be necessary sometime between mid-June and mid-August. The height and density of the weed cover should help determine if and when to mow. In areas where weeds are especially dominant, the advantages of cutting the weeds and preventing them from setting seed offset any disadvantages of cutting prairie plants. Spot spraying might still be necessary this year. However, both mowing and spraying should still be considered to be optional; at this time, you can begin to introduce grazers like cattle to help control the weeds and to control grass growth. Hoof action and the impact of grazing will further stimulate growth from the plants. However, depending on the plants that are grown, timing of grazing and how long to graze is critical to know.
, Both grasses and forbs will be more plentiful, providing beautiful, low-maintenance returns. One cutting per year can be used as a clean-up procedure. The best time to cut off old prairie vegetation is in early May or late November (after you've enjoyed the gold, lavender, russets, and maroons of an autumn prairie). In areas where prairie plants were especially tall and dense, mulch or rake away the dead plant material. If it's feasible, as mentioned repeatedly before, consider using livestock to create the disturbances necessary for maintaining a truly natural prairie habitat. You may wish to use such animals instead of investing in having to mow or rake once or several times a year. They also will contribute to needed fertilizer that plants will need to continue their growth. Such animals are also a key disturbance to help control woody invasions from trees and shrubs.

Change the water.,
Control algae growth.,
Remove dead fish promptly.",How to Build a Self Sustaining Ecosystem2," Aquariums take a bit of maintenance to make sure all of your critters stay alive and well. About every 2 weeks, 10-15% of the water in the tank should be replaced with fresh water. If you are using tap water, let the water sit in an aerated bucket for about 24 hours to allow the chlorine to air out.Check your local water source to determine if there are heavy metals in your water.
Use filtered water if you are concerned about the quality of your tap water.

, A gravel vacuum is a handy tool to have to help control the algae in your aquarium. When you change out the water, vacuum the gravel at the same time to remove algae growth and any uneaten food that may have accumulated.Clean the aquarium walls with filter floss or a magnetic tank scrubber to keep algae from accumulating on the glass.
Add plants, snails, or daphnia to help control the growth.

, Count your fish at least once a week to determine if any have died. Smaller fish can decompose quickly and cause spikes in nitrite, ammonia, and nitrate levels. These can be harmful to the other fish in your tank. If you see a dead fish, remove it as soon as possible.Use a test kit to check the levels of ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and pH. Replace the water if the levels are too high.

Cover the pebbles with a layer of activated charcoal.,
Add about a ½ inch layer of peat moss.,
Layer potting soil on top of the peat moss.,
Add small plants.,
Maintain the terrarium.,
Prune plants as needed.",How to Build a Self Sustaining Ecosystem3," Any sized jar or bottle will be sufficient for your terrarium. A container with a large mouth will make it easier to work inside of. You want to make sure that the container can be properly sealed.Options include: a candy jar with a heavy lid, a pasta jar, or a mason jar.
Make sure the container is properly washed to remove any residue before using as a terrarium.

, The layer of pebbles at the bottom of the jar is to allow water to collect at the bottom and protect the plants from flooding. Add pebbles to a depth of about 1/2-2 inches.It doesn’t matter what type of rock or pebbles you use. You can even use colorful pebbles from the pet store to make it more exciting.

, The charcoal layer is important to filter out impurities in the water. It helps keep the ecosystem clean and healthy by reducing the burden of bacteria and fungi. You don’t need a thick layer, just enough to cover the rock layer.Activated charcoal can be purchased at a local pet store.

, On top of the charcoal layer, you will add another layer of peat moss. Peat moss is a nutrient-rich soil that will help hold the water and nutrients necessary for the plants to grow.Peat moss can be obtained a local nursery.

, The final layer before adding the plants is a layer of potting soil. The plants will be able to root in this soil and get the water and nutrients they need from the combination of all of the layers below the potting soil.Add enough soil for the plants to take root and have room for growth. A depth slightly higher than the pot the plant came in should be good.
Most types of potting soil will be sufficient for this. Succulents and cacti require a special type of soil.

, Any plant you’d like to add will work in your terrarium, but small plants are recommended. Prepare your plants by removing them from their pots and breaking up the hard soil around their roots. Trim particularly long roots before planting. Dig a small well in the soil with a spoon and place the roots of the plant into the hole. Add a bit of soil on top and pack it down around the plant.Repeat this process with the rest of your chosen plants taking care to keep the plants away from the edges of the container.
Try to avoid having the leaves touching the sides of the container as much as possible.
Some great plants to start with include moon valley friendship, the nerve plant, variegata, aquamarine, minimus aureus, strawberry begonias, ferns, and mosses., With a sealed system, the terrarium shouldn’t need much maintenance. If you notice it is looking a bit dry, open it up and add a bit of water. Alternatively, if there is a lot of moisture inside, leave the lid off for a day or two to let it dry out for a bit.There might have been bug eggs in the soil or on your plants. If you notice anything crawling around inside, let it out and then reseal your ecosystem.
Store in a location with good indirect sunlight. Near a window is perfect.

, With proper sunlight and water, your plants will grow. If the plants get too big for the terrarium, you need to cut them back so it doesn’t get overcrowded. Keep the plants at your desired size so that they continue to thrive.Remove any dead plants that may have fallen to the bottom.
Clear out algae and fungus that might be growing.

Eat less meat and dairy.,
Don’t drink coffee from K-cups.,
Buy local food.,
Avoid excess packaging.,
Don't waste food.,
Use reusable bottles for water.",How to Help Save the Environment2," Meat and dairy production is highly resource-intensive and inefficient. Attempting vegetarianism or veganism is definitely one of the best things you can do for the environment and also for your health.Meatless Monday is a national non-profit public health campaign that encourages people to give up meat one day a week. Visit the site for some meatless recipes.

, K-cups, or the mini pods of ground coffee for Keurig coffee makers, are single use and typically thrown out (although they can be recycled if users disassemble them into paper, plastic, and metal). Billions of mini cups of ground coffee were sold in 2014, and the number of cups that ended up in landfills could circle the earth 12 times.Brew coffee in a regular coffee pot or French press instead.


Use a mug or other reusable cup for your coffee instead of a disposable cup.
If you love the convenience of single-serve coffee and have already invested in a Keurig machine, look for a washable, refillable cup. You'll still save money and resources, compared to purchasing the individual cups.

, Transporting food from far-off locations takes a toll on the environment, as it must be shipped in trucks, by rail or by ship, all of which produce pollutants. Buying food that is sourced locally will help eliminate or reduce transportation impacts.Visit farmers markets to find local vegetables and fruits or use a CSA (community-supported agriculture) service to get fresh produce on a regular basis.

, Oftentimes, food companies expend just as much energy creating the packaging for food products as is expended in producing the actual food. Try not to buy food that is individually wrapped or buy in bulk., Plan your meals so that you don’t cook more than you will eat. Store your leftovers and use them up at your next meal. If you do have an overrun of food, such as after a party, share it with friends.

, Most tap water in developed countries is safe to drink, which means that buying bottled water is unnecessary. Buy a glass or metal bottle and fill it with water.


Request a water quality report from your city if you are concerned about the quality of the water.
A water filter is generally unnecessary, but even a simple one can improve the taste. Remember, however, that water softeners and reverse osmosis systems waste a lot more water than they deliver.
Fill a pitcher with tap water and chill it in your refrigerator.
If your tap water has a whitish, cloudy appearance when first poured, it may just be air bubbles. Try pouring some into a glass or bottle, and look again in a minute or two, to see if they rise out.

Walk or bike for local trips.,
Organize a carpool for work or school.,
Take mass transit.,
Plan out your errands and combine trips.,
Telecommute or work from home, if your job permits you to do so.,
Drive a hybrid or all-electric car.,
Maintain your car.,
Track your fuel economy and do all you can to improve it.

,
Take fewer airplane flights.,
Live near work, school, and other frequent destinations, if possible.",How to Help Save the Environment3," Walk or ride a bicycle when your destination is close to home. Short trips are generally the hardest on your car and on the environment, so swap out your car for your feet or bike.


Always wear a helmet and safety reflective gear when riding a bicycle.
Get what you need to carry cargo on a bike and do your shopping on two wheels, too. You can carry a lot with panniers, a bike trailer, or a sturdy basket.

, Coordinate with another person or two to carpool to work or work with other parents in the neighborhood to carpool kids to school.


Carpooling will also enable you to take the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane on a highway. This lane will usually save time and money on gasoline.
If you live near your children's school, consider organizing a ""walking school bus"" instead of driving. Children walk to school together in groups, supervised and guided by parents. Neighborhood parents can take turns leading the group.

, If you live in an area that has a bus, light rail, or subway system, consider taking this option to get to work, school or other destinations. Reducing car trips in favor of mass transit trips reduces congestion on roads and reduces the amount of gasoline that is used.


Many bus systems in major cities operate diesel-electric hybrid buses, which further reduces harmful emissions., Make errand trips more efficient by planning out where you will go and hitting all your stops in one trip. Group outings into fewer, longer trips, and plan them out so that you’re not driving the same path multiple times.


Don't forget to call ahead or check online, to make sure you'll arrive during business hours and that what you want is available. Make appointments and purchases online or by phone, too.

, One day per week reduces your commute transportation by 20%.

, If you have been looking for a new vehicle, consider buying a hybrid car. Hybrid cars run on both gasoline and electric motors. There's a growing selection of both hybrid and all-electric cars on the market. They not only give off less emissions into the air, but they also can save you money with fewer trips to the gas station.


You may also be able to get a tax credit on your U.S. federal taxes during the tax year that you bought a hybrid car., If you do have a car, keep it in good repair by changing the oil and air filter on schedule, repairing fluid leaks promptly, keeping the tires properly inflated.

,, Whether for work or vacation, lower the number of flights you take. Airplanes emit vast quantities of carbon dioxide and other polluting materials, which increases annually due to increased numbers of flights around the world.Do your part by taking fewer flights.Fly economy class. If there are more people on a plane, the relative environmental impact of one flight will be spread out among more people.
Opt to stay longer in a location rather than traveling back and forth.
Travel locally by train or bus.
Use technology for video conferencing rather than visiting a work location in person.

, Otherwise, try to live near transit or bicycle routes. If you are choosing a residence, consider transportation options as part of the process.

Install skylights and solar tubes.,
Switch to compact fluorescent or LED light bulbs.,
Seal all air infiltration points and leaks.,
Install insulation in your attic and exterior walls.,
Check for leaks.,
Install window treatments that maximize energy conservation.,
Plant barrier trees to protect your house from wind and sun.,
Maintain your appliances, and choose energy-efficient appliances if you are purchasing new ones.,
Install low-flow toilets.,
Install solar panels on your roof.,
Choose the smallest home which will comfortably house your family and your belongings (and consider cutting down on unneeded belongings).",How to Help Save the Environment4," Skylights and solar tubes are installed in your ceiling and are designed to let in more light. This will reduce the electricity you need to light your house. Some types can even convert sunlight into electricity.

, Compact fluorescent or LED light bulbs do cost more, but they also last longer than conventional light bulbs. They also use only one-quarter of the energy.


Start with the lights you leave on the most.

, Locate places where air can seep into or out of your house. These might be around doors and windows, around flues and chimneys, around recessed lights, among other places. Use caulking for thin gaps, and insulation or polyurethane foam for larger gaps.Repair leaks in your basement by first removing the insulation and sealing leaks. Use caulk or sheetrock mud to do so. Take care when you replace the insulation to ensure that it is not compressed and fully covers the space between the joists. Sealing all points of air leakage will also cut down on the number of insects and rodents entering your house.
Seal around light switches and power outlets, especially on outer walls. Turn off the power at the breaker box and test to ensure that the circuit is not live, then remove the covers and spray a low expansion polyurethane foam into the spaces on the outside of the junction box.
Check exterior door and window gaskets to ensure that they are sealing properly. If you feel a draft on cold, windy days, they need to be adjusted or replaced.
A smoke pen or a stick of incense can show you where your home leaks.

, A good layer of insulation can be a relatively low-cost way to improve both the comfort and efficiency of your home.

, If your faucets drip, get them fixed, or, if you can't fix it right away, at least put a container under the dripping faucet and use the water elsewhere, such as in your garden to water plants.


To check your toilets, put a few drops of food coloring in the tank, not the bowl. Wait about ten minutes without flushing. If you see the dye in the toilet bowl, repair your toilet.

, Choose curtains or blinds that keep your house cool in summer and warm in winter. For example, heavy curtains in a colder climate will help keep warm air in at night.


If you are in a hot climate, such as the southwestern U.S., consider tinting your windows or installing a reflective coating. This will redirect heat away from your house. Talk with local contractors to find out what options make sense for your situation. Tinting the windows which receive direct sun will also protect your fabric colors from fading so quickly.

, Deciduous trees provide shade in the summer, yet allow warming rays to enter your house during the colder months. Evergreens provide a wind break from prevailing winds.


Be sure to consider the future growth of any plantings and plant far enough from your house that the root systems will not disrupt your foundation.

,



Clean the coils on your refrigerator about once a year.

Clean the vent on your clothes dryer about once a year. Clean the lint filter each time you use the dryer.

, A low-flow toilet can save many gallons of water per year, both preserving the environment and lowering your water bill.


You can also try putting a bottle of water in the tank of your current toilet. The space the bottle takes up will save that much water each flush, yet allow the toilet to keep functioning properly. (Don't use a brick for this purpose, because bricks can disintegrate.)
Try lowering the water level in your toilet tank. Many toilets have an adjustment to lower the float controlling the fill valve.

, Solar panels convert sunlight to electricity and are dropping in price (some estimates put solar panel installation at about $10,000). A home utility bill can drop by 20% with the use of converted solar energy.


Keep in mind that there is concern, however, about the negative environmental impact of the manufacturing of solar panels. Solar panel manufacturing can result in chemical toxicity and lack of recycling, among other issues., You'll save on the physical and financial resources needed to build and maintain the access area, and you'll cut down on heating and cooling costs.


If you do have a larger home than you need, consider housing additional people, whether family members or roomers.

Determine which types of infrastructure are locally located within a couple miles radius to the coastline/beach.,
Determine whether there is ""non-point source contamination"" occurring.,
Study the direction that the wind typically blows and where this wind is coming from.,
Watch for color changes in local waters.,
Be aware that industrial runoff can go undetected into the sediments, as well as organism’s epidermis, lipid stores, and internal organs.,
Use testing strips.,
Transfer some of the water source in question into a container.,
Do readings off the test strips.,
Use a microscope.",How to Determine if Your Coastline Is Contaminated," Areas that act as drivers of local pollution include but are not limited to: highways/busy roads, different types of factories (coal burning, fossil fuel burning), farmland/cattle pastures/rural areas, urban areas/cities, shipyards, and so forth. Basically, any area that burns fuels and or uses a water source to wash away harmful materials, could be a source of contaminants.


Places that can be considered point sources of water pollution are places that are the sources of negative impact in an ecosystem.;
, It will be hard to find an area without non-point source pollution. It’s also more difficult to detect. To determine non-point source water pollution capabilities of the surrounding area, you need to know if there are locations near your water source where heavy fossil fuel burning, construction, or agriculture takes place. These sources of contamination have to go through a process before becoming a contaminant in your water source.


For example, when you drive and burn gasoline, your car's exhaust emits nitrogen oxide; this combines with sulfur oxides (particularly SO2) and other pollutants in the atmosphere, which then mixes within the clouds causing acid rain.
When the nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides, reach the cloud layer, they mix within the precipitation, then it rains upon the land.This acid rain causes the pH level in a water system or soil to decrease. The lower the level of pH, the more acidic a water system gets. The more acidic a water system gets, more organisms die.

, There are also geographic implications as well. In Provo, Utah, the community sits between two mountain ranges, so the wind if it blows east to west over this valley, air pollution blowing from California and Nevada collects in the valley like a funnel. This causes the local news team to sometimes announce that it would be imperative to stay indoors that day. However, the difference between acid rain and this process is that there there is no precipitation to mix with. The dryness creates smog, which is airborne gaseous pollutants and airborne particulate pollutants. This also affects water quality because when it does rain, all these pollutants will travel as run-off into the water table.

, If you notice a red, brown, or green hue form in the coastal waters, it is because there is an algal bloom occurring. This can be caused by sewage and/or agricultural runoff. This occurs because of a build-up of the nutrients phosphorous and nitrogen, that are used in fertilizers.The fertilizers are added into the water table every time a fertilized field is watered.


All of these nutrients flow into nearby streams and waterways, and end up in the ocean if left unchecked. These nutrients are then consumed by phytoplankton or better known as algae, causing the numbers of these photosynthetic organisms to multiply, consuming all the nutrients. When it is all depleted, they begin to die from lack of nutrients needed to continue metabolic process, thus falling to the bottom of waterways. As they decompose, the chemical reaction depletes the oxygen levels in the environment, creating what is known as a dead zone.Fish and other aquatic organisms that live underwater extract oxygen from the water, and when there is no oxygen, they fairly obviously, suffocate. So most organisms either attempt to vacate the premises, or not. The process of an aquatic environment becoming depleted of dissolved oxygen is called hypoxia., This affects human beings directly, because as these harmful metals accumulate in aquatic organisms, the trade of harmful metals from prey to predator continues up the food chain, until we are consuming these organisms and accumulating the harmful metals into our bodies. This is a process called bio-accumulation., There are many different types of test strips that can be purchased at most home appliance stores. Strips testing for pH, nitrates (fertilizer), and lead are used all the time for home water supply contaminant checks.

, Dip one of these test strips into the water to determine the levels of pH, nitrates, etc.

, What levels of chemicals are showing up?

, It is also possible to use a microscope to test samples of the water to find out which microorganisms are thriving. There will be different types of microorganisms and differing compositions of them depending on whether or not the water is healthy.

Plant a garden.,
Make your yard-friendly to wildlife.,
Reduce the area of lawn.,
Avoid pesticides, herbicides, and man-made chemical fertilizers.,
Plant a tree.,
Make a compost area.,
Use a rake instead of a leaf blower.",How to Help Save the Environment5," Create a garden plot with vegetables, fruits, and/or herbs.


Try to implement techniques so that your garden does not require fertilizers or excessive watering. For example, adding mulch to your garden will seal in water and make the soil moister.Include plants that produce your favorite fruits and vegetables so you won’t need to buy these at the store.
Use rain barrels or other containers to gather rainwater. Use this water on plants in your garden.

, Modern developments encroach upon natural habitats and pose risks to wildlife. Take some steps to make your yard friendlier to wildlife.Plant many different types of vegetation. Various creatures will visit your yard if you provide them with reason to be there. When you have many different types of vegetation, you’ll attract different types of animals.

Create a frog pond in your back yard. Frog populations are dwindling because their breeding areas are disappearing. If you create a habitat for them in your back yard, they may breed there., Grass areas usually require more frequent maintenance with lawn mowers, weed eaters, and other gas- or electric-powered tools. Convert some of your lawn to garden or native plants, which will also attract wildlife., Pesticides kill hundreds of birds and other animals per year. If you have unwanted weeds, pull or hoe them out yourself, clip them down, or plant a ground cover in their place.


Check out permaculture, integrative pest management, poly-cropping, and other techniques to reduce or eliminate the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizer.
If you do apply chemical fertilizer, apply no more than is really necessary. Ensure that excess fertilizer is not washed into storm drains or waterways.

, Add a tree to your yard. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, and they also improve area water quality and help make the ground more fertile for other plants.Deciduous trees carefully located near your home can also help keep your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
If you plant a fruit tree, you will have the added benefit of being able to harvest your own fruit instead of needing to buy it at a store.

, Designate an area in your yard to put your yard waste, fruit peels, and uneaten food. Find some worms who can break the waste down and produce a very rich soil that works great with your landscaping. Keep your compost heap as far from all water sources as possible.

, Ditch your noisy electric- or gas-powered leaf blower and use a rake to gather up leaves or other debris in your yard.


Similarly, use a broom instead of a hose to clean dirt from a paved area."

Buy secondhand clothes and other items.,
Donate or share usable household items.,
Upcycle.,
Buy or make a few reusable fabric bags.",How to Help Save the Environment6," Visit thrift stores and consignment shops to find secondhand clothes and other items.

, Instead of throwing away items, consider giving them away. Donate usable clothes and household items to charity. Many organizations will send a truck for pickup.


Craigslist.org is another useful resource for buying, selling, and giving away used items locally.

, Turn useless junk into something fun and cute, or fresh and funky. Make jewelry, household accessories, and restyled clothing from things you already own. Look around wikiHow to find tons of articles about how to make different things.

, Bring them with you whenever you go shopping. Many communities have banned stores from giving out plastic bags, but even if your community still allows them, move to using reusable bags instead.

Donate to an environmental cause.,
Volunteer your time.",How to Help Save the Environment7," Call or email your congressional representatives and local officials. Ask them to support environmental conservation and renewable energy.

, Most cities hold rallies to raise awareness of environmental issues. To be effective, these demonstrations need lots of people. Attend a rally in your community. Make signs to carry during the demonstration to convey your message.


Recruit family members and friends to join you.

, Choose an organization that focuses on an aspect of the environment, such as Greenpeace, the Sierra Club or the Environmental Defense Fund, and become a member., Use the news media to highlight environmental issues. Write a letter to the editor about fossil fuels or endangered animals. This can help start a dialogue in your community about a particular environmental issue.


Alternately, propose writing an opinion editorial for your local newspaper.

, Choose an organization working on an environmental issue. Donate money to this organization. Many organizations have different giving levels, from very small amounts to large amounts. Choose to give monthly or annually.


Donations to nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible. Ask for a receipt so that you can deduct this donation on your taxes.

, Pick up litter, educate others, fix bikes, start a repair cafe, plant trees, observe birds and animal populations. There are many ways you can create and promote a better environment by volunteering.

Mix a sample of the liquid with a known acid.,
Mix a sample of the liquid with a known base.,
Determine whether the liquid is safe to drink.,
Taste the liquid.",How to Know if a Liquid Is a Base or Acid1," Acids and bases are well known for neutralizing each other on contact. This neutralization reaction can be recognized because it releases heat and gas, which causes the two reactants to fizz. Choose a well known, safe acid to do this reaction. Put a sample of your liquid into a bowl or dish. Add your acid with a dropper. If you see fizz forming in the bowl, your liquid is most likely a base.Choose a dilute acid such as vinegar. Do not use strong acids.;
, Add the base to a bowl and then add your liquid to the base with a dropper. If you see the fizzing and bubbling of a neutralization reaction, your liquid is most likely an acid. There is no need to use a strong base. Something like baking soda will work well., You can distinguish acids and bases by taste, but this should never be done with “mystery liquids.” If you know what liquid you are testing, then you can decide if it is safe to drink. Only drink liquids that are intended for human consumption, e.g, water, milk, orange juice.

, If you determine that your liquid is safe to drink, taste a sample. You can distinguish acids by their sour taste (lemons are high in citric acid). Bases can be identified by a bitter taste (mustard is basic)."
"
Choose an indicator.,
Expose the indicator to a sample of liquid.,
Observe the color change.",How to Know if a Liquid Is a Base or Acid2," An indicator is a chemical (usually a type of dye) that will change colors predictably when exposed to an acid or base. Litmus will turn from blue to red in the presence of acid and from red to blue in the presence of a base. Red cabbage juice contains chemicals known as anthocyanins that turn red when exposed to acid, blue when exposed to bases, and yellow when exposed to a strong base.Your indicator can be in a liquid form, or you can use strips of paper coated with the indicator, known as pH strips.

, If you choose to use pH strips, simply dip the strip into the liquid. Allow the strip to air dry momentarily. If you choose to use a liquid indicator, put the indicator in a clear container (so that you do not distort the color). Add your liquid to the indicator by dropping it in with a dropper., Whether you use the pH strips or the liquid indicator, the color change should be the same. Some indicators, such as litmus, will only tell you if your solution is an acid or a base. Other indicators, such as red cabbage juice, can be compared to a universal indicator that will give you an approximate pH range of your liquid."
"
Choose a pH meter.,
Prepare your liquid.,
Prepare the meter.,
Measure the pH of your liquid.",How to Know if a Liquid Is a Base or Acid3," There are several different methods of measuring pH. The hydrogen electrode method is considered the most accurate standard, but is inconvenient for most applications. The most commonly used method is the glass diode method. It is easy to use and you get the same results (or close) each time you use it. If you are using very small sample sizes, you might consider a semi-conductor type pH meter., You want to make sure that your sample is as close to uniform as possible. Shake or stir the sample before measuring with the pH meter. Be sure that there are no solid particles in your sample, and that the sample is at a stable temperature. This way you will get the most accurate reading., Each meter will differ slightly, and you should follow the manual given with the meter you choose. Usually, preparation will consist of putting the one electrode in the sample and another electrode in a solution of known pH. Be sure that both electrodes are clean., Submerge both electrodes into the proper liquids. The difference in voltage between the two electrodes is related to the pH of the two solutions. This allows the meter to calculate the pH of your solution."

, When handling acids or any other strong chemicals, wearing goggles, gloves, and a lab coat is very important. Splash goggles should be used as they protect the sides of the eyes as well. The gloves and lab coat will also protect your skin and clothing.


Gloves should be made of plastic or vinyl.Pull back longer hair to avoid unintentional contact with the acid.

, Vapors released by the acid are toxic. Use a fume hood whenever possible to limit exposure.If you don’t have access to a fume hood, open all of your windows and ventilate the area with a fan.

, In the event that acid gets on your skin or in your eyes, you must flush them with running water for at least 15 minutes.Following this wash, immediately seek medical attention.


For eye splashes, keep your eyelids open moving your eyes up, down, and side to side to properly flush them.
For skin splashes, immerse the area of skin under running water for the full 15 minutes.

Store the acid and rinse the tools.",How to Dilute an Acid," Find the concentration of the acid solution on the label, or in the word problem you are working on. This number is often written in units of molarity, or molar concentration, abbreviated as M. For example, a ""6M"" acid contains six moles of acid molecules per liter. We'll call this starting concentration C1.


The formula below will also use the term V1. This is the volume of the acid we will be adding to water. We probably won't use the entire bottle of acid, though, so we don't know what this number is yet.;
, The desired concentration and volume of acid is typically determined by a school assignment or by the requirements of the laboratory you are working in. For example, we might want to dilute our acid to a concentration of 2M, and need 0.5 liters (0.1 US gal). We'll call this desired concentration C2 and the desired volume V2.


If you are using unusual units, convert them all to units of molar concentration (moles per liter) and liters before you continue.
If you are not certain what concentration or volume of acid is required, consult your teacher, a chemist, or an expert in the task you plan to use acid in.

, Whenever you prepare to dilute a solution, you can use the formula C1V1 = C2V2.words, this means ""the initial solution's concentration x its volume = the diluted solutions' concentration x its volume."" We know this is true because concentration x volume = the total amount of acid, and the total amount of acid will remain the same as it is added to the water.


In our example, we can write this formula (6M)(V1)=(2M)(0.5L).

, This term, V1, will tell us how much of the initial acid solution we need to add to water in order to end up with the desired concentration and volume. Rearrange the formula as V1=(C2V2)/(C1), then plug in the numbers you know.


In our example, we would end up with V1=((2M)(0.5L))/(6M)=1⁄6 liter (0.0 US gal). This approximately equals 0.167 liters (0.0 US gal), or 167 milliliters.

, Now that you now V1, the amount of acid you'll be using, and V2, the amount of solution you'll end up with, you can easily calculate how much water you need to make up the difference. V2 - V1 = the volume of water required.


In our case, we want to end up 0.5 liters (0.1 US gal) and will be using 0.167 liters (0.0 US gal) of acid. The amount of water we need = 0.5L - 0.167L = 0.333L, or 333 milliliters.

, International Chemical Safety Cards provide succinct, detailed safety information. Search for the exact name of the acid you will be using, such as ""hydrochloric acid,"" in the online database. Some acids may require additional safety precautions, besides those described below.


Sometimes several cards are issued, depending on the concentration and additions to the acid. Pick the one that most closely matches your initial acid solution.
If you prefer to read them in another language, select one here.

, Splash safety goggles that cover all sides of the eyes are required when handling acid. Protect your skin and clothing by wearing gloves and a lab coat or apron.


Tie up long hair before handling the acid.
Acid can take several hours to burn holes through clothing. Even if you do not notice a spill, a few drops can damage your clothing if it is not underneath a lab coat.

, Whenever possible, keep the acid solution in a functioning fume hood while you are working. This limits exposure to gaseous vapors produced by the acid, which can be corrosive or poisonous.If a fume hood is not available, open all windows and doors, or turn on a fan to ventilate the area.

, If acid gets on your eyes or skin, you'll need to flush it with cool, running water for 15–20 minutes. Don't start the dilution until you know where to find the nearest functioning eye wash station or sink.


When washing your eyes, keep your eyelids wide open. Rotate your eyes by looking up, right, down, and left to make sure all sides of your eyeball are rinsed.

, You can purchase an acid spill kit that contains all the necessary materials, or acquire neutralizers and absorbers separately. The process described here can be used for hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, or phosphoric acid, but other acids may require further research to dispose of properly:Ventilate the area by opening windows and doors, and turning on fume hoods and fans.
Apply a weak base such as sodium carbonate (soda ash), sodium bicarbonate, or calcium carbonate to the outer edges of the spill, avoiding the resulting spatter.
Continue to apply slowly, working inward, until the spill is covered.
Mix well with a plastic tool. Check the pH of the spill with litmus paper. Add more base if necessary to get the pH between 6 and 8, then flush the spill down a drain with plenty of water.

, This step is only necessary when you'll be handling extremely concentrated acid solutions, such as 18M sulfuric acid, or 12M hydrochloric acid.Cool the water you'll be using by keeping it in a container surrounded by ice for at least 20 minutes before the dilution begins.


For most dilutions, the water can be at room temperature.

, For projects involving careful measurement, such as titration, use a volumetric flask. For most practical purposes, an Erlenmeyer flask can be used instead. In either case, choose a container that can easily contain your total desired volume, with plenty of space remaining, to minimize splashes over the rim.


You don't need to carefully measure this water, as long as it came from a container that was carefully measured to contain the total required amount of water.

, If using a small volume of acid, use a graduated (Mohr) pipette or volumetric pipette with a rubber bulb on top. For larger volumes, place a funnel in the neck of the flask, and slowly pour in a small quantity of the acid using a graduated cylinder.


Never use a mouth pipette in a chemistry lab.

, Strong acids may generate lots of heat when added to water. If the acid was highly concentrated, the solution may splatter or produce corrosive fumes. If this happens, you will need to perform the entire dilution in very small doses, or cool the water in an ice bath before you continue.

, Allow the solution time to cool off between each dose, especially if you notice heat, fumes, or spatter. Continue until the required amount of acid has been added.


This amount was calculated as V1 above.

, For best results, you can stir the solution with a glass stirring rod after each addition of acid. If the size of the flask makes this impractical, stir the solution after the dilution is complete and the funnel is removed.

, Pour the acid solution you created into a clearly labeled container, preferably a PVC coated glass bottle, and store in a safe location. Rinse the flask, funnel, stirring rod, pipette, and/or graduated cylinder in water to remove all traces of acid.

Pour an aqueous sample.,
Test for alkalinity.,
Test for acidity.,
Analyze both papers.",How to Do a Litmus Test1," Pour some of your sample from its original container into a glass or beaker. This way, you will not contaminate the rest of the sample by dipping the litmus paper. Make sure that the sample you choose is aqueous (dissolved in water), otherwise the litmus test will not work.For example, orange juice is comprised primarily of water. A litmus test will be effective in this case.
Another liquid, vegetable oil, is not aqueous. Thus, the litmus test will not yield any results.;
, Dip a piece of red litmus paper into the liquid. If the paper turns blue, your liquid is a base (pH > 7). If the paper stays red, your liquid is not a base.Ruling out a base does not definitively tell you that the liquid is an acid (pH < 7). It could also be neutral (pH = 7).

, Dip a piece of blue litmus paper into the liquid. If the paper turns red, the liquid is an acid. If the paper remains blue, the liquid is either a base or is neutral., By using both tests, you can determine if the liquid is an acid, a base, or neutral. To do this, you have to analyze how each paper reacted to the liquid. For example:


Base - Red paper turns blue. Blue paper does not change.
Acid - Red paper does not change. Blue paper turns red.
Neutral - Red paper does not change. Blue paper does not change.

Wear goggles and gloves.,
Dilute the acid in proper glassware.,
Pour acid into base, always.,
Use precise amounts of acid.,
Mix acid with instructed chemicals only.",How to Use Acids Safely1," Your hands are the most likely place to be exposed to acid. Your eyes are even more vulnerable to corrosive materials than your skin. There’s no reason to risk it. Wear gloves and goggles at all times.;
, Diluting acid releases a lot of heat. Plastic containers are subject to melting during dilution. Even glass containers may crack, unless you use borosilicate glassware. Pyrex is an example of borosilicate.

, In this instance, water is also considered a base. Pouring acid into water, or other base, allows the heat generated during dilution to be more effectively dispersed. Appropriate dispersion of heat prevents cracking or melting containers and flash boiling, both of which could result in acid ending up on your skin and clothes.


When diluting sulfuric acid, you should do it in an ice bath.

, When taking acid from a large container, remove just enough to do the experiment or task. Any excess acid will have to be diluted, neutralized, and disposed of. Less left over acid will save on costs and make cleanup easier.


Never add chemicals back into the original container. This will introduce contaminants.

, If you are doing a specific experiment or task, follow the directions carefully. Find the Materials Safety Data Sheet for all chemicals used in the experiment and be sure that none of them react unpleasantly with acid (e.g. forming toxic gases, exploding, etc.). Never mix acids and bleaching agents."

Know what pH actually is.,
Define pH in an equation.,
Understand concentration.",How to Calculate a pH1," The pH is the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. A solution with a high concentration of hydrogen ions is acidic. A solution with a low amount of hydrogen ions is basic, or also known as alkaline.Hydrogen ions, also known as hydronium, are written shorthand as H+ or H3O+.


Know the pH scale. The pH scale is from 1-13. The lower the number, the more acidic the solution. The higher the number, the more basic the solution.For example, orange juice would have a pH of 2 because it is quite acidic. In contrast, bleach has a pH of 12 as it is quite basic.Numbers in the middle of the scale are often neutral, such as water, with a pH of 7.
One level of pH is a 10x difference. For example, when comparing pH 7 to pH 6, pH 6 is ten times more acidic than pH 7. Furthermore, pH 6 would be 100 times more acidic than pH 8.;
, The pH scale is calculated by a negative logarithm. A negative logarithm is simply how many times a number must be divided.The pH equation can be seen as follows: pH = -log.


The equation can sometimes be seen as pH = -log. Know that whether the equation has H3O+ or H+, they are the same.
It is not vital to have a firm understanding of what a negative log is to calculate pH. Most calculators used at high school and post secondary level will have a log button.

, Concentration is the number of particles of a compound in a solution.Concentration is commonly described in molarity. That is, moles per unit of volume (m/v or M). If you’re using a solution in a lab, the concentration will be written on the bottle. When working on your chemistry homework, the concentration will usually be given to you.

Obtain a container that will not deteriorate when the acid is added to it.,
Place the empty container into an ice bucket.,
Dilute the acid with water.,
Test the pH of the acid with pH paper or litmus paper.,
Make a neutralizing solution.,
Neutralize the dilute acid.,
Test the pH frequently.,
Dispose of the solution down the drain.",How to Dispose of Acid Safely2," Most strong acids will degrade glass and metal, but will not react with plastics.There are many different types of plastics so make sure you obtain the correct container for your acid. The acid should already be stored in such a container, but you will need a second container for diluting and neutralizing the acid.


Make sure the container can hold at least twice the volume of solution as the amount of acid you have. This allows you enough space for diluting and neutralizing the acid.
Take care not to spill any of the acid if you have to transfer it to a larger container.

, When diluting and neutralizing a strongly acidic solution, a large amount of heat is released.To limit the possibility of burns or melting the container, place your empty container into a bucket of ice.

, If you have a highly concentrated acid, you’ll want to dilute it first with water. This step can be dangerous so follow all instructions carefully. Use cold water to prevent the solution from boiling and causing splashes. Add water to the empty container. Slowly, add the acid to the water paying close attention to the temperature of the container as you do.The amount of water needed to dilute the acid is dependent upon how concentrated your solution is. The more concentrated, the more water you will need. You can calculate the exact amount by following the steps in how to dilute an acid.
Never add water directly to the acid, this can cause the water to quickly boil and splash the acid.
Take care not to spill any of the acid as you dilute it.

, pH strips can be obtained from a science supply catalog or a pool supply store. To determine how much neutralizing solution you’ll need, you must know the pH of the acid you’re trying to neutralize.


Dip the end of the pH strip into the solution. The strip will change color based on pH.
Remove the strip and compare the color to the pH chart supplied with the strips. The color that matches the strip is the pH of your solution.
The lower the pH of the acid, the more neutralizing solution you will need.

, Solutions such as sodium hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide are basic and can be added to acids to neutralize them. Sodium hydroxide is also known as lye, while magnesium hydroxide is the main ingredient in milk of magnesia. Both substances can be purchased at the store.


Follow the instructions on the container of lye to make your sodium hydroxide solution.
Milk of magnesia does not need to be altered and can be used directly to neutralize the acid.

, Basic solutions react with acidic solutions to neutralize the acid and produce water and a salt.Slowly add your basic solution a little bit at a time to the diluted acid. Gently stir as you add. Pay attention to the temperature of the container and be careful not to splash any of the solution.

, Periodically test the pH with a pH strip to make sure you don’t overshoot the goal pH range of 6.6-7.4. Continue to slowly add the salt solution until you reach the desired neutral range.


Alternatively, you can use a universal indicator solution. The liquid will change color according to pH.Add the salt solution until the indicator changes to the color around the range of pH 7.0.
If you go beyond the neutral range, slowly add a dilute acidic solution to get the pH back down to at least 7.4.

, The neutralized solution can be safely poured down the drain while running cold water.Continue to run water down the drain after the container is empty for at least 30 seconds.

The acid should already be stored in such a container, but make sure it is not completely full to prevent spills.

, Heavy metals such as cadmium, zinc, copper, mercury, and lead are toxic and cannot be added to the water system.Other inorganic compounds that are toxic and/or corrosive also cannot go down the drain.


If you have different containers of the same acid with different compounds dissolved in it, keep them in separate containers as they must be disposed of separately.

, If you are at a university or work in a laboratory, there will be a department that will properly dispose of your hazardous waste for you. If this is not an option you can contact a local organization to help you with the disposal process.

Wet two pieces of litmus paper.,
Place the papers in contact with the gas.,
Analyze the results.",How to Do a Litmus Test2," A litmus test works best with gases that are dissolved in water (an aqueous solution). To achieve this on a small scale, you only need to wet the paper with water. When the gas touches the wet paper, some of it will dissolve into solution right on the test strip., You should do this part under a fume hood. Open the container of gas and allow some of it to come in contact with both red and blue litmus paper. Use all appropriate safety precautions for the gases you are testing., The papers react to gases in the same way that they react to liquids, except that the gas reacts more evenly across the entire surface of the paper. Record the color changes of each paper. Use the data to determine if the gas is an acid, a base, or neutral.If red paper stays red - Neutral or Acid
If red paper turns blue - Base
If blue paper turns red - Acid
If blue paper stays blue - Neutral or Base

Set it out at room temperature for a few hours, and then you should be able to store it as dry litmus paper., If the paper was unchanged by the reaction, it can be reused as the same color. This means that red litmus paper would remain red litmus paper, and blue litmus paper would remain blue litmus paper. You can store them in their respective tubes until the next use., If your paper came in contact with a sample and changed colors, you can now use it as the color that it has become. Red litmus paper that turned blue can be reused as blue litmus paper. Blue litmus paper that turned red can be reused as red litmus paper."

Store acids in an acid cabinet.,
Separate oxidizers from flammable and organic materials.,
Separate acids from bases, active metals, and gas evolving compounds.,
Transport acids in a secondary container.,
Take the elevator to move acid from one floor to the next.,
Label all acids.",How to Use Acids Safely2," A non-corrosive acid cabinet is the best place to keep acids. This will help you separate acids from other chemicals. This is an important safety note, as chemicals produce vapors and what’s “in” a container does not necessarily stay there., Some acids, such as chromic acid, are strong oxidizers. This means that they will react very readily with most organic materials, as well as any strong reducers. These reactions will most likely be violent in nature and result in fire, explosion, etc., Bases and active metals (such as alkali earth metals) will react violently with acids. These chemicals are nucleophilic (proton deficient), and acids donate protons by definition. You should also keep acids separate from any reagents that will mix with an acid to form toxic gases. Bleach is a perfect example., Most acids (but not all) are stored in glass containers. You should place those containers in an unbreakable secondary container, such as a plastic crate. This will prevent accidentally shattering the glass and spilling acid.

, Shaking and jarring containers of acid could certainly be considered pushing your luck. Using an elevator is much safer than using stairs, however, only the person transporting the acid should be in the elevator. Should there be an accident, fewer people trapped in the elevator is better.

, Labeling acids (and all chemicals) is a good way to remember what material is stored in each bottle. Even if you are sure you won’t forget, someone else may come along and mistakenly pick up your bottle. This is an important safety step that should not be ignored."

Dilute concentrated acids before attempting to neutralize them.,
Neutralize acids before disposal.,
Flush the acids down the sink.",How to Use Acids Safely3," Concentrated acids react violently with bases. By diluting the acid, you will make it easier to neutralize safely. Slowly add the acid to a large volume of water (roughly twenty times the volume of the acid).

, Use sodium carbonate to neutralize the acid. For inorganic acids, the neutralization is complete when the solution no longer bubbles as a result of adding more sodium carbonate. For organic acids, you will need to check the solution with pH strips to confirm neutralization.

, You can safely pour the acid down the sink after being neutralized. Best practice is to flush down the drain with twenty times the as much water. So, if you had 10 milliliters (0.34  fl oz) of solution, you would flush it with 200 milliliters (6.8  fl oz) of water.

Obtain a Materials Safety Data Sheet for each acid.,
Dress appropriately for handling corrosive materials.,
Leave food and drink out of the lab.,
Locate the shower and eyewash before starting.",How to Use Acids Safely4," The Materials Safety Data Sheet is a reference sheet that contains information on a particular chemical. It will include warnings (corrosive, explosive, flammable, etc.). It will also suggest proper safety techniques for using that particular chemical. This is the ultimate reference for the safe use of any chemical, including acids., Acids are corrosive by nature. Some more so than others. You should wear pants, closed toed shoes, and long sleeves if you plan to work with acids. You should also wear a lab apron to prevent acid from getting on your clothing and eating through it.

, Food and drink can contaminate your experiment. You also run the risk of getting acid in your food or drink if you bring it into the lab. Standard practice in all labs is to leave food and drink outside., If you are exposed to acid, you will need to rinse it off your skin thoroughly. Labs are equipped with both a shower and an eyewash that will allow you to rinse yourself in case of an accident. Never try to neutralize acid on your skin. This can cause more extreme damage.


If acid comes in contact with the eyes, wash the eyes as quickly as possible, as acid can cause serious burns in 15 seconds. Hold the eyelids open, and wash the eyes in an eyewash for fifteen minutes.
Wash away acid that comes in contact with skin. Remove clothing, then shower for fifteen minutes.
If acid is ingested, you should drink water and consumable bases such as milk of magnesia. Do not try to dilute with strong bases. Do not induce vomiting.

Remember the pH equation.,
Identify the actual concentration.,
Solve the equation.",How to Calculate a pH2," The pH equation is as follows: pH = -log.Ensure you know what all terms in the equation represent. Look at which term is used for concentration.

, Read over your chemistry question. Identify the concentration of the acid or base. Write down the entire equation on paper with the known values represented in the equation.Always include units to avoid confusion.


For example, if the concentration is 1.05 x 10^5 M, write the pH equation as: pH = -log, When solving the pH equation, you must use a scientific calculator. First, hit the “negative” button. It is usually written as “+/-”. Now key in the “log” button. Your screen should display “-log”.Now hit an open bracket and enter in your concentration. Don’t forget to add exponents when necessary.Follow with a closed bracket.At this point, you should see “-log(1.05x10^5). Hit solve. Your pH should be 5.

"
"
Identify the known unknowns.,
Rearrange the equation.,
Solve the equation.,
Think about your answer.",How to Calculate a pH3," First write out the pH equation. Next, identify the values you have by writing them directly below your equation. For example, if you know the pH is a value of 10.1, write it on the paper below the pH equation.

, Rearranging the equation will require a strong understanding of algebra. To calculate concentration from pH, you must recognize that concentration needs to be on one side of the equal sign alone. Start by moving the pH onto one side, and hydronium ion concentration to the other. Keep in mind that the negative sign with the log will travel together with the hydronium ion, making it an addition of hydronium on the opposite said.. Then subtract the pH from the left side and add it as an exponent to the right.


For example, pH = -logwill mold into += log^-pH. Note that the pH value has become an inverse log. pH can then be filled in as 10.1

, When working with inverse log, the calculator process is unique. Remember that log is a type of multiplication by 10. To enter your equation, key in 10. Next, hit the “EXP” exponent button. Key in the negative sign followed by the value. Hit solve.


For example we have a pH value of 10.1. Key in “10” followed by “EXP.” Now key in “-/+” to have our value be negative. Finally, key in the pH of “10.1”. Hit solve. You should get 1e-100. This means our concentration is 1.00 x 10^-100 M.

, Does the above answer make sense? If you have a pH of 10.1, you know the hydronium ions should be very small as 10.1 is a basic solution.Therefore, having such a miniscule number for concentration does infact, make sense.

Chart the changes in pressure.,
Predict rain if the air pressure is falling.,
Forecast improving weather when air pressure rises.,
Forecast fine weather when air pressure is steady.",How to Set a Barometer," There are three types of barometers that can be purchased. If you own an antique barometer is most likely mercury or aneroid. Aneroid or electronic barometers are more commonly available for purchase. Before purchasing a barometer, check their altitude usage. Not all barometers function properly at high altitudes so buy one that can specifically be used at altitude if you live high above sea level. Here are some brief descriptions of each type of barometer:Mercury: The mercury barometer, sometimes called stick barometer, was the first to be invented. It uses an open tube system with a pool of mercury that raises and lowers with pressure changes. They only work at an altitude up to 1,000 feet.Aneroid: The aneroid barometer doesn’t use any liquids. It uses a small box made from beryllium and copper that expands or contracts based on pressure changes. These motions cause mechanical hands to move pointing towards the current air pressure.
Electronic: Electronic barometers are a little more complicated to understand, but they employ sensors and strain gauges that cause changes in voltage that can be converted to a display of pressure for the user.;
, If using an aneroid barometer, you will need calibrate it to your location. Listen to a local weather forecast to find the current barometer pressure for your location. Make sure the reading is correct for your location. Even a few miles can affect a barometer reading.


Setting your barometer to your location will take into account differences in pressure caused by the altitude of your location.
The factory setting for aneroid barometers is at sea level, but if you don’t live at sea level, you will need to calibrate it., Locate the small adjusting screw on the back of your barometer. With a small screwdriver, turn the adjusting screw to move the hand to your location's current pressure. Watch the face of the dial and stop turning the screwdriver when the hand reaches the appropriate reading.


If you are using a mercury barometer, you will have to use a conversion for your readings.
Digital barometers have sensors to calibrate altitude automatically.

, It makes no difference whether the barometer is hung on an inside or an outside wall. The pressure will be the same no matter where it hangs.Avoid locations that have frequent temperature changes such as near a bathroom or heater.


Well-sealed and air-conditioned rooms are not as affected by changes in air pressure, so avoid these rooms if possible.
Avoid a location that is exposed to direct sunlight as the temperature changes can affect the readings.
Hang the barometer away from drafty locations, like near a door or a window. Air pressure is too variable in these locations.

, If you suspect inaccurate readings, you can check your barometer with an easy trick. With the barometer hanging on the wall, slowly slide the bottom of it sideways to a 45-degree angle.If you have a stick barometer, the mercury should rise to the top of the tube and produce an audible ""tick"" sound that you may also feel. The tube should fill with mercury.
If you have an aneroid barometer, the indicator hand should rotate clockwise around the dial.
If your barometer fails this test, you may need to have it professionally serviced and re-set before you can count on its accuracy. However, most barometers can last years with no servicing.

, Turn the barometer's center knob so that the arrow rests directly above the indicator arrow (this is the current barometric pressure for your location). You can identify the set hand by its notched arrow about halfway down the hand.The set hand will serve as a reference that allows you to easily tell if the pressure is steady, rising or falling.
Remember, this hand will only be present on an aneroid barometer. If you have an electronic barometer, you can simply check the reading.
If you have a mercury barometer, you will need to correct for altitude if you’re above sea level.

, To accurately measure the air pressure using a stick barometer, you will need to correct for your altitude using a conversion chart.Look at the barometer at eye level and record the number next to the top of the mercury. This is the pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).


Find your elevation and then use to the chart to find the relevant correction factor. Add the correction factor to the reading on the barometer. This reading should match the reading of the local weather service.
If you are at an elevation of over 1,000 ft, stick barometers do not work., Predicting weather using a barometer is all about changes in air pressure. You want to check the reading every few hours to determine if the pressure is changing or staying the same.


If using an aneroid or mercury barometer, gently tap the face of the barometer to release any pressure changes stored in the mechanisms. Take the reading after the needle or mercury has stopped moving.
Move the set hand if the pressure has changed so the next time you check it will be obvious what direction the air pressure is going.

, Keep a journal of all the readings you take with your barometer. Sketch a small graph for the changes in a day to help with your forecasting. Is the pressure rising? Falling? Staying the same? This is all important information for predicting the weather.Do not expect large changes in the movement of needle. Daily changes are usually between 0.02 and 0.10 of an inch using the barometer scale. Larger variations may occur in winter and are dependent upon location and altitude.Take frequent readings (every few hours) and plot them on your graph.

, Generally, if the pressure is falling, the weather is taking a turn towards storms and rain. The starting point of the reading is also important in the forecast. Higher readings indicate better weather even if the pressure is falling.If the reading is over 30.2 inches of mercury and falling rapidly, this indicates cloudy, but warmer weather.
If the reading is between 29.8 and 30.2 inches of mercury and falling rapidly, rain is most likely on the way.
If it’s under 29.8 inches of mercury and falling slowly, rain is likely; if it’s falling rapidly, a storm is imminent.

, As the air pressure rises, the weather tends to improve as the high pressure systems moves through your location.Readings over 30.2 inches of mercury that rise indicate that the weather will continue to be fair.Readings between 29.8 and 30.2 inches of mercury that rise indicate that the weather will remain whatever it presently is.
Readings under 29.8 inches of mercury that rise indicate that the weather is clearing, but will be cooler.

, Steady air pressure indicates long periods of nice weather and suggests that you will be experiencing more of the same. If it’s sunny and the pressure is holding, expect more sunshine! Higher pressures indicate warmer weather, while lower pressures indicate cooler weather.A strong high pressure system is around 30.4 inches of mercury. Anything above 30 is considered high pressure.A typical low pressure system is around 29.5 inches of mercury. Anything below 29.9 is considered low pressure.

Just like a map or a compass rose, a wind barb plot is typically drawn with north at 0° and south at 180°. You can learn the direction of the wind by reading the angle of the barb vector in degrees. The dotted end of a wind barb staff shows where the wind is going, while the top or ""feathered"" end shows where the wind is coming from.A wind barb vector that points to 135°, in the bottom-right quadrant of the plot, indicates that the wind is blowing southeast.
A wind barb vector at 270°, pointing to the left of the graph at a right angle to north, is blowing due west.;
, You can tell how hard the wind is blowing by looking at the ""barb,"" line, or symbol at the end of each wind direction vector. Wind barbs use a kind of tallying system, and each distinct shape/line length denotes a different speed.A small, open circle indicates that the winds are calm.This usually means that the wind speed is less than 2 miles per hour.A single short line (half line) or ""feather"" represents 5 knots of wind speed.
A single long line (full line) or ""feather"" represents 10 knots.
A fully blackened triangle, ""pennant,"" or ""flag"" on the barb represents 50 knots of wind speed. If there are more lines or symbols next to the fin, then the wind speed is greater than 50 knots., If the wind speed is anything other than 5, 10, 15, 20, or 50, then you will need to read the speed from a combination of symbols. The symbols should begin with the highest relevant barb, at the end of the wind vector. Thus: if the wind speed is greater than 50, then the tally will begin with a black triangle. If it is less than 50, then the tally will begin with a line.


Two full lines in parallel would represent 20 knots of wind speed. One full line and one half line would represent 15 knots. Three full lines and one half line would represent 35 knots.
One black triangle and three full lines would represent 80 knots of wind speed. Three black triangles, two full lines, and one half line would represent 175 knots.

Gather the materials.,
Cut your aluminum can.,
Check your weather forecast.,
Determine where you'll measure dew point.",How to Measure Dew Point1," You will need an aluminum beverage can, scissors, water, ice and a thermometer to complete this method of measuring dew point. For a larger experiment you can use a bucket. Use a larger bucket if you plan to demonstrate this experiment in front of a larger audience.


You might also benefit from having a pencil and paper to record your results.;
, If you are using a can of soda, you’ll need to cut off the top portion of the lid. For a clean cut, use a can opener. Be gentle and take your time or else you may have sharp aluminum protruding out.

, Check a weather source to see if they call for clouds. If the air temperature is higher than the dew point, you won’t be able to see the clouds.You may have better results if there are clouds on the day of your experiment. The ideal day is a cool, but not too cold of a day when the clouds are present.


Aim for sixty degree weather. You can still proceed with your experiment if the weather is colder or warmer.
Look up the dew point temperature of your area to test your experiment.

, Relocate to an environment in which you wish to measure the current dew point; i.e. a particular interior or exterior area of your home or office. The temperature where you conduct the experiment should be well above freezing.


You’ll need to add salt to your experiment if your location is below freezing."

Check weather records for trends.,
Develop a homemade weather station.,
Identify cloud types.,
Use natural conditions to predict the weather.",How to Tell if It Will Snow2," Weather conditions vary significantly from year to year, but recognizable patterns for given regions appear over time as well. If you are going to predict snowfall on your own, know the average temperatures and precipitation rates for your region.


The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration provides searchable information regarding average temperature and precipitation by month and year for the continental United States, WeatherDB provides a searchable index of average snowfall in U.S. cities, and Weather Underground also offers searchable records of weather history).

, You can predict weather through measurable changes in the atmosphere. With a barometer, an anemometer, a weather vane, a screened thermometer, and a rain gauge you can make reliable short-term predictions. Gathering your own data will allow you to refine general forecasts for greater local specificity.


Learn how to set a barometer and how to read a weather map in order to track changing weather conditions for yourself.Typically, falling atmospheric pressure signals coming precipitation. If air temperatures are right, precipitation will fall as snow (typically between -2° and 2°C or 28° and 35°F).
You can purchase an all-in-one digital device that performs the functions of each of the instruments necessary for a functional weather station. Models can cost between $150 and $2,500 depending on quality and complexity.You can build your own instruments from common items., The appearance of clouds alone does not mean that there will be snowfall. Certain clouds, however, are more likely to bring snowfall than others. You can learn how to recognize clouds in order to anticipate precipitation.Cirrus clouds typically are accompanied by fair weather, while stratus clouds can bring light precipitation and cumulus clouds can bring heavier precipitation.

, If you are hiking, you may need to predict weather without the tools to make measurements or access to reliable forecasts. Recognize the reliable predictions that can be made following directly observable trends.


Learn dangerous weather patterns for the region in which you live or are traveling.Old sayings lack complexity, but can help you get a general sense for coming weather. Look to the eastern sky to see whether the air is dry: “Red sky at night, sailors delight. Red Sky in morning, sailors take warning.”Or, gauge air pressure by noting how high geese fly: “If the goose honks high, fair weather. If the goose honks low, foul weather.”

Find wind barbs for your area.,
Overlay wind barbs onto a compass or another orientating guide.,
Convert wind speed from knots.,
Use wind barbs to evaluate wind safety.",How to Read Wind Barbs2," Run a web search for ""wind barbs "" or visit the website for a local weather station.Read the wind direction that the wind barbs show. The direction of the main line of the wind barbs shows you the direction from which the wind is coming.


Remember: the orientation of the line from the compass represents the incoming direction – not which way the wind is blowing. This designation can be confusing if you aren't used to it.

, In order to interpret wind direction, you will need to know which way is north. Wind barbs are usually provided within a directional context – but if not, make sure you orient them with north at the top.

, Wind barbs almost always display wind speed in terms of knots. However, it may come in handy to know the wind speed in another unit of velocity. One knot is equal to 1.15 miles per hour (mph) and 1.9 kilometers per hour (kph).In order to calculate miles per hour, simply add 15% to the value in knots.60 knots to mph: 15% of 60 is 9. 60+9 = 69 . Thus, 60 knots is equivalent to 69 mph.

, When you know how fast the wind is going, you can apply the measurement to various safety measures. Notably, this includes burn bans and other effective fire prevention strategies.

Fill the can with warm water.,
Fill a separate container with ice.,
Transfer your supplies to the location.,
Record the starting temperature.,
Add the ice water.,
Continue until dew is formed.,
Record your data.",How to Measure Dew Point2," Take your can or bucket and fill it 3/4ths of the way full with warm tap water. There is no need to use filtered water and heat it in the microwave. Get your faucet’s water to be above room temperature, but not scalding hot (about 85 degrees Fahrenheit).


Place the thermometer into the aluminum can.

, Use any glass or cup around you and fill it with ice. You don’t want to add ice directly to the warm water. Add some regular tap water to create ice water. It is better for the experiment to add ice water instead of full ice cubes.

, Bring all your supplies to the location where you plan to conduct the experiment. Have a friend assist you to bring the supplies to the location you decided on. Be careful not to spill any of the liquids or break the thermometer.

, When conducting scientific experiments and measurements, it’s best to record the starting temperature. Look at the thermometer in the cup and jot down the starting temperature and time.The temperature should be around 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Use a small spoon or syringe to add the ice water to the cup to effectively lower the can's surface temperature. Avoid adding pieces of ice to the can. To get the most accurate reading, you’ll need to transfer the ice water slowly. As you add the ice water, stir the mixture gently.


Keep your eye on the surface of the aluminum cup., Keep adding ice water to the warm cup until you notice dew or perspiration on the side of the can. This is the moment you’ve been waiting for. Once dew has formed on the outside of the cup, the liquid in the cup has reached the dew point., Right when you notice dew on the outside of the cup, record the temperature into your notes. You should also record the outside temperature or the temperature of wherever you are conducting the experiment.


It is also a good idea to record the time to determine how how long it took to form dew.

Choose or make a hygrometer.,
Select a representative location for measurement.,
Acclimate the hygrometer to the environment.,
Take regular measurements of humidity.,
Calibrate the hygrometer, if necessary.",How to Measure Humidity1," Deciding which hygrometer to use depends on what you are using the humidity measurements for. If you are just curious about humidity in your home, you can make a very simple hygrometer using the wet/dry bulb thermometer system. If you need to accurately assess the humidity of your environment for preservation or scientific reasons, purchasing a proper hygrometer is a better idea. Consider the following questions before you purchase your hygrometer:Does it need to survive in extreme hot or cold temperatures?
Does it need to run on battery power or will it be near a power outlet?
Do you need an alarm to detect if the environment goes above or below a certain percentage of humidity?
Is it easy to re-calibrate?
Is it expensive? Does it require a lot of maintenance?
Is it easy to understand and use?;
, Once you have chosen your hygrometer, you need to pick a good location to keep it. Humidity measurements are dependent on temperature so choose a location that does not experience frequent temperature fluctuations.Place the hygrometer in a location that has a consistent temperature similar to the rest of the room.


Avoid placing the hygrometer near doors, heaters, humidifiers, or air conditioners.

, To get the most accurate readings, you must leave the hygrometer in your chosen location for a few hours so it can reach the ambient temperature of the environment. Taking a reading just after placement will likely result in an inaccurate reading.

, If you are trying to determine if you have humidity fluctuations in your home, take readings every few hours or days. This will allow you to chart the humidity levels over time.


Note that as air gets warmer, it can hold increasingly more moisture. The higher the temperature, the higher the relative humidity.

, Typically, a hygrometer needs to be calibrated about once a year. Calibration involves comparing the readings of your instrument to that of a calibrated reference sample and adjusting yours to match. Calibration is most important for scientific or research work. In this case, the hygrometer must be sent to a special facility for calibration.


If you are using a homemade hygrometer, you can leave your hygrometer outside and check it against the reported readings for the day.

Avoid touching the coral reef.,
Don’t stir up sediment from the bottom.,
Don’t take souvenirs.,
Perfect diving skills.,
Avoid anchoring a boat to a reef.",How to Protect Coral Reefs when Snorkeling1," This includes walking or standing on coral. Coral is fragile and merely brushing it can kill a whole colony. If you want to protect the coral, you’ll look but not touch., This can harm the coral and disrupt the ecology of the reef. Stay away from the bottom when you dive.Diving training should tell you how to control your buoyancy when diving., Taking anything natural from the ocean can disrupt the ecology. Breaking off a piece of coral will likely kill it and is illegal in some places, including Hawaii. Take pictures, not coral when you dive., It’s best to take a diving training course before snorkeling. Not only does this help you protect yourself, it helps you protect the coral reef. Clumsy diving can be as bad for coral as intentionally touching or breaking the coral. Instead keep your distance until you can control your buoyancy, speed, etc., when snorkeling., When snorkeling, anchor in sandy moorings or rocky locations. Better yet, use a mooring system when it’s available. Anchoring a boat to the reef can be irrevocably harmful to the reef."

Find a clear, cylindrical container.,
Make a container.,
Weigh your gauge down with pebbles.,
Inscribe a scale upon your container.,
Place it under the open sky, on level ground.,
Check your gauge every day.,
Mark the amount of rainfall on a graph or chart.,
Empty the rain gauge.,
Calculate the averages.",How to Measure Rain," This cylinder can be either glass or plastic, and should be at least 12 inches tall. The shape is important: if the top is wider than the bottom (or narrower) it will require much more calculation and measurement.


It doesn’t actually matter how wide container is, so long as it’s the same diameter all the way through. As the volume of the container gets bigger—from say, a coke can to a mop bucket—so does the area which collects the rain. Because of this, one inch of rainfall will be recorded consistently between cylinders of varying sizes.;
, If you don’t have a cylinder on hand, you can make an equally effective gauge with an empty 2-liter soda bottle and little work. Using scissors or a knife, cut the top 4 inches of the bottle off. Don't worry about the uneven bottom of the bottle. That will be taken care of in the next step.

, Because rain will often be accompanied by wind, you’ll want to steady your gauge so that it can stay upright through a storm. Fill the bottom with pebbles or marbles, but don’t go higher than an inch or so. Once that’s been done, you’ll want to fill your container with water, to provide a level starting point for your scale. Your weights will be taking up volume, and so we don’t want them included in the measurable area.Rocks, stones, marbles: any small, relatively heavy objects will do, as long as it won’t absorb any of the water.
If you’ve created your own gauge with a soda bottle, make sure the entire bottom (the four separated points of the base) is filled with water and stones, to provide a flat starting point for your scale.
As an alternative to placing pebbles in your gauge, you could place it within a sturdy container, such as a heavy bucket or flowerpot.

, This can be done with a waterproof sharpie. Hold a ruler or measuring tape up against your bottle, and line its zero up with the current water level of your gauge. Your scale’s zero should also be at this water level.


If you’ve opted to go pebble-free and are going to place your rain gauge inside a flower pot, you won’t have any water in your gauge yet. In this case, zero will be at the bottom of your container.

, You need level ground to lessen the chance of your gauge tipping over. Ensure your gauge has no obstructions above it, e..g trees or eaves, as these will disrupt your measurements., To determine how much rain has fallen in the previous 24 hours, you’ll need to regularly check it every 24 hours! Read the gauge by looking at the waterline straight on, at eye level. The water line's surface will be curved; this is the meniscus, formed as the water comes in contact with the container and creates surface tension.Your reading needs to be from the bottom of the curve.


It’s important to check it every day even if there hasn’t been any rain. You can lose water from evaporation, and water mysteriously showing up in your rain gauge without the accompanying rain clouds might mean your rain gauge needs a new spot (sprinklers are a common culprit).

, For example, you could make a 7 x 7 chart, marking the days of the week along the x-axis and 1 to 7 inches (2.5 to 17.8 cm) along the y-axis. After filling in a dot at each appropriate intersection of rainfall (in inches) and the day of the week, you can use a ruler to connect the dots and see the fluctuations in the rain measurement for that week.

, After each recording, you’ll want to empty the rain gauge to ensure an accurate reading. Ensure you keep the same stones in your gauge, and refill water up to the zero on your scale. If you ever add or subtract stones from your gauge, ensure the water is again filled to the zero point before setting your rain gauge back in place.

, Once you’ve recorded data for a month, you can analyze your data and see overall rainfall trends. Adding up the rainwater of all 7 days in a week, then dividing it by 7, will give you the average rainfall of that week. Over a longer period of time, you could do this for months (or even years, if you’re particularly dedicated).


The formula for finding an average is easy to apply. The average equals the sum of all the items (in this case, rainfall measurements for a day, week, or month) divided by the number of items (however many days, weeks, or months you’ve added up).If you're looking for average weekly rainfall over 4 weeks, with recorded weekly rainfall totals of 20 inches, 12 inches, 6 inches, and 25 inches, we would say 20 + 12 + 6 + 25 = 63 (the sum of the items) / by 4 (the number of weeks) = 15.75 inches average weekly rainfall.

Determine how much water vapor is in the air.,
Determine how much water vapor the air can hold.,
Divide the actual mixing ratio by the saturation mixing ratio.",How to Measure Humidity2," This can be expressed as the ratio of grams of water vapor to the number of kilograms of dry air. This is called the actual mixing ratio. This data can be obtained online as measured from instruments such as a microwave water radiometer.Measuring the water vapor in the air is not something that can be done with household items.

, This is the point at which the air would be saturated with moisture and is called the saturation mixing ratio. The amount of water vapor the air can hold is dependent upon the temperature of the air. Tables are available online that will tell you the capacity of water vapor at a specific temperature.The higher the temperature, the higher the water vapor capacity., This simple calculation produces the relative humidity. Thus, if the air currently holds 20 grams of water per kilogram of dry air and can hold 40 grams of water per kilogram of dry air, the relative humidity would be 20/40, or 50 percent.

Fill a metal can with water.,
Add ice cubes, continuously stirring until condensation forms on the can’s surface.,
Read the temperature on the thermometer.",How to Measure Humidity3," The can should have a shiny surface to reflect light and heat away. Metal is the best material to use for this particular experiment. Fill the can about 2/3 full, leaving enough space to add ice cubes.

, Add the cubes gradually, stirring the ice water mixture with a thermometer as you do so. This will keep the can surface the same temperature as the water.


Continue adding ice, a few cubes at a time. Stir after each addition until the cubes have melted. Keep adding ice until you see water condense on the outside of the can.

, This is the dew point temperature. The dew point is the temperature at which water completely saturates the air and water vapor condenses.The can and water are a simplified form of a chilled mirror hygrometer, a device with electronic sensors which meteorologists use to measure dew point. The higher the dew point temperature, the more someone will feel the moisture in the air.

Avoid feeding the marine life.,
Don’t disturb the fish.,
Use fish-safe sunscreen.,
Remove trash when diving.",How to Protect Coral Reefs when Snorkeling2," This can disrupt natural fish behavior and food chains. Fish have plenty of food in the reefs, and don’t need help. If you’re goal is to see the fish more closely, learn how to blend in with the environment, so that the fish aren’t startled by your presence., Disturbing the fish and other marine life harms the ecology of coral reefs. It can disrupt feeding patterns, mating behavior, among other important biological functions. It’s best not to chase, scare, or handle the fish in any way., Fish-safe and biodegradable sunscreen is a must when snorkeling. Snorkeling involves coming in close contact with a lot of marine life, and fish-safe sunscreen helps protect that sea life.Try to find a sunscreen that is labeled as fish-safe and reef-safe, as well as biodegradable. Also, avoid the following ingredients, many of which contribute to the harm of coral reefs, and are often problematic for humans as well:cyclopentasiloxane
cyclomethicone
benzophenone-3 (oxybenzone)
homosalate
microbeads
nano particles
octocrylene
octinoxate
parabens
octyl methoxycinnamate
methylisothiazolinone
formaldehyde
diazolidinyl urea
quaternium-15
DMDM hydantoin
hydroxymethylglycinate
phthalates
sodium lauryl and laureth sulfate
zinc oxide.

, One the best ways you can help the environment and the marine life is by removing trash when you go snorkeling. Trash is a big problem for ocean health, so every little bit helps. Be careful not to damage the coral when removing trash. Only remove recognizable normal trash.Keep the following guidelines in mind when removing trash:If you are unsure of an item’s identity, don’t touch. Rather, report it to local authorities.
You should not touch human remains or potential hazardous materials when removing trash. Instead, call 911 to report the remains or hazardous materials.
If you discover a large piece of wreckage or other large item, call 911 to report it. If the item poses a navigational hazard, contact the Coast Guard immediately. You can do this through VHF-FM Ch. 16 or 2182 MHz by radio or 510-437-3701 by phone. You should not move the wreckage.

Use reef-friendly snorkeling and diving companies.,
Go local.,
Take underwater pictures and share them.",How to Protect Coral Reefs when Snorkeling3," Some local tourism sites include information about reef-friendly businesses.The Coral Reef Alliance lists its partners (though it does not list reef-friendly businesses, per se). Do your research, and search reviews of any snorkeling company you are thinking of using to see if they give divers information about buoyancy and reef protection., Going local when buying snorkeling products and services helps limit consumption as well as your carbon footprint when snorkeling. Pollution as a result of excess consumption and the transport of goods is directly harmful for coral reefs. So, going local means that you’ll be protecting the reefs in additional ways while snorkeling. They also have the added advantage of being invested in the area, the community, and perhaps even the coral reef itself., By taking pictures you help to document the health and biodiversity in the coral reefs. By sharing the photos, you help raise awareness for coral reefs. You can help people understand the reef’s beauty as well as the danger it faces with pollution, consumption, and climate change."

Air pressure is a very important component of forecasting the weather, but air is microscopic and difficult to read with the naked eye. Air pressure occurs when the weight of tiny particles of air, known as air molecules, pushes down on an area. When air is compressed, it is placed under high pressure and indicates a change in the weather.When the barometer is rising, it means the weather is sunny and dry. When the barometer is falling, this means the weather will be stormy and wet.;
, To make a barometer at home, you will need the following supplies:


A small coffee can
Plastic wrap
A pair of scissors
Tape
A straw
An index card
A rubber band

, Then, secure the plastic wrap with a rubber band around the top so it forms an airtight seal over the coffee can.

, It should be in the center of the can, widthwise, dividing the can into two half circles., Divide the card in two and write “high pressure” on the top portion of the card. Then, write “low pressure” on the bottom portion of the card., You may need to trim the straw so the card can sit behind the can. Use tape to attach the index card to the can., Note where the straw sits on the index card, in “high pressure” or “low pressure” when you first attach it to the can. Place the can outside and note when it rises or falls.High pressure will cause the plastic wrap to dip, leading to a rise in the straw. Low pressure will cause the plastic wrap to puff up, leading to a drop in the straw.

, An anemometer helps weather scientists to measure wind speed. This instrument rotates at the same speed as the wind and provides a direct measurement of the speed of the wind.Wind speeds are typically measured using the Beaufort Wind Scale, with a 0-12 scale based on visual cues. You can learn to identify calm, gentle, moderate, and strong breezes with your homemade anemometer.

, To make an anemometer, you will need the following supplies:Four plastic cups of the same color, such as Dixie or Solo cups
One plastic cup of a different color
Two long strips of stiff cardboard
A pen
A pencil with an eraser on one end
A ruler
A stapler
A push pin
A watch with a second hand or timer
A small fan
A calculator

, Then, use the stapler to staple them together. Staple them in the center of the plus sign so they hold their shape.

, Hold the ruler on one cardboard piece and draw a line down the center of the cardboard. Then, do the same on the other piece of cardboard. Note where the lines intersect on the cardboard pieces., Use the different colored cup as one of the four cups. Staple the cups onto the cardboard so they are on their sides, facing the same direction in relation to the cardboard pieces., Then, push the eraser part of the pencil into the pin sticking out of the center of the cardboard pieces.Use the scissors to poke a small hole in the bottom of the remaining cup. Slide the pencil into this cup.
The barometer should now stand upright, supported by the pencil in the cup. There should be four cups on the ends of the cardboard pieces, all on their sides and facing the same way.

, Then, turn it on at low speed. Use the stopwatch to count the number of rotations that occur in 15 seconds. Multiply this number by four to determine the number of rotations per minute.Use the different colored cup as a marker for one rotation, where one rotation is every time the different colored cup comes all the way around. This will help you to count the rotations accurately.
You can also test the barometer outside to get an air pressure reading. Make a chart that has two columns, one for the time interval and one for the number of spins. You can then record the time interval and the number of spins within that time interval. Multiple this number by four to determine the number of rotations per minute and then multiple the same number by 60 to determine the number of rotations per an hour.

, This instrument measures how much moisture is in the air or the relative humidity in an environment. It uses the cooling effect of evaporation to determine the relative humidity.Relative humidity is the ratio of water vapor in the air relative to the amount that could possibly be there, at a certain temperature. When you walk through fog, for example, you are experiencing 100% humidity. If you walk through a desert, you are experiencing around 10% humidity., To make your own sling psychrometer at home, you will need:Cotton gauze, in pads rather than balls
A pair of scissors
A small rubber band
A ½ liter plastic soda bottle
Clear plastic tape
Two red alcohol Celsius thermometers
Water
An 18 inch piece of string

, Use the water to moisten the gauze. This will help you capture moisture in your sling psychrometer.Cover one bulb of the thermometers with the wet gauze using a rubber band.

, Take the thermometer covered in gauze and place it on one side of the plastic bottle. Then, secure it there with tape.Take the other thermometer and attach it to the other side of the bottle using tape. Make sure you can still see the numbers and the red alcohol in the thermometers.

, Make sure the string is tied well on the the top of the bottle, as you will be holding it and spinning it to get a reading on your sling psychrometer.Hold tightly to the end of the string and spin the bottle in a circle in an open air. Do this for one minute. Then, record the temperatures on both thermometers.

, Record the two temperatures and then subtract the two temperatures to determine the temperature difference. You will likely find that the thermometer with the wet gauze will always have a lower temperature than the thermometer with the dry bulb.The wet bulb temperature will always be lower than the dry bulb because water evaporates from the wet bulb when you spin the two thermometers. The evaporation then cools the wet bulb. The drier the air is, the more water will evaporate from the wet bulb, leading to a higher temperature difference between the wet and dry bulb.
For example, you spin the sling psychrometer outside and the dry thermometer has a temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. You get a wet bulb temperature reading of 12 degrees celsius. This is a difference of 10 degrees, which means there is 29% relative humidity outside.
If the weather is very humid one day, you may get a dry bulb temperature of 22 degrees Celsius and a wet bulb temperature of 21 degrees Celsius. Because there is very little water evaporation on the wet bulb, this indicates that there is high humidity outside, or 92% relative humidity.

, This instrument will help you determine the direction from which the wind is blowing. The direction of the wind is an important element of predicting the weather, as the wind brings the weather to a certain area.The wind vane works by spinning and pointing in the direction from which the wind is blowing. This instrument has two parts or ends, one that is shaped like an arrow and turns into the wind and one wide end that catches the breeze. The arrowed end will indicate which direction the wind is blowing, for example, North, South, East, or West. You must be aware of where North, South, East, and West are relative to your location to use a wind vane properly.

, To make a wind vane at home, you will need the following supplies:A manila file folder
A pin
A pair of scissors
Glue
A pencil with an eraser
A straw
Modeling clay
A paper plate

, Use the manila folder to cut out an arrow point that is 5cm long. Then, cut out a tail for the arrow that is 7cm long.Take the straw and make 1cm cuts on each end of the straw. Form the arrow by sliding the arrow point on one end of the straw and the arrow tail on the other end of the straw.

, Do this by pushing the pin through the middle of the straw and then into the eraser on the pencil.Push the sharp end of the pencil into a small lump of modeling clay to form the base of the wind vane.

, Take the paper plate and write the four directions, North, South, East, and West on each end of the plate.Place the clay base, with the arrow attached, in the center of the paper plate.

, You can do this by blowing directly on the wind vane and noting if the arrow spins freely when you blow on it.You can also use a compass to determine the wind direction outside. Do this by placing the wind vane and the plate outside on a flat surface. Then, use the compass to determine where North is and set the plate so it faces the correct direction.
Observe the wind vane. If it becomes very windy, hold down the paper plate so the vane does not blow away. Note the direction the arrow points to as the wind blows and check the direction on the paper plate to determine the wind direction outside. For example, if the arrow is pointing west, the wind is blowing from the west.

, This instrument will help you determine the amount of rainfall within a specific period of time. The amount of rainfall is important in meteorology because it lets weather scientists know how much rainfall there was for a specific day or period of time and provides information on changes in rainfall from year to year or season to season., To make a rain gauge at home, you will need the following supplies:


A cylinder shaped jar that is clear, such as an olive jar
A clear plastic ruler
A rubber band
A plastic funnel
Clear tape

, You can do this by attaching it to the outside of the jar with a rubber band. Check to ensure the bottom edge of the ruler is flush with the bottom of the jar and you can read the ruler measurements clearly.Another option is to tape the ruler inside the jar so it stands vertically, with the end at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you can read the numbers on the outside of the jar.

, The funnel should sit in the top of the jar so the funnel covers the entire mouth of the jar. This will ensure water goes through the funnel and does not spill on either side of the jar., If you do not have access to a climate that has heavy rainfall throughout the year, you can test the rain gauge by using tap water. You can run tap water through the rain gauge and take down a measurement of the water.If it is going to be a rainy day, leave the rain gauge outside in a safe spot that is not covered by trees or other obstructions that can block the rain. Take a reading after each rainfall. Make sure you empty the rain gauge after every reading to ensure your measurements are accurate.

Repeat in areas of differing temperatures.,
Use your calibrated thermometer to find an unknown temperature.",How to Make a Homemade Thermometer," Fill a measuring cup halfway with water and halfway with rubbing alcohol. Drop four to eight drops of liquid food coloring into the solution and mix gently to combine.Note that the food coloring does not alter the way that the solution reacts to temperature changes. Its only purpose is to make it easier for you to read the level of the water in the straw when you use your thermometer.
You could technically skip the alcohol altogether and only use water, but a thermometer containing equal parts water and rubbing alcohol will respond to temperature changes more quickly than one made with only water.
When determining how much solution to make, consider the volume of the bottle you will use. You will need to prepare enough solution to fill the entire bottle, plus a little extra.;
, Fill the bottle up to its neck by directly pouring the solution inside. Use a plastic dropper to slowly add more of the colored solution until the level of that solution reaches the very top of the bottle.


You can use either a glass or plastic bottle.
Avoid letting the solution overflow.
Technically, you can create a thermometer even without filling the bottle to the top. The structure of this thermometer will ensure that the solution expands into the straw instead of further into the bottle, even if the bottle is partially empty. Filling the bottle to the top, however, will cause your thermometer to respond to temperature changes faster than it might if you only filled it halfway.

, Slide the straw into the bottle, working carefully to avoid spilling any solution. Leave at least 4 inches (10 cm) of the straw sticking out from the top of the bottle and do not allow the straw to touch the bottom of the bottle. Fix it in place by molding clay around the straw and the top of the bottle.The clay must completely seal off the mouth of the bottle. Ideally, no air should get inside the bottle unless it comes through the straw.
Partially melted wax or plasticine would work if you do not have modeling clay.
Sealing the bottle is crucial. A tight seal prevents the liquid inside your bottle from expanding up through the mouth of the bottle, and as a result, that liquid can only expand into the straw., Position the card directly behind the straw and use a piece of clear tape to hold it in place.The index card is not strictly necessary, but using it can make it easier for you to see the level of the solution in the straw. Moreover, if you plan on calibrating your thermometer so that it can actually be used to measure temperatures, you will use this index card to mark and label the measurement values.

, Carefully add a few drops of your colored solution into the top of the straw. When done, there should be 2 inches (5 cm) of water above the top of the bottle inside the straw.


By filling the straw with additional solution, you will ultimately make it easier to spot the level of the solution in the straw as it both rises and drops.

, Use your dropper to carefully add a single drop of vegetable oil into the straw. Only use one drop.


Oil and water do not mix, so the oil will stay on top of the solution in the straw.
Adding oil to the straw prevents the solution inside from evaporating. As a result, your thermometer will remain accurate for a while after you make and calibrate it.

, The device itself is done, but before you attempt to use your thermometer, you need to double-check your work to make sure that your new measuring tool will be as accurate as possible.


Feel the sides of the bottle. Make sure that no moisture is leaking out from anywhere.
Check the clay seal at the top of your bottle to make sure that it is fairly airtight.
Check the straw and the index card to make sure that both are secure and will not move around during use.

, Fill a small bowl with cold water and a little ice. Let the water get as cold as possible, then carefully sit your thermometer inside the bowl. Make sure that you can see the liquid inside the straw very clearly.


When exposed to cold water, the solution in the straw should drop.
All matter is made of particles, and all of these particles are in constant motion. The energy involved in this motion is called kinetic energy. When the temperature of matter drops, its particles move slower and its kinetic energy decreases.
When you use your thermometer, you transfer the temperature and kinetic energy of the solution you test to the solution inside the thermometer. In other words, the solution in your thermometer changes to match the conditions of the solution or space being tested, and the results are visible and able to be measured.
Cold temperatures cause the particles in your thermometer solution to draw closer together. As a result, the liquid condenses and drops further down the straw.

, Get hot tap water or heat water on the stove until it begins to steam, but not the boil. Carefully lower the thermometer into the hot water and watch the level of the liquid in the straw.


Note that you should give the bottle time to warm up to room temperature after you remove it from the ice bath. Do not move the bottle directly from the ice to the hot water, since the sudden change in temperature can cause your bottle to break, especially if it is made from glass.
When exposed to warm temperatures, the solution in the straw should rise.
As previously mentioned, the particles in matter speed up when heated. When the hot temperature of your tested solution gets transferred to the solution in your thermometer, the particles in your thermometer solution move faster, causing them to expand or move further apart from one another. As these particles expand, the solution rises further into the straw.

, Check the thermometer in various places with different temperatures. Look at how much the level rises in warm spots and how it drops in cold spots.


You should continue to notice that warm temperatures cause the solution to rise while cold temperatures cause it to drop.
Other areas worth checking out may include the refrigerator, a sunny window, an outdoor porch on a hot day or cold day, a shady spot in your yard, the inside of a car when it is not running, your basement, your garage, and your attic.

, Place your thermometer in a room temperature location and allow the solution to settle to its original level in the straw. Hold a commercial alcohol thermometer next to the straw, matching the level of your thermometer solution to the level of the solution in the straw.


The process of calibration is essential if you want to use your homemade thermometer to actually measure temperature instead of only detecting temperature changes. If you do not calibrate and mark your thermometer, you will only be able to tell when the temperature is warmer or colder but will have no idea of what the present temperature is.

, With a fine point permanent marker, mark a line on your index card, directly next to the top of your solution in the straw. Label it with the current temperature, as measured by your commercial thermometer.


When marking the top of the solution, look closely to make sure that you are marking the top of the colored alcohol solution and not the surface of the protective layer of oil sitting on top.

, Return the thermometer to your testing areas. Allow the solution level to rise or fall accordingly in each location, and once it does, hold the commercial thermometer next to it. Mark and label each new temperature on your homemade thermometer.


Measure as many different temperatures as possible. The more temperatures you can include on your thermometer gauge, the easier it will be to identify the temperature of an unknown solution or atmosphere.

, Once you have a decent range of temperatures marked on your thermometer, take your instrument to a warm or cold location and set it down. Wait for the solution level to rise or fall, and when it stops, look at the calibration marks on your straw. Use these previous measurements to determine the temperature of the area in which your thermometer presently sits.


To double-check the accuracy of your thermometer, check the temperature of the location using your commercial thermometer after recording the measurement you got with your homemade thermometer.
At the completion of this step, your homemade thermometer is done and officially ready for use.

Punch holes in the cups.,
Punch holes in the center cup.,
Make the bottom hole in the center cup.,
Insert the straw into a cup.,
Fit a straw through the center cup.,
Fit the second straw and cup through the center cup.,
Insert the pencil into the center cup.",How to Make an Anemometer," Gather four 3 oz. paper or plastic party cups, and use a single hole paper puncher to punch a hole on the side of each cup. The punched hole should be about ½ inch under the rim of the cup., With the fifth party cup, use the single hole puncher to punch two holes directly across from each other, ½ inch underneath the rim of the cup. The holes should be level and even. Punch two more holes ¼ inch from the rim of the cup, directly across from one another, and in between the two first punched holes.The final result should appear to have four equally spaced and perpendicular holes near the rim of the center cup.

, Use a pushpin to punch a small hole in the bottom of the center cup.Then use scissors to make the hole slightly bigger, so a pencil can fit through the hole and sit loosely.

, Fit a straw through the hole in one of the cups that has one hole punched in it. About ½ inch of the straw should be poking through the inside of the cup. Bend this ½ inch of straw poking into the cup, and tape it to the inside wall of the cup.Do this same procedure with another straw and another cup with one hole punched in it.Afterward, you should have to cups with two straws coming out from their sides.

, Feed the straw coming from one of the cups through the two holes (directly across from each other) in the center cup. Once the straw comes out the other end of the center cup, feed the straw through another cup with one hole punched in it.When the straw is inserted into the other cup with one hole punched in it, let ½ inch of the straw go through to the inside of the cup. Fold the ½ inch of straw on the inside of the cup, and tape it down to the cup’s inner wall.


Repeat this step with the other cup and attached straw., Feed the straw attached to the other one hole-pinched cup through the other two holes in the center cup. When the straw is through the two holes, attach another one hole-punched cup onto the end of the straw. Just like before, allow ½ inch of the straw to penetrate to the inside of the cup. Bend the ½ inch of straw, and tape it to the inside of the cup.


Make sure that the two cups on each end of the straws are facing in opposite directions. When all the cups are added to the ends of the straws, all openings of the cups should be facing the same direction., Push the eraser side of the pencil through the bottom hole in the center cup. Push the pencil upward until it meets to the intersecting straws. Push the pushpin through the two intersecting straws and into the eraser end of the pencil.Be sure that you don’t push the pin in as tight as it will go, otherwise the anemometer won’t spin when exposed to wind.Push the pushpin in just enough so the straws stay connected to each other and the pencil eraser.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Clean the hair with diluted rubbing alcohol.,
Cut a small triangle pointer.,
Tape the dime onto the tip of the pointer.,
Attach the hair to the pointer.,
Fasten the pointer to the wood block with a pin or nail.,
Hammer a second nail into the block about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the top.,
Glue the other end of the hair to the nail at the top of the block.,
Calibrate the hygrometer.,
Check the position of the hygrometer pointer at different times of the day and record the results.",How to Make a Hygrometer1," To make a hair hygrometer you will need 2-3 pieces of hair at least 12 inches long, a 9 inch by 4 inch wooden block or piece of cardboard, two pins or nails, rubbing alcohol, a dime, tape, a marker, a sheet of plastic transparency, a ruler, scissors, and a hair dryer.Most of these materials should be easily found around the home.
If you’re using nails, you will also need a hammer. Parental supervision is advised during use of the hammer.
You can also substitute the transparency sheet for stiff cardstock or cardboard.;
, Mix 2 drops of alcohol and 8 drops of water. Wipe the hairs with the mixture to remove oils or hair care products. The cleaner the hair is, the more water it will be able to absorb.Keep the hair on a white piece of paper so you don’t lose it while you build the rest of the hygrometer.
Clean multiple strands of hair in case some break during the assembly process.

, This pointer will be the arrow that allows you to measure relative humidity. The pointer can be made out of stiff cardboard or the plastic transparency sheet. Trace a triangle onto the sheet that has a base of 3 inches and sides that are about 2.5 inches tall. Cut out the triangle using scissors.


Mark a spot about 1.5 centimeters from the base of the triangle in the center. This will be the attachment point for the pointer.

, Using a piece of tape, attach the dime close to the tip of the pointer. It’s okay if the dime hangs off the edges a little bit.The dime serves as a weight, to keep the hair taut and straight.


If tape does not work, you can use a dab of hot glue. Keep in mind, this is a slightly more permanent solution.

, Glue the hair to the hygrometer pointer between the dime and the marking for the attachment point. The hair should be perpendicular (make a 90 degree angle) to the pointer.

, Using the mark you made earlier, poke a hole through the pointer with a pin or nail. Hammer the pin/nail into the 9-inch-by-4-inch (22.86-cm-by-10.16-cm) wood block base about 6 3/4 inches (17.15 cm) from the top, with the pointer parallel to the ground (hanging horizontally).


Make sure the hole is large enough for the pointer to swivel around the nail.

, Measure 1 inch from the top of the block and mark a point that is straight up from where the hair is positioned. Hammer the nail into this spot on the block. This second nail will be the anchor point for the hair.

, Pull the piece of hair taut and wrap it around the nail at the top of the block. Add a dab of glue to secure the hair in place. You may need to hold the hair while the glue dries to make sure it is taut.


Make sure the hair is pulled tight and the tip of the pointer is horizontally straight/parallel to the ground.
Trim any extra hair.

, Using a hair dryer and a wet rag, you can simulate the conditions of zero and one hundred percent humidity. Dry the hair with a blow dryer until the pointer does not move anymore. Make a mark on the wood with a paint pen and label it 0 percent. This is the point at which there is no water vapor absorbed by the hair.


Put the hygrometer in a sealable plastic box with a wet rag. After 10 minutes, make a tiny mark with a pencil at the pointer's location and put the hygrometer back in the box. Check it again in another 10 minutes; continue this process until the pointer stops moving. Mark that spot with a marker and label it 100 percent.
Divide the space between 0 percent and 100 percent into 10 spaces and label them 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent and so on.
You can also calibrate your hair hygrometer by setting it on the bathroom counter while you take a shower. After marking the 100 percent humidity line, aim your hair dryer at the hair until the pointer stops moving and mark 0 percent.

, Place your hygrometer on a shelf in the house or outside in an area that is protected from rain or snow. As the hair dries or absorbs water, the pointer will move up or down to show the humidity of the air. While the measurements are not especially accurate, they will give you an idea of the relative humidity in the air.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Cover one thermometer with wet gauze.,
Attach the two thermometers to the cardboard.,
Record the temperatures on each thermometer.,
Determine relative humidity using a wet/dry humidity table.",How to Make a Hygrometer2," To construct this hygrometer, you will need two thermometers, some cotton gauze, a rubber band, a small container some water, and a piece of cardboard large enough to hang the two thermometers.

, Moisten the gauze with some water and wrap it around the bulb (bottom tip) of the thermometer. Secure the gauze in place with the rubber band. In order for this hygrometer to work long term the gauze must stay moist during readings.


Fill the small container with water and make sure part of the gauze is in contact with the water. The gauze will stay wet as long as it is touching the water in the container.

, Align the thermometers so that their tops and bottoms are in the same place. Secure them in place using tape or hot glue. Use caution when working with hot glue.

, This hygrometer allows you to determine a relative humidity level of the air.Look at each thermometer at eye level and record the degree at which the red liquid sits. Write down these temperatures.


Make multiple recordings throughout the day and take note of the weather as well. Is it sunny? Is it raining?

, Obtain a wet/dry humidity table like the one found here. The left side of the table (y-axis) is the temperature reading of the dry thermometer. The horizontal (x-axis) of the table is the difference between the dry thermometer and the wet thermometer.


Subtract the dry thermometer temperature from the wet thermometer (wet – dry = difference).
Find the temperature of the dry bulb on the vertical axis and then find the corresponding difference on the horizontal axis. Where those two meet on the graph tells you the relative humidity.
Be sure that your table matches the scale you are using. If you’re using Fahrenheit, use a Fahrenheit table. If you’re measuring in Celsius, use a Celsius table.
