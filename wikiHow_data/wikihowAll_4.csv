Know the risk factors of developing uterine fibroids.,
Recognize the symptoms of uterine fibroids.,
Discuss treatment options with your doctor.",How to Prevent Uterine Fibroids2," Fibroids are very common, especially in women who have reached childbearing age. Women who have not had children may be at higher risk of developing fibroids.Your risk of developing fibroids increases as you age. Women between the age of 30 and menopause are the most commonly affected.Having a family member, such as a sister, mother, or cousin, with uterine fibroids increases your risk of developing them.Women of African descent appear more likely to develop fibroids, especially as they age. Some studies suggest that African American women are two to three times more likely to develop fibroids than white women. 80% of African American women develop fibroids by age 50, compared to 70% of white women.(Though, again, keep in mind that a large percentage of women who have fibroids do not experience any symptoms or problems related to the presence of the fibroids.)
Women with a BMI (Body Mass Index) above the “normal” range” are more likely to develop fibroids.Women who began menstruating at an early age (i.e., before 14) are at a higher risk of developing fibroids., Many women who have fibroids do not know they have them.In many women, fibroids do not cause significant health problems. However, if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, see your physician:Heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding
Significant change in menstruation patterns (e.g., sharply increased pain, much heavier bleeding)
Pelvic pain, or feelings of “heaviness” or “fullness” in the pelvic area
Pain during sexual intercourse
Frequent and/or difficult urination
Constipation
Backache
Infertility or recurrent miscarriage

, If you do have fibroids, discuss treatment options with your doctor. In many cases, treatment is not necessary. However, in some cases, medication or surgical procedures may be necessary. The treatment your doctor recommends will vary depending on several factors, such as whether you wish to become pregnant in the future, your age, and the severity of the fibroids.Drug therapy, such as hormonal birth control, may reduce heavy bleeding and pain. However, it may not prevent new fibroids or keep fibroids from growing.Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) may be prescribed to shrink fibroids. The fibroids regrow rapidly once these medications are stopped, so they are primarily used pre-operatively to shrink fibroids in preparation for hysterectomy. They may have side effects including depression, decreased sex drive, insomnia, and joint pain, but many women tolerate these medications well.Myomectomy (surgical removal of fibroids) may allow you to conceive children after the procedure. The risks depend on how severe the fibroids are.You may also be able to conceive after having MRI-guided ultrasound surgery, although this procedure is not widely available.Other treatments for more severe fibroids may include endometrial ablation (surgical destruction of the uterus lining), uterine fibroid embolization (injection of plastic or gel particles into the blood vessels surrounding the fibroid), or hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). Hysterectomy is considered the last resort when other treatments and procedures have not worked. Women cannot have children after some of these procedures.Women who conceive after undergoing embolization may experience complications with their pregnancies, so this method is not recommended for women who may become pregnant in the future.

Get regular checkups.,
Wear proper clothing.,
Clean your vagina properly.,
Eat yogurt with active cultures.,
Wipe properly.",How to Recognize and Avoid Vaginal Infections2," Women should have a pelvic exam as part of their yearly physical. Your doctor will be able to check for any signs of illness during your visit. This is the time to ask any questions or discuss any concerns or symptoms you may be having.You should not douche, use a tampon, have sex, or use any medicine or cream in your vagina two days before your visit.The exam should not take more than 10 minutes.
If you are sexually active, you should ask your doctor to screen you for sexually transmitted infections(STIs). Many people do not experience symptoms when they have some STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HPV.Yearly screening will help with identifying and treating these infections before they have any lasting effects.
You should use condoms if you are sexually active. This can prevent your partner from passing a STI to you. You should still get tested regularly even if you use condoms.

, You should wear underwear that keeps your genital area dry and does not hold moisture. Cotton is the preferred fabric. You should also avoid wearing tight fitting clothing because it can trap heat and moisture around your genital area. If you work out or go swimming, you should change out of your wet clothes as soon as possible.When you are on your period, you should change your tampons and pads regularly.
Make sure your non-cotton underwear, leggings, workout gear, and pantyhose have a cotton panel in the crotch area , Your vagina is a self-cleaning organ. You should not do anything that may upset the natural balance if your vagina because it can lead to an infection.Wash the area around your vagina with plain, unscented soaps and rinse with plenty of water.You should not douche, use feminine sprays, or scented tampons. These can upset the natural bacterial balance of your vagina and cause irritation. Remember your vagina is self-cleaning.

, Foods live and active cultures can help keep the right pH balance in your vagina. Probiotics is another common term for these cultures. Good sources of probiotics are yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, and miso. Make sure your yogurt label says ""contains live and active cultures.""Eating one cup of yogurt a day is adequate.

, When you use the bathroom, make sure you wipe from front to back. Wiping from back to front will spread yeast and bacteria from your anus to your vagina or your urinary tract.Spreading bacteria through improper wiping can cause bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection.

Understand that exercise may not help symptoms in all women.,
Know how exercise affects hot flashes.,
Start slowly.,
Choose an activity that you will enjoy.,
Make it a social experience.,
Create a well-rounded routine.,
Exercise safely.,
Exercise for an appropriate amount of time.",How to Reduce Hot Flashes with Exercise2," As with so many other issues surrounding menopause, there is a good deal of controversy surrounding the idea that exercise can reduce the symptoms and frequency of hot flashes. Exercise may not be able to reduce hot flashes in all women, but in the field of treating menopausal symptoms, that is actually the norm. The signs and symptoms of menopause are so varied and are felt so differently in so many women that very few approaches can be said to be effective for all women.The controversy is not all that important because the benefits of exercise during any time in a woman’s life far exceed any controversy. The best advice is to exercise throughout your life because it will be beneficial.
Exercise has been proven to reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, osteoporosis, diabetes, arthritis, and other chronic disorders, as well as potentially reducing the severity of hot flashes. You can essentially accomplish two goals using exercise as the approach, reducing hot flashes and reducing your risk of other medical problems.

, A number of studies show that a majority of women experience significant relief of hot flashes by increasing their physical activity.These studies used a variety of measures of physical activity. There was no preferred type of exercise, so these studies indicated that any increased physical activity could be effective in reducing hot flashes.


Exercise of any type also improved mood, strengthened bones and reduced the number of fractures, reduced stress, reduced sleep issues, and reduced weight gain.
In some women, exercise may cause hot flashes instead of reducing them. Talk to your doctor if this is the case.

, If you are starting with an exercise program or increasing your level of physical activity, start slow. Work yourself into increasing your physical activity slowly but steadily. Instead of focusing on instant goals, look at the bigger picture.For example, don’t start by trying to run a marathon. You may want to start by jogging a mile, or walking a mile or even half a mile. If you are lifting weights, don’t expect to lift the heaviest weights. Start with two, three, or five pound weights and increase from there.
Ask yourself how you will feel next month or in the next six months. Don’t focus on how you will feel tomorrow.
Remember that the physical changes you are striving for are long-term and you will see them. It will just take a bit of patience.
While we can all recognize the advantages of exercise at all stages of life, sometimes it’s hard to adopt an exercise program. Menopause can be a difficult time, especially if you are just starting to get involved in an exercise program. Don’t be too hard on yourself. Take it slowly and keep at it.

, If you expect to be able to stay with a new exercise program, make certain it is something that engages you and that you will enjoy. Play a sport you’ve always enjoyed. Pick up a hobby you used to have that you never had time for.


Think about your interests. Maybe you liked riding your bicycle as a kid, or you were on the track team in high school. Maybe you love hiking or kayaking. Try Zumba if you love dancing, or a spin class if you like cycling.
Try something new. If you’ve always wanted to do an activity, make this the time you finally go for it. Do a variety of activities. Try something new each day, or join a gym and attend all the different classes.

, You don’t have to exercise alone. Exercising with someone else can be motivating and help the time fly by. See if there is a friend or group of friends that will join you in your physical activity.Invite your partner or spouse along when you go out and exercise. Ask your kids to join you.
Find other women who are suffering from hot flashes. Start a menopause exercise group so you not only have someone you can work out with, but you can also help support each other as you deal with menopause.

, Any type of physical activity is good; however, you want to make sure your workouts are well-rounded so you work all aspects of your body and all your muscles. Whatever exercise program you choose, make sure it includes aspects of:Aerobics, focusing on movement and cardio health.
Strength training, focusing on weight training and building muscles.
Stretching, focusing on increasing your flexibility.
An example of a well-rounded routine would be: Warming up before walking with a slow, five minute walk. Then walk at a faster pace for four blocks. Then cool down for five minutes and stretch. After two weeks, increase to six blocks. After two more weeks, walk six blocks and add in a few sets of slow walking lunges, some pushups (for instance a modified pushup from a park bench), and a held plank (against a wall or a bench) for the abs. After one month, walk eight blocks and increase the number of reps of your added bodyweight exercises. Stretch after every workout.

, Pushing yourself is an important part of improving your overall health, but you can push too much and too far and cause yourself injury. Talk with your physician and work with a trainer or coach to make sure you are not pushing too much., You need to make sure you exercise long enough to get the benefits of the activity. Only doing it for a few minutes or once every week or two will not be enough to make a difference. When you begin, try for at least 30 minutes of physical activity at least four to five times a week.You can also split the 30 minutes into 10 minute increments throughout the day.
You can increase this amount of time as you get more fit, aiming for a total of 150 minutes each week.

Learn what menopause is.,
Recognize the symptoms of menopause.,
Know what a hot flash is.",How to Reduce Hot Flashes with Exercise3," Menopause is just a time period which covers the 12 months during which a woman no longer menstruates.After that year has passed, a woman is postmenopausal. Perimenopause occurs before menopause, when the body begins to transition into infertility, and you may begin experiencing symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes.The process of menopause can take a number of years.


In the perimenopausal time, a woman’s ovaries begin to decrease the production of the reproductive hormones, estrogen and progesterone. The average age when the last period occurs is 51 years; however, women can begin the perimenopausal time anywhere from two to 15 years prior to that.Menopause can also occur after a total hysterectomy, after some forms of cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and as a result of primary ovarian insufficiency., Menopause has common symptoms; however, the list of symptoms that women experience is extensive and often very individual. Women go through a number of different changes in the perimenopausal period, and the symptoms may vary depending on a large number of factors. No matter your symptoms, you can find relief. It may be as simple as using exercise to deal with hot flashes or using lubricants to help with painful intercourse. The most common symptoms during perimenopause are:Irregular periods
Vaginal dryness
Hot flashes
Night sweats
Sleep problems
Mood changes
Weight gain and slowed metabolism
Thinning hair and dry skin
Loss of breast fullness
Many of these symptoms can indicate thyroid problems, which is one of the most underdiagnosed conditions in women. It often occurs at the same time women begin the menopausal transition. Make certain your physician does a blood test to determine if your thyroid is functioning well.

, Hot flashes generally occur in the upper part of a woman’s body. Most often they occur on the face, chest, breasts, and neck. You may feel suddenly or progressively as though you are overcome by an intense heat from your body, which may be incredibly uncomfortable. Your skin may redden and you may begin to sweat. Hot flashes generally last for a few minutes.


Hot flashes are not well understood, but are thought to be caused by changes in the body’s thermostat and that these hypothalamic changes are brought about by the hormonal fluctuations that occur during perimenopause, particularly changes in estrogen. Testosterone and other factors, including endorphins released during exercise, can play a role as well.You cannot predict or control when hot flashes strike. Easing or reducing their occurrence with exercise can help you feel you have at least some control over the situation. Strength training in particular can help build a sense of control and empowerment as you become stronger and more coordinated.

Get a diagnosis.",How to Recognize Uterine Cancer Symptoms," Since uterine cancer affects the uterus, every woman is at risk for contracting this type of cancer (unless you’ve had a hysterectomy). However it is most common for women over the age of 50 who have gone through menopause.One major risk factor for developing uterine cancer is taking hormones or other drugs.These hormone risks include using estrogen without also using progesterone, or taking Tamoxifen – a drug used to treat certain forms of breast cancer.
There are also certain physical factors that can contribute to an increased risk of contracting uterine cancer. Major bodily factors include being obese, being a smoker, or having a history of uterine, colon, or ovarian cancer in your family. You are also a greater risk if you have had problems getting pregnant or if you had fewer than five periods a year before beginning menopause. Another risk factor is suffering from endometrial hyperplasia.;
, Abnormal bleeding or postmenopausal bleeding is the most common early symptom of endometrial cancer. If you notice any vaginal bleeding that is not normal for you and your monthly cycle, you should be mindful of your symptoms so that you can recall them for your doctor.If the abnormal bleeding continues for any considerable amount of time (more than a few days) or if it happens during several monthly cycles in a row, consider notifying your doctor.
Check for bleeding between periods. If you notice bleeding between periods, this can be a symptom of uterine cancer.Be wary of bleeding that last longer or is heavier than normal. If your menstrual cycle changes in any way, this can be a symptom of a problem with your reproductive system, including uterine cancer. Look for changes like heavier periods than normal, longer periods than normal, or increased PMS symptoms (cramps, fatigue, etc.).
Keep a journal recording these occurrences.

, Bleeding, even a small amount (also known as spotting), after having gone through menopause can be problematic for many reasons. One of these reasons is the possibility of uterine cancer. If you are vaginally bleeding after menopause, you should consult your doctor immediately.Since menopause eliminates your body’s need to go through the menstrual cycle every month, any bleeding after menopause can be problematic and should be taken seriously.

, Take the time to notice if your menstrual periods last longer than seven days. A longer than average menstrual cycle can be indicative of problems with your reproductive system, including uterine cancer. Keep track of how many days your period lasts for several cycles in a row so you can tell your doctor.


A doctor can help you regulate your periods so that they are more manageable and make sure there are no underlying problems causing the longer periods.

, Pain is actually somewhat rare in early uterine cancer. It does not usually occur until later in the disease’s progression. Any kind of recurring pain in your pelvis can be a sign of a various number of potential health problems – including uterine cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and ovarian cysts. You should notify your doctor and get it checked out if you are experiencing any kind of pain or pressure in your pelvis.A feeling of pressure in your pelvis can also be a sign of uterine cancer.
The intensity of the sensation can vary from person to person. You might feel a sharp, stabbing pain in your pelvic region or perhaps a lighter, more continuous feeling of pressure.

, It should never hurt when you urinate. If you are experiencing pain during urination, it can be a symptom of several problems including uterine cancer or urinary tract infection. Regardless, you should see your doctor immediately if you are experiencing this problem., For the most part, sexual intercourse should not be painful. If you are experiencing pain during sex, especially if it is a recent development, consider letting your doctor know just to make sure nothing is wrong.Your doctor may also be able to recommend something to alleviate the pain.

, See your health care provider if you have any of the signs or symptoms listed or are concerned that you might have uterine cancer. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.


It might be a good idea to ask a friend to go with you to your appointment. They can be there for moral support, to help you remember the information the doctor gives you, and to ask questions that you may forget in the moment.
Make sure you prepare for your appointment ahead of time by researching your symptoms, keeping track of your symptoms, and writing down any questions you may have.

, It is important to ask your doctor questions when you consult with him or her about your concerns regarding uterine cancer. Doing research on your own is a great way to find out some preliminary information, but getting information directly from your doctor is more beneficial.


If you often have trouble remembering all of the questions you want to ask, write your questions down ahead of time as you think of them so you’ll be sure to ask all the right things when you’re discussing it with your doctor.
You can also take notes during your appointment with the doctor so that you will be able to accurately recall all of the information later.

, There is also no simple and trustworthy way to test for uterine cancer in women who are symptom-free. The Pap test (also known as Pap smear) does not check for uterine cancer. If you do have signs or symptoms of the cancer, your health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:


Pelvic exam
Transvaginal ultrasound
Endometrial biopsy
Pap test (to test for other possible causes)

, Once you have tracked all of your symptoms, discussed your symptoms with your doctor, and undergone any testing your doctor deems necessary, your doctor should be able to give you an accurate diagnosis about whether or not you have uterine cancer.


Keep in mind that your doctor may need to do some tests on your before they can make a definitive decision about your symptoms.

Consider other illnesses.",How to Prevent Spotting Between Periods," Oral contraceptives, or birth control pills, are frequently used to manage spotting. Birth control pills regulate the hormonal changes that occur during your menstrual cycle.Birth control pills can help to establish a regular cycle and avoid overgrowth of the uterine lining in women that do not routinely ovulate. In women that do ovulate, birth control pills work to treat abnormal, heavy, or excessive bleeding during menstruation.;
, Skipping a pill, or inconsistent oral contraception use, is one of the main causes of spotting. If this happens, using additional methods of contraception are strongly recommended for the duration of your cycle.

, Progestin is a synthetic, or manufactured form, of progesterone. Progesterone is a naturally occurring hormone released by the ovaries that helps to regulate the amount of bleeding that occurs in women that do not routinely ovulate. The synthetic form, or progestin, is most often taken in tablet form.Progestin products that are made in tablet form contain active ingredients called medroxyprogesterone and norethindrone. This type of intervention may involve taking the progestin once daily for 10 to 12 days of the month, for several months. Sometimes, progestin products are prescribed to be taken once daily every day. Other forms of taking progestin include injections, implants, or intrauterine devices.

, In some women that experience abnormal bleeding episodes, using an IUD, or intrauterine device that contains progestin, is a good option. This type of device is inserted into your uterus by your doctor. It has an attached string so you can check to make sure it is still in place.Progestin-releasing intrauterine devices can help to decrease the heavy bleeding by up to 50%, control episodes of spotting, plus they help to relieve some of the pain associated with monthly periods. In some cases, women that use progestin-releasing IUDs stop having their monthly cycle completely., If you are already taking birth control pills, talk to your doctor about changing to a different type of contraception. This may include a different formulation of birth control pills, an implantable device, intrauterine device, diaphragm, patch, or injection.If you use an intrauterine device that does not contain medication, ask your doctor about changing your IUD, or switching to a different method of birth control. IUD users have a higher rate of spotting than users of other birth control methods.

, These agents are useful in treating the pain and discomfort associated with your monthly period, but they also have the ability to thin the blood. This can make it more likely to experience episodes of breakthrough bleeding, or spotting, between your periods., Excessive stress can cause your body to delay or skip your cycle altogether. Both short and long-term feelings of stress have an impact on a part of the brain called the hypothalamus.The hypothalamus is key is regulating the release of many natural chemicals throughout your body, including your ovaries, which regulate normal levels of estrogen and progesterone. When stress enters the picture, your ovaries lose their control over proper release of hormones, like progesterone. If progesterone isn't released, the build-up of estrogen can cause spotting.Both mental and physical stress can affect your menstrual cycle and create spotting. Consider moderate exercise, yoga, and relaxation techniques to help control your stress.

, Obesity increases your risk of uterine cancer. However, strenuous physical activity or drastic weight loss can also throw your menstrual cycle off, causing you to skip or have abnormal periods where spotting can occur., An annual exam involves a pelvic exam, pap smear, and other routine tests to check for abnormalities. Let your doctor know if you have episodes of spotting. The actual pap smear and pelvic exam can sometimes cause spotting, but this is normal., The spotting or bleeding can be normal, but it may also be a warning sign of complications with the pregnancy, such as a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy., Additional feelings of pain, fatigue, or dizziness warrant further evaluation by your doctor., Heavy bleeding between your periods, and even during your period, can be an indicator of complications, many of which are easily managed. Contacting your gynecologist is the first step in determining the cause of the heavy bleeding and discovering possible treatment options., Whether you are taking continuous hormone therapy, cyclic hormone therapy, or not taking hormone therapy at all, episodes of unexpected bleeding are not normal. Contact a doctor if unexpected bleeding occurs.The risk of cancer increases by about 10% in postmenopausal women that experience vaginal bleeding., If you go as long as 90 days without having your period, then contact your doctor., Stop using tampons and contact your doctor immediately if you develop a fever, muscle aches, diarrhea or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, an unexplained sunburn-like rash, sore throat, or notice redness in your eyes., Spotting can be caused by conditions or illnesses both unrelated and related to women’s health issues. Either way, your doctor can help to rule out other conditions or illnesses.The use of certain medications like corticosteroids, blood thinners, and even antidepressants have been linked to episodes of spotting. Thyroid disease and diabetes are also possible contributors to spotting between your periods.
Women’s health conditions that may be causing the abnormal bleeding episodes can include uterine fibroids, uterine polyps, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, bladder or vaginal infections, and cancer. Abnormal pap tests and infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia can also cause abnormal spotting. Seek medical attention as soon as possible if you continue to have abnormal bleeding or spotting."

Know if you are at risk.,
Take the following precautions:


If you suspect you may have have gonorrhea and/or chlamydia, get early diagnosis and treatment.,
See your doctor immediately if you have any of the following:


Abnormal sore or canker in your genital area.",How to Prevent PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease)," Frequently PID is connected with gonorrhea and chlamydia. There are other factors that may put you at risk also. They are:


Frequent douching.
Use of an intrauterine device (IUD).
Being of childbearing age and sexually active.
Being under age 25.
Having multiple sex partners.
Having a sex partner who has multiple sex partners.;
,
Practice abstinence.
Maintain a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who known to be uninfected with an STD.
Use a condom to reduce the risks of getting STDs.
Have yearly testing for chlamydia, especially if you are under age 25, are sexually active, or have multiple sex partners.

,
A vaginal discharge with a strong, repugnant odor.
Burning sensation during urination.
Bleeding or spotting outside your menstrual cycle.

"
"
Follow dietary recommendations for menopausal women.,
Quit smoking.

,
Keep a regular sleep schedule.,
Engage in some form of physical exercise for 30 to 45 minutes each day.",How to Prevent Menopause Symptoms1,"

Decrease the number of calories you consume to maintain a healthy weight. Menopause slows down a woman's metabolism by about 55 calories a day, so it may be necessary to decrease your daily caloric intake to avoid putting on weight.



 


Avoid saturated fat and limit your total fat intake to less than 30 percent of your total calories.






Eat a diet high in whole grain fiber and green leafy vegetables.






Include 1000 to 1500 milligrams of calcium in your diet each day. Low-fat milk and dairy products, soybeans, tofu, spinach, sardines, salmon and fortified cereals are all good sources of calcium.






Limit your consumption of foods known to increase menopause symptoms. These include spicy foods and those that contain high amounts of sugar, white flour, salt, caffeine and alcohol.





;
,, Go to bed and get up at the same time very day, even on your days off. Irregular sleeping hours contribute to insomnia.

, Weight bearing exercise, which requires your muscles work against gravity, is especially important during menopause because it slows muscle loss. Walking, jogging, yoga or weightlifting are good choices.

Eat a balanced diet.,
Eat probiotic-rich foods to encourage healthy gut bacteria.,
Start an exercise routine.,
Watch your weight.,
Get enough sleep nightly.,
Breast feed if you have an infant.",How to Prevent Uterine Cancer1," Ingesting the right foods is one of the most important elements of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and reducing your risk of cancer.Include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your daily diet. Aim not just for quantity, but for variety. Studies have shown that consuming a wide variety of fruits and vegetables has a significant impact on overall health.Limit your consumption of foods high in animal fat, as women with diets high in animal fat have been shown to have a higher risk of uterine cancer.Foods rich in fiber will promote a healthy digestive tract by helping eliminate toxins and byproducts from your body. If you’re not taking in enough fiber through your diet, consider taking over-the-counter fiber supplements that promote regularity and proper digestion.;
, Probiotics limit the growth of harmful bacteria which transform procarcinogens into carcinogens, and they strengthen one’s overall immune system.Probiotic-rich foods include yogurt, kefir, kombucha, and raw cheeses. Check the label of the product to make sure that it contains live and active cultures.
If you're not partial to naturally probiotic-rich foods, you can take a probiotic supplement. Such supplements are widely available over the counter at your local drugstore or health food store.

, In addition to eating a healthy diet, being physically active will improve your overall health and reduce your risk of uterine cancer.If you're engaging in moderate-intensity physical activities like walking, you should exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, five times a week. If your physical activity is something intense like running or rowing, you should exercise for at least 20 minutes a day, 3 times a week.Low-impact exercises like yoga or spinning are just as good for you as jogging or hiking, so don’t miss out on physical activity just because you have knee or joint conditions.

, Paired with a balanced, calorie-controlled diet, frequent exercise should lower your likelihood of becoming overweight or obese. Fat cells produce estrogen, one of the main causes linked to uterine cancer, so weight should be controlled as much as possible.While weight loss has been shown to resolve some precancerous conditions, studies show that major weight loss through diet and exercise is almost always futile or unsustainable. If you're more than 75 pounds overweight, consider your options for bariatric surgery, which has a much higher success rate over the long term.Medical management by obesity specialists can also help.

, Sleeping between 8 and 10 hours a night has been shown not only to diminish one’s risk of cancer, but also to improve many aspects of daily life such as attention span, energy, and mood levels.Getting enough sleep is also associated with lower rates of obesity, which helps to prevent uterine cancer.


Avoid drinking coffee or energy drinks after 7:00 in the evening.
Though it seems to be part of our modern lifestyle to watch television in bed, studies have shown that keeping your bed a sleep-only zone encourages more restful sleep patterns.Develop a night-time ritual that relaxes you and helps you to wind down for the evening. Experiment with aromatherapy candles, different books, and non-caffeinated teas or cocoas in order to find the right groove for you.

, Studies have shown that, since both pregnancy and breast feeding lower one’s exposure to estrogen over a lifetime, these conditions also diminish your risk of uterine cancer."

You can find more information and search where specific foods fall on the glycemic index at this website: http://www.glycemicindex.com/


, Foods that contain large amounts of fat, along with highly processed foods, should be avoided. In addition, it is also helpful to reduce the amount of sodium you consume. Foods that contain all of these items can make the pain associated with your period (and other PMS symptoms) worse.It is also best to eliminate the intake of any foods that contain trans-fats. Trans-fats are normally found in commercially produced foods such as: cookies, crackers, cakes, french fries, onion rings, donuts, and margarine., In the days leading up to your period, you should try to reduce the amount of alcohol you consume. Alcohol has the ability to make the pain associated with your period (and other PMS symptoms) worse., Beverages and foods containing caffeine can worsen cramps and bloating.Caffeine can cause blood vessels to constrict and cramp more than they do in those who avoid caffeine.Cut out coffee and caffeinated tea the week before your period.

, Sometimes the pain associated with a woman’s period, including many of the symptoms associated with PMS, can be made worse by stress, anxiety and overall tension in the body. Implementing techniques to help you relax and relieve stress can help reduce or eliminate your painful symptoms.Relaxation techniques can include: breathing exercises, meditation and yoga. Attending a yoga class via a local yoga studio or recreation centre can also help you learn proper breathing methods and meditation techniques.
Massage is another great way to help reduce tension and increase relaxation. Scheduling a regular massage right before or during your period every month may help you manage the pain.

, There is an acupressure point located on the inside of your leg, approximately three finger widths up from your anklebone, that can create relief for cramps and pain caused by your period.Use your fingers to apply deep pressure to this area for five minutes to help relieve the pain.
Applying pressure and massaging your lower abdomen, where the cramps are most painful, may also help. You might want to try this in combination with a heating pad., The change in hormone levels just before your period can often cause severe headaches and even migraines. One way to help relieve the pain caused by these headaches is to apply a cold cloth or ice pack to your head or neck — wherever the pain is most prominent.If you decide to use an ice pack, or ice cubes, be sure to wrap it in a towel first. Avoid applying ice-cold items directly to your skin, as this can cause irritation or damage.

, Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, but it can also help relieve cramps and other pain caused by your period. Two types of exercise that are most effective is yoga and aerobic exercises.Try to exercise for 30 minutes a day, at least five days a week., A warm bath (or shower) or a heating pad can help reduce the severity of the cramps caused by your period.The heating pad can be placed on your belly, below your belly button.Be careful not to fall asleep with a heating pad on. If possible, purchase a heating pad that automatically turns itself off after a certain period of time.

Practice relaxation techniques and deep, abdominal breathing at least twice each day.,
Take black cohosh 2 to 3 times a day.,
Visit an acupuncturist.",How to Prevent Menopause Symptoms2," Studies have found that women who practice deep breathing exercises have a decrease in hot flashes and other symptoms.

, Black cohosh is an herbal remedy that has been found to decrease menopause symptoms. It is sold in many health food stores in several different forms, including powdered root, tea, powdered extract, fluid extract and tincture.


Black cohosh is used in some over-the-counter menopause treatments, such as Remifemin.

, A study done in Sweden found that women who received acupuncture experienced relief from hot flashes and other menopausal side effects that lasted for several months.

Discuss the risks and benefits of using hormone therapy to prevent menopause symptoms.,
Estrogen taken without progestin may increase the risk of cancer of the uterus.,
Consider taking a low dose antidepressant.,
Undergo other health tests as recommended by your doctor.",How to Prevent Menopause Symptoms3," Women who undergo natural menopause are typically prescribed estrogen and progestin, which is a synthesized version of progesterone.

, However, women who have had a hysterectomy no longer have a uterus, so they can take estrogen alone.

, Paxil or Effexor are sometimes prescribed to menopausal women, as these medications have been found to be effective in decreasing the severity and frequency of hot flashes.

, Your doctor may test your bone density and iron levels, to monitor the changes in your body as you go through menopause.

Educate yourself on the potential causes of uterine cancer.,
Schedule regular appointments.,
Consider postmenopausal hormone treatments.,
Evaluate your options regarding genetic testing.",How to Prevent Uterine Cancer2," Not knowing the causes and risk factors of an illness often leads to exposure to those factors. Ask your doctor to help you develop a better understanding of the disease and how to avoid it.Know the statistics. Age, weight, genetics, and other cancers are all factors in contracting cancer, so compare your own profile with that of the high-risk candidate. For example, women over 50 are at the most risk of getting uterine cancer, while overweight women are also more likely candidates for uterine cancer.Other factors considered to increase one's risk are: nulliparity (never giving birth), unopposed estrogen therapy (if you still have a uterus), early onset of menses, late menopause, PCOS, a history of anovulation, obesity and excessive weight, diabetes or related issues, and exposure to certain medical chemicals like Estrogen replacements.
If you started menstruation early or experienced a late menopause, you have a higher risk of uterine cancer. This is because the longer one menstruates, the longer one is exposed to relatively high levels of estrogen., Early detection is one of the most effective tools in treating cancer, so plan to see your doctor every one to two years for checkups. Also, talk with your doctor if you notice any bleeding after menopause or if you have irregular periods.


Keep track of any irregular or abnormal vaginal bleeding and tell your doctor about any symptoms you are having when you go for appointments.
Review test results with your doctor to ensure that you understand everything.
Make a special medical calendar and hang it in a prominent place so that you won’t miss your appointments.

, Estrogen is only a risk factor for uterine cancer if it is given without progesterone. Talk to your doctor about any concerns you have before undergoing a postmenopausal hormone regimen.The breast cancer medication Tamoxifen has also been linked to uterine cancer, but the general consensus of the medical community regarding this drug determines that its benefits largely outweigh its potential risks., Women who have or might have hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) have a substantially increased likelihood of contracting uterine cancer. If you or family members have had colon or endometrial cancer before, you should consider getting genetic counseling to test for the genetic mutation dictating HNPCC.Cowden syndrome and BRCA1 may also raise your risk of uterine cancer.

Learn how to identify uterine cancer as soon as possible.,
Look out for vaginal bleeding or abnormal discharge.,
Take notice of any vaginal or pelvic pain.,
Monitor your energy levels.",How to Prevent Uterine Cancer3," Preventing any illness or disease begins with understanding the way that it presents itself. By knowing the signs, you are more likely to identify uterine cancer and begin treatment early, which improves patient outcomes.Keep in mind that the most common sign of uterine cancer is postmenopausal bleeding or irregular bleeding.

, Irregular bleeding constitutes one of the first signs of uterine cancer, so don’t overlook the significance of this symptom.Irregular bleeding can look different depending on the person. So, whether your bleeding is watery and pink-colored or dark and viscous, don't hesitate to make an appointment with your physician., Vaginal or pelvic pain is a sign of advanced uterine cancer, so this sign is rare. Even though it can be embarrassing to discuss your most intimate physical functions, don’t ignore your discomfort for the sake of squeamishness. If you experience pain during urination or intercourse, consult your physician immediately.If you’re feeling nervous about consulting a doctor about your pain, consider bringing a close friend or family member with you to the clinic. Having a trusted person with you can help you feel more at ease, as well as provide you with an advocate who can assist you in describing symptoms and understanding the doctor’s feedback.

, Feeling exhausted or light-headed can be a sign of anemia, which is a fairly common symptom of uterine cancer."
"
Take anti-inflammatory medications.,
Ask your doctor about certain prescription medications.,
Consider taking hormonal contraceptives regularly.",How to Prevent Period Pain2," Anti-inflammatory medications include drugs such as ibuprofen (i.e. Advil) and naproxen (i.e. Aleve). In order for these medications to be most effective, start taking them a day before your period is scheduled to start, and continue taking the medication (as instructed on the bottle) for several days after your period has started., If you feel your pain is severe enough that it is interfering with your ability to function on a daily basis, you may want to ask your doctor about prescription medications.There are several types of prescriptions that can help reduce or eliminate the pain associated with your period, including: birth control pills, progesterone-containing IUDs, prescription-strength anti-inflammatory drugs, prescription-strength pain relievers, antidepressants, and even some antibiotics.
For headaches caused by changing hormone levels before and during your period, your doctor may prescribe triptans. Triptans help block pain signals to your brain and can bring very quick relief when suffering from a severe headache., Even if you do not require birth control for the purpose of actual birth control, the drugs in birth control products can significantly help manage many of the painful side effects of having your period. Some specific things to consider about birth control products are:Hormonal contraceptive include birth control pills, the patch, vaginal ring, and Depo-Provera injections.
Birth control pills normally have 21 pills per month that contain active ingredients and seven pills per month that are placebos. (Some birth control pills don’t actually provide placebo pills, but simply have seven days where you stop taking the pills.) Reducing the number of days you take the placebos may help your symptoms.
An alternative to reducing the number of days you take a placebo pill is to eliminate them altogether. This means you would take 21 days of the active ingredients and then start the next set of 21 pills immediately.
Each type of birth control pill contains different levels of estrogen (as the active ingredient). Decreasing the amount of estrogen by changing the type of birth control you use can help your symptoms as your estrogen levels won’t peak or drop as significantly.
Replace the placebo pills with anti-inflammatory medication, low-dose estrogen pills or an estrogen patch. Again this will help regulate your estrogen levels before and during your period and help relieve your symptoms.
Every woman reacts differently to birth control products. If you find they do not work for you, and you do not need them for birth control purposes, talk to your doctor about stopping them.

Increase your calcium intake.,
Add more magnesium to your diet.,
Boost your vitamin B6 levels.,
Take vitamin D supplements.,
Try vitamin E supplements.,
Supplement omega-3 fatty acids.,
Make herbal tea.,
Give evening primrose oil a try.,
Use ginger supplements.",How to Prevent Period Pain3," Calcium can help prevent and reduce the pain you have associated with your period, as well as many other PMS symptoms. Calcium can be consumed through items such as: dairy products, fortified soy beverages, canned salmon and sardines, and leafy greens.You can also take additional calcium via a calcium supplement of between 500 mg and 1,200 mg per day.

, Low magnesium levels can be associated with many PMS symptoms, including cramps and headaches. Increase the amount of foods you consume that are high in magnesium, such as: sunflower seeds, nuts, lentils, legumes, whole grains, soybeans, figs and green vegetables.You can also increase your magnesium intake by taking magnesium supplements in a pill form. For the best effect, take 360 mg per day for three days before your period begins., Vitamin B6 helps produce serotonin. Serotonin can help reduce anxiety and depression brought on by PMS. Foods with high amounts of vitamin B6 are: beef, pork, chicken, fish, whole grain cereals, bananas, avocados, and potatoes.While vitamin B6 is found in supplements, but be careful not to take more than 100 mg per day. Excess vitamin B6 can be toxic.

, Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and can act as an anti-inflammatory. Try taking 400 IU per day to help reduce the pain you have due to your period., Vitamin E has been shown to decrease pain associated with your period when 500 IU is taken per day. It is best to start taking the vitamin E supplements two days before your period begins, and stop three days after your period has started. Therefore you’d be taking it for five days., Omega-3 fatty acids are most often found in fish oil as a supplement. It can be taken in pill form or liquid form.Fish oil is an anti-inflammatory and can help reduce the pain associated with your period.

, Several types of herbal teas contain ingredients that can help reduce the painful cramps brought on by your period.Raspberry leaf tea can help to relax your uterus and reduce cramping.
Chamomile tea contains an anti-spasmodic which can also reduce cramping.
Cramp bark tea (made using 1 teaspoon of dried cramp bark simmered in 1 cup of water for 15 minutes) can help reduce pain. It can be taken up to three times a day., Evening primrose oil can be obtain both in liquid form and in pill form. It contains an essential fatty acid called gamma linolenic acid (GLA). GLA blocks prostaglandins in your body which can cause painful cramps during your period.For the best effects, take 500 to 1,000 mg per day., Taking ginger supplements in extract form (specifically Zintoma or Goldaru) can help reduce the pain associated with your period.Take 250 mg four times a day for the first three days of your period.

Understand what an incompetent cervix is.,
Be aware that there are usually no symptoms.,
Schedule an appointment for an examination.,
Receive a transvaginal ultrasound.,
Discuss cerclage with your doctor.,
Discuss other preventative treatment options with your doctor.",How to Prevent Incompetent Cervix1," An incompetent cervix can also be referred to as a cervical insufficiency. This means that your cervix is found to have shortened, funneled, or dilated during your second trimester of your pregnancy. If the shape of the cervix changes, it creates a potential for miscarriage or preterm birth. Your cervix can change for many reasons, including (among other reasons):


A history of cervical surgery and trauma, such as LEEPs, cervical cones, dilation of the cervix for pregnancy terminations, or D&C.
A history of cervical lacerations with vaginal delivery.
Congenital defects (anatomical anomalies).;
, Cervical insufficiency often has no symptoms. The diagnosis must be made using a history of previous painless cervical dilations after the first trimester. During these procedures, you cannot have an infection, bleeding, or broken water. If you do experience symptoms, then some of your symptoms might include::


Abdominal cramping and lower back pain. You may experience mild cramps, often resembling menstrual cramps in the nature of the pain.
Vaginal discharge. You may notice a change in the volume, color, and/or consistency of your vaginal discharge.
Vaginal bleeding, although this is less common.
Note that many cases are entirely asymptomatic.Therefore, if you have a history of the condition or of previous preterm births, or other risk factors for incompetent cervix, it is best to check in with your doctor on a regular basis.
If you do have symptoms, they will most often present between 14 to 20 weeks gestation.

, Physical examination by a medical specialist (usually a gynecologist) is key to assessing the condition of your cervix.Things your doctor will look for include:


Signs of ""cervical effacement,"" which is when the cervix thins and stretches in preparation for birth.Signs of ""cervical dilatation,"" which is when the opening of the cervix begins to widen in preparation for birth.The doctor may also do ""provocative maneuvers,"" pushing on your uterus or asking you to do certain maneuvers that increase the pressure, to see if they can see any fetal membranes poking through with the application of pressure. If fetal membranes are visible, this is always a bad sign as it is a very high risk factor for preterm birth due to incompetent cervix.

, Using this technology, the doctor will be able to see if your cervix has dilated (or opened) in an abnormal way.At 18 to 22 weeks, you can have an ultrasound done to measure your cervix.


Transvaginal ultrasound is usually the quickest and most reliable way in which incompetent cervix is detected and diagnosed as soon as possible.
Early detection is key, because there are strategies doctors can use to prevent any further dilation of the cervix in order to ward off a preterm birth.

, Something called a ""cervical cerclage"" is a type of suture that is placed below the internal opening of the cervix, and the cervix is tightened with sutures in a circular fashion (which means that the cervix is tightened up so that it can’t dilate—or open up—further than it should). This is actually the best way to prevent an incompetent cervix so if you have a high risk of developing this condition, talk to your doctor about this procedure.The sutures are put in 12 to 14 weeks into your pregnancy and removed around the 36 to 38 week mark of your pregnancy.They can also be placed at the time of diagnosis, which is called a rescue cerclage. These generally are not done after 25 to 26 weeks.

, Cervical cerclage is the ""gold standard"" of preventative treatment for incompetent cervix. However, your doctor may suggest some additional treatment options.


Ask about ""vaginal pessary."" This is a device that is inserted into the vagina to alter the position of the cervix so that the weight of the uterine contents do not push the cervix open prematurely."

Get regular screenings.,
See your doctor for a Pap test.A Pap test is recommended three years after the onset of sexual activity, or beginning at age 21 (whichever comes first).,
Prepare properly for a Pap test.If you are planning to see your doctor for a Pap test within the next two days, it is important to avoid the following:


Sexual intercourse
Douching your vagina
Tampon insertion
Using any birth control foams or jellies
Inserting any creams or medications into your vagina
Being on your period.,
Consider HPV testing.In addition to the usual Pap test, you can ask your doctor to test you for the presence of the HPV virus at the same time.,
Recognize the risk factors for cervical cancer.Understanding what increases your chances of developing cervical cancer can help you to cut back and to adopt safer behaviors.,
Get vaccinated.There are two HPV vaccines available, Gardasil and Cervarix, that are recommended for girls around the age of 12.,
Quit smoking.Smoking has been linked to a heightened risk of cervical cancer (and of cancers elsewhere in the body, too).,
Practice safe sex.Because cervical cancer is linked to HPV, a sexually transmitted infection, practicing safe sex and using condoms during sex can decrease your risk.,
Understand the importance of screening tests and early diagnosis.Cervical cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in women; however, if you follow through with regular screening tests as directed by your doctor, you can diminish your risk of contracting cervical cancer to almost zero.,
Follow through with further investigations as needed.If your Pap test reveals suspicious cells or a worrisome lesion, your doctor will advise you on a course of action to follow up on the cause for concern.,
Be aware of concerning symptoms.",How to Prevent Cervical Cancer," Cervical cancer starts with the presence of HPV (human papillomavirus), which is the most common sexually transmitted infection.Virtually everyone has HPV at least once in their life, if not more; however, the infection most often shows no symptoms so most people are unaware of having it. HPV, over time, can lead to precancerous chances in the sensitive cells around the cervix. This eventually poses the risk of developing into cervical cancer.


Most people are able to clear the infection, which eliminates the risk of cervical cancer; however, if you aren't able to clear the infection then you are at risk for cervical cancer.
By getting regular screenings, you can catch any suspicious cells early and have them treated.
Regular screening is the most effective way to prevent cervical cancer.;
, Women should continue receiving Pap tests until the age 65, or until your doctor says otherwise. A Pap test entails your doctor insert a speculum (a metal or plastic device) into your vagina so that they can see the cervix. Your doctor will then take a sample of cells from the cervix for examination under the microscope.


A Pap test is usually performed annually for the first few years. After that, if you have clear results, your doctor may recommend you come back every three years if you are between the ages of 21 and 29. After age 30 it is every three years unless you also have a negative HPV testing, and then it is every five years.
If any cellular abnormalities are detected on your Pap test, your doctor will call you back in for a follow-up appointment. Results are normally reported back within a few weeks; however, don't panic if your doctor calls you back as there are several other reasons they may want to see you and it does not necessarily mean that you are at risk of cervical cancer.
Also, the benefit of receiving Pap tests is that, as long as you do them regularly, any suspicious lesions tend to be caught early enough to remove them before any further problems arise.

, Be sure to schedule your Pap test for a time when you will not have your period. If you do have your period, your doctor will be unable to properly perform the test as it will cloud the results.

, This is called ""co-testing."" The benefit of testing for HPV at the same time as analyzing the cells around your cervix is that, if both tests give you clear results, you can have even higher confidence of not being at risk for cervical cancer.


A negative HPV test and regular Pap will also decrease how often you get your paps, from every three years to every five years.

, Risk factors for cervical cancer include the following:


Multiple sexual partners
Unprotected sex (without condoms)
Smoking
HIV/AIDS (an illness that suppresses your immune system)
Long-term birth control use (greater than five years)
Any type of immune suppression, including immunosuppressive drugs

, These vaccines prevent the strains of HPV that are most likely to lead to cervical cancer and/or genital warts. Although the vaccines are not 100% effective, they greatly diminishes one's risk of contracting a strain of HPV that is a precursor for cervical cancer.


You are also eligible to get the vaccine even if you have already had an abnormal pap.
Note that having been vaccinated does not mean you no longer need Pap tests. Pap tests are still recommended in order to be sure that there are no suspicious cells or lesions around your cervix.
Also, if you are between the ages of 13 and 26 and have not yet received the vaccine, speak to your doctor. You are still eligible to receive it between these ages.
The sooner you can get vaccinated the better, as it is ideal to receive the vaccine prior to initiating sex, or at least with a history of as few sexual partners as possible. This is because HPV is a sexually transmitted infection that cannot be cured; it can only be prevented.

, If you smoke and are interested in quitting, speak to your doctor who can help you with strategies and support for quitting. The benefits from quitting smoking are numerous, including a reduced risk of cervical cancer.

, Also, be aware that multiple sexual partners is linked to a higher risk of cervical cancer, so be selective in who you choose to have sex with.

, This is because it is one of the few cancers that can be detected and treated early, at the ""precancerous stage,"" before it develops into a full-blown cancer.


Therefore, with early diagnosis and treatment, virtually all cases of cervical cancer can be prevented before they become worrisome to your health.

, This may include a second Pap test shortly after the first one, to monitor any progression or changes to the cells. Alternatively, it may involve a procedure called a ""colposcopy,"" which is essentially where doctors use a microscope-like instrument to visually examine your cervix at a high enough magnification to detect any precancerous or cancerous concerns.


Your doctor will apply acetic acid (a substance similar to vinegar) to any concerning areas during your colposcopy exam. This helps your doctor to see which areas have suspicious cells.If an area of concern is noted, your doctor will take a biopsy of the area.This will then be examined under the microscope.
If caught early enough, the suspicious lesion can often be removed without long-term consequences; however, if it is an invasive cancer, you will need to see an oncologist for direction regarding further treatments, such as surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.

, Suspicious cells around the cervix, as well as cervical cancer itself, often have no associated symptoms. Only later-stage more advanced cervical cancer tends to present with symptoms, such as:


Abnormal bleeding or discharge from your vagina
Bleeding and/or abnormal pain with sexual intercourse
Note that presence of the above symptoms is a definite sign of concern and warrants prompt medical attention and evaluation."

Be aware that sexually active women are more at risk than other women who do not have intercourse regularly.,
Understand how bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed.",How to Prevent Bacterial Vaginosis from Recurring," A week long antibiotic treatment is usually prescribed to women with Bacterial Vaginosis.


You should be very careful not to miss any medication throughout the course of treatment. Stopping the medication without the advice of the healthcare provider will cause bacterial resistance to the antibiotic and will increase the possibility of the disease recurrence.
The type of antibiotic you are prescribed may vary depending upon the severity of the condition.;
, Metronidazole is the standard drug given to patients with Bacterial Vaginosis. Metronidazole works by interfering with the bacterial and protozoal cells’ genetic material (also known as DNA).


This prevents the bacteria and protozoa from forming new DNA and eventually kills them. The recommended dose is 7.5 mg/kg orally every 6 hours but must not exceed 4 grams daily.
Patients should be made aware that during the course of the treatment, they are not allowed to drink alcohol or other related products as this can lead to adverse reactions such as skin flushing, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia (increased heart rate above 100 beats per minute when resting), and difficulty breathing.

, Clindamycin is used when Metronidazole doesn’t work and the vaginal discharge keeps on coming back.


It works by blocking the production of proteins in the bacteria which are necessary for their growth. They eventually die without these proteins.
The recommended dose is 300 mg orally two times a day.

, The partners of women who have been diagnosed with Bacterial Vaginosis are not usually treated. However, if the disease is recurring, the doctor may consider assessing the patient’s partner and possibly recommend treatment for them as well.

, Occurrences of bacterial vaginosis are higher in women who do not exercise proper hygiene, such as regular bathing.


It is recommended that you wash your vaginal area as well as anal area with mild soap (one with a lower pH, normally less than 7).
The vagina typically has an acidic environment (lower pH) thus using a mild soap with a pH that's closer to the vagina's natural flora will prevent harming any good bacteria.

, Remember to wipe from the front of the vagina to the back in order to prevent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. You should also wipe from front to back after a bowel movement.


This prevents E. coli, a type of bacteria from feces, from entering in the vagina and disrupting the balance of natural organisms in the vagina.

, Avoiding harsh and scented soaps and detergents can also prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis.


Harsh soaps and detergents irritate the vagina and cause an imbalance of microorganisms in the area due.
Additionally, cervical caps and medical applicators should be cleaned thoroughly before and after each use to prevent the spread of bacteria.

, This practice could potentially alter the natural bacteriologic balance of the vagina as it can wash away the good bacteria which are necessary for vaginal health.

, The use of tampons could promote bacterial growth, harm the vaginal cavity and expose the vagina to blood which has a relatively different pH.

, It is believed that wearing a thong could greatly increase the possibility of transferring microorganisms from the anus to the vagina, which could lead to bacterial vaginosis.

, If an attack of bacterial vaginosis symptoms occurs after sexual intercourse, it is advisable to abstain from sex until any symptoms have completely cleared up.

, During sexual intercourse, this condom completely covers the entire vagina, thus preventing the balance of bacteria being disrupted.

, The use of these commercially made pads makes the genitals warm and moist because they prevents the entrance of air. This kind of environment attracts bacteria, leading to an imbalance of the flora in the vagina. Switching to cotton or cloth pads is advisable, as they are more hygienic.

, Bacterial vaginosis is often caused by a disruption in the vagina’s normal flora. This happens when good bacteria is outnumbered by bad bacteria due to various elements, such as washing the vagina with harsh products or using an antibiotic.


In order to reverse the condition and thereby increase the amount of good bacteria in the vagina, you could try adding probiotics to your diet. Probiotics are high in good bacteria and by adding them to your diet you could potentially prevent bacterial vaginosis from recurring.
Probiotics are live microorganisms that serve the same function as those microorganisms typically found in the vagina. Add at least one food rich in probiotics to each of your major meals. Supplements or food products that are rich in probiotics are the following:
Dairy products such as acidophilus milk, cultured cottage cheese, buttermilk, kefir (fermented milk), yogurt, miso (fermented soybeans and rice), kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha (fermented tea).

, The exact cause of Bacterial Vaginosis can be difficult to identify, however there are several factors that may be attributed to this disease. These include the following:


Bacterial Content Imbalance. The vaginal cavity is protected with harmless bacteria that protect the vagina. Yet, there are factors that disturb the homeostasis in the vagina which allows the penetration of bad bacteria, resulting in Bacterial Vaginosis. The bacterial content imbalance in the vagina could possible be caused by: an operation on the vagina, douching, or placing inappropriate and unsterile items into the vagina.
Sex: Although there is no clear link between sexual intercourse and the development of Bacterial Vaginosis, it is believed that the disease may be the result sexual intercourse involving unhygienic practices.

, In most instances, women with Bacterial Vaginosis do not notice any signs or symptoms. In the women who do experience symptoms, they include:


Grey, white or yellowish discharge. The disease can lead to unwanted vaginal discharges that are commonly caused by the growth of bad bacteria.
Foul-smelling discharge. The vaginal discharge is often described as having a “fishy odor.” This odor tends to worsen after sexual intercourse.
Lack of soreness or itchiness. BV is usually non-irritant and is not accompanied with any soreness or itchiness. In most instances, .

, Bacterial Vaginosis is usually described as asymptomatic, however in rare cases, a burning and stinging sensation may be experienced during urination due to an inflamed vagina.

, Sexual intercourse is said to be a precipitating factor that contributes to the occurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis. The incidence of BV in women who abstain fro intercourse is very rare.


However, there is a type of penile inflammation that affects the tip of a man’s penis that seems to be connected to the bacteria found in Bacterial Vaginosis, supporting the idea that the disease is sexually transmitted.
At present however, there is no reliable evidence or facts to support the claim that Bacterial Vaginosis is transmittable.

, Bacterial Vaginosis is diagnosed through an assessment of vaginal discharge, combined with the results of the following tests:


Checking the pH or alkalinity of the vaginal secretions. The normal pH of women’s vaginal secretions is slightly acidic. But once they are affected by the disease, their secretion becomes more alkaline leading to a pH that is greater than 5.
Potassium Hydroxide Test/Whiff Test. A sample of vaginal discharge is collected and a 10 percent potassium hydroxide solution is added. The result is considered positive if a distinctive smell is produced. But recently, this test is not recommended because the substance used during the procedure is discovered to have a harmful effect.
Microscope examination. The discharge sample is brought to the laboratory to be examined microscopically. The presence of unusual cells on the discharge, which are described as odd and speckled, suggests the presence of Bacterial Vaginosis.

Get more rest.Although complete bedrest is not yet scientifically proven as a reliable preventative treatment for incompetent cervix, most doctors recommend as much rest as possible if you are at risk of the condition in order to minimize the chances of premature birth.,
Avoid intense exercise if you have an incompetent cervix.,
Refrain from sexual intercourse.The act of coitus may place additional stress on your cervix, and could provoke further symptoms of incompetent cervix and a greater risk of preterm birth.,
Schedule an appointment with your gynecologist for each month.,
Know that your baby can still be born healthy.",How to Prevent Incompetent Cervix2," You can also try relaxation techniques such as:



Practicing breathing exercises to keep yourself calm.

Meditating each day to stay relaxed.

, Exercise is fine if you are pregnant, but if you have an incompetent cervix, then you should avoid all exercise that puts pressure on your body.You should avoid things such as running, gymnastics, and any sport that involves vigorous body movement.


Your doctor may also recommend that you take time off work. This will depend upon what type of job you have, and the physical demands your line of work entails.
It is definitely advisable to refrain from heavy lifting and other strenuous jobs.

, Try exploring other forms of sexual activity that do not put the same strain on your cervix that intercourse does.

, If you are concerned that you might be at risk of developing an incompetent cervix, you should have a gynecologist check up on you at least once a month (if not more often) to make sure that the pregnancy is going smoothly.

, It is important to remember not to panic if you are diagnosed with an incompetent cervix. You can still give birth to a happy, healthy baby but you must follow your doctor’s instructions.

Take your BBT first thing in the morning and record your temperature in a small calendar on your bedside table. You should take this reading before you get out of bed to prepare for the day for it to be most accurate.
Your BBT remains stable throughout the first half of your menstrual cycle, then it drops when there is a surge of progesterone signaling that ovulation is about to start. Your temperature then rises half a degree when you are actively ovulating. The most optimal time to have sex is two days prior to ovulation, right before the temperature rise. It takes time for the sperm to get to the egg. If you have sex the day of ovulation, you have only a 5 percent chance to conceive.;
, Your vaginal discharge, which consists of cervical mucus, provides important clues about where you are in your menstrual cycle. Hormonal fluctuations cause the consistency and color of your cervical mucus to change..


Fertile discharge is clear and thin, and it has the consistency of egg whites. You have this kind of discharge when you are ovulating.Discharge during the rest of your menstrual cycle tends to be cloudy and white and may be thick or thin.
It is not uncommon to have brownish discharge for a few days after your period. This is the result of your vagina cleaning out old blood. Usually, you have less discharge after your period ends.

, Your cervix, the tunnel between your vagina and uterus, changes throughout your menstrual cycle. The texture and position of your cervix lets you know if you are ovulating.Probe your cervix with one or two fingers daily and write down your observations about its position and texture to start tracking trends.
During the first part of your menstrual cycle, your cervix is hard and low. As your body prepares to ovulate, your cervix softens, opens slightly, and shortens to allow sperm an easy access to your ovum.
You may need to reach your finger several inches into your vagina before you feel your cervix. Once the tip of your finger touches a donut-shaped opening at the end of your vagina, you have reached your cervix.
If you are unsure how to feel your cervix, read more here.

, Ovulation test kits reveal your level of luteinizing hormone (LH). Your LH level spikes right before your ovary releases an egg, indicating your fertile time..


Like a pregnancy test, an over-the-counter ovulation test kit requires a urine sample to determine your levels of LH. The test turns positive the day before ovulation occurs; thus, you may need to do several tests daily around the time of ovulation to identify the correct day.Checking your cervix and tracking trends in your vaginal discharge can help you determine when you should take an ovulation test. Also, ovulation kits provide guidance about when to check urine based on how irregular your menses are.

Calculate your menstrual cycle.,
Pick the right time of day.,
Be consistent.,
Keep applying the cream if you become pregnant.,
Choose the right spots.,
Rotate application spots.,
Pay attention to dosage.,
Ask your doctor questions.,
Research different creams.,
Shop around.,
Know the possible effects.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Use Progesterone Cream for Fertility," Your hormones have a lot to do with your monthly period, so it is important to take your cycle into account when beginning to use the cream. Your hormones are working as a team to trigger ovulation, so it's important to help balance the hormones.You can chart your cycle by identifying the expected first day of your next period, then counting backwards two weeks (14 days) from then. This would be day 14 for a woman with a cycle duration of 28 days, or day 21 for another woman with a cycle duration of 35 days.
The exact day will differ from woman to woman according to her calculations and and her cycle's usual duration.;
, Generally, you will want to apply the cream twice a day, unless instructed otherwise by your doctor. Since you will likely want to apply the cream at home (so you don't have to tote it to work), you should choose two times when you are generally at home. Try to apply once in the morning, after your shower, and once at night, before bedtime., As with any medication or supplement, it can be very helpful to get into a routine when applying your progesterone cream. Make it a habit to apply your cream at the same time each day. Soon, the application will be second nature, and you will be less likely to forget a dose., If you learn that you are pregnant while using the cream, keep applying your normal doses. It is important that your progesterone levels do not drop early in a pregnancy, as that could result in loss of the fetus. Make sure to consult your doctor before you stop applying the cream., Progesterone cream is a fat-soluble substance, which makes it easily absorbed through the skin. It is best to choose spots on your body that have the greatest amounts of capillary blood, because it will be absorbed most quickly. There are many different spots that will work. You can rub small amounts of the cream into your neck, face, breasts, chest, and the insides of your hands., In order to avoid a particular area of your body becoming saturated, mix up the application spots each day. For example, do not apply to your neck both in the morning and the evening. If you have trouble remembering which spot you used last, just make a note and stick it to your bathroom mirror. That will serve as an easy reminder., When trying to become pregnant, you will typically need 30-40 milligrams of progesterone per day. The cream can easily be used to supplement what your body is supplying. Most creams come with instructions to apply about 20 milligrams twice a day. That is an amount about the size of 1/4 of a teaspoon., Make sure to discuss your specific fertility issues with your doctor to determine if progesterone cream will be right for you.Talk to your doctor if you have amenorrhea or a lack of a menstruation cycle. For women with amenorrhea (no period), it can be more difficult to use progesterone cream, as calculation of when to start the cream can be complicated., Some progesterone creams are available over the counter, while others require a prescription from your doctor. You should ask your pharmacist about different options, and ask for details about the differences. When applying anything to your skin, make sure to read the ingredients and make sure that you do not have any known allergies., If you decide to go with an over the counter option, you might want to try your local natural health store. Homeopathic remedies can be very successful, and you can ask the staff at a small store any questions you may have. You might receive more personalized advice than at a large chain store.

, While generally considered safe, progesterone can cause some unwanted side effects. Some users have reported issues such as upset stomachs and weight gain. Others have noticed depression-like or PMS-like symptoms. Remember, this cream contains hormones, so it will affect you physically., Before you start using progesterone cream, discuss your options with your doctor. Explain your concerns, and what you hope to gain from using the cream. Ask all of the questions that you have, and gain a clear understanding of what the cream can do for you.

Chart your menstrual cycle on a calendar for eight to 12 cycles.,
Count the total number of days in each cycle.,
Identify the shortest cycle in your cycle record.,
Note the longest cycle in your cycle record.,
Determine your fertility window.",How to Use Fertility Charting1," To get a sense of your menstrual cycle, you should be prepared to track your cycle for at least eight to 12 months. Use a calendar you can write on and mark down each day of your cycle or keep track of your cycle on your cellphone’s calendar app. The calendar method will help you keep track of the length of each of your menstrual cycles, which can then help you determine when you are most fertile, or your fertility window.Circle the first day of your cycle, which is the first day you have a menstrual flow, on the calendar. This will be Day 1. Continue to circle each day of your cycle for the entire month. Stop circling days of the month when your period is over. The average menstrual cycle can range between 28 to 32 days.
Repeat this day-to-day tracking of your period for at least eight to 12 months. This will give you a clear sense of your menstrual cycle and hopefully account for any irregularities in your cycle.;
, Make sure you include the first day of your cycle when you count. Do this for all cycles you have tracked. An example cycle record may look like this:January 20: 29 days
February 18: 29 days
March 18: 28 days
April 16: 29 days
May 12: 26 days
June 9: 28 days
July 9: 30 days
August 5: 27 days
You should not use the calendar method if your cycle is less than 27 days during an eight to 12 month period.

, This cycle will be used to determine your first fertile day or the start of your fertility window.Subtract 18 from the total number of days of your shortest cycle. Count the resulting number of days from day one of your current cycle and circle or mark that day with an X. Make sure you include day one when you count the days. The day you circled or marked is your first fertile day.
For example, if your shortest cycle is 27 days, subtract 18 from 27 to get 9. Then, count 9 days from day one of your current cycle to get your first fertile day. If day one of your current cycle is the fourth day of the month, you will count 9 days from the fourth day. You will then mark the 12th day as your first fertile day or the start of your fertility window.

, This cycle will be used to determine your last fertile day or the end of your fertility window.Subtract 11 from the total number of days of your longest cycle. For example, if your longest menstrual cycle was 30 days, take 30 and subtract 11 to get 19. This means the last day of your fertility window is on the 19th day of your cycle.

, Use the days you calculated based on your shortest cycle and your longest cycle to determine your fertility window. In the above example, your most fertile days will be from the 12th day to the 19th day of your cycle. This means ovulation is expected to occur on one day during this time frame.If you are trying to conceive, you should have sexual intercourse with your partner during your fertility window to increase your chances of getting pregnant. Though you cannot get pregnant every day during your fertility window, there is one 12 – 24 hour time frame during this period where pregnancy has a very high chance of occurring.
If you are trying to avoid getting pregnant, you should abstain from sexual intercourse during your fertility window or use birth control during this time. You can have unprotected sexual intercourse the day after the last day of your fertility window, but not before, as this could lead to pregnancy. Keep in mind that fertility charting is considered the least effective form of birth control and may result in unexpected pregnancy, even if you don't have sex during your charted fertility window.

Ask your doctor about fertility drugs.,
Consider laparoscopic surgery.,
Discuss the possibility of a salpingectomy with your doctor.,
Try selective tubal cannulation.,
Move on to in vitro fertilization (IVF).",How to Treat Blocked Fallopian Tubes1," If only one of your tubes is blocked, and you are otherwise healthy, your doctor may suggest a course of fertility drugs like clomiphene, Femera, Follistim, Gonal-F, Bravelle, Fertinex, Ovidrel, Novarel,Antagon, Lupron, or Pergonal.Several of these drugs (Lupron, Pergonal) shut down the pituitary gland so you can control it with medication. They may be used in combination with other drugs, which cause your pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby increasing the likelihood that you will ovulate and become pregnant (using the open fallopian tube).


Note that this treatment will not work if both your fallopian tubes are blocked. If this is the case, you’ll need to begin with more aggressive treatment options.
The most common risks of taking fertility drugs are multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).OHSS occurs when your ovaries become filled with too much fluid.;
, If your doctor thinks you are a good candidate for surgery, they may recommend a laparoscopy to open blocked tubes and remove any existing scar tissue. Laparoscopic surgery does not always work. The success of your procedure will depend on your age and the cause and extent of your blockage.


If your blocked tube is relatively healthy, you have a 20 – 40% chance of getting pregnant after surgery.
The procedure will not be painful because you will be under general anesthesia. Risks of laparoscopic surgery include bladder infection and skin irritation around the surgery site.If you have a particular kind of blocked fallopian tube known as hydrosalpinx, in which the tube fills with fluid, you may not be a good candidate for surgery. Discuss your options with your physician — they may recommend removing the tube.
This kind of surgery increases your risk of future ectopic pregnancies (in which the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus). If you do get pregnant after your laparoscopy, your doctor should follow your progress closely and watch for signs of an ectopic pregnancy.

, Salpingectomy involves removing part of your fallopian tube. This procedure is done when a tube has a buildup of fluid called hydrosalpinx. This procedure is done before undergoing an attempt at in vitro fertilization (IVF).If the end of the fallopian tube is blocked due to hydrosalpinx, a salpingostomy is performed. This procedure creates an opening in the fallopian tube near the ovaries. It is common for tubes to become re-blocked by scar tissue following this procedure., If you have a blockage that is close to your uterus, your doctor may recommend selective tubal cannulation – a medical procedure done by inserting a cannula through the cervix, uterus, and fallopian tube. The cannula is used to open the blocked portion of the fallopian tube.This is an outpatient procedure and less invasive than laparoscopic surgery. It is done by hysteroscopy, in which your doctor inserts a thin tube with a camera, which allows your doctor to see inside your uterus. You may or may not need general anesthesia.
Tubal cannulation is not recommended if you have other conditions such as genital tuberculosis, previous fallopian tube surgery, and severe damage or scarring in your fallopian tubes.Potential risks of this procedure include tearing of your fallopian tube, peritonitis (infection of the tissue around your organs), or an unsuccessful restoration of your fallopian tube function., If these treatments do not work (or if your doctor thinks you are not a good candidate for these treatments), you still have options for becoming pregnant. The most common of these options is IVF, in which doctors fertilize an egg with sperm outside your body, then insert the resulting embryo or embryos into your uterus. This method bypasses the fallopian tubes, so blockages do not present a problem.


The success of IVF depends on many different factors including your age and the cause of your infertility. IVF is also very time consuming and expensive and can be very difficult emotionally for patients.Risks of IVF include ectopic pregnancy, multiple births, premature delivery and low birth weight, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, miscarriage, and stress due to the emotional, mental, and financial burden."

Remember that a negative test could be false.,
Troubleshoot if nothing appears in the test stick window.,
Place the cap back on the test.",How to Take an EPT Pregnancy Test," Early pregnancy tests can also be taken up to five days prior to your period, but results are not as accurate. Missing a period is usually considered a sign that you might be pregnant. Ovulation usually occurs about halfway between the start dates of two consecutive periods.
Most women ovulate between 11 and 21 days into their menstrual cycle.
During this fertile period, pregnancy can result from having unprotected intercourse or a failure in birth control methods.
Usually a late or missed period is an indicator of pregnancy, though you can miss your period for other reasons (such as stress, hormonal changes, illness, etc.).
When taken the day of your expected period, EPT pregnancy tests are 99% accurate.;
, Using one of these tests too early can give a false negative result. This is because the test works by measuring the levels of a certain hormone (HcG) in your urine.
This hormone is present only when the egg has been fertilized and it has become implanted in the lining of the uterus.
HcG is present in your urine after conception, but at very low levels at first.
If the test is taken too early, the hormone level might not have reached the level at which the test can detect a pregnancy.
Try to avoid taking the test before the first day of your expected period if possible.

, The time of day can make a difference when using a pregnancy test. Most pregnancy tests suggest that you use the test when you first urinate in the morning.
This is because your urine is more concentrated in the morning and may contain more HcG.
Doing this decreases the possibility of a false negative result that could occur later in the day.
False negatives can occur if you drink a lot of fluid during the day and your urine becomes diluted.

, There are two types of EPT Pregnancy Tests available. One uses simple lines to indicate pregnancy, while the other actually displays the word “pregnant” or “not pregnant.” Both have the same accuracy rating, so choosing between them is just a personal choice.
While easier to read, the digital tests are more expensive.
Each box usually contains two tests.

, Each box contains two separate tests, so purchasing one box is sufficient for most women. It is important to be sure that the box is sealed and that there are no signs of damage that could lead to false test results
You should also check the expiration date on the box to be sure that the pregnancy test has not been sitting on the store shelf too long and lost its ability to function properly.
If your box is damaged or the tests are expired, purchase a new test.

, When you are ready to take the EPT pregnancy test, open the box and remove one of the test sticks, which are wrapped separately. The wrapper should be removed from the test stick before use.
Many women open the wrapper all the way and set it nearby so that they can place the used test on it while waiting for the results to appear.
Otherwise, discard the wrapper.

, The test will have a cap on one end. It should be removed after you are sitting on the toilet so that you do not need to lay the opened test stick down anywhere and risk contamination.
Once you remove the cap, make sure you don't set the test stick down. If it becomes dirty, you may contaminate the test and get an incorrect result.
Save the cap for later use. If you are going to show the test to a partner, you will want to re-cap it for sanitary reasons.

, This end will absorb the urine. The end of the test stick that was under the cap needs to be held in your stream of urine for at least five seconds in order for the test to work properly.
An alternative to holding the test stick in the stream of urine is to catch some of the urine in a disposable cup and hold the end of the test in the urine.
Usually when a container of urine is used, the test stick needs to remain in the urine for about 20 seconds.
If a cup is used, it is important to properly dispose of it.

, Without touching the end that was in the urine to anything, you should lay the test stick down on the wrapper or a flat surface. The test stick is designed so that when it is placed flat, the testing end is not in contact with the surface.
Placing the test stick on the wrapper can help you to prevent the absorbent end from touching anything.
Alternatively, you can now place the cap back onto the test.

, These next few moments may be nerve racking. Take a deep breath and try to relax. It can take two to ten minutes for the results to appear.
Some women find it emotionally easier to set a timer and walk away from the test stick.
When the results appear, you will need to interpret them. This is especially important if you use the non-digital test.

, The words ""Pregnant"" or ""Not Pregnant"" will appear in the window.The results of this test usually appear within three minutes.
The EPT tests with the results given in word form are easy to interpret, but are more expensive than standard line tests.
While you wait for the results, an hourglass may appear in the window.
The hourglass symbol will flash to show the test is working.
When it stops flashing, your results should appear.

, The tests that use the line indicator can be a bit more challenging to understand. For these, there are two small windows on the side of the test stick.
The square one will show a single line within 10 minutes after taking the test. This line simply indicates that the test stick was properly used.
The other window is round and it is the one that indicates if the test was positive or negative.
If you are not pregnant, the round window will have a single line.
If the test is positive and you are pregnant, it will show two lines that are crossed to form a plus sign.
It is irrelevant if one line is darker than the other as long as the plus sign is visible.

, It is important to remember that a negative test result could be false if the test was taken too early. If you want to confirm the negative result, wait a few days and then use the second test stick from the box.
Instead of using the second test, you can also wait to see if you have your next period.
If you re-test after missing a second period and get a negative result, contact your medical provider.

, If there is nothing displayed in the test windows after 10 minutes, you should check the instructions in the box to make sure you did everything correctly. If you think that you did something incorrectly, you can use the second test from the box to take another test while following the instructions more closely.
If there are no results with the second test, you should contact the company because the product may be faulty.
If you experience this, you can call the company and they may send you another test.

, Once you have found your results, put the cap back on the test so that anyone else who looks at the test stick will not come into contact with your urine.


The cap will not cover the results window.
The results will remain in the window on the line test.
The results on a digital test may disappear after a few days.

Put the thermometer in your mouth to take the reading.,
Record your BBT right away.,
Check the chart after two cycles and look for any patterns.,
Identify the most fertile times in your cycle.",How to Take Your Basal Body Temperature," You can buy a digital BBT thermometer at your local drugstore or the health aisle of your local supermarket. It will be labeled as thermometer specifically made for basal body temperature (BBT) readings. A digital BBT thermometer will allow you to get a quick, accurate reading. It will also beep when it has recorded your temperature and provide an easy to read number, which can be handy when you are sleepy in the morning.Some digital BBT thermometers also store the temperature for you. However, you should still record the temperature in a more permanent way, such as in a BBT journal or in a BBT app on your smartphone.
You can also use a non-digital BBT thermometer as long as the thermometer is made to measure your basal body temperature, such as a glass thermometer.;
, You will need to set up a routine in which you take your basal body temperature first thing when you wake up and are still lying down, before you move, stretch, or even talk. The idea is to get an accurate reading of your body at rest, and moving or talking can lead to a false BBT reading. To make it easier to take your temperature first thing in the morning, place the BBT thermometer next to your bed on a bedside table so it is handy when you wake up.If you are using a glass thermometer, make sure you shake it down at night before you place it on your bedside table. This way, it will be ready to use when you wake up.

, Try to take your temperature at the same time every morning. Set an alarm and try to stay within half an hour of your average time so your temperature does not vary too much from day to day.Always make sure you get at least three to five hours of continuous sleep before you take your basal body temperature to ensure the reading is accurate., You can take your basal body temperature by putting it in your mouth in the same location every morning. Keep it in your mouth for several seconds to allow the thermometer to get an accurate reading.Some women take their basal body temperatures vaginally or rectally, especially if they find it difficult to get an accurate reading using the oral option. Make sure that no matter which method you chose, you stay with the same method for the duration of your cycle. Always place the thermometer in the same spot and at the same depth vaginally and rectally.

, To track your BBT effectively, you should write down the reading in the morning. Do this in a journal or on your phone using a tracking app. There are several apps available that will plot your readings on a chart or graph. You can then use the chart to get a better sense of your cycle and your ovulation periods.Make sure the chart includes a vertical section for the day of your cycle (1,2,3, etc), the month, and the date. It should have an horizontal section with a temperature range of 99°F to 96°F. Before ovulation, a woman’s BBT averages between 97°F (36.1°C) and 97.5°F (36.4°C). After ovulation, it usually rises 97.6°F (36.4°C) to 98.6°F (37°C).
You can view a sample BBT chart online., You will need to chart your basal body temperature for at least one to two cycles to get an accurate picture of your fertility. You should note any clear patterns on the charts, such as a temperature rise or fall at the same time in your cycle for both months.Notice if there is a temperature shift of at least 0.4 degrees within 48-hours on your chart. This is a sign that you are ovulating. The temperature shift should be higher than the highest temperatures that you recorded the previous six days. Most women have a basal body temperature of 96 to 98°F (35.6 to 36.7°C) one to two days before ovulation., For most women, the most fertile period is two days before their basal body temperature rises or they begin ovulation. Keep in mind sperm can live up to five days in your reproductive tract, so if you would like to get pregnant, you should have sex two days before you begin ovulating. If you do not want to get pregnant, you should avoid having sex from when your menstrual period starts until three to four days after your basal body temperature rises, though you should not rely on this as a form of contraception until you have tried it for a few months.


If your basal body temperature stays up for more than 18 days after you have ovulated, you should get tested for pregnancy."

Start a chart on the first day of your period.,
Chart your BBT every day.,
Add descriptions of your vaginal discharge for each day to the chart.,
Observe averages in your ovulation charts to get a better idea of when you are fertile.,
Use your ovulation chart to track period lengths.",How to Work out Ovulation With Irregular Periods2," Ovulation charts are useful for combining results from your vaginal discharge and basal body temperature (BBT) that can be used to identify trends in your cycle. Although you are having irregular periods, start the tracking on the first day of your period.The first day of your period is day one. If your menstrual cycle is irregular, then you may bleed every 21-35 days for 2-7 days, perhaps with some spotting.Number each of the days preceding your period. When you start a new period, then that is your new day one.
Figure out the number of days your cycles approximately last for a few months. Then try to see if there is an average number that emerges as time passes.

, Create a chart that has temperatures ranging from 97.0 to 98.0 degrees Fahrenheit in increasing increments of 0.1 degrees on the X-axis and the days of your cycle on the Y-axis.Put a dot on the temperature that corresponds your BBT reading under the corresponding day of your cycle. This way you can see if there are fluctuations from day to day in your BBT.
Connecting the dots allows you to track trends more easily from a visual perspective.
There is a drop and then a dramatic spike in your BBT when you ovulate, indicating the two most fertile days of your cycle.
You can find a sample chart at BabyCenter.com., Create an easy to understand key describing your vaginal discharge. For example, D can indicate the dryness that occurs after your menstrual cycle, B can stand for a period, R can stand for regular white discharge, and F can stand for stringy, clear fertile discharge. Compare your descriptions of your discharge against observations from previous cycles and see if your discharge changes consistency within an average range of dates. This can give you a better idea of how your irregular cycle lengths may vary.

, With irregular periods, it can be frustrating and hard to find patterns that indicate when you are most fertile. Your ovulation chart helps you see if there are certain trends that emerge.With irregular menstrual cycles, it can be hard to get a clear cut average, but you can at least better estimate when you evaluate within a range of a few days.

, A frustrating aspect of having an irregular menstrual cycle is being unprepared for your period. You can use an ovulation chart to get a better idea about your cycle length based on averages from previous cycles.You can also see an average of bleeding days emerge from your data, helping you to better prepare for your period when it comes.

Buy a basal thermometer.,
Take your temperature every morning before you get out of bed.,
Record your temperature every day on a calendar for one to three cycles.,
Note a pattern on the chart.,
Identify your fertile days.",How to Use Fertility Charting2," Your body temperature actually falls during the first stage of your menstrual cycle. It then rises slightly after you have ovulated and the egg has been released. Your body temperature will then remain elevated for the rest of your cycle and then fall again just before your next period. Tracking your basal body temperature can help you to determine when you are ovulating and identify your most fertile days.Your basal body temperature (BBT) is the temperature of your body when it is completely at rest. BBT can vary from person to person, but usually, before ovulation your BBT is 96 to 98° F (35.6 to 36.6°C). After ovulation, your BBT is usually 97 to 99°F (36.1 to 37.2°C).

, To track your basal body temperature, you will need to chart your temperature every day for at least 1-3 cycles. The changes in your body temperature will be very small, about 1/10 to ½ a degree. You will need to use a large-scale basal thermometer that is easy to read.You can find basal thermometers at your local drugstore. Look for a thermometer that only registers 96 to 100 °F (35.6 to 37.8°C). Some basal thermometers are made to be used in your mouth or in your rectum. Rectal thermometers are usually more reliable but can be uncomfortable. Regardless of which type of thermometer you choose, you should take your temperature the same way every day.

, Make sure you take your temperature as soon as you wake up. Do not do any activity before you take your temperature, such as talking, eating, having sex, or smoking.Place the thermometer in your mouth or your rectum for a full five minutes. This will give the thermometer enough time to correctly read your temperature. If you are using an oral thermometer, make sure the tip of the thermometer is under your tongue on the soft flesh at the base of your tongue., Record your temperature every morning within 1/10 of a degree. Do this for one to three menstrual cycles to get a good sense of your basal temperature fluctuation.


You can get a calendar or a chart to record each temperature reading from your doctor or your local women’s health center.

, As you continue to record every morning reading on the chart or calendar, you should be able to see a pattern. You may notice that your temperature rises suddenly, gradually, or in steps. You may also notice that the pattern varies from cycle to cycle.Your BBT can shift due to small changes like stress, illness, or fatigue. It may also shift if you smoke and drink. You should note these changes on the chart so you can understand what may have triggered a change or shift in the pattern. You should also try to get three consecutive hours of sleep before you record your temperature so you get an accurate reading.Show the chart to your doctor after you have recorded your temperature every day for three cycles, or three months. Your doctor can then help you to read the chart and determine your fertile days.
If you have a cycle where you do not have any shifts in temperature at all, you should not use this cycle as part of your temperature method and do another cycle to compensate. You may not experience a temperature fluctuation due to stress or due to a genuine anovulatory cycle, which is a cycle with no ovulation., Highlight the days when your temperature rise lasts for at least three consecutive days. Then, highlight the period when your temperature falls back down from this rise. Do this for all three cycles and note if the three high days fall on the same days in your cycle. After these three high days, you have finished ovulation and the remainder of your cycle is infertile.This means that if you are trying to avoid getting pregnant, you should not have unprotected sexual intercourse during the high periods of your temperature chart, and on the days before you ovulate, or when your temperature rises sharply.
If you are trying to conceive, you should plan to have sexual intercourse during the high temperature days of your temperature chart, as this will be when you are most fertile.
The temperature method is often combined with another method, like the menstrual cycle calendar method, to get a clear picture of the fertile and infertile days of the cycle.

Be aware of the two-day mucus method.",How to Use Fertility Charting3," The same hormones that control your menstrual cycle also cause your cervix to produce mucus, which collects on your cervix and in your vagina. The mucus will change in quality and quantity before and during ovulation.When you have your period, your flow will usually cover any signs of mucus. As the egg starts to ripen, more mucus will be produced. It will appear yellow, white and/or cloudy and feel sticky or tacky. You will usually have more mucus just before you start to ovulate and it will appear clear and feel slippery, like raw egg white.
At the peak of your fertility, during your fertility window, the mucus will be very stretchable and slippery. After four slippery days, your body will suddenly produce less mucus and it will appear cloudy and tacky again for several days. You may also notice “dry days” where you do not produce any mucus before your period starts again. These days are considered the days where you are infertile.

, You will need to record the color and texture of your mucus every day for one to three cycles on a chart or calendar. Check your mucus by wiping the opening of your vagina with a tissue before you urinate. You can also look at the mucus discharge on your underpants, or put clean fingers into your vagina to check the mucus.Note the color and texture of the mucus. You should describe the mucus as yellow, white, cloudy, creamy, or clear. You should also note if the mucus has a dry, tacky, wet, or slippery texture and a thick, sticky, or stretchy consistency.To do the mucus method, it is important that you are comfortable with touching your cervical mucus. You will need to analyze and record your mucus every day in order for this method to work effectively as a fertility charting tool.
This method may not be ideal for women who do not produce a lot of mucus. Your mucus pattern can be altered if you are breastfeeding, if you have had cervical surgery, if you have a sexually transmitted infection, if you use douches or other feminine hygiene products, or if you have recently used hormonal contraceptives, such as emergency contraception or Plan B.

, Once you have charted your mucus over one to three cycles, you should start to notice a pattern. Your mucus will usually be the most dry at the start of your cycle, when your fertility is very low. When the mucus starts to appear and feels moist or damp, you have moved into the ovulation stage. You will then experience a clear, slippery mucus when you are highly fertile, or in your fertility window. Finally, you will experience yellow and brown mucus and several dry days with no mucus as your fertility window ends.Identify the two to three days before you experience the first signs of slippery mucus. These are your most fertile days and are the best days to conceive.
Once the slippery mucus drops off and appears cloudy and tacky again, you are no longer in your fertility window. You can have sexual intercourse and have a lower chance of getting pregnant. The dry days that follow the end of the slippery mucus period are also considered safe days for sexual intercourse if you do not want to get pregnant.

, This method works best for a woman who has been using the mucus method consistently from one to three cycles and is good at reading her mucus pattern. To do this method, you will need to ask yourself two question: Do I have cervical mucus today? Did I have cervical mucus yesterday?If you can answer “no” to both questions confidently, it may be safe for you to have unprotected intercourse on that day. Keep in mind women who use this method may have only 12 safe days during every cycle.
The two-day mucus method is not foolproof and should not be your only method of fertility charting. According to Planned Parenthood, of 100 couples who use the two-day method correctly for one year, four will have a pregnancy. As well, of 100 couples who use the cervical mucus method correctly for one year, three will have a pregnancy."

Understand that you may have no symptoms.,
Make an appointment with your doctor if you are unable to get pregnant after trying for a year.,
Schedule a fertility evaluation.,
Consider a sonohysterogram.,
Have a hysterosalpingogram.,
Ask your doctor if a laparoscopy is appropriate.,
Get a diagnosis.",How to Treat Blocked Fallopian Tubes2," Though some women with a particular kind of blocked fallopian tube may experience abdominal pain or increased vaginal discharge, most experience no symptoms at all. In most cases, women only discover the problem when they struggle to get pregnant.

, From a medical perspective, “infertility” means that you are not pregnant after at least one year of regular, unprotected sex. If this happens to you, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist as soon as possible.


If you are over 35 years old, don't have regular menses, or have tested for ovulation and tests are negative, don’t wait a year. Schedule an appointment after six months of regular, unprotected sex.Note that “infertility” is not the same as “sterility.” If you are infertile, you may still be able to conceive a child, with or without medical help. Do not assume that you will never be able to get pregnant.

, Your doctor will probably recommend a complete fertility evaluation for both you and your partner. Your partner will need to provide a sperm sample so that a specialist can rule out a problem with sperm count or motility. You will likely need various tests to confirm that you have normal hormone levels and are ovulating properly. If all of these tests come back normal, then your doctor will recommend checking your fallopian tubes., Your doctor may recommend undergoing a sonohysterogram – a medical procedure that involves using an ultrasound to look for masses in the uterus. Your uterus will first be injected with saline water so that the doctor can see better during the ultrasound. Uterine masses can sometimes block the fallopian tubes.Fibroids, polyps or other masses near the fallopian tubes could cause the blockage.

, A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a medical procedure in which a special dye is injected through your cervix and into your fallopian tubes. X-rays are then taken to determine if the tubes are open or blocked.Hysterosalpingograms are done without anesthesia, and you should experience only mild cramping or discomfort. It can help, however, to take ibuprofen about an hour beforehand.
This procedure usually takes 15 to 30 minutes. Potential risks include pelvic infection or damage to cells or tissue from radiation exposure.If your doctor suspects that your tubes are blocked, they may use an oil-based dye during the procedure. The oil can sometimes remove the blockage., Depending on the results of your sonohysterogram and hysterosalpingogram, your doctor may recommend a laparoscopy — a medical procedure in which an incision in made near your navel to find (and, in certain cases, remove) any tissue that is blocking the tubes.In general, laparoscopy should only be performed after other infertility testing has been done. This is partly because it is a riskier procedure: it’s done under general anesthesia, so it carries all of the risks associated with any major surgery.

, The results of these tests should determine whether one or both of your fallopian tubes are blocked. Ask your doctor to explain the extent of the blockage. Having as specific a diagnosis as possible will help to determine a treatment plan.

Understand that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can lead to blocked fallopian tubes.,
Know the role of pelvic inflammatory disease in causing blocked fallopian tubes.,
Be aware of the potential risks associated with endometriosis.,
Recognize the role of uterine infections.,
Factor in past ectopic pregnancies.,
Consider past surgeries.",How to Treat Blocked Fallopian Tubes3," Knowing the cause of your blocked fallopian tubes may help your doctor formulate an effective treatment plan. Sexually transmitted infections are some of the most common causes of blockages. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other STIs can lead to the development of scar tissue that blocks the fallopian tubes and prevents pregnancy. This can be a problem even if your STIs were treated and resolved., Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can result from sexually transmitted infections and lead to blockages. If you have PID (or a history of PID), you have an increased risk of developing blocked fallopian tubes and infertility., In women with endometriosis, uterine tissue grows outside its normal location, implanting on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or other organs. If you have endometriosis, know that it can lead to blocked fallopian tubes., If you ever had a uterine infection, perhaps in connection with a miscarriage or abortion, it’s possible that scar tissue formed and blocked one or both fallopian tubes.


Although uncommon in the United States, pelvic tuberculosis may also cause blocked fallopian tubes., Ectopic pregnancies are those in which the fertilized egg implants in the wrong place, usually in the fallopian tube. These pregnancies cannot grow to term, and when they burst or are removed, they can cause scarring and blockages., If you have ever had abdominal surgery, your risk of developing blocked fallopian tubes is higher. Surgeries on the fallopian tubes themselves are especially risky.

"
Schedule a pre-conception doctor appointment.,
Start building healthy habits.,
Start taking folic acid supplements.,
Avoid planning too far ahead.",How to Stop Birth Control when Wanting to Conceive1," Before you stop birth control, schedule a pre-conception visit with your doctor. If you are up to date on your annual exams (e.g. Pap smear, breast exam), this visit generally won't involve a physical or gynecological exam. Your doctor will inquire about your lifestyle habits, medical history, and gynecological history, and may provide advice on how to conceive., Once you decide to conceive, start adjusting your lifestyle habits to prepare for pregnancy. If you're a smoker, work on quitting the habit before trying to conceive. Start getting regular, low impact exercise (e.g. jogging) and move away from fitness activities that pose a high risk of falling or injury (e.g. mountain biking).Cut caffeine down to two servings a day, and begin eating a more well-balanced diet.

, As soon as you decide to conceive, start taking folic acid supplements. Folic acid decreases the risk of miscarriage and birth defects, but you must start taking it one to two months prior to conception for it to be successful. Buy either 400mg or 600mg tablets at your local pharmacy, to be taken once a day.For best results, start taking folic acid a month before you stop using birth control.

, Plan for pregnancy as an imminent possibility before stopping your birth control, whether it be discontinuing your contraceptive pills or having an IUD removed. While it could take months to conceive after halting contraceptive measures, it is also possible that you will get pregnant right away. If you want more of an adjustment period before conception (e.g. to plan for things financially), wait to stop birth control until you are absolutely ready."
"
Look for references.,
Avoid products that guarantee pregnancy.,
Research all endorsements.,
Understand that there is no cheap fix.",How to Spot a Fertility Scam1," Many fertility scams will advertise that “research” has proven that a certain treatment will help you get pregnant with no side effects. Whenever you see statements about proven research, you should always look into the actual studies behind the research to make sure that the claims are not false. For instance, check websites for direct references to medical studies. If the claims are true then the site will likely provide adequate referencing.Look to see if the study was published in a peer reviewed medical journal.
If there is no reference to a study, it is probably false.
Determine who published the study. For example, if the study was published by the company selling the product, it is likely a scam.;
, If you see a product that advertises a 100% guaranteed pregnancy, it is most likely a fertility scam. Even the best fertility physicians and clinics in the world cannot provide a guarantee that their patients will become pregnant. There are so many factors that can lead to infertility, and in some instances it is just not possible for a woman to get pregnant. As a result, you should never trust a product that comes with a money back guarantee on fertility treatments.Typically, these scams work because people will purchase the products and then forget or not bother to claim the refund.

, Some fertility treatments will claim to be endorsed by a physician. In order to ensure that this endorsement is meaningful, you can conduct your own research. For instance, find out who the doctor is that has endorsed the product and see if they are a legitimate physician. You can also call the doctor listed and verify that they have actually endorsed this product. If the endorsements are fake then it is likely a fertility scam.


Another way to avoid a scam is to seek out previous patients and ask them about their experiences using this treatment or clinic. Getting a first hand account can also help you avoid scams.

, Fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and surrogacy, are not cheap. As a result, many people will look to find cheaper alternatives. These alternatives can often be fertility scams. For instance, a book or supplement that is sold to help cure infertility is likely just a scam to make money off of individuals who are looking for a cheap fix. Be wary of all cost-saving alternatives."

Consider the timing.,
Examine the color and quantity of the bleeding.,
See if you're having cramps.",How to Recognize Implantation Bleeding1," This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex. If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding.Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
Once the pregnancy is confirmed at a doctor's office, the physician can use other testing to determine the correct gestational age of the fetus, particularly if implantation bleeding has left some question about when the last real menstrual cycle occurred.;
, This will help to distinguish between pregnancy implantation and the start of a regular menstrual cycle. Implantation bleeding does not usually resemble bleeding during a normal period. It will be lighter, and of lower quantity. Sometimes, implantation bleeding can just be spotting for a few hours, or even a single spot.Implantation bleeding typically consists of a discharge with a pink or brownish tint. It is often darker than period blood because it takes time for the blood to travel from the uterine wall through the vagina.
The amount of bleeding is relatively light, and will only last a couple of days. For some women, the flow will resemble a very light period, which is why confusion between the 2 occasionally occurs. The majority of women find that menstrual blood is more of a red color and will become heavier within a day or two.

, Pregnancy bleeding from implantation may include some mild cramping as the egg implants and the uterus is changing to accommodate the embryo. However, cramping with implantation bleeding is usually much lighter than what women might experience with a regular period. The tricky thing is that the symptoms of early pregnancy are similar to the symptoms you may feel right before your period.If the abdominal cramping continues to increase, it could indicate a regular period or problem with the pregnancy, such as an ectopic pregnancy. In some cases, the pain might be associated with a completely different medical condition, such as appendicitis or a bladder infection.
Any pain that does not appear to be from your normal period and does not subside on its own within a couple days should be checked by a doctor. Patients that have pain that continues to intensify, or patients that develop other symptoms like fever, chills or heavy bleeding, should see their doctor as soon as possible.

Understand that male infertility often has no obvious signs.,
Feel for a lump or swelling in your testicles.,
Inspect your breasts to see if they have grown excessively.,
Look at your body and facial hair.,
Consider whether you have difficulty maintaining an erection.,
See whether you have respiratory problems or infections.",How to Recognize Male Infertility1," Many infertile men experience a regular sex life and have sperm that looks fine to the naked eye.In this sense, it is difficult to recognize the physical symptoms of male infertility. Warning signs are rare, but some infertile men have lumps or swelling near the testicles, breast growth, erectile dysfunction, and respiratory problems., A lump, swelling or pain and discomfort in your testicles can be a symptom of male infertility.


Examine your testicles while standing in front of a mirror. Hold your right testicle with your hand and your thumb on top. Roll it gently and feel for any pain or discomfort. Next, hold your left testicle and roll it gently to feel for any pain or discomfort. Do not worry if one testicle feels slightly larger than the other one, since this is perfectly normal.If you feel any pain or a heaviness in your groin, you should see a doctor., If you have grown very large breasts (known as gynecomastia), you may be experiencing a symptom of male infertility.


Talk to your doctor if you have large breasts. Gynecomastia is often confused with just having fatty breast tissue, so you should ask your doctor to look at your breasts. Your doctor may check for breast cancer or an infection of the breast tissue called mastitis., One symptom of male infertility is a decrease in body hair, which can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance. If you have significantly less hair growth than normal, you may be experiencing a symptom of male infertility.

, Erectile dysfunction can also be a cause of male infertility.In this case, you should ask your doctor about treatments for erectile dysfunction.


Common treatments for erectile dysfunction include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), avanafil (Stendra), and vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). These types of medications help your body increase blood flow to the penis. However, you should see your doctor for full treatment options and approval of any medication. In particular, the above treatments are dangerous for people with low blood pressure, liver or kidney disease., Another symptom associated with male infertility is respiratory problems. If you have trouble breathing or have had a lot of respiratory infections, you may have a condition associated with male infertility."

Determine the mother's ovulation date.,
Have the father maximize his sperm count.,
Have sex as close to ovulation as possible.,
Have sex in a rear-entry position.,
Attempt to give the woman an orgasm during sex.,
Avoid attempts to conceive before or after ovulation.,
Understand the controversy surrounding the Shettles Method.",How to Raise the Chances of Having a Boy1," The Shettles Method is a collection of techniques purported to be useful for increasing the chance of conceiving babies of the desired sex. According to the Shettles Method, having sex as close to ovulation as possible increases the odds of having a boy. If you don't already know when the mother is likely to ovulate, follow the instructions below to determine your ovulation date:


Observe the cervical mucus each day. Right before ovulation, the mucus should be elastic and watery, similar in consistency to a raw egg white. Shettles recommends charting the cervical mucus for at least a month prior to conception.
Take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed. Just after ovulation, your temperature will spike.Because you will want to have sex as close to ovulation as possible, it is advised to chart your BBT at least 2 months prior to conception to get a sense for when your ovulation is likely to occur in the following month.
Use an ovulation predictor kit. These kits, which are available at most pharmacies or through online suppliers, detect when your body releases luteinizing hormone (LH) prior to ovulation. To catch the LH surge as soon as possible, Shettles recommends testing twice a day, preferably between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. for the first test and between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. for the second test.;
, The Shettles Method recommends that the father should takes steps to ensure that his sperm count is as high as possible to raise the chance of a successful pregnancy from a single session of sex. Most importantly, this means that the father should abstain from orgasm for about 2-5 days before ovulation. However, a variety of other factors can also affect sperm count. The tips below can help you get a high sperm count and ensure the sperm are as healthy as possible:


Keep the testes cool. Sperm production is at its highest when the testes are slightly cooler than body temperature. Avoid tight-fitting underwear, hot tubs, and warm laptops.
Don't smoke or drink. Men who smoke and drink heavily are more likely to have low sperm count. If you're having a hard time quitting, talk to your doctor.
Don't take illegal drugs. Marijuana has been shown to have a similar effect as cigarettes when it comes to sperm count. Cocaine and other types of hard drugs are also known to hamper sperm production.
Avoid certain medications. A variety of medications can affect a man's fertility — some, like chemotherapy medications, can even make a man permanently infertile.If you are currently taking serious medications, talk to your doctor about your fertility goals. You may be encouraged to make and store a sperm sample to ensure that you'll be able to conceive in the future.

, When the woman is sure that she is ovulating, the couple should have sex. In general, aim to have sex in the narrow window starting 24 hours before ovulation and ending 12 hours after ovulation. During this time, according to the Shettles Method, conceiving a boy is more likely.


The Shettles Method operates under the assumption that, under perfect conditions, male sperm, which are small and fast, but fragile, can reach the egg faster than female sperm which are large and slow, but strong. According to the Shettles Method, the reason that additional children are conceived in a 50:50 ratio normally is that some fragile male sperm die in the birth canal. By having sex as close to ovulation as possible, you ensure that sperm can reach the egg basically immediately, rather than having to wait, which (allegedly) ensures as many male sperm remain alive as possible.

, The Shettles Method advises using sexual positions that encourage deep penetration, such as a rear-entry position, when trying to conceive a boy. The logic behind this is that ejaculating during deep-penetration sex places the sperm as close as possible to the cervix, giving the fast-moving male sperm an advantage. On the other hand, with shallow penetration, sperm may be deposited farther from the cervix, which means that the more durable female sperm (which can survive longer in the vagina) may have the advantage.

, According to the Shettles method, male sperm, which are more fragile than female sperm, tend to die faster in the acidic environment inside the vagina. With this logic, giving the woman an orgasm can improve the chances of the male sperm. During female orgasm, extra cervical fluid is released, decreasing the acidity inside the vagina. This makes the environment more hospitable to male sperm, increasing the chances that they make it to the egg alive. Preferably, the woman's orgasm is achieved immediately before the father ejaculates.


The Shettles Method also claims that the orgasmic contractions can help push the sperm into the cervix faster.
If the woman can't achieve orgasm, don't be discouraged — it's not essential.

, The Shettles Method only claims to work for the single session of sex that you use it during. Any other sex can interfere with the method by causing a child to be conceived outside of ideal Shettles Method conditions during which the chance for conceiving a boy is 50/50. Because of this, it's very important to ensure that the man does not have unprotected sex with the woman in the days before and after ovulation. You don't want the carefully-controlled sperm from your Shettles Method sex session competing with ordinary sperm.


By most measures, sperm can remain alive in the vagina for 3-5 days.This means that the father and mother should stop having unprotected sex about 5 days before ovulation is expected. It's also wise to refrain for several days after ovulation as well for the same reason.
If sex is unavoidable, use a condom to avoid accidentally conceiving a child outside of the predetermined window.

, Though some advocates swear by the Shettles method and some research has shown that it is moderately effective, it's very important to understand that the Shettles Method is the subject of controversy in the medical community. Multiple studies have suggested that scientific data partially or totally disproves the Shettles Method.Other studies have shown that attempting sex selection through intercourse timing can reduce your chances of having any child, let alone a boy.In short, it is safe to say that if you attempt to have a boy with the Shettles Method, your results are far from guaranteed.


Note that even research that does suggest that the Shettles method can affect the rate of male/female conception pins the effectiveness of the method significantly below the level claimed — on the order of 60%, rather than 80%.

Be patient.",How to Stop Birth Control when Wanting to Conceive2," Depending on your type of contraceptive pill, stopping mid-month may result in bleeding. Opt to finish off your pack and go through your regular monthly bleeding, which will also make it easier to track your ovulation. It will also help in estimating your due date down the line., Anticipate ""withdrawal bleeding"" when you stop the pill, similar to the light bleeding or spotting you might experience when you miss taking pills during the month. If you have been taking birth control consistently to skip periods, expect to experience full, period-like bleeding after you stop. During the time after stopping birth control and before getting pregnant, irregular bleeding is normal and not a cause for concern., Everyone's body responds differently to stopping birth control, so it's normal that conception time after stopping ranges widely amongst women. As a general rule, it usually takes several months to conceive, though it can sometimes happen right away. If you still have not gotten pregnant after 6 months free of oral contraceptives, contact your doctor."
"
Have your IUD removed.,
Stop the contraceptive shot.,
Remove the patch or ring.,
Have your implant taken out.,
Skip barrier methods.",How to Stop Birth Control when Wanting to Conceive3," Once you are certain that you are ready to get pregnant, make an appointment with you ob-gyn to have your IUD removed. You will be able to conceive within the same month that the IUD is removed. The removal procedure will only take a few minutes, but you can prepare for pain or cramping by taking an ibuprofen beforehand., If you want to stop your Depo Provera injections to get pregnant, plan ahead as much as possible. Injections last between eight to thirteen weeks, but it can take up to a year for fertility to return to normal after the shot wears off.Typically, it can take between nine to ten months to get pregnant after your last Depo Provera shot., Contraceptive patches or rings releasing both estrogen and progestin are similar to the Pill as combination hormonal methods of birth control. Be prepared for pregnancy before ceasing to use either of these, as immediate pregnancy is a possibility. There is no definitive evidence on how long it takes to conceive after you stop using these methods of contraception, but experts believe the wait time might be similar or shorter than what you would experience with the Pill., Contraceptive implants are progestin-only hormonal methods of birth control. When you are ready to conceive, contact your doctor to have the tiny, plastic rod removed from under your skin. Once it is removed, it will be possible to get pregnant right away., If barrier methods of contraception are your choice of birth control, trying to get pregnant should be fairly straight forward. Once you stop any type of barrier method, you can feasibly conceive the next time you have sex. These methods include:Condoms
Diaphragm
Cervical cap
Spermicidal foam, sponge, cream, jelly, suppository, or film

Check the success rate of the fertility clinic.,
Look into their treatment options.,
Make sure that the clinic is certified.",How to Spot a Fertility Scam2," One way to determine if a fertility clinic is reputable is to look into their success rates. Most legitimate fertility clinics will post their success rates on their website. The success rates should be clearly broken down by age and number of embryos transferred. If you cannot easily find the success rates, or they are not provided upon request, then you should look for another fertility clinic.The success rates themselves can, at times, be misleading. For instance, some clinics will not take on “hard” patients while others will. This means that success rates can be deceiving.
As a general rule, if the success rates are not provided the clinic should be avoided.

, If IVF is the only type of treatment offered at the clinic, this is a red flag. IVF is the most expensive form of fertility treatment and is not always necessary. For instance, some people may just need advice on properly timed intercourse. If a clinic focuses solely on IVF treatment than they are likely more interested in making money than helping couples with fertility issues., Depending on where you live there will be different requirements and certifications necessary to operate a fertility clinic. Make sure that the clinic you use is properly certified. For instance, to obtain certification in the United States a physician must complete four years of training and two years of clinical practice. Additional training is required to gain special certification in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility."

Ask your doctor to refer you to a reputable fertility clinic.,
Arrange for an egg donor or surrogacy through a fertility clinic.,
Hire your own lawyer.",How to Spot a Fertility Scam3," When looking to find a reputable fertility clinic in your area, you should start by talking with your family doctor. Ask your doctor to refer you to a clinic with a known success rate. For instance, you could say “do you know of any other patients who have had successful results at this clinic?” By receiving a referral from your doctor, you are likely avoiding non-reputable clinics or scams.Even after receiving a recommendation, you should still do some research into the clinic before visiting.

, Do not purchase an egg or sperm donation or surrogate on a personal ad website. Many personal ad websites, such as Craigslist or Kijiji, will include people selling eggs or sperm to couples looking to get pregnant. In some instances people will even advertise surrogacy on these sites. If you are not using someone you know as a donor or surrogate then you should always use people vetted by a fertility clinic.

, Donors and surrogacies are not only expensive, but they can also be legally challenging to set up. Surrogacy laws often differ between states and countries. As a result, it is important to hire your own lawyer in order to establish a legal contract. Some fertility clinics may offer to share their lawyer for cheaper rates. Although this may save you a few dollars, you should always have independent legal counsel."

Be on the lookout for mood swings.,
See if you're feeling dizzy.,
Go see a doctor.",How to Recognize Implantation Bleeding2," Morning sickness is a very real thing. Many expectant mothers feel morning sickness during the early part of the day; it's a feeling of nausea and an aversion to smells that previously had no effect on you, such as the smell of strong coffee. You may even be vomiting in the morning, which will be a sign that something is up.

, Sore and tender breasts are a common symptom of pregnancy. Throughout your pregnancy, your breasts will get larger and your nipples may darken and grow. However, sore breasts are also a sign that you're about to get your period., Many women are also fatigued during the first trimester of their pregnancy. If you're feeling unusually tired while getting plenty of rest and not feeling overly burdened for any reason, then your pregnancy may be the cause., If you're urinating a lot more frequently without any reason you can think of, or if you're suddenly constipated while previously not having any trouble with your bowels, then you may be pregnant.

, Pregnancy comes with some serious hormonal changes that can have a major impact on your mood. You could be crying one minute and then feeling ridiculously happy the next minute for next to no reason. See if you're suddenly sobbing while watching a corny movie or seeing a sad story on the news. Of course, again, mood swings are also a pre-menstrual symptom.

, If you're suddenly getting dizzy when you stand up quickly, walk up stairs, or just for no reason at all, then you may be pregnant.

, You may experience a number of these symptoms and can still not be pregnant. The best way to know if you're pregnant and if what you see on your underwear is really implantation bleeding is to leave it to the health care professional. Make an appointment with your doctor, at your local hospital or clinic.


You can also start by taking a home pregnancy test, but you have a better chance of getting accurate results if you go to a doctor or a clinic.

Difficulties with sperm production include not only how many sperm are produced but also the quality of the sperm.In terms of quantity, ejaculating less than 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen is considered a low sperm count. If you suspect you may have a low sperm count, you should ask your doctor about getting your sperm count tested.You could also do a home sperm test.


Do a sperm test at home. You can purchase a home sperm test online or at major drug and department stores. Typically, these home sperm tests are reasonably accurate in measuring sperm count. You will have to ejaculate into a cup, wait ten minutes, and then look for your results.Remember that home sperm tests are limited in their ability to test for male infertility. They only measure sperm count and do not check for things like motility, shape, and other aspects of sperm quality., Although many plans cover the diagnostic tests needed to determine infertility, there can be complications. You should check with your insurance plan to see if they cover the infertility tests you want to take.Some plans cover the diagnosis of infertility but not the treatment. You should also see whether or not your plan covers infertility treatment.
Check to see if there are age and gender related restrictions in your plan.

, Your doctor will likely conduct a physical examination and look at your medical and sexual history. The next step will likely involve an analysis of your semen. You will have to masturbate into a cup and they will send the sample to the laboratory for sperm count testing.If the sperm analysis is not sufficient to determine infertility, your doctor may do a scrotal ultrasound test. This test is used to look for problems such as varicocele (varicose veins in the scrotum).Get hormone testing to see if there is a problem with testosterone.Get a post-ejaculation urinalysis. This test is used to determine if your sperm are travelling in the wrong direction and ending up in your bladder.Look into genetic tests. If the sperm analysis finds a very low count, you can get genetic testing done to see if your condition is inherited.A testicular biopsy may be conducted in unusual circumstances. This test can determine whether the problem lies with sperm production or transport., If you have been trying to conceive for over a year and have not been able to determine the problem with your regular doctor, you may want to see a specialist. An infertility specialist can explore your infertility problem in detail and order targeted testing as needed."

Look over your medical history.,
Figure out whether you have been around toxins at work.,
Scrutinize your history of alcohol and drug use.,
Note if you have an undescended testicle.,
Look at your medical history of chemotherapy and radiation.,
Evaluate whether you have experienced overheated testicles.",How to Recognize Male Infertility3," In particular, check to see if you have a history of medical problems with your reproductive organs. If you have had surgery in the scrotum area, you should mention this to your doctor as you discuss fertility., Consider whether you have been exposed to a lot of environmental toxins. Lead, pesticides and other environmental toxins may increase your risk of infertility., If you have used an excessive amount of drugs and alcohol, you may be at a higher risk for male infertility.Sperm production can be impacted by steroid abuse, cocaine abuse, and smoking either cigarettes or marijuana., This is a testicle that is not suspended below your body.If you have this condition, you will have only one testicle. Your doctor can examine you and find out more.

, If you have had cancer and were treated with chemotherapy or radiation, you may be at an increased risk for infertility., If you regularly use a sauna, soak in a hot bath or wear very tight clothing, you may be overheating your testicles. This can lead to an increased risk of male infertility.The production of DNA in the testicles is very sensitive to temperature fluctuations.Jacuzzis, saunas, and other hot rooms tend to excessively raise the temperature of the testicles and may cause infertility."

Find a licensed clinic near you.,
Schedule an appointment on the day the mother ovulates.,
Provide a sperm sample.,
Allow the sperm to be processed in albumin.,
Artificially inseminate the mother with the processed sperm.,
Repeat the process, if needed.,
Keep your expectations realistic.",How to Raise the Chances of Having a Boy2," The Ericsson Albumin method is a technique used to separate male sperm from female sperm. The method's defenders claim that it has a roughly 75% success rate, though many doctors and researchers question its effectiveness.Nevertheless, the method remains attractive to some expectant parents because of its relative cheapness (at $600-$1200 per attempt) compared to other techniques. If you wish to use this method, your first step is to find and contact a clinic licensed to perform the Ericsson method.


A list of Ericsson-licensed clinics can be found on the website of Gametrics Ltd., a company founded by the method's developer and lead proponent, Dr. Ronald Ericsson. Six clinics in the U.S. are licensed to perform the procedure, as well as five clinics outside the U.S. These five are in Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Colombia, and Egypt.

, The Ericsson method involves the father giving a sperm sample, that sample being processed, and the mother being artificially inseminated in a single appointment. To ensure the best possible chance of pregnancy, the appointment must be made on the day that the mother is scheduled to be ovulating. You will be asked to provide this information when scheduling an appointment.


The Ericsson method takes about four hours to complete, so ensure that both the mother and the father have reserved plenty of free time on the day of ovulation and can attend the appointment together.

, Upon arriving at the clinic on the day of the woman's ovulation, the man gives a sperm sample. This sperm is used to inseminate the mother. Generally, a man's sperm count is highest after 2-5 days without ejaculation,so you may be asked by the clinic to abstain from any sexual activity for about 48 hours before your appointment.

, Once the father provides his sperm sample, the sperm is placed in a vial of a type of protein called albumin. Sperm can swim through albumin, but the Ericsson method assumes that male sperm, which are smaller, weaker, and faster than female sperm, can pass through the albumin quicker. This means that, after waiting for the sperm to swim from the top of the vial to the bottom of the vial, the sperm near the bottom will (supposedly) be mostly male, while the sperm near the top will be mostly female.


However, the effectiveness of this process has been called into question many times.Some studies have found that albumin produces no noticeable separation of male and female sperm. Other studies (whose results have sometimes been called into question) purport about a 75% success rate., To try for a male child, staff at the clinic will take a sample of sperm from the bottom of the vial of albumin and artificially inseminate the mother with this sperm. At this, point, hopefully, the woman conceives. As with normal sexual intercourse, however, pregnancy is not guaranteed from a single exposure to sperm.


There are several different methods of artificial insemination in use, but the most common is Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI). In this method, sperm are injected via a catheter directly into the uterus.

, Just like it can be difficult for a woman to achieve pregnancy through ordinary sex, it can also be difficult for a woman to become pregnant from artificial insemination. Though the chances of pregnancy naturally vary with a woman's age and health, in general, most sources rate the success rate of Intra Uterine Insemination at about 5-20% per cycle.Because of this, it is a very real possibility that multiple attempts may be needed to achieve pregnancy.


Note that the use of fertility medications can increase the chance of pregnancy.
Though the Ericsson method is generally cheaper than many other fertility-related procedures at $600-$1200 per attempt,the fact that success is not guaranteed from a few attempts means that the total cost may be significantly higher. Be aware of this before scheduling this treatment.

, Before pursing the Ericsson method as a way to improve your chances of conceiving a boy, it's important to make sure that you have reasonable expectations to avoid serious disappointment. As discussed above, the process can take multiple attempts to produce a pregnancy. In addition, the actual effectiveness of this method is a subject of debate — many researchers question its ability to reliably produce children of the desired sex. Finally, even when taking the most charitable attitude towards the Ericsson method possible, it's worth noting that even the method's supporters acknowledge that it won't work all of the time. Generally, proponents of the method suggest about a 75% success rate.


It's also important to know that some clinics offering the Ericsson method have been found to have made deceptive claims regarding the method's effectiveness, although this is not necessarily true at all locations."

Find a hospital or clinic that performs PGD and IVF.,
Undergo fertility treatments.,
Receive hormone injections.,

Allow the eggs to be fertilized.,
Allow the embryo to undergo biopsy.,
Make a decision based on the testing results.,
Undergo In-Vitro Fertilization.,
Understand the costs of PGD and IVF.",How to Raise the Chances of Having a Boy3," Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is a medical process by which an embryo's genetic information is analyzed before implantation in the uterus. This often used to screen for genetic diseases to avoid pregnancy termination later in the embryo's development. However, it can also be used to determine the sex of the baby. If you're interested in pursuing this process, you'll want to begin by contacting a clinic near you that performs this type of procedure.


The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) publishes yearly data ranking fertility clinics in the U.S. on their success rates. This information is downloadable for free from the CDC website.PGD coupled with In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is one of the only ways to choose a baby's sex with absolute certainty. However, it's also one of the most expensive, resource-intensive methods available. Mothers undergoing PGD and IVF should expect to undergo numerous screening tests, take fertility drugs, receive hormone injections, and donate eggs in a minor surgical procedure. From start to finish, the entire process can take months and cost thousands of dollars.

, If the clinic agrees to perform this procedure, the mother will probably need to begin preparing to donate eggs several weeks to a month in advance. Generally, women undergoing PGD and IVF are given fertility drugs to stimulate the ovaries to release more mature eggs. The more eggs available, the better the chances of a successful pregnancy.


Usually, fertility drugs are taken for about two weeks via pill or injection.However, if the mother does not react well to the most common drugs, other alternatives can be taken for shorter periods of time.
Side effects for common fertility drugs are usually mild and can include include hot flushes, nausea, bloating, headache, and blurred vision., In addition to taking fertility drugs, women who intend to donate eggs usually also receive a series of daily hormone injections. These injections further stimulate the ovaries to release more mature eggs. These hormones include gonadotrophins follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone (LH).Some women have strong side effects to these hormones, so first-timers are generally monitored carefully to ensure that the process is proceeding smoothly.


You may also be required to take progesterone, a hormone that thickens the uterine lining in preparation for IVF.

, As the mother's body is stimulated to release more eggs, regular ultrasound tests are used to determine when the eggs are ready to be donated. When the eggs are fully mature, the mother undergoes a simple, minimally-invasive surgical procedure to remove the eggs. A doctor uses a very fine, thin needle attached to an electronic probe to collect eggs from the ovaries. Most women are able to resume normal activities within a day or so of this procedure.


Though the mother is put under sedation for this procedure, it can be somewhat uncomfortable. Painkillers are usually prescribed to aid with post-surgery pain.

, If the father does not already have a stored sperm sample ready to use, he must now provide it. The father's sperm is processed to isolate the healthiest, highest-quality sperm, and combined with the eggs. Within about a day, the eggs are checked to see whether or not they have been fertilized. Any eggs that are fertilized are allowed to mature for several days.


As with all sperm donations, in this case, the father will want to abstain from ejaculating for about 48 hours before giving his sperm donation.

, After the embryos have grown for several days, a doctor removes several cells from each for testing and analysis. At this point in the embryo's life, this does not harm the eventual development of the child. DNA is removed from each cell sample and copied via a process called the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This DNA is then analyzed to determine the embryo's genetic profile, including the sex of the child that would potentially grow from the embryo.

, After the cells from each embryo have been analyzed, the parents are notified which embryos are male and which are female, in addition to any other pressing information (such as the presence of genetic diseases). At this point, it's up to the parents to decide which embryos to attempt to achieve pregnancy with. For parents hoping to have a boy, male embryos would obviously be used, while female embryos may be stored so that children can be conceived later or discarded.


PGD is extremely accurate — by conservative estimates, to a degree of about 95-99%.Later testing can be used to confirm the results of PGD, bringing the method's accuracy to nearly 100%.

, When you've chosen which embryo(s) you'd like to attempt pregnancy with, the embryos are transferred into the mother's uterus via a thin tube passing through the cervix. Usually, only one or two embryos are transferred at a time. During a successful attempt, one or more embryos attach to the uterine wall and pregnancy continues as normal. Generally, the mother won't need to stay in the hospital after embryo transfer, as more than 20 minutes of rest after the procedure provides no positive benefit.In two weeks, the mother may take a pregnancy test to see whether or not the procedure was a success.


Don't be deterred by one unsuccessful IVF attempt. Generally, most women have a per-cycle success rate of about 20-25%. Success rates of 40% or higher are considered quite rare.It's often necessary for perfectly healthy couples to have to undergo multiple rounds of PGD and IVF to achieve their desired pregnancy.

, Together, PGD and IVF offer an actual scientifically-verified path to conceiving a child of the sex you desire. However, it's important to weigh your desire to have a boy against the expenses of undergoing multiple rounds of PGD and IVF. These procedures can be time-consuming and costly, potentially lasting months and costing thousands of dollars per cycle. In addition, the side effects of the drugs involved can cause stress and discomfort for the mother. It's important to consider all of these hurdles when making a decision about whether or not to pursue PGD and IVF. Only pursue this option if you are absolutely heart-set on the idea of having a boy and have the means to responsibly pay for these procedures.

IVF involves five main steps: ovulation induction, egg retrieval, sperm retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer. One cycle of IVF will take about two weeks and you may require more than one cycle to conceive. The process of receiving IVF involves three phases:Phase 1: You will be given fertility shots to increase follicle production and stop your ovulation. You will have multiple visits to your doctor for blood tests and vaginal ultrasounds.
Phase 2: Once the eggs mature, there is minor surgery to retrieve them. An embryologist will prepare the eggs and place them in a petri dish. The sperm is then introduced by injecting a single sperm into each egg.
Phase 3: After the eggs are fertilized, the eggs’ cells continue to divide until Day 3 or Day 5, when the embryos are transferred. The embryos are screened for disabilities such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and Down syndrome, if desired. You will then need to decide how many embryos you would like to transfer to your uterus, and if you would like the remaining embryos to be frozen.
Keep in mind the possibility of conceiving via IVF cannot be predicted, as each couple has possible factors, such as age and reproductive health, that can affect the success of the treatment. Your doctor should be able to give you a sense of the likelihood of pregnancy for you, based on your background and medical history. However, IVF is the most viable fertility treatment currently available and has been known to have a high rate of positive results.;
, IVF is a costly procedure and can take up a lot of your personal time. It can also be stressful and mentally draining, especially if you and your partner are struggling to conceive and have to go through several cycles of IVF before getting pregnant. Stress and anxiety can become big risks during the IVF process. There are several medical risks when you use IVF, including:Multiple births: IVF increases your risk of multiple births if more than one embryo is implanted in your uterus. If you become pregnant with multiple babies, you may have a higher risk of early labor.
A premature delivery and a low birth weight.
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: This occurs when your ovaries become swollen and painful. This syndrome can occur due to the use of injectable fertility drugs. You may experience symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you become pregnant, you may experience these symptoms for several weeks.
A miscarriage: Though the rate of miscarriage for women who conceive using IVF is similar to that of women who conceive naturally, the rate can increase as the age of the mother increases. Using frozen embryos during IVF has been known to slightly increase the risk of a miscarriage. Complications during the egg-retrieval procedure: The doctor will need to use an aspirating needle to the collect the eggs and this could cause bleeding, infection, or damage to your bowels, bladder, or a blood vessel.
An ectopic pregnancy: This occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. About 2 to 5 percent of women who use IVF will have an ectopic pregnancy.
Birth defects: there is evidence that the rate of birth defects in IVF pregnancies is slightly higher than in spontaneous pregnancies, but the exact mechanism for this is unclear.

, IVF is known to be one of the most expensive fertility treatments available. A basic IVF cycle in the U.S. can range from $18,000-$20,000. Most insurance companies will cover diagnostic testing, such as ultrasounds or a hysterosalpingogram, but many do not cover the IVF treatment itself. Your costs will depend on your individual needs, as well as the standard costs at your fertility clinic. The quote for your IVF treatment may include:Fertility medication
Initial fertility tests
Ultra sounds and monitoring
Blood tests
You may also need additional treatments like ICSI, where a single sperm is injected directly into an egg, which can cost $1,000-$1,500, or PGD, where the embryos are genetically tested, which can be $3,000 or more. If you decide to freeze the embryos, you may need to spend several hundred dollars for the initial freezing and storage.
Your doctor should be able to provide you with a financial overview of your IVF treatment, and offer you any alternate sources of funding for your treatment if you cannot afford it. Some clinics offer IVF refund programs, where you pay a set fee (from $20,000-$30,000) and the clinic will refund part of your money if you do not conceive after three to four cycles. However, you should clarify what your clinic considers a positive result, as leaving the clinic pregnant does not guarantee a child. You may have a miscarriage or a complication, and miss your chance to receive the refund.
Some insurance companies also offer partial coverage of IVF treatment or fertility diagnostic procedures. Speak to your insurance company about covering the cost of IVF. You may need to switch to a clinic that is covered by your insurance company to receive financial support.

, IVF is a process that requires you have eight to ten injections a day, and go through many tests, as well as attend many doctor visits. During your IVF treatment, seek the support of your partner and/or close family members. You will need someone to learn how to inject you with fertility hormones several times a day, and you may need assistance when dealing with the side effects of these injections.


Side effects of the IVF treatment include skin irritation at the injection site, abdominal bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, and nausea. You will also be required to attend regular doctor visits during the IVF cycle to confirm your progress. Don’t be afraid to lean on the support of your partner and/or close family members as you go through the IVF process, especially if you are experiencing side effects from the injections.

, Many couples who are going through the IVF process find it useful to join a support group. Look online for a fertility support group in your area that focuses on IVF. IVF can be a stressful process and it can help to reach out to others who are experiencing a similar stress or anxiety to help you and your partner cope with any issues you may be experiencing., Before you begin IVF, your doctor will do several tests on you and your partner, if he is the sperm donor, to confirm your individual levels of fertility.Your doctor may do an ovarian reserve test, which will determine the quantity and quality of your eggs. This can be done through a blood test conducted during the first few days of your menstrual cycle. The test results, as well as an ultrasound of your ovaries, can help your doctor determine how your ovaries will respond to fertility medication.
Your doctor may also conduct a uterine cavity exam, using a sonohysterography, where fluid is injected through your cervix into your uterus and an ultrasound is done to create images of your uterine cavity. Your doctor may also use a hysteroscopy, a thin flexible lighted telescope, and insert it through your vagina and cervix into your uterus to determine the state of your uterine cavity.
An HSG is another common procedure. Your doctor injects a dye through the cervix and takes x-rays to look at the shape of the cavity and to confirm that the fallopian tubes are open.

, Your partner may need to undergo a semen analysis before the start of any IVF treatment if he is going to be the sperm donor. This will determine any fertility issues in your partner.


You and your partner will need to be screened for infectious disease, including HIV, before IVF treatment can begin.

, About a month prior to your first IVF treatment, your doctor may ask you to participate in a mock cycle. This will show you that you and/or your donor are responding well to the hormone therapies.During the mock cycle, your doctor will do an ultrasound 10-12 days into your estrogen enhanced cycle. This will help your doctor determine the depth of your uterine cavity and the technique that will be the most successful for placing the embryos in your uterus.You may also need to start taking birth control pills to regulate your cycle so you can synchronize with your donor’s cycle, if you are using a donor.
The doctor may also give you a gonadotropin releasing hormone, which will inhibit the surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your body. This will ensure the lining of your uterus is ready for the implanted embryo.

, Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to improve embryo morphology during IVF treatment. As well, folic acid is taken by pregnant women to improve the health of the fetus, and taking this supplement in preparation for the IVF treatment can prepare your body for pregnancy.Supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so also choose supplements that have been third party tested for contaminants and recommended by your doctor. Your doctor can also recommend the proper dosage of each supplement.

, Women who are overweight or in poor physical shape can have a lower risk of conceiving during an IVF cycle.Doing gentle exercise like daily walking or yoga can reduce any stress you may experiencing as you prepare for IVF and regulate your blood circulation. Mild to moderate exercise has been shown to have no negative effects on IVF treatments.


However, you should avoid strenuous activity and intense cardiovascular activities like running, jogging, or aerobics, as this could lead to a decrease in live births and pregnancy loss during IVF treatment., To increase your rate of fertility results, you should implement good nutrition and health practices at least four to six weeks prior to your first IVF cycle. This includes maintaining a healthy sleep cycle, with at least eight to nine hours of sleep a night.Try to sleep in complete darkness, as this improves your body’s melatonin production. Melatonin is a hormone that helps with healthy follicle development. Getting melatonin naturally through a healthy sleep cycle is more beneficial than taking melatonin supplements.

, Treat your body like you are preparing for pregnancy and maintain a healthy, low fat diet, with high quality foods that are good sources of iron, potassium, and magnesium. Establish a diet that is high in leafy greens, fruits, vegetables, calcium, and protein.Avoid starting a restrictive diet, like a low-calorie or a low-carbohydrate diet. Instead, maintain a healthy diet so you can maintain a healthy weight that will not put your IVF treatment at risk.

, Just like if you were pregnant, you should restrict your consumption of caffeine and avoid drinking alcohol or smoking. This will ensure your body is at its healthiest before you start IVF treatment."

Notice your overall energy level.,
Take note of any changes in tastes.,
Think about whether you've been moody.",How to Know the Earliest Pregnancy Signs1," Fatigue is a common early sign of pregnancy. Even when you have not changed your routine or sleep schedule, you may feel tired throughout the day. Unexplained fatigue can be an early sign of pregnancy., You may not experience food cravings right away. However, early on in pregnancy you may suddenly develop an aversion to certain foods. You may dislike the smell of a food or drink you once enjoyed or did not mind.For example, you may wake up one morning and be nauseated by the smell of your morning coffee brewing.

, Pregnancy hormones can cause changes in mood early on. You may notice you get angry or frustrated more easily or are very emotional. You may cry over sad commercials or television shows more easily.These mood swings may be similar to what you experience just before your menstrual cycle.

Decide if children are the right thing for this phase in your life.,
Decide how much you want children.",How to Know if You Are Ready to Start a Family," Are you an adult? Not only in terms of physical maturity, but also of your emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development.


Do you feel you can move beyond those all-night parties?
You must be prepared to put the needs of others before your own, and willing to make sacrifices that can be painful.
You must also be able to take care of yourself, not be dependent on others to care for you. That means that you should not count on grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or anyone else to raise your child. (That doesn't mean that they cannot aid or support you, just that you cannot expect them to always be able to help out.);
, While there are successful single mothers & fathers, your best bet for success, happiness and well-being is love, compassion and support from a spouse who is committed to both you and your baby.

, Bringing a baby into the world, or a child into a family in which both parents aren't both thrilled about the arrangement is not fair to anyone. You both need to be on-board.

, Try to estimate the cost of baby supplies, clothes and furniture as well as other things you may need such as day care.

, You can take parenting courses, babysit nieces and nephews and the babies of friends. Find out what you would be getting into. But don't be too afraid; while parenting is difficult, every parent learns with every child as life moves on.

, Just like other parts of life, there are no guarantees with children. You may find yourself the parent of a handicapped or special-needs child. You may end up a single parent by divorce. You could end up conceiving triplets. While you shouldn't worry endlessly, and even challenging children can bring as much joy as any other, keep in mind that you won't be in control of everything.

, If you are in your 20s, you may time to find the right partner, build a career, and become a biological parent. In your late 30s or 40s you might be bumping up against your child-bearing years, although adoption is of course an option at any age.

, On an emotional level, do you really want to be a parent? Do you feel you would miss out if you don't have a child?

Express your confusion, sadness and worry about how this is affecting your relationship and love for one another.;
, Avoid blame statements even though it is quite possible you feel angry with your partner as much as with yourself. Own your feelings by expressing everything in terms of how you are experiencing the challenge and how this makes you react as one part of the couple. Be very open because it is likely that your partner is feeling very similar emotions. For example, you might say things like:


""I feel that worrying about having a child all the time has removed the spontaneity of our love life. I feel that I can't just enjoy being with you because I am always worrying about whether or not this is the right time of month, the right temperature, or the right position. This hardly makes me feel sexy.""
Or you might like to say, ""These fertility treatments are making me feel really tired. I am worried about how much they are costing us. And I am worried about how much of the financial burden is impacting on you as well as on me.""
Or, ""Although I have always wanted a child, I am feeling really frustrated that we have spent years and thousands and nothing has changed. I want to know if you would be really disappointed if we decided to not do this anymore because I value our marriage more than something that I don't think is ever going to happen.""

, Once you have openly discussed together about how you are both feeling the strain and loss of intimacy as love in your marriage, it is time to face some bigger questions. Consider addressing such issues as:


Is this a path the two of you want to continue at all?
If yes, can you find time for a vacation from the fertility treatments, the constant pressing need for following fertility routines that are weighing both of you down? There are plenty of stories about people falling pregnant when the pressure is removed. That is always a hopeful thought to consider.
What about other alternatives, such as adoption or fostering?
Plan to add the romance back into your lives by going out to a special event, a dinner, or having a romantic rendezvous in the country for a weekend. As part of this, make a conscious decision not to discuss having children and make the focus return to the two of you.

, This is an important part of working together as a team to develop a sense of shared purpose that results in something beneficial. Gardening and growing plants is one great activity that helps achieve this closeness and feeling of producing beneficial outcomes. Plant vegetables, trees, flower gardens together. Create life of a different sort around you. Visit people in need and cook for them, read to them, listen to them as a couple. Giving your time to the needy will help both of you to focus on the greater reality of being a part of a larger human family in which everyone counts. This can give a sense of renewal of purpose and strength to your relationship.

, The two of you came together out of love. Remember this and find ways to keep this spirit of love alive. Above all, do not let infertility and the lack of a child gnaw away at your relationship or your self-esteem. Not everybody is destined to have children; of those who do, not all of them truly engage in the experience and enjoy parenthood. That is the way of the world. It is important to learn to embrace limitations and to be grateful for the wonderful things we do have - each other, good health in general, career, shelter, family and friends, talents and more. While none of these can make up for your sense of loss, ultimately you must make a choice to either move on and accept things as they are, or to let the remainder of your life be embittered and curtailed by a deep sense of loss that mars your future. It is a lot kinder to yourself, your spouse, and others to make the choice to accept the loss and focus on creating a good future together.

Look for changes in urination habits.",How to Know the Earliest Pregnancy Signs2," A missed period is usually the first sign of pregnancy. You should track your menstrual cycle to know roughly when to expect your monthly period. If you do not experience your period within this time frame, this can be an early sign you're pregnant., About a quarter of pregnant women experience nausea as the first sign of pregnancy. You may feel sick to your stomach at certain times of the day. Strange smells may easily trigger feelings of nausea and sickness., Implantation bleeding sometimes occurs just after pregnancy, possibly due to a sperm attaching to an egg. Some women may mistake this for a very light period, but it can be a sign of pregnancy if you are also experiencing other symptoms.Implantation bleeding or spotting is much lighter than your regular period. You may only notice it when you wipe.
The color also may differ from a regular period. It may be more pink or brown-colored than usual.

, Pregnancy can cause unexpected physical discomfort. Usually, this takes the form of mild uterine cramping as well as tender, sore breasts.Like many symptoms of pregnancy, these are often similar to pains you may experience just before your period.

, During pregnancy, your kidneys produce extra fluid due to increased levels of blood in your body. Many women notice increased urination during pregnancy. If you find yourself using the bathroom more often, this could be an early sign that you are pregnant."

Follow the directions on the package and take the test at home. Usually, you pee on the stick or gather your urine in a cup and dip the stick in the test.Most pregnancies tests can be taken a few days after your missed period. However, there are some tests on the market designed for early detection you can try. Refer to the package's instructions for precise directions on when to take the test.Tests are more accurate after your missed period. If you suspect you are pregnant before missing your period, go to the doctor instead of taking an at home test.

, If you suspect you are pregnant, or have a positive pregnancy test, make an appointment with your doctor.During your first visit, your doctor will run tests to confirm your pregnancy. A doctor may perform a urine test in the office or they may order blood work.Your doctor will also ask you about your medical history, past pregnancies, your general lifestyle, and any medications you're currently taking.
Your doctor will perform a basic physical exam to make sure you're in good health.

, If you are pregnant, it can be an emotional experience. If you're waiting on the results of a test can be stressful, so talk to friends, family members, and the other parent about your emotions. You can also talk to a therapist if you have one.

This hormone is produced in a woman’s body shortly after a fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining.You can take a urine test at the doctor’s office or at home using a home pregnancy test.
A home pregnancy test is both convenient and inexpensive.;
, A blood test is designed to detect the specific levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a woman’s blood. This hormone is produced in a woman’s body shortly after a fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining.A blood test can tell you if a woman is pregnant earlier than a home pregnancy test but it is more expensive and takes longer to receive the results.Taking a blood test is a good idea if you want accurate results.
Make an appointment with your doctor to schedule a blood test. You should schedule your test no earlier than six to eight days after ovulation., The qualitative blood test determines whether the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is present in a woman’s body. This hormone is a sign the woman might be pregnant because hCG is produced in a woman’s body shortly after a fertilized egg attaches to the wall of her uterus.A qualitative blood test only checks to see if hCG is present in your body. A qualitative blood test also does not determine the exact levels of hCG in a woman’s body., This test is useful for determining the exact levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a woman’s body. It is a good idea to take this test to monitor any potential problems during a woman’s pregnancy.


The quantitative blood test is a useful test because it can rule out miscarriage. It can also help to determine if an ectopic pregnancy is present, but an ultrasound is still needed to confirm an ectopic pregnancy. A quantitative blood test is also useful for monitoring the levels of hCG after a miscarriage., Many home pregnancy tests claim fast results but it’s better to wait a few days for hCG levels to build up in the woman’s body. Make sure to wait at least one day after the woman misses her period before taking the test. The exact timing of ovulation or when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus is impossible to determine. It is recommended to wait a week for the most accurate results., Determine what level of sensitivity your test should have. Each test has a different sensitivity to the levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is the hormone that indicates whether a woman is pregnant or not. Go to the local pharmacy and buy a home pregnancy test or purchase tests online. These tests can range in price from $8 to $20.It’s possible to buy pregnancy test strips in bulk online if you are trying to conceive and want to save a ton of money. Some of these tests may not have applicator strips, but will work just fine.
Ensure that the test is in a sealed box and shows no sign of damage. Always check the expiration date on tests, too.
Most tests are only accurate about a week after the woman has missed her period. You can get a false positive or false negative result if you use the test too early., Read the instructions included with the home pregnancy test carefully. Different manufacturers have different specifications for their tests. It is important to follow the instructions precisely to avoid inaccurate results.


Make sure you have clean hands and remove the test from its wrapper.
Decide whether a urine sample will be collected or whether you will hold the test in the woman’s urine stream.
Hold the test in the woman’s urine sample for a certain number of seconds.
Wait a certain number of minutes for results.

, Always make sure the pregnancy test is not expired before using it. It is recommended to use a test that is as new as possible to ensure the highest levels of accuracy.


Throw away a home pregnancy test that is expired or that was purchased months before but has not been not used. Don’t take any chances by using an expired test, which will likely give inaccurate results. Using an expired test could result in a false positive or false negative result., Take the home pregnancy test in the morning when hormone levels of hCG are highest. Use one of the following techniques:


Place the test in a woman’s urine while she urinates.
Collect urine in a sterile container and dip the test into it.
Collect urine in a sterile container and use a dropper to drop the woman’s urine onto the test., Consult the instructions of the test if it is not clear how long the test requires before it gives results. Some tests take only one minute while others take upwards of ten minutes.


Place the test on a clean surface.
Wait several minutes for results.
Take some deep breaths if you are anxious while you wait.
A negative result may mean that you took the test too early.
Take another test if the woman doesn’t get her period in a few days.

, Determine which symbol the pregnancy test uses. Familiarize yourself with the way these symbols work.


Many tests use a line or color system that changes depending on your hormone levels.
Some tests will show you a plus sign or a negative sign.
Some tests will display the words “Pregnant” or “Not Pregnant.”, Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you can if you receive a positive result. A positive result means the woman is pregnant, even if the symbol on the test has only changed a little bit. Talk to your doctor about what to do next and discuss how to begin prenatal care., Make an appointment with your doctor to determine whether the woman is actually pregnant or had a false positive result. False positive results are very rare but may be the result of using HCG injections for fertility. There is no pregnancy with a false positive result.


False positives can occur if you take a pregnancy test shortly after taking a fertility drug that contains hCG.
False positives can also occur during menopause or if the woman has problems with her ovaries., A negative result may indicate that the woman is not pregnant, or that she tested too early. Take another test if you are not sure about the results of the test or if any of the following apply:


You took the test too early in the woman’s pregnancy.
You didn’t correctly take the test.
You mistakenly used an expired test.
The woman consumed too much fluid before taking the test.
Certain medications the woman is taking inhibit a positive result."

Consider your age.,
Monitor any menstrual problems.,
Pay attention to weight gain and skin changes that occur at the same time.,
Consider any underlying medical disorders.,
Know that some infections can lead to infertility.,
Understand that there are some habits and lifestyle choices that can affect fertility.,
Consider any anatomical abnormalities you may have.,
Go to a doctor for testing.",How to Know if You Are Infertile1," Your chances of conceiving generally get smaller as you get older. This is because your eggs decrease in number and quality with time. In addition to that, various underlying medical disorders that come with progressing age can further affect your chances of having a baby.Generally, after the age of 30 a woman’s chance of conception reduces by 3-5% every year, with a considerably higher reduction after 40.;
, An abnormal period could potentially be a sign of infertility. Consider the amount of bleeding you experience during every period, the length of the bleeding, the normal cycle you have, and the symptoms that accompany your period. A regular period is something that occurs on the days you expect it to come, and it lasts for only three to seven days. Other signs of an irregular period include menstruating a lot, too little or a bleeding variation during which you bleed sporadically. Experiencing severe menstrual cramps when you don’t normally have very strong cramps should also be considered an abnormality., If you have been experiencing unexplained weight gain, you may have one of several health issues, including polycystic ovarian syndrome, type-2 diabetes mellitus, or hypothyroidism (which is the decreased functioning of the thyroid gland). Women with polycystic ovaries and type-2 diabetes mellitus also have certain skin changes.


Increase in facial hair, acne, oily skin, and skin tags. They might also develop acanthosis nigricans, or dark brown to black raised skin patches on the face, neck, underarms, below the breasts, and back.
Obesity or a BMI above 30 can significantly reduce your chances of getting pregnant.

, Some medical disorders may affect your chances of becoming pregnant. There is also a chance that you body may produce anti-sperm antibodies that can damage sperm and keep you from becoming pregnant. Some of the conditions that have been known to cause infertility include:


Type-2diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, tuberculosis, pituitary tumors, anemia or iron and folic acid deficiencies, cancers, and a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery that may have affected the fallopian tubes, including appendectomy.

, Some infections may cause infertility. These infections may block your fallopian tubes, affect egg production, and cause the sperm to become unable to impregnate your eggs. Recurrent vaginal yeast or bacterial infections may change the cervical mucus consistency, which can also lead to infertility. Other infections that could reduce your chances of becoming pregnant include:


Pelvic inflammatory disease, infections of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus, or mycobacterium tuberculosis.

, Cigarette or tobacco smoking leads to hormonal imbalances in women and can affect fertility. It could also cause miscarriages, fetal birth defects, and premature birth. If you are a smoker, you should consider quitting as smoking could be the cause of your infertility.


Faulty diets low in nutrients and iron can also affect your reproductive capabilities, as well as leading to various underlying diseases such as anemia, type-2 DM, PCOS, and obesity, which may further increase your risk of infertility.
Exposure to excessive stress and unhealthy sleep patterns could also affect your reproductive health.

, Certain anatomical defects of the uterus also result in infertility. Most of these defects are present at birth and are referred to as congenital anomalies; however they are almost always asymptomatic. These abnormalities can include:


A wall dividing the uterus into two chambers, double uterus, adhesions of the uterine wall, adhesions and scarring of the fallopian tubes, twisted fallopian tubes, and an abnormally positioned uterus.

, Your doctor will run several tests to rule out various causes of infertility. These tests could include a thyroid function test, testing postprandial blood sugars, prolactin levels, and checking for anemia. He or she may also do abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds to rule out any anatomical abnormalities.

Understand the function of FSH.,
Familiarize yourself with the conditions that can lower FSH levels.",How to Improve FSH Levels," Essential fatty acids are important in the production of hormones in the body, including FSH. Essential fatty acids include omega-6, omega-9 and omega-3. The foods that provide the body with omega -3 are fish oil and flax oil and oily fish (salmon, trout, mackerel, sardines, herring and anchovies). Women are encouraged to eat at least two servings of oily fish per week to increase the level of omega -3 in the body.
A good source of omega-6 are borage oils (which can be taken in supplement form), while good sources of omega-9 include avocados, sunflower oils, nuts and seeds.;
, Dark green and sea vegetables provide the body with the vitamins and minerals necessary for a healthy endocrine system, which, in turn, is necessary for FSH production.


Dark green vegetables include kale, spinach, broccoli and cabbage, while sea vegetables include things like nori, kelp and wakimi. Spirulina can also be taken as it provides the body with proteins and minerals.
Women who wish to improve their FSH levels are advised to eat at least five portions of these foods per day. This can be done by blending green veg into a morning smoothie, eating a green salad for lunch and including at least two portions of green or sea veg with dinner.

, Ginseng helps to support and nourish the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, both of which are essential in regulating FSH levels. You can take ginseng as a supplement — it is recommended that you take two 500mg capsules twice a day for best results.


Ginseng is also widely used to increase fertility in men and studies have shown that it plays a vital role in the prevention of erectile dysfunction and enhancement of sexual performance. You shouldn't take more than the recommended dosage of ginseng, as it can affect the blood's ability to prevent clotting.

, Maca is a root like vegetable that grows in high altitude areas that have intense sunlight. Maca helps to nourish the endocrine system, which has a positive effect on the release of hormones (including FSH) in the body. Maca can be found in supplement form and the recommended dosage is 2000-3000mg per day.

, Vitex is an herb that regulates the pituitary gland, helping to balance the production of hormones in the body. The pituitary gland works by sending chemical signals to different parts of the body and communicating the amount of hormones that are needed by different organs and tissues.


Vitex can be taken in supplement form and the recommended dosage is 900 to 1000mg daily. Vitex supplements should be taken over the course of a month to boost FSH levels.
Be aware that vitex capsules work best on an empty stomach and therefore should be taken early in the morning before breakfast.

, One easy, low-cost way of boosting FSH levels is to use massage to stimulate the glands that produce FSH and other hormones. Try using gentle circular motions to massage the lower abdomen for 10 to 15 minutes each day, to boost FSH and increase fertility.


You could also try rubbing the ball of your big toe. In reflexology, the big toe is linked to the pituitary gland, which is essential for balancing hormone production in the body.

, Maintaining a healthy weight is essential for the production of FSH. Being underweight will decrease the amount of FSH the body produces, which negatively affects fertility. A healthy weight is defined as having a BMI between 18.5 and 25.


Your BMI (body mass index) is your weight measured relative to your height. To find your BMI, divide your weight (in pounds) by your height (in inches squared), or use an online BMI calculator.
If your BMI is under 18.5, you are underweight and if it is over 25, you are overweight.

, When you are feeling stressed out, your body releases stress hormones (such as cortisol) which negatively affect the amount of FSH your body produces. Therefore, it is important to reduce stress in order to keep boost your FSH levels.


To decrease stress, you can use relaxation methods such as getting some exercise, doing yoga or meditation or taking a long, hot bath. It is also important that your balance your work with rest.
Getting enough sleep is another important factor in reducing stress. Try to get 7 to 8 hours sleep a night and follow a consistent schedule, where you go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.

, Having too much testosterone or estrogen in the body can interfere with FSH production. The liver helps to remove excess hormones from the body, but over time the hormones can build up and the liver becomes overwhelmed. Therefore it is important to perform a cleanse from time to time in order to detox the liver.


You can purchase special liver cleansing kits that are specifically designed to rid the body of excess estrogen and testosterone and boost fertility.
These fertility kits contain cleansing capsules that renew the liver and help it to perform efficiently. They also contain special herbal teas that detoxify the blood and maintain the health of the uterus. , Although the methods described in the sections above can help to improve FSH levels, your body's hormone levels will not return to normal levels if the underlying cause is not addressed. Therefore it is important to see your doctor and undergo rigorous testing so the underlying cause of low FSH levels can be diagnosed and hopefully cured.


The tests used to find the cause of low FSH levels vary hugely. Your doctor may look at hormonal panels that compare the level of certain hormones in the body (such as GnRH and estrogen), or they may do a biochemical analysis, which looks at enzymes and other substances that affect the operation of certain organs and glands.
In certain situations, you doctor may turn to radiographic methods to diagnose the cause of low FSH levels, such as ultrasound, CT scan and MRI.

, In some circumstances, low FSH levels are caused by a tumor or cyst on the ovaries, testes or hypophysis. If this is the case, the tumor or cyst will need to be surgically removed.

, The level of FSH your body produces is directly affected by the levels of other hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone. Hormone replacement therapy involves taking medications that contain synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone. Once these hormonal imbalances are addressed, your FSH levels should return to normal.

, FSH stands for follicle stimulating hormone. Although FSH is an important factor in many bodily processes, its most important function involves the growth and development of the ovarian follicles, which are essential for reproduction.Each month, FSH is secreted at certain points during a woman's menstrual cycle, to keep the follicles growing and enable the ovulation process. Without adequate FSH levels, successful pregnancy isn't possible.
Aside from aiding the reproduction process in women, FSH also helps with bone growth, the development of sex organs, the production of sperm and boosting the metabolism.

, FSH levels are determined by a complex and delicate network of hormones. Therefore, there are a large number of conditions that can affect your body's production of FSH. These underlying conditions must be identified and treated in order for FSH levels to return to normal levels. Some of the most common conditions that can lower FSH include:



Polycystic ovarian syndrome:' With this condition, there are multiple cystic follicles in the ovaries, which leads to the excessive production of estrogens and androgens. High levels of these hormones can significantly lower FSH levels.Hypopituitarism: With this condition, the function of the hypophysis is suppressed, which can greatly affect the levels of FSH, since this is where FSH is produced.

Hypogonadism: As a result of many different syndromes, the diminished functional activity of gonads (testes in males, and ovaries in females) will interfere with FSH levels, since this condition can disrupt both GnRH and estrogen production (hormones necessary for the production of FSH).

Tumors: A tumor in one of several different locations — such as the hypophysis, the ovaries or the testes — can cause abnormal FSH levels.

Stay away from products claiming to boost HCG.",How to Increase HCG Levels1," Low or decreasing levels of HCG may be cause for concern, but not always – only your doctor can tell you for sure.Before you feel stressed or frightened, have a conversation with your OB/GYN. They will ask you if you’re having any symptoms that might suggest your pregnancy is at risk, like vaginal bleeding or abdominal cramps.Most likely, repeat testing will be done.

Ask questions like, “Is it possible I’m not as far along in my pregnancy as we believed?”
If your pregnancy is at risk, your doctor may tell you to rest in bed until things improve. You can also ask if there are any medications safe to take during your pregnancy that might help prevent miscarriage.;
, HCG values are usually just used as guidelines, and a single low reading is nothing to worry about. Ask your doctor to check your HCG level again in a couple of days, so that you can watch for trends., If your HCG is low or decreasing on a urine test, have a blood test done – this reads HCG levels more accurately. Depending on the stage of your pregnancy, you may be able to have an ultrasound done to check on your baby. Even after just 5-6 weeks, an ultrasound is more accurate than HCG levels., HCG is not a hormone that you can increase or decrease safely by yourself, and keeping a healthy pregnancy depends on a delicate balance of hormones that should be supervised by your doctor. Do not use products claiming to increase HCG. These are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and might actually cause harm to your baby."

, The best ways to find out when (and if) you ovulate are basal body temperature charting, using ovulation predictor kits, and observing cervical mucus changes. Using more than one method gives you a more accurate determination of your ovulation date.

, If you find that you're not ovulating regularly (or not at all), then get some lab testing done to see if your hormone levels are normal. Your doctor will be able to determine which tests will be helpful.

, Eat lots of fruits and veggies (5+ servings daily), drink lots of purified water (at least 8 glasses per day), take a multivitamin/mineral supplement with at least 400 mcg of folic acid, and exercise for 15-20 minutes at least three times per week.


Stay away from harmful foods and drinks such as coffee and alcohol. Your doctor should provide you for a list of foods to avoid if you ask.

This is called ovulation and conception occurs in the days leading up to ovulation. The egg is fertilized by sperm and attaches itself to your uterine wall. As ovulation occurs about halfway through your menstrual cycle, tracking the natural flow of your periods can help you get an idea of your fertile window.


Mark when your period begins each month. our menstrual cycle begins on the first day of menstrual bleeding. It ends the day before your next period occurs. Menstrual cycles vary, but on average are between 21 and 35 days.In general, ovulation happens around day 14 of your menstrual cycle. You can try having sex more frequently in the week leading up to the 14th day of your menstrual cycle. It's likely that, during this time, your body is preparing to ovulate. Sexual activity during this time can increase the chance of an egg getting fertilized.You can use an online ovulation calculator through many medical websites that will help you figure out your fertile days. Usually, you'll enter the start dates of your last few periods. The calculator will then give you an estimate of your most fertile cycle days for the coming months.If you notice your periods vary in length greatly, or you skip periods some months, talk to your doctor before attempting to get pregnant. Medical conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOC) can affect the menstrual cycle and you may need medical guidance to conceive.;
, Unfortunately, figuring out when you'll ovulate is an inexact science. While the 14th day is a good guess, many factors can affect your hormone levels and, in turn, ovulation. You should also look for changes in your cervix mucus, which is the fluid naturally discharged from your vagina. Just before ovulation, many women notice a change in this fluid.If you gently wipe around your vagina each time you use the bathroom, you can watch for a change in mucus. The vagina produces a variety of mucus all the time, usually clear or white in nature. In addition to tracking your menstrual cycle, start paying attention to your normal vaginal secretions each day.
When ovulation gets close, secretions will be clear and slippery. You may also notice you're producing more secretions than usual. Many women find these fluids look something like raw egg whites. After ovulation has occurred, making conception that month unlikely, discharge will lessen and become cloudier and thicker., Your basal body temperature is the temperature of your body when it's at rest. It can be measured with a special thermometer you can purchase at most drug stores. During ovulation, basal body temperature rises by about 0.2 to 0.5 degrees.


Take your basal body temperature every morning the moment you wake up — before getting out of bed or moving around. Keep a note on a notepad on your bedside table or on your smartphone. It can be helpful to write your temperature on a graph, as this can allow you to see a pattern each month. The graph may suddenly spike upward for a few days. These are the days you are probably ovulating.You may eventually see a pattern emerging. You may notice, for example, during the 16th and 17th day of your cycle, your basal temperature rises. The best time to conceive would be the days lead up to this temperature spike. You could increase your chance of pregnancy by aiming to have sex on the 14th and 15th day of your cycle., Certain hormones surge when you are ovulating. You can buy an over-the-counter ovulation kit at a local drugstore. These kits detect hormones in your urine, identifying the most likely time you are ovulating. Some tests may also detect a surge in hormones that occurs just before ovulation. You can purchase an ovulation kit to identify at which points in your cycle you will be most likely to conceive.How you use an ovulation kit varies by brand. In some kits, you pee on a stick, as you would with a pregnancy test. In other kits, you can take a small sample of saliva from the inside of your mouth. After a certain amount of time has passed, you should see a reading that indicates whether or not you're ovulating.

, As stated, figuring out ovulation is inexact. Sometimes, just paying attention to your body can help you identify when you're ovulating. In addition to changes in vaginal fluids, you can watch for some of the following signs that may indicate you're ovulating:Light spotting
Slight cramping
Tenderness in the breasts
Bloating of the abdomen
Increased sex drive
A heightening of certain senses, like taste, sight, and smell

, Research does not point to one specific diet that increases fertility; however, getting your body as healthy as possible can up your chances of conceiving and prep for a healthy pregnancy. Go for a diet rich in lean protein, fruit, vegetables, healthy fats, and whole grains.For starters, up your fruit and vegetable intake. Consuming a lot of plants is great for your overall health. Keep baby carrots, berries, and things like apples and oranges on hand for snacks. Try to have a salad before every meal. Go for vegetable-based side dishes, like grilled broccoli or asparagus.Go for non-starchy grains. Opt for whole wheat bread and pasta over white bread and pasta. Choose brown rice instead of white rice. In terms of protein, go for lean options like fish and lean poultry. You can also get some protein from low-fat dairy products, like low-fat cheese and milk.Limit your consumption of sugar. Products with added sugar really do nothing for a balanced diet. It may be a good idea to cut sugar out, for a variety of reasons; however, if you have a sweet tooth, work on indulging it in moderation. Only have dessert a few nights a week. Stick to mini-sized candy bars over the larger variety. Go for diet soda over regular., Women who are overweight or underweight may have increased difficulty conceiving. Getting to a healthy weight can increase your chances of pregnancy.A healthy weight is defined as a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. You can calculate your BMI using a height/weight chart, an online calculator, or having your doctor assess your BMI. If your BMI does not fall within the above range, you may need to gain or lose weight.Overweight and underweight women struggle to conceive and may be prone to further complications during pregnancy. If your BMI is below 18.5, or 25 or above, you should talk to a doctor about how to get on track to a healthier weight. Weight loss or gain should usually be supervised by a physician. If you're planning on getting pregnant, seeing a physician regularly is a good idea anyway.In general, to gain weight you would increase your caloric intake while lowering your rate of exercise. To lose weight, you would decrease your caloric intake while increasing your amount of exercise each day. If you're a woman of childbearing age, you should be eating between 1,800 and 2,400 calories a day. You can count calories by hand, looking up the number of calories in your favorite food online. There are also many smartphone applications that count calories for you when you enter the food you eat each day.Weight loss or gain should be a slow process. For healthy, sustainable weight loss or gain, do not aim to gain or lose more than 1 or 2 pounds each week. While that number sounds small, if you're diligent with your exercise and eating habits, you'll be surprised how quickly your weight loss or gain adds up. This can be achieved by cutting out 500 calories a day.

, In order to conceive, regular sexual activity is important. If you're having sex one to two times a week, you should eventually hit a fertile point in your cycle and conceive. You can greatly increase your chances at conception by having sex once a day in the days leading up to ovulation.If you and your partner have a busy schedule, making time for sex can sometimes be difficult. After a long day, it can be hard to get into the mood. Try to incorporate a pre-sex ritual into your routine. Turn off all electronics, go into the bedroom alone, and try to play some romantic music or light a candle.Make sex a priority. Many couples get caught up in a variety of responsibilities and regular sex falls to the wayside. While it may seem non-romantic to schedule sex, many couples find it helps them maintain regular intimacy. Try to block off an hour or so each day for sex with your partner., The evidence on stress's effect on fertility in and of itself is still inconclusive. Some studies, however, do indicate a lower overall stress level may have a positive impact on fertility.Regardless of the precise effect of stress on pregnancy, it's a good idea to work on lowering your stress when trying to conceive. High stress can affect you ability to eat right and exercise regularly. You may also be more likely to drink alcohol when stressed and may have a lower sex drive. This can all inhibit your ability to live a lifestyle that promotes fertility.


Engage in practices like yoga, deep breathing, mindfulness, and meditation. These activities help you keep your mind in the present moment, preventing anxiety from disrupting your thoughts. You can take meditation or yoga classes at a local community center. You can also find guided routines online.
Practicing basic self care can also help reduce stress. Try to get in at least 20 minutes a day of physical exercise, like a light walk or jog. Eat three well-balanced meals per day and two light snacks to avoid feeling hungry. Get at least eight hours of sleep a night.
If you are having trouble regulating your stress, you may have an underlying anxiety disorder that's preventing you from relaxing. Talking to a therapist may help. You can find a therapist by finding a list of providers through your insurance. You can also ask your regular physician for a referral.

, Making sure you have a stable, healthy sperm count can increase your chances at getting your partner pregnant. Some studies indicate high temperatures around the scrotum can affect sperm production. Take measures to keep your groin cool to increase your chance at pregnancy.Avoid saunas and hot tubs. Try not to use warm electronics, like laptops, on your lap as this can affect sperm count.Try wearing loose-fitting underwear to increase airflow to your groin. You can also minimize the time you spend sitting, as this can heat up your scrotum., Like women, men can increase their fertility by eating a healthier plant-based diet. The antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables may help sperm stay healthy. Try to snack on fruits and veggies throughout the day. Have a salad before dinner and vegetable or fruit based side dishes. Try skipping dessert a few nights a week in favor of fruit for a sweet after dinner treat., Moderate physical activity may help increase sperm count. Try to incorporate some light walking, jogging, or biking into your daily routine. You could, for example, ride your bike to work instead of walking each day. You could also make a point of taking your dog for a long walk before bed each night. All of this can potentially increase your sperm count., Toxins found in pesticides and household products may have an effect on sperm count. If you work a job, like construction, that requires you to work with toxins, take preventative measures. Always wear protective clothing to prevent skin contact with chemicals., If you and your partner are struggling to conceive, consider seeing a fertility doctor to have a sperm count done. You will provide a semen sample, which will be medically tested to count the sperm. A sperm count lower than 15 million per milliliter of semen is considered low.Do not panic if your sperm count is low. There are many medical treatments, such as taking hormones and surgical options, that can correct a low sperm count. You will have to talk to your doctor to see which options are right for you given your medical history and current health., Most couples can safely try to conceive on their own for up to a year before consulting a doctor; however, in certain cases you should see a physician before attempting to have a child.


If you're over 35, fertility does decrease during this time. You are also at increased risk for a miscarriage or other complications during pregnancy. If you're over the age of 35, make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor will perform a basic exam and talk you through some of the unique risks and challenges you face getting pregnant at your age. They may also provide you some tips on how to conceive safely.If you have a condition that inhibits fertility, like PCOS, you should make an appointment with your doctor. They can provide you with insight on how to get pregnant safely. You should also see a doctor if you suspect you have a fertility issue. For example, if your menstrual cycle is inconsistent, you may want to have your doctor perform some tests to assess your fertility.If you discover you have a fertility issue, do not panic. Many fertility issues are treatable with medication or surgery. You doctor may recommend you see a fertility specialist, depending on your issue. Many couples are able to overcome fertility issues and go on to have healthy babies., Sexually transmitted infections are diseases transmitted through sexual intercourse. STIs can affect fertility in both men and women if they go untreated. If you and your partner have not already been tested for STIs, get tested before attempting to conceive. Most STIs are curable and you should make sure you're STI-free before trying to have a baby., If you're in your early 30's, seeing a doctor is not necessary unless you've been trying for a baby for over a year; however, many couples find it helpful to talk to their doctor ahead of time. Preconception planning allows your doctor to assess your overall health and give you advice on how to best conceive.Your regular doctor may be able to give you a preconception planning appointment; however, they may also refer you to a gynecologist or OBG/YN. At a preconception appointment, you will get a basic physical exam and your doctor will ask you about your lifestyle and medical history.Your doctor will then recommend any changes you can make to have a healthier overall lifestyle, increasing your chance of getting pregnant. For example, your doctor may suggest a slight change in your eating or exercise habits.If you or your partner has a health issue, preconception planning can be particularly helpful., Some medications can reduce fertility. Even vitamin supplements may have some affect on your hormones, decreasing your chance at conception. Go through your medicine cabinet and review all the medication you take regularly, including over-the-counter pills. If you notice anything on the label about a decrease in fertility, consider switching to a different type of medication.When trying to conceive, you should ask your health care provider before trying any new medications. Even over-the-counter medications may interfere with conception or cause complications after a baby is conceived., For both men and women, smoking tobacco products can affect fertility. If a woman smokes during pregnancy, or is around secondhand smoke, the baby's health could be affected. If a man smokes, he can damage his sperm. If you smoke, you should both quit as you try to conceive.Talk to your doctor about quitting. Tobacco is highly addictive and trying to quit without medical help can be difficult. Your doctor can help you form a plan to taper off tobacco. They may also recommend products, like nicotine gum, that can help you quit.
Seek support when quitting smoking. Quitting smoking is incredibly difficult and you'll need lots of support. Ask friends and family members to support your decision. You can also see if there are any support groups at your local hospital. If you can't find a support group in your area, you can look online.

, Drinking alcohol can decrease your fertility. If you conceive, drinking alcohol can hurt the developing fetus. When trying to get pregnant, it's best to refrain from alcohol consumption completely.If you're a regular drinker, quitting may be challenging. You may be accustomed to having a glass of wine with dinner, for example, or having drinks with friends on Fridays after work. Consider giving yourself a month to cut back on alcohol before trying to conceive.
Many social events revolve around drinking. These events can be awkward if you're not partaking, and you may not feel ready to tell others why you're cutting back on alcohol. You could drink something that appears like an alcohol beverage, like seltzer water in a clear glass, to avoid questions.

, Vaginal lubricants can help sex be less painful if you're prone to vaginal dryness; however, many over-the-counter lubricants can decrease fertility. Try to minimize or eliminate your use of lubricants when trying to get pregnant.You can use canola oil or mineral oil instead of an over-the-counter lubricant. You can also ask your doctor to recommend a lubricant that does not decrease fertility.Foreplay before sex may help your vagina lubricate more naturally. You can try increasing the amount of foreplay prior to sex. You can engage in behaviors like mutual masturbation before sex as well, or watch pornography together.

, While exercise in moderation can increase fertility, strenuous daily workouts may affect your hormones. This can decrease your overall fertility. Try not to engage in more than five hours of vigorous aerobic exercise each week."

Try to conceive on the days when you’re most fertile.",How to Increase Fertility Naturally," A healthy BMI has been linked to increased fertility in both men and women.This is because your weight affects your body’s hormone production. Being overweight leads to decreased sperm production in menand decreased frequency and consistency of ovulation in women.A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.You can find a BMI calculator online through the NIH or Mayo Clinic.;
, A big part of watching your weight means eating right. While no research suggests that one specific diet increases fertility, a balanced diet promotes overall health, including reproductive health.You should avoid sugar and other simple carbohydrates, as well as fatty or fried foods. Focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, lean meat protein (such as fish and skinless chicken), and healthy fats (such as omega-3 and omega-9 fats).


Note that once you become pregnant, you should slightly alter your diet, especially avoiding fish such as tuna that can have harmful amounts of mercury.Unchecked celiac disease has been linked to reduced fertility in women.If you have celiac disease, make an extra effort to avoid gluten while you’re trying to conceive. Consult your doctor for an ideal gluten-free diet during pregnancy.

, Another important step in maintaining a healthy weight is to get plenty of exercise. In men especially, moderate exercise can help produce enzymes that help to protect sperm.You should aim to get at least thirty minutes of moderate cardio (anything that gets your heart rate up, such as jogging, cycling, swimming, etc.) five days a week.
Note that women should stick to a moderate exercise routine as vigorous exercise reduces progesterone levels, which is an important hormone for ovulation.You should limit vigorous exercise to fewer than five hours each week., STIs, especially chlamydia and gonorrhea, can cause infertility in both men and women.Both of these STIs can occasionally present asymptomatically (without warning signs), so it’s always a good idea for you and your partner to schedule an STI screening before you stop using condoms when you plan to conceive.


Both infections are bacterial, and you can treat them with a course of antibiotics from your doctor.

, Use of tobacco products is another leading cause of infertility amongst both men and women.Women who smoke risk aging their ovaries and depleting their eggs prematurely.In men, smoking is associated with reduced sperm counts, decreased sperm mobility, and even misshapen sperm.Quitting all at once is rarely the most effective way to stop smoking for good. Consult your doctor concerning the best smoking cessation aids that are also safe for a couple trying to conceive.
You can also find more information at How to Quit Smoking.

, Experts have linked alcohol consumption to a number of fertility complications in both women and men. Heavy drinking can cause ovulation disorders in women, making it more difficult to pinpoint when you are most fertile.In men, heavy drinking is associated with lower levels of testosterone, which can lead to decreased sperm counts and even impotence.You should always drink in moderation and consider cutting out alcohol entirely while trying to conceive.

, Consider skipping additional lubricant during sex if at all possible. Many lubricants contain chemicals that will kill sperm or make it more difficult for sperm to reach the woman’s egg. If you do need to use a lubricant, try using simple baby oil or a fertility-friendly brand (such as Pre-Seed)., Consuming too much caffeine has been linked to fertility issues, especially in women.Experts in family planning suggest that women trying to become pregnant should limit their intake of caffeine to less than 200 or 300 milligrams each day.This means limiting yourself to roughly one eight-ounce cup of coffee or two one-ounce shots of espresso (or less)., Working swing or graveyard shift often affects one’s sleep schedule, which can also affect reproductive hormones.If you work nights, see if you can switch to day shift at least temporarily. If that’s not an option, do your best to keep a consistent sleep schedule., Some medications (such as calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants) can lead to reduced fertility.Talk to your doctor about any effects your medications might have. He or she might be able to switch your medication or reduce your dosage while you try to conceive.


Never alter your prescription regimen without first consulting your doctor.

, Both women and men should limit exposure to chemicals and other toxins, which can lead to menstrual disorders in women and reduced, damaged sperm counts in men.

You should wear protective clothing and equipment whenever possible if you work with chemicals. Some of those to avoid include:Nitrous oxide if you work as a dentist or dental assistant
Organic solvents like those found in dry cleaning chemicals
Agricultural chemicals
Industrial and manufacturing chemicals
Salon hair treatment chemicals

, Increased stress levels may also affect reproductive hormones and fertility in both men and women.If you experience high levels of stress in your work life or at home, then ensure you take time to relax with meditation, your favorite hobbies, or any other preferred stress-reducing activity.


You can find more info on the best ways for you to reduce stress at How to Reduce Stress.

, Temperatures in excess of normal body temperature around a man’s scrotum can affect sperm production.Wear loose, breathable underwear (such as cotton) and avoid hot environments like saunas and hot tubs., Women can track their body temperatures and changes to their cervical mucus to determine when they are most fertile—collectively called the symptothermal method.After the final day of your most recent period, begin recording information about your cervical mucus on a daily calendar., One of the easiest ways to check is to wipe using toilet tissue before urinating first thing in the morning.You want to observe the mucus for several things, including:Color - Is it yellow, white, clear, or cloudy?
Consistency - Is it thick, sticky, or stretchy?
Feel - Is it dry, wet, or slippery?
To avoid confusing standard sexual lubrication for cervical mucus, you should avoid sex during the cycle when you first record the information., You will notice several distinct changes to your cervical mucus throughout the month. These changes usually include:No apparent secretions in the first three or four days after your most recent period ends
A small amount of cloudy, sticky secretions for three to five days
An abundance of clear, wet, and slippery secretions for three to four days, which corresponds to the time just before as well as during ovulation
A sharp drop in cervical mucus for the next eleven to fourteen days until your next period starts

, Your basal body temperature refers to your temperature when you’re completely at rest.Many women record a slight rise in body temperature—around 0.5°F (0.3°C)—during ovulation, which you can use to help in determining your most fertile days.Since the change in temperature is so slight, you’ll need a highly accurate digital thermometer that measures tenths of a degree.
You can use the thermometer orally, vaginally, or rectally, but ensure that you always use a consistent method to record accurate results., To get a consistent basal temperature under the same conditions each day, keep your thermometer at your bedside and record your temperature before you get up in the morning.You should also make sure that you get at least three uninterrupted hours of sleep during the night to avoid any changes due to sleep disturbances., Your most fertile day is approximately two days before your basal temperature rises.By tracking both your cervical mucus and your basal temperature, you can pinpoint your most fertile day when your cervical mucus has become abundant and clear but your basal body temperature has not yet risen.


Though two days before your temperature rises is before you begin ovulating, it’s still ideal because your partner’s sperm can survive for up to five days in your reproductive tract.You may have to track this period over several months to conceive. Stay patient and plan sex with your partner during this period each month.

Know that abnormal sperm count and ejaculation could be a sign of infertility.,
Monitor any erectile dysfunction you have been experiencing.,
Consider any medical conditions you have.,
Know that certain infections can play a role in infertility.,
Be aware that your lifestyle can affect your fertility.,
Go to a doctor for testing.",How to Know if You Are Infertile2," Abnormal ejaculation would be an ejaculation with a lower sperm count or total absence of sperm. Abnormal ejaculations and unhealthy sperms can result in infertility. This is normally due to a problem arising in your seminal vesicles which produce the sperms and hormonal imbalances.


Varicocele or an enlarged testicular vein leads to abnormal sperm development, and results in 40% of infertility cases.
Abnormal ejaculations such as retrograde ejaculation or ejaculation into the bladder and premature ejaculation due to physical or hormonal causes also lead to male infertility.

, Erectile dysfunction is also known as impotence. This issue affects almost 20 million American males. It can be a result of psychological factors or inherent medical disorders. Almost 90% of erectile dysfunctions are due to medical causes.Performance anxiety, guilt, and stress are the common psychological causes of erectile dysfunction.
Type-2 DM, hypertension, hormonal imbalances, heart diseases, and pelvic surgery or trauma may also result in erectile dysfunction and subsequent infertility issues.

, Various underlying medical conditions affect your androgen or male hormone levels. They could also affect your sperm count and increase your chances of infertility. These conditions include:


Anemia, type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pituitary disorders, hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, testicular torsion, hydrocele, and obesity

, Various infections such as tuberculosis, mumps, brucellosis, influenza can affect your infertility. STDs such as gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis lead to low sperm count and sperm motility. Some STDs also lead to blocking of the epididymis which transports the sperms to the seminal fluid, leading to infertility.

, There are quite a few lifestyle choices and habits that can result in a decreased sperm count. These include:


Unhealthy eating habits, like eating a diet that is lacking in zinc, vitamin C and iron could affect your sperm count.
Wearing tight underwear can lower your sperm count as well, by increasing the scrotal temperature.
Long standing use of steroids also results in infertility from testicular shrinkage. Extreme exercise routines may also lead to infertility in men.
Cigarette smoking and excessive or chronic alcohol consumption leads to hormonal imbalances, low sperm counts and infertility.
Dealing with excessive amounts of stress at work or home could affect your sperm count and hormonal balance.

, Your doctor will run tests to determine your sperm count. He or she may also run blood tests to check androgens, postprandial blood sugars, and thyroid functioning. Further tests may be done if these tests are inconclusive.

Discuss your fertility options with your OB/GYN.,
Get your HCG injection.,
Follow up with your doctor.",How to Increase HCG Levels2," Most women who take HCG to help them get pregnant have already tried natural methods to increase fertility, and the drug clomiphene (Serophene). You may be prescribed other medications that promote fertility while taking HCG, such as menotropins and urofollitropin. When talking to your doctor about HCG as an option, be sure to discuss the following:Whether you have any allergies to medications, foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals.
What other medications you’re taking, if any.
If you use tobacco or drink alcohol.
If you have any other medical problems, especially unusual vaginal bleeding, asthma, seizures, heart or kidney problems, migraines, ovarian cysts, or uterine fibroids.

, The dose of HCG you take will depend on you, the levels of your other hormones, other medications you’re taking, and other factors. The average dose is 5,000-10,000 units. Your doctor will choose the right day to give you the injection based on your hormone levels, and the HCG will be injected into the muscle of your arm.HCG injections are NOT given during pregnancy for low HCG levels, because of the risk of birth defects., Once you start treatment, your doctor might ask you to keep a record of your basal body temperature. You will also need to continue to see your doctor for blood tests, and probably for ultrasounds to monitor your treatment."

Talk to your doctor about making dietary changes.,
Change your diet to change your body chemistry.,
Eat a diet high in calcium and magnesium.,
Avoid potassium and sodium-rich foods.",How to Have a Girl1," Dietary changes remain a controversial method of influencing a baby's sex. Many doctors and scientists doubt that diet can exert any strong influence on a child's sex and consider the sex of a baby to be based on random chance. Nevertheless, if your doctor says that it is safe for you to adjust your diet to promote having a girl baby, there is little harm in trying a ""girl diet."";
, Dietary changes can supposedly affect your likelihood of conceiving a girl by altering the mineral content and acidity of the uterine environment. According to this theory, a woman's diet in the weeks leading to conception can make her body more ""friendly"" toward X chromosome sperm (which lead to a baby girl) and less ""friendly"" toward Y chromosome sperm (which lead to a baby boy)., Recommended foods on a diet conducive to having a girl include low-sodium dairy products, eggs, rice, and low-sodium breads and crackers.Fruits and vegetables might also help you conceive a girl., A recent study found that women who ate potassium-rich cereals were more likely to conceive boys. Other potassium-rich foods include bananas, salmon, mushrooms, beans, tuna, sweet potatoes, and potatoes. "
"
Track your ovulation cycle.,
Have sex 2-4 days before ovulation to conceive a girl.",How to Have a Girl2," You can time your ovulation in many ways. The most accurate method is to use an ovulation predictor kit (OPK). If you have a regular menstrual cycle, you can also predict the date range of ovulation by counting back 12-16 days from the date your last period started, though the prediction might not be entirely accurate.Keeping track of ovulation can also increase your likelihood of conceiving at all (regardless of gender) because women are usually the most fertile in the few days prior to ovulation.Other signs of ovulation include abdominal pain, changes in vaginal fluids, and changes in basal body temperature. Consider tracking your cycle carefully on a calendar in order to understand how your body responds to ovulation.

, Female sperm carry more genetic material, making them heavier and slower than male sperm. Having sex at least two days before ovulation gives the slower female sperm more time to move up the uterine canal before the egg arrives.This is known as the ""Shettles Method.""


There is an alternate theory known as the ""Whelan Method"" that suggests that sex should take place 2-3 days prior to ovulation to conceive a girl and 4-6 days before ovulation to conceive a boy. "

Determine what you are willing to spend on sex selection.,
Discuss options with your doctor very carefully.,
Pursue sperm sorting techniques with a clinic.,
Look into the ""swim up"" method of artificial insemination.,
Pursue Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD).",How to Have a Girl3," While medical procedures are the most foolproof method for having a girl, they are also the most expensive. They can cost anywhere from several hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. Sometimes these procedures are not available in every country, leading to additional travel costs as well. Set a budget in order to plan how you might pay for the procedure.

, While side effects from these procedures tend to be mild, these techniques are relatively new and involve a certain amount of risk. Talk to a trusted doctor to decide what risks you are comfortable taking on.

, It is possible to sort sperm into Y-chromosomal and X-chromosomal sperm using a technique known as cytometric sorting, after which an egg is fertilized with the desired sperm using artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization. Because X chromosomes are slightly larger than Y chromosomes, sperm that lead to girls are able to absorb more fluorescent dye than sperm that lead to boys. The sperm can then be separated, and the desired sex of a baby can be chosen.Sperm sorting is highly effective, though it is not 100% effective. It can, however, be costly and might not be available for all prospective parents.

, Many reproductive clinics offer to sort sperm by their speed of movement. Because sperm carrying female genetic material tend to be heavier (and therefore slower), this sorting can make a specific sex much more likely, though not guaranteed., This procedure can be done on embryos created using in vitro fertilization. It allows doctors to identify embryos of a certain sex, thus providing gender selection prior to embryonic implantation. In addition to identifying (and potentially selecting) embryos of a certain sex, chromosomal disorders and conditions can be identified using PGD. Though highly effective, the procedure is costly and invasive, and it raises ethical dilemmas about the appropriateness of sex selection of embryos. In fact, gender screening is banned in some places. Certain countries, like Britain, make exceptions only when there is a medical necessity to screen for gender, such as gender-specific genetic diseases.Other doctors similarly support post-fertilization sex selection in cases of medical necessity, but reject post-fertilization sex selection practices because of personal preference.
The procedure works by identifying the gender of an embryo while it is still in the lab before it is placed in the womb, and claims 100% accuracy."

Get yourselves thoroughly checked out.,
If you have a male partner, have their sperm tested for genetic problems.,
During IVF, seek a clinic that offers the Sure24 Chromosomal test.,
Make sure that you're healthy!,
Cut down on the coffee.,
During IVF, if you produce more & better size follicles you'll have a higher chance of getting pregnant.,
Use a clinic that offer blastocyst transfers, but remember they aren't always better that a good 3 day embryo!,
Be realistic, especially with age.,
Finally choose a fertility clinics that offer packages or discounts for multiple treatments.",How to Help Your IVF Work," As well as the regular blood & sperm tests, have an ultra-sound. If there are any problems with conditions like Fibroids (which are quite common) you'll need to know how severe they are & how that might affect your chances with IVF. It could quite simply mean, you'll need more attempts, which will affect you budgeting.;
, Often chromosomal issues go untested & unchecked whilst couples have several IVF attempts at fertility treatment. Because despite his 'troops' looking great under the microscope, there's a problem that can't so easily be see. A simple test could literally saves £1000's in treatment expenses.

, This is a new & exciting development in IVF. Embryologists know that around half the fertilized embryos that they re-implant won't survive because of chromosomal problems. The difficultly for them, is that despite newly fertilised embryos looking good in the lab, there's no way of knowing how good they actually are. Selecting fertilised embryos isn't exactly guesswork but it is 'best-guess' work. Or at least it was until the 24Sure test. This actually looks at 24 key chromosomes (the basic human building blocks) of newly fertilised embryos to determine if any are missing or damaged. So far it looks like this test could possibly improve IVF success rates by 65%!

, 'Control the controllable' as they say: Eat a great diet, exercise, stop smoking, stop drinking, stop smoking the funny stuff! & get more sleep. It may sound a little boring, but if you are over-indulging in any of these areas, it could stop IVF from working

, For women, NEW research shows that drinking more than 5 cups of coffee a day has a negative effective on you're chances of getting pregnant with IVF. So hold back on those free refills!

, The ideal situation is around 8-15 eggs at 16mm-22m in size. If you only have 3 then you need to consider this - should you freeze them & go for another 2-3 stimulation cycles before fertilizing a good number of eggs in one go? This should increase you chances of success.

, Also if you're going to freeze some eggs for a later cycle - always use the vitrification freezing technique - it increases your chances of success.

, Unexplained infertility affects thousands of couples every year. Sometimes it's just nature's way of saying - you're getting a bit old for this! Between the ages of 43-45 it's probably time to at least consider using donor eggs. Donors will be matched to you major physical characteristics, which helps bonding with your new child.

, Why? Because you'll probably need them! Some even offer refund guarantees. These allow women to try IVF three times. So even if it's not successful, you still have enough money to try IVF with donor eggs. As we said at the beginning - it's a numbers game! The very best of luck!

Be especially vigilant throughout your pregnancy.",How to Get Pregnant With PCOS," Many women with PCOS will need help regulating their ovulation and protecting against miscarriage, which requires supervision of a trained doctor. Your doctor will help you with this, as well as monitor you early in your pregnancy.


Medications you are taking to manage your PCOS may not be safe for use in pregnancy, and they will need to be changed or discontinued. This is another excellent reason to see your doctor right away.;
, PCOS causes many women to have infrequent periods. Infrequent periods mean infrequent ovulation, which means lower chances of sperm fertilizing an egg. Chart your period, using an over-the-counter ovulation test or basal body temperature thermometer to make note of the days you ovulate.


If you are ovulating regularly, try to time intercourse to occur on your most fertile days.
If you are not ovulating, or your ovulation is irregular, your basal body temperatures and ovulation predictor results are erratic, or you have not conceived after 6 months of regular ovulation, schedule an appointment with your obstetrician. Explain your concern and ask for a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist.

, The biggest problem women with PCOS face is irregular ovulation. If you're not ovulating when you think you're ovulating, or you're not ovulating at all, getting pregnant is going to be a Sisyphean task. Luckily, doctors — and the magic of science — can help.


Many doctor prescribe drugs like Metformin and Clomid to help produce regular periods and regulate ovulation, respectively.

Metformin is primarily a drug used to treat diabetes, but is used for women with PCOS because they often have difficulty absorbing insulin. High insulin levels produce high androgen levels, which complicates periods.Clomid is an infertility drug that stimulates the production of hormones that cause ovulation.If you're having trouble getting a period at all, your doctor might suggest a drug like Provera., Some patients with PCOS use in-vitro fertilization to conceive when other methods do not offer results. In some rare cases, PCOS affects the quality of the woman's eggs and donor eggs must be used.

, A surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling has shown promise and may help some women with PCOS conceive.It involves a surgeon inserting a camera through a small incision in your abdomen and using it to identify follicles on the surface of your ovaries and burn holes in them.This alters your hormone levels and may allow you to conceive naturally.

, Expecting mothers with PCOS are about three times as likely to miscarry than expecting mothers without PCOS.Many doctors will recommend continuing to take metformin throughout the pregnancy in order to lower the likelihood of miscarriage.

, Many doctors will stress the importance of consistent light exercise for expecting mothers with PCOS. Exercising will improve the body's use of insulin, normalize hormone levels, and keep your weight in check. In fact, regular exercise is often recommended for women who are trying to conceive, as this improves their chances of regular ovulation.


Talk with your doctor about which exercises are allowed and which ones you may want to stay away from. Walking and light strength training are often ideal for expecting mothers.

, Because PCOS limits your body's ability to regulate insulin, you may need to be as vigilant about what you eat as a person with diabetes is. A diet high in protein and fiber can help lower your insulin levels, which mitigates the impact PCOS has on your body. Avoid overly processed foods or foods with added sugar., Unfortunately, PCOS carries with it several other risks even after you've managed to conceive. Talk with your doctor about protecting again pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes, which are all more common for women with PCOS.Understand that women with PCOS often deliver their babies by Cesarean section. C-section is more common for expecting mothers with PCOS because complications more often arise.

Take your temperature every morning.,
Notice ovulation symptoms.,
Chart your symptoms and temperatures.,
Have sex at the most fertile times.,
Live a healthy lifestyle.,
Don't get too thin or too big.,
Avoid Bisphenol A (BPA).",How to Get Pregnant Using the Sympto Thermal Method," The ""thermal"" part of the STM requires that a woman take her core body temperature each morning before getting out of bed.Use a basal thermometer (an especially sensitive thermometer that has a limited range) to get a reading and then record it on a calendar. Depending on the stage of your menstrual cycle, there are slight variations in temperature that can indicate ovulation. Ovulation of an egg means a woman is fertile and able to conceive.


There is a 0.5 – 1.0 degree rise in temperature after ovulation.
When the temperature is elevated for at least three days, you can safely assume you've ovulated.
Basal thermometers are used either in the mouth or rectum. Rectal readings are generally more reliable/accurate, but not necessary.
Your basal temperature can change when you are upset, ill, stressed, jet lagged or don't get enough sleep.;
, The ""sympto"" part of the STM requires that a woman take note of other physical symptoms of ovulation, such as increased cervical and vaginal mucus production, abdominal cramping, breast sensitivity and mood swings.Monitoring mucus quality and quantity is a particularly reliable sign of ovulation. The hormones that control your menstrual cycle also trigger your cervix to produce mucus, which also collects in the vagina. This mucus changes in quality and quantity just before and during ovulation.


You'll produce the most amount of mucus just prior to ovulation. It looks clear and feels slippery — much like raw egg white.With careful monitoring, it's relatively easy to predict your fertile period from these physical symptoms.
These physical symptoms can cause discomfort and are sometimes called PMS symptoms or premenstrual syndrome symptoms.

, The key with STM is to record all your information regarding your daily temperature readings and make note of when you feel the above-mentioned symptoms.You can get ready-made monthly charts from your healthcare provider or a women's health center. As each day's information is written onto the chart, you'll begin to see a pattern develop after a few months.


Get a fertility specialist, registered nurse or family planning professional to help you organize and interpret your charts until you get the hand of it.
The menstrual cycle is 28 days on average (although some can be as long as 35 days), which doesn't completely synchronize with the months, so expect your fertility periods to occur at slightly different times each month.

, For the average woman, the most fertile days of her cycle are from days 10 and 17 — about one week per month.By charting your temperatures and physical signs, you can be even more precise and be able to figure out on which days of the month your highest fertility falls on. From there, you should have vaginal intercourse (with male ejaculation) throughout the fertile period to give yourself the best chance of getting pregnant. Although it only takes a single sperm, most couples take three to six months of sexual activity in order to get pregnant.


Keep in mind that sperm frequently live up to two days within the vagina/cervix (and in rare cases as many as five days), so it's possible to get pregnant from having sex a few days prior to ovulation.
In comparison, the female egg only lives for between 12 – 24 hours. Thus, once a woman ovulates, there's not much more than a day for sperm to have a chance of fertilization.

, Fertility rates drop among couples who live unhealthy lifestyles. Hormone production as well as the health of the eggs and sperm depend on a number of factors and unhealthy living can make a significant negative impact on fertility. Stopping smoking, drinking less alcohol, cutting back on caffeine, eliminating trans fat from your diet and eating more nutritiously can really impact fertility rates and ensure a healthy pregnancy.As a woman, make sure to include enough protein, iron, zinc and vitamins C and D in your diet because deficiencies in these nutrients are linked to longer menstrual cycles and less ovulation.If you're thinking of getting pregnant, limit your daily caffeine consumption to less than 200 mg — about 12 ounces of freshly brewed coffee.Drinking more than two alcoholic beverages per day on average can reduce the quality and quantity of a man's sperm.

, Although watching your weight is always a good idea to make sure you don't get too heavy and increase you risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, being too thin can prevent ovulation or conception.In general, a women needs about 20% body fat or more to conceive and carry a baby. In terms of body mass index (BMI), women should aim to be in the 20 – 24 range, which is healthy and still allows a woman to have some curves.


Being obese is problematic for getting pregnant because body fat produces hormones that affect the menstrual cycle and ovulation.Men who are overweight, especially those with lots of belly fat, tend to produce fewer and less healthy sperm.

, BPA is found in most plastics and food packaging, such as plastic bottles, Tupperware and cellophane wrap, and can mimic hormones like estrogen.BPA essentially disrupts the endocrine system and decreases sperm quality and libido in men, as well as reduces egg quality and hormone production in women. BPA can also cause egg abnormalities and increase a woman's chances of suffering a miscarriage.Reduce your exposure to BPA for at least three months before trying to get pregnant (both men and women).
Look for ""BPA-free"" plastic products, especially those that are in contact with food and/or beverages.
Don't wrap microwaved food in cellophane or other plastic wraps while cooking.
Drink water in ceramic or stainless-steel-lined bottles instead of plastic.

Reflect.,
You don't have to make your mind yet.,
Find a clinic that goes through artificial insemination with single or lesbian women.,
Contact the clinic and book a conversation (usually costs 90 dollars) where you can talk to a person about the insemination and what it'll be like for the child not to have a father etc.,
Find out if you can afford artificial insemination.,
Go to your doctor or gynecologist.,
If you have, or have had, physical or mental disabilities or any kind of addiction you should consult with your doctor.,
Let a gynecologist give you a physical to see what chances you have to get pregnant.,
Have you ever had an infection in your womb or fallopian tubes?,
Write down the latest six months menstruation intervals.,
Know that your chance to become pregnant - if you are younger than 35 years old and in your natural cycle - is about 25% in one insemination.,
You should stop or decrease your input of coffee, cigarettes and alcohol.,
Decide when you want to go through the insemination.,
Go to the clinic to get inseminated.,
The clinic will tell you when to test if you are pregnant.,
Book a new insemination time if you didn't get pregnant.",How to Go Through an Artificial Insemination if You Are Single or Lesbian," Is this what you want to do? Are there other ways, like adoption, that fit you better? Are you ready to be a parent? Becoming a parent is a big transposition. Children can be tiresome, but at the same time so adorable and wonderful. Are you ready to do what it takes to be a mother? Can you afford a child?,;
, Read about artificial insemination on the Internet or in books to find out more about the whole process.

, Not all clinics inseminate single women.

, This conversation can be on phone or face to face.

, One insemination often costs about 300 to 700 dollars (if you live in the United States) and you may need to be inseminated 4 times or more to get pregnant.

, Ask the doctor to test if you have chlamydia, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. Also take a blood test to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are infected by rubella during your pregnancy, the child can get severe malformations and disabilities. If you are not immune to rubella, you can vaccinate yourself before the insemination. If you have a cat or often meet cats, it can be a good idea to talk to your doctor about a test for toxoplasmosis.

, The certificate from the doctor shall discuss your current circumstance of life and not the disability or illness in general.

, That is done by using ultrasound imaging and eventual blood tests. The ultrasound imaging shows if your womb and ovaries look normal. The blood tests show the hormone levels in your body.

, Or have you had chlamydia or gonorrhea before? Then you should do an X-ray examination in order to see if you have passage through the fallopian tubes. Talk with your gynecologist about this examination.

, Use your calendar. You count from the first day the menstruation starts (=day 1) up until the last day before the next menstruation starts. How many days you bleed doesn't matter in this context.

, That means it will, on an average, take 3-4 inseminations before you are pregnant. If you are 35-40 year old you need, on an average, 6 inseminations, and 11 inseminations if you are older than 40. The risk for miscarriage is the same as in every other way to become pregnant. The risk is 19% if you are younger than 35, and sadly 44% if you are older than 40. If you are older than 45, the chance to become pregnant and give birth to a healthy child is endlessly small.

, Furthermore, eat healthy! This will increase your chance to get pregnant.

, It has to be during your ovulation. You can talk about this with your clinic.

, The insemination is painless and lasts for 5-10 minutes. A doctor or accoucheuse will insert sperm in your vagina or uterus with a catheter or needle-less syringe. After the insemination you may get allowed to rest for 30 minutes or so. You may get a pregnancy test from the clinic.

, Go home again, and after a certain period of time, use the pregnancy test. If you are pregnant - congratulations! But it's more likely that you need some more inseminations before you are pregnant, so be prepared.

, Hope for the best and don't give up!

Understand what charting is.,
Keep track of your basal body temperature.,
Keep track of changes in your cervical mucus.,
Check your cervical position and texture.",How to Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding with No Period1," Charting can help you to determine when you are most fertile. When you know this specific time span, you have more of a chance of getting pregnant. Charting is done by tracking your basal body temperature, cervical position, cervical texture, and cervical mucus.;
, You will need a special thermometer called a basal body thermometer in order to be able to do this. When you get up in the morning, take your temperature; this baseline reading is your baseline body temperature. Your basal body temperature will change throughout your cycle as your hormones fluctuate; these changes can help you to determine when you will be most fertile.During the first half of your cycle, estrogen dominates. The second half of your cycle causes a surge of progesterone. This hormone leads to a sudden increase in body temperature as it gets your uterus ready for fertilization and implantation. These days where you see a spike in your body temperature are the days when you are most fertile.
The changes in temperature can range from 0.2° to 0.5° C (0.4° to 1.0° F).
You can keep track of your temperature by creating a physical chart. Keep track of your basal body temperature for a couple of months so that you can predict which days are likely to be your most fertile.

, Cervical mucus is known as vaginal discharge; this mucus can change depending on which phase of your reproductive cycle you are in. To examine your cervical mucus, look at your toilet paper after you wipe. Check your mucus before going to bed. Keep track of your mucus colors on a chart for a couple of months so that you can predict when you will be most fertile.If you observe clear and slippery mucus for two days, you are fertile and can try to conceive.
Dry of cloudy mucus means that you are not likely to conceive.

, To find your cervix, stand or squat and place one of your legs on a stool. Insert two of your fingers into your vagina and push backwards. You will feel a slightly firmer texture when you reach the cervix.Do this every day to assess the changes of your cervix and keep track of these changes on a chart for at least two months.


During ovulation, your cervix will be high, soft, and open. The cervix is soft if it feels like the texture of your lips.
When you are not ovulating, your cervix will be low, firm, and closed. A low cervix is characterized as being just a few inches from your vagina. The cervix is firm if it feels like the texture of the tip of your nose.

Wean your baby.,
Feed your baby frequently during the day but try to feed him less at night.,
Give your baby a pacifier to suck on.,
Feed your child a combination of breast milk and formula milk.",How to Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding with No Period2," Continuous breastfeeding results in the production of more prolactin levels. High prolactin levels can suppress your body’s production of estrogen. In order to lower your prolactin levels, you can consider reducing the amount of time that you breastfeed your baby.Techniques for how to do this are covered in the following steps.

, Feed your baby as much as he wants during the day. As your baby grows older, he will be able to store more in his belly, which will help to cut down on how frequently you have to feed him.


Try to avoid nighttime stimulation so that your baby sleeps without wanting to feed. When you can reduce the number of times you feed your baby during the night, your body may produce less prolactin.

, Comfort sucking is when your baby latches on to your nipple without actually consuming your breast milk. However, even if your child does not feed, your body still recognizes your baby latching on to you, and will produce more prolactin. To reduce your prolactin levels, hold your baby while he sucks on a pacifier.</ref>Pallone SR, et al. Fertility awareness-based methods: Another option for family planning. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine. 2009;22:147.</ref>


To determine when your child is feeding or comfort sucking, check to see if your child is swallowing. When your child feeds, his jaw will move slowly, and you will be able to see him swallowing. When your child comfort sucks, his jaw will move very quickly and you will see little swallowing occurring.

, To cut back on the amount of time you spend breastfeeding your child, feed your child a mixture of breast milk and formula milk. Doing this will give your child the nutrients he needs, while helping your body to lower its prolactin levels.

Eat foods rich in omega 3 fatty acids.,
Eat foods rich in vitamin D. The active form of vitamin D (calcitriol) plays an important role in female reproduction.,
Increase your Vitamin B6 intake.,
Take vitamin C supplements.,
Get more zinc.",How to Get Pregnant While Breastfeeding with No Period3," Omega 3s are helpful in increasing fertility by regulating reproductive hormones, increasing the cervical mucus of egg white, which helps the sperm reach the egg. Omega 3s can also reduce your body’s sensitivity to the hormone prolactin, which can suppress ovulation, and boosts blood flow to the uterus, which can aid with the development of uterine lining..


Foods rich in omega 3 are cod liver oil, canola oil, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, cashews, avocado, sunflower seeds, almonds, sesame seeds, olive oil, corn oil and safflower oil.

, Calcitriol has the ability to control the genes involved in the production of estrogen and embryo implantation. The uterine lining is able to produce calcitriol in response to the embryo as it passes through the uterine cavity before implantation.


The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 35 (international units) (IUs) per pound of body weight.

, This vitamin can help you to restore your luteal phase, which is the time period from your ovulation to your period. It is generally 11 to 16 days long. Vitamin B6 can also help to reduce your prolactin levels, which, as described above, can disrupt your ovulation process.Try to get roughly 100 mg of vitamin B6 each day. Foods that are rich in vitamin B6 include whole grains, walnuts, lean red meat, seafood, bananas, potatoes, beans, spinach and fortified cereals

, Studies have shown that vitamin C increases the amount of mucus in the vagina which makes the mucus more abundant. This means that it will be easier for the sperm to travel and reach the eggs. For breastfeeding women it is recommended to get around 65 mg of vitamin C each day.Vitamin C can be taken in capsule, tablet or effervescent form. You can also eat foods rich in vitamin C, such as cherries, oranges, kiwi, red and green pepper, lemon, spinach and strawberry.

, Zinc is a mineral that can help your pituitary gland to release chemicals that promote ovulation. It can also help to boost your pituitary gland’s production of estrogen and progesterone..


You should try to get roughly 25 mg of zinc each day. Foods rich in zinc are veal liver, shellfish, crabs, dark chocolate, lean red meats, wheat germ, watermelon, chickpeas, and pumpkin and squash seeds.

Stop using hormonal birth control.,
Stop smoking.,
Take prenatal vitamins.,
Eat nutritious foods.,
Achieve a healthy body weight.,
Cut back on the caffeine.,
Limit your alcohol intake.,
Visit your doctor.,
Seek a specialist if necessary.,
Count the days of your menstrual cycle.,
Chart your basal body temperature.,
Check your cervical mucous.,

Relax.",How to Get Pregnant Quickly," These methods (pills, patch, intrauterine contraceptive, Depo-Provera, etc.) can alter your menstrual cycle. To plan your pregnancy, you'll need to know the length of your cycle and how long your periods last without birth control. If you were on the Pill or the patch, your body might need extra time to re-regulate.


If you need another month or two, use a condom. Each woman's body is unique. Some women have to wait up to a year after stopping their birth control, while others can get pregnant immediately.;
, If you smoke, quit the moment you decide you want to have a baby. Smoking could make you less fertile and increase your risk of an ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage. It's also known to cause a host of birth defects, such as low birth weight and underdeveloped lungs.


If you have a partner, they should quit, too. Secondhand smoke is just as dangerous as primary smoke. If your partner is the intended father, smoking can slow down his sperm., Prenatal vitamins prepare your body for the task of nourishing an extra person. They also contain extra folic acid, which can prevent spina bifida in the developing fetus. Because spina bifida often develops before a woman know she's pregnant, doctors recommend taking a prenatal vitamin as soon as you decide you want to start a family., You should always eat a balanced diet. Aim for a variety of foods that will help you get your daily requirements of iron, calcium, folic acid, and protein. You can get these nutrients from raisins, dark leafy greens, legumes, broccoli, and fortified whole grain breads. Omega-3 fatty acids are also important. If you're vegan, you don't have to start eating fish for omega-3s. You can get them from flax seeds and walnuts., If you're overweight, it could take you twice as long to get pregnant as it would for a woman of normal weight. If you're underweight, it could take you four times as long. Talk to your doctor about an exercise regimen that will help you achieve a normal Body Mass Index (BMI).If you are a healthy body weight, keep your diet consistent and healthy.

, Too much caffeine can limit your fertility. Aim for no more than 500 mg per day. If you brew your own coffee at home, this is about five cups. However, if you grab your java at the local coffee shop, that 16-ounce serving of latte or Americano should be your limit for the day., The jury is still out as to how much (or if) alcohol limits your fertility. However, you should still err on the side of safety. If you decide to consume alcohol, one drink (12 fl oz./355mL regular beer, 5 fl oz./148mL table wine, 1.5 fl oz./44mL distilled spirits) per day should be your limit., They'll probably do a full exam and go over your medical history. Tell them about Let them know if you're taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements. They'll tell you which ones you'll need to stop taking and which ones are safe. Let them also know about your:


Reproductive issues, including past pregnancies, miscarriages, ovarian cysts, fibroid tumors, endometriosis, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or reproductive cancer.
Vaccination history, especially vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella. If you contract these illnesses during pregnancy, they can harm the fetus.
Family medical history, including siblings or parents who have had cancer, heart disease, or genetic abnormalities.
Exercise habits.
Partner's medical history, if applicable. This includes low sperm count, history of measles, mumps, rubella, or other illnesses that can affect fertility., Women's fertility steadily decreases after the age of 35. For men, the effects are less clear. If you're under 35, try to conceive for a year before you see a doctor for fertility testing. If you're over 35, wait six months. See your family doctor or regular gynecologist first. They'll refer you to a specialist if you need to see one. Give your doctor details about every measure you've taken to conceive. The most common tests you'll undergo are:Pap smear to check for cervical cancer.
Urine test to check for chlamydia, which can block your fallopian tubes.
Blood test during your period to check for hormonal imbalances.
Blood test during or after your period to test for ovulation.
Blood test at any time during your cycle to check for rubella.

, If your cycle is regular, you may be able to determine your egg's next release through your Fallopian tubes with simple math. If your cycle is 28 days long, you'll probably ovulate on day 14. A good rule of thumb is to count back 16 days from the first day of your next period. You'll probably ovulate up to five days after that day.There are also plenty of calculators available online.

, Your basal temperature (lowest body temperature in any given 24-hour period) will rise 0.2 degrees F (0.11 degrees C) a few days after you ovulate. Only use a basal thermometer. You're looking for fluctuations that are smaller than a degree, which are difficult to see on a regular thermometer. You can find a basal thermometer at your local drug store or big box store., Monitor color and texture. Your mucous will increase and be most slippery around the time of your ovulation. If you can stretch it between your fingers, you probably are ovulating. These changes can be difficult to detect, so monitor for them often., Ovulation prediction kits can predict a released egg a day in advance. It uses the same methodology as a pregnancy test. However, they can cost anywhere from $20 to $50. You can buy them in your local drug store.


Ovulation kits test levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. This means you'll have to urinate on a stick. Unfortunately, it's not 100 percent accurate, so don't depend only on this method., Sperm can survive for up to five days in your body. Therefore, if you aim for two to three days before to the day of ovulation, you should be able to get pregnant. If you want to play it safe, have intercourse every day or every other day during the second and third weeks of your cycle., Artificial lubricants can slow down or kill sperm. Instead, have your partner make time for foreplay. However, if you need a lubricant, go for something natural like mineral oil or canola oil., When you're stressed, it can mess with your cycle. Calm down and have fun. If your life is full of undue stress, try picking up yoga or another meditation practice. Taking just 15 minutes out of your day to calm yourself can help greatly."

Pre-planning: Make a “pre-conception” appointment with your OBGYN or Midwife.,
On the first day of your pregnancy cycle, throw out birth control, if applicable.,
On the second day of your pregnancy cycle, start BBT charting.,
On the third day of your pregnancy cycle,if you opted to buy the first response fertility test, this is the day to take it.,
About on the fifth day of your pregnancy cycle, start charting your cervical mucus Do this daily until the doctor confirms conception.,
About on the fourteenth day of your pregnancy cycle, start taking OPKs daily starting on or about the days that FF predicts you are fertile.,
About on the twentieth day of your pregnancy cycle, you likely noticed a slight rise in your temperature around the time of ovulation.,
About on the twenty-eighth day of your pregnancy cycle, expect Aunt Flo any time now.,
In the second cycle of your pregnancy and on this cycle's first day, continue charting menses and BBT, and taking all supplements.",How to Get Pregnant in 90 Days or Less," Check with your doctor to ensure that the following supplements and tools are right for you as you would not want any adverse effects. Ask for a prescription for prenatal vitamins or ask your doctor to recommend a good over the counter brand. Have IUD or other birth control device removed (if applicable, in not continue to cycle day 1).;
, Go shopping for the items listed in ""things you will need."" Start taking all daily supplements immediately (except for Guaifenesin until further notice). Stop all use of caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and non-medically necessary drugs. Time to put away the hot tub, if you have one. It decreases fertility in men and they cannot be used by women during pregnancy anyway.

, Set an alarm and wake up the same time every day and take your temp. Do not move or get out of bed until the thermometer has registered the temp (make sure to get at least 3, but preferably 6 hours of sleep before taking BBT).

, Follow the directions on the packaging.

, (Note: shortly after your period it will be extremely dry or non-existent; more information about charting CM at http://infertility.about.com/od/tryingtoconceive101/a/cervicalmucus.htm)

, Continue to check your cervical mucus. When it is clear and stretches between your fingers (like egg white) it is your most fertile mucus. Be sure to have sex on the days you have EWCM (Egg White Cervical Mucus) as well as on the day you get a positive OPK. Start taking Guaifenesin (200 mg 3x per day), and start doing the horizontal hula (missionary or doggy style positions are best for depositing the sperm closest to the cervix). Avoid using lubricants or saliva as these can both inhibit or kill sperm (if you must use a lubricant try actual egg whites or PreSeed). Also avoid oral sex because of the same issues with saliva. If you can, make sure she orgasms during or after ejaculation, as there is some proof that a woman’s orgasm can help ferry the sperm along through the cervix. Do this daily during suspected fertile days for the first cycle. You should lie down with your hips elevated for at least 20 mins after sex. If conception does not occur during the first cycle try switching to sex every other day, but being careful to have sex on the day of EWCM and positive OPK.

, If the temperature has remained high there is a possibility that you are pregnant, if not there is still a possibility, but you should probably expect to see aunt Flo around her regularly scheduled visitation time.

, If there is no sign of her after your expected cycle days three or four, take a home pregnancy test and hope for the best.

, At end of menses continue steps starting at CD 5 and follow instructions through CD 28. Repeat for cycle 3.

Wait to be selected by a recipient.,
Discuss your egg donor fee with the fertility clinic.,
Have your airfare and other expenses covered, as necessary.,
Sign a contract for payment for your eggs.,
Donate your eggs at the clinic.,
Rest for several days after the donation.,
Watch for any adverse side effects.,
Attend a follow up visit at the clinic.",How to Get Paid for Donating Your Eggs," Search online for a licensed fertility clinic in your area. You will need to go in person to the clinic during the process, so opt for one that is easy for you to get to. Check if the fertility clinic has a license to practice, usually noted on their website. You can also call them directly to confirm they are licensed.

Ask friends who have donated their eggs before to recommend a clinic that you can apply to for egg donation. They may be able to suggest a good, reputable fertility clinic in your area.;
, Many fertility clinics have an online application system for egg donation. You will complete a questionnaire that asks about your birth control usage and your medical history. You will need to disclose if you have had an STD and if you are on any medications.As part of the application, you will also need to disclose your family’s medical history, including the medical history of your parents and grandparents.

, Depending on the fertility clinic, you will usually hear back about your online application within three to five business days. The clinic will contact you directly to let you know if you have been chosen as a candidate for egg donation. You will then need to agree to move forward in the application process., The clinic will require you to undergo physical tests and blood work to confirm you are in good health. You will be checked for any diseases and abnormalities. You will also need to meet with a genetic counselor and a psychologist.Once you pass all the required tests, you will be approved as a donor.

, The fertility clinic will let you know when you have been chosen by a recipient to be their donor. Once this happens, you will need to start taking birth control to synchronize your menstrual cycle with the recipient’s cycle. This will require an injection of a hormone stimulant into a fatty area on your body twice a day.You will need to take birth control for about six weeks. After six weeks, you will be able to go into the clinic to complete the egg donation.

, The standard fee for egg donation ranges from $6,000 to $10,000 USD per donation. The exact amount will depend on state guidelines and the discretion of the fertility clinic. In some cases, recipients bid a certain amount on donor eggs. The fertility clinic should detail the exact amount offered for your eggs by the recipient.Some fertility clinics offer more money if you donate your eggs more than once. Discuss this option with the clinic if you are planning to donate your eggs again in the future.

, The fertility clinic will usually offer to cover your airfare, your accommodation, and other expenses if you need to travel to the clinic. They will also cover all medical expenses and medical insurance associated with the donation.You will need to plan to stay in bed for several days after the donation. The clinic will cover the cost of accommodations for you to rest before you fly home, if needed.

, Once you agree to donate your eggs to the recipient, you will sign a contract that specifies payment for your eggs. You will not paid in full until after the donation has been completed.The contract may also specify if you are going to be an anonymous donor, which means you will not know who the recipient is or where your eggs will end up. The recipient will also not be given any personal information about you so you remain anonymous.

, About 35 hours before the retrieval date for the eggs, you will need to give yourself a shot that stimulates your ovaries. Your ovaries will then produce extra eggs that will be removed from your uterus at the fertility clinic. The eggs are retrieved vaginally with a syringe. There is no surgical cut required for the donation.You will be under IV sedation during the donation and will not feel any pain. The procedure usually takes around 30 minutes.
You will not be able to drive after the donation, so you should bring a friend with you or secure a ride for after the procedure.

, Bed rest is required for 24 hours after the donation. Your abdominal area may feel sore and you may feel groggy due to the IV sedation during the procedure. Make sure you rest in bed and do very little physical activity for several days.You should menstruate within 10 days after the donation. After your next period, your cycle should return to normal.

, The fertility clinic will monitor you for possible issues like Ovarian Hyper-Stimulation Syndrome (OHSS). They will check if you have a sudden weight gain and extreme bloating in the days following the donation. If you notice these symptoms, you should go to the clinic immediately.You should also watch for issues like severe cramping, lower back pain, and a general feeling of unwellness. If you experience any of these issues, go see your doctor.

, The fertility clinic will schedule a follow up exam within two to three weeks of the donation to ensure you have healed well. If you decide to donate your eggs again, the clinic will require you to wait three months to donate again.Most clinics allow you to donate your eggs up to six times, as long as your donations are three months apart.

It can take some time to conceive after you stop birth control, so stay diligent.


Stop using condoms or spermicides as soon as you decide to get pregnant. Because these forms of birth control don’t use hormones, there may be no delay in getting pregnant.
Stop taking your birth control pills or have any devices such as IUDs removed.
Recognize that it can take up to six months for your cycle to become regular and for you to ovulate after stopping hormonal birth control.;
, You’re most like to get pregnant when you are ovulating. From monitoring cervical mucus to taking your basal temperature, watching your menstrual cycle can help you detect ovulation, which may increase your chances of conceiving.Many smartphones offer apps that can help you track your ovulation.

, A woman’s cervical mucus changes consistency depending on her cycle. Watching for differences in your cervical mucus may help you conceive more easily.Look for an increase in mucus and a change in consistency to thin and slippery around ovulation. Following ovulation, cervical mucous decreases, thickens, and is generally less noticeable.Be comfortable and extremely diligent when examining your cervical mucus to increase your chances of conceiving., Observe the “standard rule” that menstrual cycles average between 26 and 32 days for most women. Watching the calendar can help you figure out the days when you are most likely to conceive.Watch for changes in your cycle around day 14, which is the approximate day on which many women ovulate.Be aware that this can vary from person to person.
Consider enjoying sex more often between days 8 and 19 of your cycle to increase your chances of getting pregnant.Keep a small calendar with you so you can track the days of your cycle.

, Your basal body temperature, or your body’s temperature while fully resting, can increase slightly during ovulation. Take your temperature every day before you get out of bed in the morning to measure your basal temperature and increase your chances of conceiving.Use a thermometer specifically designed for taking basal temperature. You can get these at many pharmacies and medical supply stores.See if your basal temperature increases up to 1 degree Fahrenheit (.5 Celsius), which might indicate ovulation.Take your temperature right after you wake up and before you get out of bed as your baseline number. Make sure to continue measuring your temperature at the same time every day.Write your temperature down in a notebook and see if you notice any patterns.Most women are fertile in the two to three days before their temperature rises., If tracking mucus, days, or temperature feels like too much work to you, buy an ovulation predictor kit. These tests can predict ovulation or signal it before it happens.You can purchase an ovulation predictor kit at a pharmacy.
For most kits, you will need to start using the kit on day 10 of your cycle, but check the instructions that come with the product to be sure.
When it is time to start using the kit, you will urinate on the test stick to see if you might ovulating., They key to getting pregnant in most cases is to have sex. Aim to have sex a few times a week, which increases your chances of hitting one of your fertile days.Schedule sex with your partner if you find that you’re both busy. This might seem unromantic, but turn it into a date night or something that can help you get in the mood.
Be spontaneous as much as possible to keep things fun.
Have sex at least two to three times a week, which should be enough to hit one of your fertile periods.Have sex at least once a day near the time you ovulate to increase your chances of conceiving., Make healthy choices if you want to get pregnant. Maintaining a healthy diet and weight, exercising, and managing stress can increase your chances of conceiving and having a healthy pregnancy.Be aware that it can take you longer than normal to conceive naturally after 35. See a doctor if it takes you longer than 6 months to rule out fertility problems.Stick to a healthy and nutrient rich diet of about 2,000 calories a day, depending on how active you are.Incorporate foods from the five food groups.Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate cardio activity such as brisk walking and muscle strength training on two days of every week.Limit and manage anything that causes stress in your life.Avoid recreational drugs and tobacco products, which can prematurely age your eggs.Avoid or limit your alcohol intake as well. Studies have shown drinking can decrease your fertility.Take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of any pregnancy resulting in neural tube defects., If you’ve been trying to conceive naturally for six months or longer with no luck, schedule an appointment with your OB/GYN. She can run tests to determine if you have a fertility issue or recommend a specialist for high-risk pregnancies.Be open and honest with your doctor about what methods you’ve been using to increase your chances of conceiving.
Take any notes you’ve kept on your cycle.
Ask any questions you might have about conceiving or your chances for getting pregnant.

, There are a variety of reasons that may prevent you from conceiving naturally including structural issues with either the man or the woman.Determining what is impeding your ability to conceive can help your doctor formulate a more effective treatment plan and may also help you get pregnant. Undergo any tests your doctor might suggest for you and your partner including:


Semen analysis
Hormone testing
Ultrasound of the scrotum (for men) or uterus and fallopian tubes (for women)
Testicular biopsy
Genetic testing
Ovulation testing with blood
Imaging tests such as hysterosalpingography or hysterosonography., If your doctor determines that something specific is impeding your ability to conceive, treat the disorder. After receiving your treatment, speak to your doctor about resuming attempts to conceive naturally or use other methods such as in-vitro fertilization.Some treatments for infertility include:


Antibiotic treatment for infections of the reproductive tract
Medication or counseling for erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation
Hormone replacement
Surgery., The number of eggs a woman has decreases considerably after the age of 40. Your doctor may suggest taking medications to help restore your regular cycle and stimulate ovulation if your infertility is unexplained or other treatments haven’t corrected it.Take these medications to increase your chances of getting pregnant.Speak to your doctor about the best medication for you.She may suggest options such as clomiphene citrate (clomid or Serophene) or letrozole (Femara), which are considered safe drugs and are relatively inexpensive.Inject or ingest fertility drugs. They may cause nausea, insomnia, and headaches.Be aware that fertility drugs can result in multiple pregnancy or conditions such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which causes the ovaries to become painful and swollen., If you’re still having trouble conceiving following treatment, consider using one of the many forms of assisted reproductive technology available today.From in-vitro fertilization to gestational carrier, ARTs can greatly increase your chances of conceiving or having a baby to 5-10% per cycle.Some of the following ARTs may be available to you:


In-vitro fertilization (IVF), which is the most commonly used ART.This requires collecting eggs and sperm from the woman and man and then fertilizing them in a dish in a lab. After fertilization, the embryos are implanting into the woman.Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which a healthy sperm is injected into a mature egg.Donor eggs or sperm. Although most couples will use their own eggs and sperm, if there are serious problems with either the eggs or sperm, you can opt to use a known or anonymous donor egg or sperm.Gestational carrier. If you have some physical issue that impedes carrying a pregnancy but not conceiving, you can choose to have the embryo placed in the uterus of a woman who agrees to carry the baby."

Mark the first day of your last menstrual cycle on a calendar.,
Estimate date of ovulation at the middle of your cycle.,
Note which days you were sexually active around ovulation.",How to Estimate Date of Conception1," Most women have a 28-day cycle, which means they start bleeding every 28 days. The first day of bleeding is the date your cycle begins.If you do not know at least a general date of your last cycle, you cannot find your date of conception without visiting a doctor.
Cycles can be as short as 24 days or as long as 34 days in some women. Knowing the length of your cycle will be important when calculating ovulation.;
, You can only conceive when ovulating, but without daily testing for ovulation, there is no way to know for sure when it occurred. Doctors usually give a short range of dates surrounding the middle day of your cycle. If your cycle starts every 28 days, count backwards 14 days from the date bleeding began and mark it on the calendar.Women with a regular 28 day cycle can ovulate anywhere between the day 11 and day 21, but day 14 is the standard for estimation.If your cycle is 24 days, estimate ovulation at day 12. If your cycle is 30 days, ovulation probably occurred around day 16.If your cycle varies month to month, use the average to calculate your date of ovulation. For example, if one month your cycle starts again after 24 days, but the next month it lasts for 26, use 25 days as your cycle length.
Once the egg is released from the ovary it has a roughly 24-hour lifespan in which it can be fertilized.

, Since exact time of ovulation cannot be specified, knowing what days you had sex around the middle of your cycle can help you figure out when you conceived. Look at the week around your estimated ovulation date, and mark any in which you know you had intercourse.


Conception may have occurred on any of dates you had intercourse between day 11 and day 21 of your cycle depending on your date of ovulation.
Although you cannot get pregnant unless you are ovulating, sperm can live inside the body for up to five days. If you had intercourse in the five days before your estimated date of ovulation, it is possible sperm were still present when ovulation began and fertilized the egg."

Take your basal body temperature.,
Monitor any vaginal secretions.,
Notice mild abdominal cramping.,
Buy an ovulation kit.,
Test for pregnancy after you miss your period.",How to Estimate Date of Conception2," If you are trying to figure out exactly when you start ovulating so you can become pregnant, taking your temperature daily can help since some women have a slightly higher temperature when they ovulate — about 0.2 to 1°F higher. Using a basal thermometer, take your temperature every morning before getting out of bed. Plot your temperature on a calendar for a month or two and look for a pattern.You are most fertile two to three days before ovulation begins, so count the days between the first day of your last cycle and the day your temperature increased. Use this number to figure out your likely next date of ovulation, and count back three days to find the best time to engage in intercourse.
If your cycle is different from month-to-month, you may need to track for several months to find an average or a bigger pattern to know your likely date of ovulation.
Be sure to use a thermometer specifically designed to find basal temperature, or your body’s resting temperature. Also take it as soon as you wake up, before you begin moving around. Keep your thermometer on your nightstand to make it easy to reach from bed.

, Some women experience an increase in clear vaginal secretions, resembling raw egg whites, right before ovulation. It might be difficult to notice unless you are looking for it and comparing secretions every day.Mark dates on a calendar that you notice any secretions. Use one symbol or color for any you consider “normal,” meaning frequently the same amount, color and texture, and any days you notice more or different secretions.
If there is a day or two you when have higher secretion levels or they resemble egg whites, assume your date of ovulation is the next day or so after that. Use this information to decide when it is best to have sex over the coming month.

, Some women experience mild cramping when they ovulate. If you can’t find your basal temperature, or don’t show a pattern of increasing temperature around the same time every month, start charting any abdominal discomfort you feel. There may be a pattern here to show when you usually ovulate.For a month, mark every day on a calendar that you have any abdominal discomfort. Afterwards, look over the dates. If there were a couple days in the middle of your cycle during which you had mild cramping, this is likely when you ovulated.
Use the number of days in-between your last period and cramping to determine the best days to have sex in the coming month.

, Available as an over-the-counter test, this kit helps you monitor your urine for an increase in hormones that occurs most often right before ovulation. As soon as you are alerted to an increase, have sex daily until the hormones decrease again., Pregnancy begins when a fertilized egg starts to grow and attaches to the lining of your uterus. This can happen six days after fertilization (or your date of ovulation) and may take up to four days to complete. The best time to start testing is a few days after your period would normally start.No matter the length of your menstrual cycle, do not start testing until you have missed your period. If you test any earlier you are more likely to get a false negative.
A negative test doesn’t mean you aren’t capable of getting pregnant, or that an egg wasn’t fertilized, just that it didn’t finish attaching before your menstrual cycle progressed.

Schedule an ultrasound.,
Ask for a physical exam.",How to Estimate Date of Conception3," A doctor can determine the baby’s gestational age with an ultrasound by measuring the either the fetus' gestational sac, or the embryo or fetus, depending on stage of the pregnancy. Gestational age, considered the age of the baby, is determined based on the last menstrual cycle rather than conception. Subtracting two weeks from the gestational age will therefore give you a likely time of conception.Gestational age (the age of the baby) can be measured by ultrasound as early as five or six weeks after your last menstrual cycle, and is easier to estimate between weeks eight and 18, since most babies grow at the same rate during this time.Your doctor takes measurements to determine how old the baby is based on size.
Estimating conception with the help of ultrasound is not foolproof. If you know the date of your last cycle and the gestational date determined by ultrasound is less than a week different, doctors still use your cycle date to predict when the baby will be born.
An embryo may develop a heartbeat as early as six weeks after fertilization and the heart is formed by week eight. During the second month of pregnancy, symptoms such as breast tenderness, nausea and vomiting, heartburn, and frequent urination begin. See a doctor as soon as possible if you notice one or more of these symptoms to best estimate your date of conception with an ultrasound., If you do not know when your cycle started and don’t have access to or can’t get an ultrasound, a doctor can determine length of pregnancy around the 12th week by detecting if the uterus has grown over the pubic bone.This is the least reliable method and is only used to determine gestational age if the other two aren’t available.

Think outside the box.,
Consider a shared/split egg donor IVF cycle.,
Pursue frozen eggs.,
Look for grants.,
Advocate for insurance coverage.,
Travel abroad.",How to Find Affordable Options for Egg Donor IVF," A simple internet search for ""Donor Egg IVF"", ""Donor Egg Bank"" or ""Shared Egg Donation"" will populate millions of options.;
, In this method, either an anonymous or chosen egg donor are possibilities. You can then share this donor's eggs with another IVF patient or Egg Bank. Essentially, the results are in the title of the procedure: figure you will save around half overall- but remember, you will only receive a portion of the eggs retrieved. (The good news is, a young, healthy donor averages 16 eggs- and 8 certainly is enough!)

, Cryogenically frozen eggs are now gaining popularity. Although this is still considered a relatively new option, early data is showing pregnancy rates around 40%. Clinics all over have various options for clients. The most common is a ""lot"" of 5 frozen eggs for $18,500; however clinics are catching on quick and starting to offer ""split/shared frozen eggs,"" too. Remember, it just takes one!

, This is the least likely to occur for essentially every patient, but occasionally, clinics offer a grant, or even one free cycle, to a lucky patient. Additionally, there are a handful of organizations that offer financial assistance for IVF treatments.

, Currently only 15 states have mandated coverage for fertility treatments, with varying limitations. One in six couples face infertility, and this does not include the most obvious in need of an egg donor, same sex couples. The squeaky wheel gets the grease- so start writing letters!

, Numerous countries around the world offer egg donation IVF cycles to foreign patients with in most cases huge cost savings. Again, an internet search can provide more information on country options, including Czech Republic, South Africa, Spain, Greece, Peoples Republic of Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Thailand, Guatemala, Mexico, Barbados, Panama, Brazil, Uganda, and India. The average cycle total ranges from USD $3,400 to $11,100, internationally - much cheaper than the US range.

Be aware that having a balanced, healthy diet does not guarantee higher fertility.,
Keep in mind fertility diets may only work for a small subsection of women.,
Talk to your doctor about your fertility treatment options.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Take a folic acid supplement if you have irregular periods.,
Keep your insulin levels down by eating a heart-healthy diet.,
Avoid trans fats.,
Consume more complex carbohydrates.Focus on eating complex carbohydrates that contain fiber, like fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains.",How to Eat to Improve Fertility," There are many online sources and several books that claim that switching to a more balanced and healthy diet can lead to improved fertility. Though it is always beneficial to eat a healthy diet, it should not replace other fertility treatments and options. However, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle may reduce a woman's risk of irregular ovulation and could improve her chances of getting pregnant.

, During the scientific study of fertility diets, the trials were focused on a specific condition found in infertile women: ovulatory dysfunction, or irregular ovulation. Women who have ovulatory dysfunction may benefit from adjustments to their diet if they want to try to get pregnant.For example, one study done by the Nurses’ Health Study tested over 18,000 women who were trying to get pregnant over an eight-year period. Only about 400 of these women were diagnosed with infertility related to irregular ovulation. Thus, the study linking nutrition and fertility was in fact only based on a very small number of women in the test group and may not be applicable to women who do not have irregular ovulation., Before you try a fertility diet, speak to your physician about other medical options to treat fertility issues or infertility. There are several certified medical procedures to help you get pregnant, as well as other options to help improve your chances of getting pregnant.You may be a good candidate for fertility drugs that will help regulate your ovulation. Your doctor may also suggest in vitro fertilization, intrauterine insemination, embryo testing, or reproductive immunology.

, If you are overweight or underweight, your natural hormone levels could be thrown off, and this could lead to irregular or suppressed ovulation. Focus on maintaining a weight that is considered healthy for your height and body type.If you have health issues like a thyroid problem, talk to your doctor about your treatment options. Try to avoid unnecessary weight gain to prevent irregular ovulation.
If you are overweight, losing just 5% of your body weight -- around 10 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds -- can help increase blood flow to your reproductive organs and boost your fertility., Folic acid is an essential nutrient for pregnant women and it can help to improve your chances of conceiving if you have irregular ovulation. However, only take the prescribed dosage of folic acid and maintain a healthy weight as well to keep your ovulation regular and consistent.One major study of the effects of folic acid on women found that taking folic acid supplements can lead to a higher conception level and a higher likelihood of having twins.
Men can also benefit from folic acid supplements, as these can help to improve the quality of sperm., The insulin levels in your body can affect your sex-hormone binding globulin. This can then affect the amount of free androgen in your body, if you are a woman. Having too much free androgen can suppress your ovulation. Based on this logic, a heart-healthy diet can help to reduce your insulin levels and possibly lead to improved fertility. Low insulin levels can also benefit fertility in men as it can affect the quality of the sperm in men.A heart-healthy diet consists of:Little to no red meat. The women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study who had the highest intake of animal protein such as red meat had 39% more ovulatory infertility than women who ate lower amounts of animal protein. Some nutritionists also claim an excessive intake of animal protein could affect the sperm quality in a man.
A higher quantity of beans, nuts, legumes, and tempeh. Plant-based proteins like beans and other legumes, tempeh, and nuts will give your body lots of iron and folate. Both of these nutrients can help encourage egg development and ovulation.
A small amount of full-fat dairy. Overall, the healthy heart diet advises a low dairy intake, but a small amount of full-fat dairy by consuming yogurt, milk, or cheese, may improve your fertility. The participants in the Nurses’ Health Study who ate one to two servings of full-fat dairy had better ovulation than those who ate fat-free dairy. Some research suggests fat-free milk changes the balance of sex hormones in women, which can in turn affect their ovulation., Trans fat are often found in prepackaged baked goods, fried foods, junk foods, and some animal products can increase your body’s ability to produce insulin. Having high insulin levels can cause metabolic disturbances that may also affect your ovulation., It takes your body more time to digest complex carbs so they have a more gradual effect on your blood sugar and your insulin levels. Some studies have shown women who have diets high in less complex carbs like cookies, cakes, white bread and white rice are 92% more likely to have ovulation fertility issues than women who had diets high in complex carbs.

Pass the screening and interview process first.,
Make an effort to provide a good sample.,
Learn some tips to ejaculate while in clinical settings.",How to Donate Sperm," Sperm banks and fertility clinics screen for health issues and sexual preference, or at least sexual practices. Men who have hereditary diseases are excluded, as are those with chronic debilitating diseases (such as diabetes, cancer or chronic fatigue), due to the negative impact on sperm production and motility. You also cannot have any exposure to the following infectious diseases: HIV, hepatitis B and C, HTLV, syphilis, genital herpes and/or genital warts.Heterosexuality matters because homosexual men (or those who engage in same-sex practices occasionally) are at much higher risks of being exposed to or infected with STDs and various other pathogenic viruses and bacteria. Blood samples are routinely taken for examination prior to acceptance.

At sperm banks, sperm health is often defined as a sperm count of at least 70 million/ml, at least 70% motility and at least 60% normal in appearance (morphology).As a general rule, sperm health in sperm donors needs to be better than average because some sperm die or lose their motility in the freezing and thawing processes.
Common hereditary diseases include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia and inflammatory arthritis.;
, Although sperm banks and fertility clinics all have slightly different policies in terms of sperm donor qualifications, almost all require that you be younger than 40 years old.Some men produce completely healthy sperm beyond the age of 40, but many have lower sperm counts and reduced sperm motility, which makes it less likely to lead to impregnation. Lifestyle, diet and overall health are sometimes better indicators of sperm health than chronological age.


The age limit for some facilities can be as low as 35 years.
At the other end of the spectrum, the minimum age requirement is usually either 19 or 20 years.
Male sperm donors are usually paid between $50-100 USD per viable sample.

, In addition to age, there are height restrictions of who can donate sperm in the U.S. and many other countries. Shorter men don't have more issues with their sperm compared to tall men, but the recipients of the sperm almost always request taller donors, so the sperm banks and fertility clinic comply with their wishes. Many facilities require that their sperm donors be between 5'10"" and 6'2"", although others maintain that you must be at least 5'9"" to qualify — the average height for American men. Short height is often a function of genetics, although environmental factors (poor nutrition as a child, infections, exposure to toxins) can play a significant role also.
Taller children tend to fit in better among their peers (assuming they're not giants) and eventually have a higher probability of success with dating, marriage and mating., Obviously many men who don't attend university or college are highly intelligent or even geniuses, but almost all sperm banks and fertility clinics require proof of enrollment or completion of post-secondary education.In fact, some sperm banks only accept donors who are graduates of Ivy League schools and then market that information to justify their higher costs. Regardless, if you are not formerly educated in some capacity, there's virtually no chance of being accepted as a sperm donor.


Perhaps interestingly, university and college grades or performance almost never matter to sperm banks or fertility clinics (nor other achievements that require intelligence), it's just the admission and/or completion of a program that matter.
Between 50-80% percent of sperm within a sample of ejaculate do not survive the freezing process at sperm banks and fertility clinics., Almost no sperm banks or fertility clinics accept donors who are intent on going through the process only once. Instead, most want a commitment in terms of frequency of visits (weekly or bi-weekly) and time (1-year contracts are common).Most companies feel that commitment to their timetables represents stability, plus they have the opportunity to monitor and compare sperm samples for quality and evidence of poor health or bad lifestyle changes. For example, blood and sperm samples are routinely screened for illicit drug use, which can alter and damage sperm.


All sorts of hair and eye colors are encouraged, with the possible exception of red hair at some clinics. It appears that people who buy donated sperm prefer red hair the least.
Because Caucasian (light-skinned people) tend to use donated sperm the most, Caucasian sperm donors represent the majority. However, in some geographic markets, African Americans and Asian Americans may be in high demand., After meeting the initial requirements of age, height, health and sexual practices, sperm donor candidates then progress to the screening and interview process in order to substantiate their claims and get a better feel for their personality and willingness to make a commitment If you haven't already filled one out, you'll need to complete a thorough medical history questionnaire of not just your own, but also your immediate family. The questionnaire is followed sometimes by a personal interview and then blood and semen samples. If accepted a legally binding contract has to be signed.


People who are adopted are often disqualified from being a sperm donor because their family history cannot be substantiated or verified.
Mental health can also sometimes be an issue because some conditions, such as schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, may have genetic links.
Sometimes multiple samples are needed to best establish sperm count and motility rates.

, Because your sperm count, motility and overall morphology is a crucial aspect of being accepted as a sperm donor, take it seriously and try to give the best sample you can. Donors are typically asked to abstain from ejaculation (from sex or masturbation) for at least 2 days (sometimes up to 5 days) before giving a sperm sample in order to get the highest counts possible.Prior to giving a sperm sample, get a good night's sleep, avoid alcohol and cigarette smoke, drink plenty of water and eat a nutritious meal.


Supplements that can help improve the health of your sperm include zinc, selenium, folic acid, vitamin E and L-carnitine.
Most sperm banks and fertility clinics ask for weekly sperm deposits because it can take as many as 8 inseminations for a woman to become pregnant., To ensure that it's your sperm sample, most sperm banks and fertility clinics require you to ejaculate while in their premises. Clinical settings are not known for their sexual atmosphere, so you'll have to learn to control your feelings of nervousness / awkwardness and rely more on your imagination. Most facilities provide pornographic material to increase arousal, but the increasing usage of porn in the U.S. has dulled many men to its effects.Furthermore, you can't use any lubricants (even saliva or water) to masturbate due to their potentially negative effects on sperm health. As such, rely on vivid sexual imagery in your own head and consider bringing to the clinic a device that stimulates your genitals in some capacity, such as vibrator.


After the initial STD screening, sperm samples are quarantined and typically frozen for 6 months. Then, before use, the sperm sample is tested again to ensure safety from pathogens.
Sperm banks tend to be very protective of its donors' rights and confidentiality, and they have no legal rights or responsibilities for kids conceived from their sperm.

Most women who miscarry go on to have healthy pregnancies afterwards. A miscarriage probably does not mean that you won’t be able to have a baby.

, Many miscarriages occur because the baby wasn’t developing properly. This can occur for several reasons either arising from the genetic makeup of the fetus or from the mother’s health.Genetic disorders in the fetus. These can be either inherited problems or problems occurring in that particular egg and sperm.

, Some diseases can increase your risk of miscarriage, though many of these diseases can be prevented through simple vaccinations. If you are unsure of your vaccination history, check your vaccination record.


You may need to undergo blood testing to determine whether or not you received certain vaccinations as a child.
It is best to get vaccinated before you plan to conceive, so check your record early.

, Thyroid disease, epilepsy, and lupus are thought to increase the risk of miscarriage, though it is entirely likely that you can still have a healthy baby if you have one of these diseases. Be sure to disclose your family disease history to your doctor., You should begin this dosage one to two months before you plan to conceive. Folic acid helps to reduce the chance that your baby will be born with birth defects.

Identify the key stages of your menstrual cycle.,
Be aware of the fertility period or the fertility window.,
Determine if you have regular periods.,
Check if your periods are irregular.,
Use the duration of your menstrual cycle to identify your fertility window.,
Check your body temperature or use an ovulation predictor kit if you have irregular periods.,
Have sexual intercourse during your fertility window.",How to Determine Your Most Fertile Day to Conceive," Your menstrual cycle occurs in several stages, but this does not mean you are fertile throughout your entire menstrual cycle, or period. In fact, it is a myth that a woman can get pregnant throughout her entire menstrual cycle. Instead, you can only get pregnant on your most fertile days, before and during ovulation. Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from your ovary, and moves down your fallopian tube so it can be fertilized by the sperm. The phases of your menstrual cycle are:Menstruation, which begins your menstrual cycle.It happens when your body eliminates the thickened lining of your uterus from your body through the vagina. This causes bleeding during your period, and generally lasts between 3-7 days. It also marks the first day of the follicular phase, which stimulates the growth of follicles, which contain eggs. This phase ends when ovulation occurs. The follicular phase usually lasts 13-14 days, but it can range between 11-21 days.
The ovulatory phase happens when the level of luteinizing hormone rises dramatically. This stimulates the release of an egg. This phase is short, usually lasting only about 16-32 hours, and ends when the body releases the egg.The luteal phase begins after ovulation and continues until the beginning of your next period. It prepares your uterus in case an egg becomes fertilized and implants in the uterine wall. This phase usually starts around 14 days into your cycle and lasts about 14 days.;
, This is the time in your menstrual cycle where you are the most likely to get pregnant from having sexual intercourse. For most women, their fertility window will last about six days.


Keep in mind having intercourse during your fertile period does not guarantee you will conceive. But your chances of becoming pregnant increase dramatically if you have sex during the 5 days before ovulation and the 24 hours after ovulation. Healthy, fertile young couples usually have a 20-37% chance of becoming pregnant using this window.

, Every woman’s cycle is different and may shift or vary due to external factors like stress. The best way to determine if your period is regular, in that it occurs every month close to the same time every month, is to chart how long it lasts for three to four months.


Mark your calendar on the first day of your period. Label it Day One. Then, count each day until your next period arrives. Keep in mind the average menstrual cycle is 28 days long; however, your cycle may range from 21 to 35 days.
Do this for three to four months. Note if your cycles are the same length every month.

, If after three to four months of tracking your menstrual cycle, no pattern emerges, you may have an irregular period. This happens to many women and can be due to factors like extreme weight loss, increased physical activity, stress, or a more serious medical issue. Talk to your doctor if you experience irregular periods to rule out any serious medical conditions. Women with irregular periods can still track their fertility window, it may just take more time and effort than for women with regular periods.Speak to your doctor if your period does not occur for 90 days or more and you are not pregnant. If your periods become irregular after being regular, or you bleed between periods, you should talk to your doctor to ensure you do not have a hormonal disorder, an infection in your reproductive organs, or other health condition., If your periods are regular, you can identify your fertility window based on how long your period typically lasts. Your fertility window will be the six days leading up to and including ovulation. But your most fertile days will be the three days leading up to and including ovulation. Use the duration of your menstrual cycle to identify your most fertile time by subtracting 14 days from the total length of your menstrual cycle:28 day periods: If your period typically lasts 28 days, ovulation will occur on day 14 of your cycle. So your most fertile days will be days 12, 13, and 14.
35 day periods: If you have a longer menstrual cycle, ovulation will occur on day 21 and your most fertile days will be days 19, 20, and 21.
21 day periods: If you have a shorter menstrual cycle, ovulation will occur on day 7 and your most fertile days are days 5, 6, and 7.
If your menstrual cycle is regular, but it does not fall within these periods, you can use an online fertility calculator to determine your fertility window. All you need is the first day of your last period., If you tend to have irregular periods, or if you feel your period may be off, you can use other methods to determine when you are ovulating:Keep track of your body temperature. During ovulation, your body temperature will increase. See if you are experiencing a “thermal shift” by taking your temperature every morning at the same time. Most women will experience a body temperature shift about half a degree 24 to 48 hours after ovulation. You can use a regular thermometer or buy a special basal body temperature thermometer.
Get an ovulation predictor kit. Look for an ovulation predictor kit at your local drugstore. Though it is a more expensive option that tracking your temperature, it may be a more accurate way of pinpointing when you are ovulating. This kit will test your urine to determine the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. You will need to urinate on tester sticks to find out when your LH levels are rising. This is a sign that one of your ovaries is about to release an egg, or that you are about to ovulate.
Look for changes in your cervical mucus. During the time in your cycle before ovulation, your body will produce large quantities of thin, clear cervical mucus. This substance smooths the way for the sperm to meet the egg. Right before you start ovulating, you may notice mucus on your underwear or around your vagina. It will appear clear, stretchy, and slippery, like raw egg whites. You can collect a sample of your cervical mucus by gently wiping your vaginal opening with a piece of tissue or a clean finger. If you check for cervical mucus several times on one day and don’t see any mucus, you are likely not in the fertile period of your cycle.

, Most doctors will advise you to have sex with your partner every day or every other day about five days before ovulation and through to the day after you ovulate. While sperm can live up to five days inside a woman’s body, an egg’s life span is only 12 to 24 hours, so having intercourse before you ovulate and the day of and the day after you ovulate can maximize your chances of conceiving.Focus on having intercourse within your fertility window, or three to five days before you ovulate. If you wait to have intercourse when you have already started ovulating, by the time the sperm enters your body, it may be too late to fertilize your eggs.
If you are under 35 years old and have been having intercourse during your fertility window for 12 months to no avail, or if you are 35 years and older and have been timing intercourse during your fertility window for six months to no avail, you may want to talk to your doctor about a fertility evaluation. You and your partner can take fertility tests to determine if there are other issues that are preventing you from getting pregnant.

Understand the biology of your body.,
Track your fertility with an ovulation kit or fertility awareness method.,
Discuss your wish to determine your fertility with a health professional.,
Consider more rigorous fertility testing methods.",How to Determine Fertility," Most women are only fertile for a few days out of every menstrual cycle.


During ovulation, when the ovaries release an egg, your body has a short window during which the egg can be fertilized. For this period of time, you are considered fertile, and conception is possible.
Sperm can survive in a woman’s reproductive tract for up to five days, meaning you could potentially become pregnant from intercourse that took place prior to ovulation if the mucus conditions in your body are receptive.
If you track your menstrual cycle with the sympto-thermal or basal body temperature methods, you will notice your morning body temperature dips slightly during ovulation and spikes directly afterward. In addition, your cervix will be high, soft, moist, and open. You may notice breast tenderness and other physical signs, such as slight spotting, cramping, or abdominal bloating.
Your body will secrete a clear, stretchy, slippery mucus when you are most fertile and you will notice greater natural lubrication during intercourse. Many women also experience a greater desire for sexual intercourse during ovulation.;
, Natural family planning, the sympto-thermal method, basal body temperature tracking, the Billings Method, and other fertility awareness processes involve regular tracking of your monthly cycle and can help you determine your most fertile days every month.


Fertility awareness methods are hormone-free ways of managing fertility. Although many methods require several months of regular charting and coaching before you become confident or familiar with tracking your symptoms, they can be highly effective at pinpointing ovulation to help you achieve or avoid pregnancy. When used consistently and correctly, they can predict fertility with as much as 99% accuracy.
Natural fertility awareness methods are often taught at hospitals, health clinics, churches, fertility centers, and gynecologist offices. They are significantly more precise and detailed than the “rhythm method,” and are typically free or low-cost methods for determining fertility. In addition, they are accepted by many religions that otherwise reject contraception. The methods typically require multiple training sessions, a thermometer, and a paper calendar or chart for tracking your symptoms.
Fertility awareness tracking has no associated risks, but it cannot protect you from sexually transmitted infections. Similarly, if you are trying to avoid pregnancy you must abstain during your most fertile period or use an alternate method of birth control to prevent conception when you perceive symptoms of fertility.
If you do not wish to chart your physical symptoms to determine ovulation, you can use commercial ovulation calculators or test kits to attempt to determine your fertility. These over-the-counter tests can predict ovulation very accurately when used correctly, but can become expensive if used on a regular basis for determining fertility.

,


If you are trying to conceive and have used a fertility awareness method for over 6 months without luck, discuss your situation with a fertility specialist or your primary care provider. There may be simple changes you can make – such as having intercourse once per day on each of your fertile days – that may help you achieve pregnancy.
In some cases, occupational, dietary, or physical conditions may make determination of fertility difficult, even if you are using a fertility awareness method or ovulation kit correctly and regularly. Your physician may have advice for limiting your exposure to some medications, certain chemicals, physically demanding exercises, or unique dietary items to aid in determining your fertility. In some cases, simple changes in nutrition, physical activity, sleep or medication habits, or sexual activity can make it easier to determine fertility.
If you are correctly tracking your fertility and you are unable to conceive, your physician may discuss the possibility of changing some of your partner’s habits. In some cases, constrictive clothing or regular heat exposure in the groin area may make men temporarily less fertile. Simple changes may be all that is necessary to help you both reach your fertility potential.

, Be aware that not all medical fertility tests are conclusive, and many can be invasive. The tests may last several months and do not always help determine fertility or specific causes of infertility.


Fertility testing can be expensive and stressful. Discuss the pros and cons of fertility testing with your health care provider and make sure you are ready for extensive tests. In some cases, your doctor may recommend additional time tracking your fertility and targeting intercourse, as well as making dietary and lifestyle changes, before suggesting formal fertility testing.
Ask your insurance provider if fertility testing is covered under your plan. Many insurance agencies do not pay for fertility testing or fertility enhancement, so be sure you are emotionally and financially prepared for large potential out-of-pocket expenses and that your partner is equally eager to determine fertility for the purpose of conceiving.
Consult an experienced fertility specialist and request a fertility counseling session before beginning tests. This will help you and your partner know what to expect from the tests and what will be required of you both.
Adhere to the specialist’s instructions precisely when attempting to determine fertility through additional tests. Also, be prepared to discuss your sexual, dietary, and physical activity habits with your fertility specialist on a regular basis. Tests range from simple blood draws and sperm samples to ultrasounds and invasive extraction of eggs.

Make an appointment before conception.,
Check your blood type.,
Look for imbalanced hormones.,
Take a look at your chromosome.,
Talk about current medications.",How to Prevent Recurrent Miscarriages1," Before you start trying to conceive, talk to your obstetrician about any trouble you may have had carrying a pregnancy to term in the past. Ask them about testing and lab work options so that they can check for things like chromosomal abnormalities, high androgen levels, or other factors that may lead to miscarriages.The many variable causes of miscarriages mean that there is no set panel of tests that will be done. Speak openly and honestly about your medical history, family history, and your efforts to become a parent so that your doctor can suggest appropriate testing and potential treatment options.
Let your doctor know, ""I have a history of certain medical conditions and I would like to discuss whether these impact my current efforts to try and have a baby.""
If you have a history of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or other conditions that specifically impact your reproductive organs, let your doctor know, ""I have an ongoing effort to manage a condition that impacts my reproductive health. How might this impact my ability to carry a baby?"";
, If you have blood type that tests negative for the Rh-factor, you may need a low dose of RhoGAM. This may help prevent problems with future pregnancies where Rh incompatibility is a factor.RhoGAM is administered b injection, and is generally only used with mothers who have Rh-negative blood types carrying a child with an Rh-positive blood type.

, Hormone imbalance may manifest in a number of ways, including through conditions such as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, and Endometriosis. If you know you’ve had problems with these conditions in the past, or if you suspect you may have problems relating to your thyroid or adrenal gland, ask your doctor to check your hormone levels.Some signs of hormonal imbalance may include weight gain, irritability, abnormally heavy periods, irregular periods, missed periods, headaches, back pains, and more.Some hormonal imbalances may be treated with medication or with supervised therapy from your doctor.
Ask about hormone support. One of the factors causing early miscarriage may be a lack of progesterone. A progesterone hormone in the form of injection or tablets in the first three months of pregnancy may help. However, this technique is based on older studies. Newer research does not indicate that this treatment is effective.

, Repeated miscarriages may be due to chromosomal abnormalities. There are a number of types of chromosomal abnormalities that may impact pregnancy, some of which are easier to address than others. Ask your doctor about chromosomal analysis to help you determine if this may underpin your recurrent miscarriages.This analysis may be done on you and your partner.


Be aware that some forms of testing may require you save tissue from your miscarriage in order to run the analysis.Know that many chromosome problems are unavoidable, and may be unpredictable and untreatable.

, Talk with your obstetrician about any medications prescribed by your general practitioner, as well as any over-the-counter drugs you may use, including vitamins and herbal supplements. Ensure that these are safe for you to use while trying to conceive and during pregnancy.Don't wait for your doctor to ask. Tell them outright, ""I am on these medications by prescription of my general practitioner, and these are the over the counter drugs I use regularly. Might any of them impact my ability to successfully carry my child?""
Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen while trying to conceive or while pregnant. Stick to acetaminophen as a pain reliever during this time.

It is important to note, however, that not all missed or delayed periods are the result of pregnancy. Also, some women may experience mild bleeding during pregnancy. If this is the case for you, consult your doctor about what level of bleeding might pose a concern. If you have missed your period, evaluate whether this may be due to non-pregnancy related reasons such as:


Gaining or losing a great deal of weight.
Non-pregnancy related hormone problems.
Fatigue.
Stress.
Recently ending a prescription for birth control pills.Breastfeeding.;
, Ten to 14 days following conception, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the wall of a woman's uterus. This process can cause minor spotting and cramping. This is called implantation bleeding, and it is easily mistaken for premenstrual symptoms. If you suspect you may be pregnant, keep track of these symptoms and watch to see if they develop into a full-fledged menstrual cycle. If they don't, you may be pregnant., Many women begin to experience an increased volume of white, milky vaginal discharge almost immediately following conception. This harmless discharge is caused by an increase in the growth of the cells lining your vagina, and may continue throughout pregnancy. Often, women experience varying levels of discharge over the course of a normal menstrual cycle. If you notice changes or a new degree of persistence in the level of discharge you experience, you may be pregnant.Contact your doctor if the color of your discharge changes and is accompanied by a smell, pain, or an itching or burning sensation; these symptoms are signs of a yeast or bacterial infection and they may also indicate an STD like trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia.

, Your basal body temperature -- your temperature when you first wake up in the morning -- rises during the last two weeks of your menstrual cycle and then drops once your period begins. If you've been tracking your basal body temperature as part of an attempt to get pregnant, watch to see if your temperature remains elevated. If it does, it may be a sign of pregnancy."

Minimize smoking and drinking.,
Take supplements.,
Get enough rest.,
Cut down on caffeine.",How to Prevent Recurrent Miscarriages2," Smoking and consumption of alcohol is not only frowned upon during pregnancy. Women trying to become pregnant are advised to abstain from smoking and drinking during the conception process.It is also advisable for women to stay away from any illicit drug use while trying to carry a pregnancy to term.
Quitting smoking is a long-term process, but many women have found a combination of nicotine reduction supplements such as the gum or the patch and community support groups either online or in person helpful tools in their struggle to quit., Certain supplements may be beneficial for women trying to maintain a healthy pregnancy. Consult with a medical professional before beginning any course of supplements and ask your doctor for advice on dosages.Supplements for women who are already pregnant include folic acid and prenatal vitamins that contain folic acid, calcium, iron, and Vitamin D.Taking a multivitamin that is not formulated for the needs of pregnancy is not advised as it may provide improper nutrients for the mother and child., Rest is crucial. Sleep as much as your body tells you is necessary, and adhere to bed rest if it is recommended by your doctor. If you suspect any complications due to over-activity, especially where you've had recurrent miscarriages, seek medical help immediately.


An extra 45 minutes to an hour of sleep per night is recommended during the first trimester.Getting eight restful hours of sleep during the second trimester is recommended. This may be difficult, however, as the second trimester often sees the start of nighttime indigestion and poor sleeping patterns.It is advisable for women in the third trimester to rest whenever they feel fatigued, as sleep patterns may become irregular due to discomfort at this time. Naps and regular bed rest are advised., When trying to conceive and during pregnancy, it is recommended that you keep your caffeine intake under 200 milligrams per day. This includes coffee, tea, and soda. You can try decaf versions of your favorite drink or even try ""herbal coffees"", which are caffeine-free tea drinks that imitate coffee flavor.


If you are trying to become pregnant, try gradually cutting back so that you don’t shock your system by going cold turkey after conception.Remember to look for caffeine in more than just beverages. It can also be found in chocolate and even certain over-the-counter medications such as those meant for treating headaches."

Avoid self-blame.,
Seek community support.,
Turn to friends and family.,
Reduce your stress.,
Watch for depression and anxiety.",How to Prevent Recurrent Miscarriages3," Do not cause undue stress on yourself as you try for your child by blaming yourself or feeling guilty. Many of the factors that cause miscarriages are unpredictable and unavoidable. Know that these circumstances are not your fault.


Depending upon the criteria used, between ten and thirty percent of pregnancies are thought to end in miscarriage. Miscarrying does not automatically indicate that something is wrong biologically, or that you will never be able to carry a pregnancy to term., Recurrent miscarriages can cause stress and heartache that may bring about some stress-management techniques and lifestyle choices that are not optimal in the long run. Look for a supportive community, instead, to help you deal with the stress and pain in a more healthful way.Ask your doctor about local support groups for mothers dealing with miscarriages or struggling to conceive.
Look at online forums and message boards to get advice from and exchange stories with others going through similar hardships.
If you have the means, consider finding a therapist or a counselor that deals specifically with family planning.

, Some may find it difficult to talk with those closest to them about their miscarriage, but seeking support from friends and family ultimately lets you feel uplifted by those closest to you, and may even provide some information to help you down the road.


Let your friends know that you are going through a difficult time, and ask them to be sensitive to this matter. Try saying, ""I'm dealing the emotional aftermath of a miscarriage and I really need your friendship and support right now.""
Ask your friends if any of them have dealt with similar situations, and what, if anything, helped them overcome.
Let your family know, and use that as an opportunity to ask about whether any of your female relatives have a history of miscarriages, as well. This may point to something hereditary rather than an individual anomaly or a lifestyle issue.

, There is no evidence that stress levels cause miscarriages in and of themselves, but stress does impact hormone levels, which can contribute to your baby's overall health in utero.Remove stressful influences from your life. If a person tends to cause you undue stress, let them know that you cannot handle that at the moment. If your work causes you excess stress, tell your supervisor, ""I fear that the stressful environment here may be impacting my health, and I would like to speak with you about creating a more stress-free environment.""
Calm yourself during a stressful situation by taking ten minutes to deep breathe or perform a body scan. Start by relaxing the muscles in your toes, and work your way up one body part at a time until you reach the top of your head.Don't be afraid to walk away. When your main focus is getting yourself ready for your future child, there is no shame in saying that you can't do or take on more in that moment. Walk away from things that seem like too much at the moment.

, Women who experience recurrent miscarriages are at risk for depression and anxiety, two mental health issues that may impact your will to continue trying to build your family. If you notice symptoms of either, consult your doctor immediately to see if referral to a mental health professional is advisable.Symptoms of depression include a feeling of sadness, feeling empty or hopeless, angry outbursts, loss of interest in daily activity, change in appetite, feelings of guilt, trouble concentrating, and more.Symptoms of anxiety include feeling nervous or restless, a sense of impending doom, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, fatigue, trouble sleeping, uncontrollable worry, and more."

Consider any changes in your breasts.,
Determine whether you're feeling nauseous.,
Note increased fatigue.,
Evaluate whether you're urinating more frequently.,
Assess whether you feel constipated.,
Gauge your mood.,
Note if you're feeling more dizzy -- or fainting.",How to Determine if You Are Pregnant2," Rapidly changing hormone levels may cause your breasts to become swollen, sore, or tingly as soon as one to two weeks into a pregnancy. They may feel heavier or fuller, or tender to the touch. The area around your nipples, called the areola, may also darken or grow in size., Nausea, often referred to as ""morning sickness,"" affects 70 to 85 percent of pregnant women.Despite the ""morning sickness"" label, nausea can occur at any time of day, though morning is most common. The exact cause of this common symptom is unknown, but pregnancy hormones likely play a leading role. You may find yourself craving (or repulsed by) certain foods. You may also find yourself more sensitive to smells.If you find yourself experiencing this symptom, you may experience relief around weeks 13 or 14. Unfortunately, however, some women do experience nausea throughout their pregnancy.You may lessen your symptoms by using a variety of tactics:


Eat small, frequent meals. While this may seem counterintuitive, eating something may actually help to calm your stomach.
Rest as much as you can.
Choose bland foods without strong smells. Saltine crackers, oyster crackers, or unsweetened dry cereals may be good choices for snacks.
Drink ginger tea or suck on ginger candies., Pregnancy may make you feel more tired as soon as one week following conception. Pregnancy hormones will direct your body to start increasing its blood volume so you can provide for both you and your baby. This can lower your blood pressure and your blood sugar levels -- and leave you feeling exhausted., Pregnancy causes your kidneys to work harder. Your increased blood volume means they must filter extra fluid. As a result, even early in pregnancy you may find yourself making extra trips to the bathroom.


If you have a burning sensation with urination, then this may be a sign of infection.

, Pregnancy hormones slow your digestive cycle so that additional nutrients can reach the fetus. Hormones can also relax the muscles that push waste through your digestive tract.

, Pregnancy hormones can take a toll on your body, resulting in mood swings over the course of your first trimester. While these changes in your mood may feel similar to symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), persistent mood changes without a period following are a potential sign of pregnancy. You may experience mood swings both due to physical changes and for emotional reasons.Consult your doctor if you find that changes in your mood are damaging your ability to cope with daily life.

, Your blood vessels dilate during pregnancy as your blood volume increases. This can contribute to lower blood pressure or blood sugar, and cause you to become dizzy or faint."
"
Understand what pregnancy tests are looking for.,
Purchase a urine test.,
Contact your health care provider to take a blood test.",How to Determine if You Are Pregnant3," Pregnancy tests examine either your blood or your urine to detect the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after an embryo attaches to the uterine lining. While hCG builds up quickly in your body over the first few days of pregnancy, testing too quickly can produce a negative result. If your pregnancy test is negative but you experience a variety of other symptoms, it's a good idea to re-test.

, Home pregnancy kits test urine in one of two ways. Some tests require you to collect urine in a cup and either dip a test stick into the urine, or place some urine into a special container using an eyedropper. Other tests require you to place a test stick into the path of your urine stream and catch the urine midstream -- in short, you urinate on the stick. How long you wait for a result may vary, so follow your kit's instructions carefully. You'll be looking for a chance in color or the appearance of a line or other symbol.Most urine tests have a ""control indicator"" line or symbol that should appear regardless of your test results as an assurance the test is working. Be sure this control indicator is working -- if not, your test is likely invalid.
Always check the test's expiration date to ensure it will give you accurate results.
It's best to wait until at least the first missed day of your period before taking a urine exam. This will likely be about two weeks following conception. If your test turns out negative but you continue to experience other symptoms, re-take the test in a week.Urine tests are 97 percent accurate when performed correctly., Blood tests come in two forms. Qualitative tests simply assess whether any hCG is present in your blood and give you a yes-or-no answer. These tests are about as accurate as a urine test. Quantitative tests will tell you the exact quantity of hCG in your blood. These tests are extremely accurate and can be useful if your doctor needs to track potential problems in your pregnancy. Blood tests can often detect pregnancy as early as seven to 12 days after conception. They are, however, more expensive, and must be done in a doctor's office."

Get counseling for outcome-related anxiety.",How to Cope With Infertility," Anyone experiencing infertility often has a wide array of feelings such as denial, shock, numbness, anger, guilt, and shame. Acknowledging these feelings can help you start to get over them. Giving your feelings the proper attention by acknowledging them and seeking support through friends, family members, and even health professionals can give you power over them and any related situations you may encounter.Remember that your feelings are completely natural.Write down your feelings about your infertility or consider keeping a journal to track your progress or even just give you a private space in which to deal with your feelings.
Make sure you don’t hide your feelings from those people with whom you are close. They may find it difficult to understand how you truly feel if you mask it with smiles and “I’m okay.”
Avoid forcing yourself to feel a certain way. Instead, welcome any anger or sadness you feel and then let it go.Consider saying daily positive affirmations to help you acknowledge your feelings. You could say something like, “I am so angry I can’t have children, but I am strong and my life will be just as full without kids.”;
, Grief can be a normal reaction to infertility. Whether you’re still hoping to having a successful pregnancy or are unable to carry a child, your mind is likely already grieving. Not allowing yourself to mourn the loss can cause stress and anxiety and won’t allow you to feel better again.Approach the grief process with infertility as “grieving a dream.” This can help make it more concrete and also cue your mind into knowing that your feelings of loss are completely normal.
Talking to your partner, family, friends, or even writing in a journal can help you get through the grieving process.

, Most people are socialized, but fertility and having children are something about which many people feel entitled to comment. People may make insensitive remarks about you not having children without knowing your situation. In some cases, people may even feel it acceptable to make comments like, “if you hadn’t waited so long.” These types of comments and stigmas, which are often a result of lack of information, may make you feel guilt, shame, stress, anxiety, or depression. Learning to ignore comments and social stigmas can help you to cope with your infertility.


Avoid worrying about how other people may react to your infertility. Ignoring negative comments and reactions can help you more readily cope with the disorder. Telling yourself, “What other people think is their business” may help you gradually disconnect from negative comments and social stigmas.Counter a negative comment with, “you know, I’m undergoing fertility treatments right now and it’s been really stressful” or “unfortunately, I can’t have children” that people are genuinely helpful, concerned, and eager to support you.
Re-channel negativity by taking a deep breath and thinking of something positive, like doing an activity you love. For example, say to yourself “I may be struggling with infertility, but the condition doesn’t own or define me. I can go out and laugh with other people and even children.”

, Infertility and its treatment can cause any person considerable stress and anxiety, be it physiological side effects, money concerns, and treatment failure. Taking active steps to reduce and manage any stress in your life can also help you cope more effectively with your infertility.Step away from any situation that causes your stress if you are able. This might include going to baby showers or children’s birthday parties.Use deep breathing techniques to help yourself relax or get through stressful situations. You can do this by sitting or standing up straight and inhaling deeply through your nose for a few seconds. Then hold it and exhale through your nose for the same amount of time as you inhaled. Do these breathing exercise for five minutes when you feel stressed or anxious can help relieve your feelings., Taking care of and having time to yourself can help reduce stress and make you feel better. If you are dealing with infertility and any related emotional or physical issues, schedule “me time” to distract your mind and give yourself a break.


Consider activities that keep you engaged with other people who don’t remind you of your infertility. For example, have lunch with a work colleague or enjoy happy hour with friends.
Do things that allow you to pamper yourself and reduce stress such as taking a gentle yoga or meditation class or getting a massage. Allow yourself to buy something nice or do an activity you love such as mountain climbing or making pottery. Even reading a book in the bath is a nice way to pamper yourself.
Remember that you should never feel guilty for wanting some time to pamper yourself. It is important for reducing stress and promoting your overall wellbeing.

, If you are having trouble getting pregnant, undergoing fertility treatments, or have been diagnosed with infertility, schedule an appointment to see your doctor. He or she may be able to help you find ways to cope with related physiological and psychological issues that arise as a result of infertility.Let your doctor know about your feelings related to your infertility. He or she may be able to discuss them with you or refer you to a specialist.
Consider seeing a mental health professional to help you cope with your feelings. This may help you better cope with your own feelings or with situations you encounter in the outside world.

, The stress of infertility can lead to problems in any relationship. Having open, honest, and loving conversations with your partner or loved one can help keep your relationship strong. It can also help both of you effectively cope with your infertility.Remember that you and your partner won’t always be on the same page. Finding compromise through honest conversation can help you navigate any problems that arise. For example, say, “Stephan, I know you really want a baby, but these fertility treatments are really hard on me. We need to figure out how long we’re going to continue them.”
Consider reestablishing intimacy through conversations. Enjoying nonsexual and sensual talk with your partner can help both of you deal with your struggle., The old truism that knowledge is power can help you and others cope with your infertility. Making sure that you, your partner, as well as family members and friends stay informed about infertility may help everyone understand what you’re feeling and provide you the necessary.Stay in touch with your doctor about the latest developments in infertility or your specific condition. Use this information to keep your loved ones in the loop. You can also draw on online resources to inform yourself and your loved ones more about infertility.This may also give you ideas on how best to cope with it. For example, the National Infertility Association offers different resources on infertility, including ways to best cope with it., It may be difficult to talk to family, friends, and others about your struggle with infertility. Speaking with people honestly about it can help you cope with infertility. Being open may also minimize the risk of uncomfortable situations or questions.Decide how much of your struggle you want to share. Consider rehearsing what you’re going to say to people. You may want it to be in private so that you can show your emotions. For example, you could say, “Infertility is a life crisis that affects 1 in 8 couples. Christopher and I are one of those couples. It’s been so stressful and we’re trying to make it through this.”
Let people know how they can support you and how much you’re willing to share. For example, say “It’s so kind of you to ask and be supportive. I’m willing to tell you some of what’s happening, but I’m also having a hard time wrapping my head around it, so I might hold back at times.”

, Talking to others who are struggling with infertility can be a significant source of support for you. Joining a support group for people with infertility can offer you unconditional support from others who really understand what you’re experiencing. A support group may also help you more effectively deal with your feelings and other aspects of infertility.Participate in a local support group or join an online support community. Groups such as the National Infertility Association can help you locate both types of groups.
Remember that a support group is a safe space where you can be yourself. You may find that sharing your feelings openly can help you more readily embrace them and deal with your infertility.

, If you are undergoing drug- or hormone-based fertility treatments, you may be experiencing a variety of psychological and physical side effects. These can make any emotions or physical sensations you’re experiencing even worse. Keeping your doctor in the loop about any physical or emotional symptoms you are having during fertility treatments can help you get relief from side effects.Be aware that it is vital that you let your doctor know any side effects you may be experiencing, especially if they are psychological. He or she can identify if the side effects are related to the medications and what the next best steps are to relieve your discomfort.
Recognize the psychological symptoms that fertility drugs may cause: anxiety, sleep disruption, mood swings, irritability, depression, mania, and the inability to concentrate.
Realize that certain drugs may also cause headache and breast tenderness. Both of these symptoms are often easily relieved with a mild pain reliever., If you are undergoing fertility treatments, chances are you are spending a lot of time in your doctor’s office or thinking about your next visit. This can compound any stress you feel in the process of trying to get pregnant. As often as you can, do something enjoyable to counter the time spent with your doctor or thinking about your next appointment.


Do something that you enjoy or that actively relieves your stress and can distract you. This could be something like getting a massage, going away for a weekend, or having a nice dinner with friends.
Try doing enjoyable activities with your partner. Your relationship may be heavily focused on administering drugs, having sex, and other aspects of fertility treatments. Doing something as a couple can remind you of the reasons you’re together and trying to have a child. It may also relieve ongoing stress.

, Costs for infertility treatments are significant. A typical cycle of IVF (in-vitro fertilization) can cost upwards of $14,000. For many couples, infertility treatments present a considerable financial burden, even with insurance. Getting the help of a financial advisor may relieve some of your worry and help you find ways to afford fertility treatments without depleting your finances.Gather all of your financial information, such as pay stubs and investment records, before you meet with a planner. Let him or her know that you’re struggling with paying for infertility treatments and want to know ways you can sensibly continue them. Answer any questions the advisor has honestly so he or she can give you the best advice for your situation. Make sure to ask any questions you have about your financial health and how it impacts your ability to continue treatment.Be aware that in the United States, only 15 states mandate insurance coverage for infertility treatments. Even then the extent of the coverage varies widely. Copayments or limitations in your coverage can mean you still have significant out of pocket costs.This is also information you need to provide to your financial planner, who may be able to suggest different insurance companies.

, In addition to the stress that accompanies treatments, the choices you make about them and potential outcomes can cause significant anxiety. Feeling anxious about miscarriage, if you should undergo prenatal testing, and whether to continue treatment are all normal reactions to infertility treatments.Talking to an infertility counselor can help you—and your partner—deal with the stress and anxiety of dealing with potential outcomes and choices you have to make as a result of fertility treatments.Ask your OB/GYN or fertility specialist for a referral to an infertility counselor. Let him or her know why you want to see the counselor so that he or she can offer complementary care to therapy.

Look for the absence of menstruation.,
Start looking for other signs of pregnancy.,
Feel for any abdominal pain.,
Be aware of any vaginal bleeding.,
Consider whether any of the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy apply to you.,
Have your β-HCG levels checked in a blood test.,
Undergo a transvaginal ultrasound.,
Allow your doctor to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy.,
Seek treatment promptly.,
Take medication that will abort the pregnancy.,
Have surgery to remove the ectopic pregnancy.",How to Detect an Ectopic Pregnancy," If you have missed a menstrual period, and had unprotected sex prior to that, take a pregnancy test.Although an ectopic pregnancy does not occur in the uterus, your body will present with many of the typical signs of pregnancy anyways.
If you have an ectopic pregnancy, the pregnancy test would hypothetically always be positive.However, remember that these tests do have the possibility of false positive results or false negative tests, so if in doubt it is always a good idea to visit your doctor for a blood test for a confirmation.;
, If you are pregnant, whether it has implanted in the uterus (as in normal pregnancy) or in the fallopian tubes or elsewhere (as in ectopic pregnancy), you will still likely experience some if not many of these common symptoms:breast tenderness
frequent urination
nausea, with or without vomitingabsence of menstruation (as previously mentioned)., If you have already confirmed your pregnancy or you still aren’t sure, but you experience abdominal pain, then it could be because of an ectopic pregnancy.The pain mainly occurs due to the pressure exerted by the growing fetus on the surrounding tissue, which in the case of an ectopic pregnancy does not have enough room to accommodate the fetus (the fallopian tubes for instance, the most common site of ectopic pregnancy, are not by any means designed to accommodate a growing baby).
The abdominal pain can be sharp and severe, or in some cases there may be no pain.
The pain often increases on movement and straining, and is often localized to one side of the abdomen.
Shoulder pain can also present due to the presence of blood in the abdomen, which can irritate the nerve that travels up to your shoulder.
Know, however, that round ligament pain is very common in pregnancy. This pain, similarly, is located on one side or the other (or both) and can come in intervals (which usually last a few seconds each). The main difference is that round ligament pain tends to occur in the second trimester.The pain from an ectopic pregnancy will usually emerge sooner than that.

, Light bleeding may occur due to irritation of the fallopian tubes as they are being stretched, and more profuse and severe bleeding may occur later as the baby grows to the point where the fallopian tubes may actually rupture. Bleeding during any sort of pregnancy is something that warrants examination from your doctor - particularly if it is continual or severe bleeding, in which case you are best to be seen in the emergency department sooner rather than later.Severe bleeding from ruptured fallopian tubes (which can occur as a result of an ectopic pregnancy) can lead to significant blood loss, fainting, and in very rare instances death if not treated promptly by a medical professional.Other serious symptoms (apart and aside from bleeding) which warrant prompt medical attention include severe abdominal pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, sudden paleness, or mental confusion, all of which could indicate a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.Note that something called ""implantation bleeding"" is entirely normal. This occurs one week prior to your first missed menstrual period (3 weeks after your last menstrual period) and is a pinkish/brownish discharge that should fill more than a few pads.Bleeding from an ectopic pregnancy usually occurs later than this, after the embryo has implanted and begun to grow in a space that cannot accommodate very much growth.
However, if bleeding at any time is bright red in color, taking up several pads, and not improving within a day or so, it is important to seek prompt medical attention.

, If you are experiencing any of the symptoms mentioned above, you also need to consider if you fall into the high risk group of ectopic pregnancies. Certain factors increase a woman’s likelihood of experiencing an ectopic pregnancy.


Generally, women who have had an ectopic pregnancy in the past are more likely to experience such pregnancies in the future too.Other risk factors include: pelvic infections (sexually transmitted infections), multiple sexual partners (as this increases the chance of unknown STI's), fallopian tube tumors or abnormalities, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, having an IUD, endometriosis, or smoking.Also, if a woman has had ""sterilization"" (also known a ""tubal ligation"" surgery, when her ""tubes are tied"" in an effort to prevent future pregnancy), although this is normally very successful in preventing pregnancy if one were to become pregnant the risk of it being an ectopic pregnancy is notably higher., This is the first step towards the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.β-HCG is a hormone that is secreted by the developing embryo and placenta, so it rises as the pregnancy progresses and is a more definitive (and reliable) form of pregnancy test.
If the β-HCG level is above 1500 IU/L (often between 1500-2000 IU/L is suspicious), but no pregnancy is seen with ultrasound, doctors will worry about you having an ectopic pregnancy. This is because the β-HCG levels are normally higher in ectopic pregnancy than in normal intrauterine pregnancies, so it is certainly a cause for suspicion.If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected due to your β-HCG levels, your doctor will follow this up with a transvaginal ultrasound to see if she can visualize a pregnancy, and its location., These ultrasounds can detect 75-85% of ectopic pregnancies (the growing fetus will be able to be seen on ultrasound in that percentage of cases, which confirms its location).Note that a negative ultrasound does not rule out an ectopic pregnancy. A positive ultrasound (one that confirms the presence of a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes or elsewhere outside the uterus), however, is enough to make the diagnosis.If the ultrasound is negative (i.e. inconclusive), but the β-HCG level is high and your symptoms are enough to concern your doctor that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, your doctor will likely recommend a ""diagnostic laparoscopy,"" which is a simple surgery with very small incisions where they can insert cameras into your abdomen to have a clearer look., If your blood tests and ultrasounds seem inconclusive, and an ectopic pregnancy is still suspected, your doctor may perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to visualize your pelvic and abdominal organs internally to look for the spot of implantation.This procedure usually lasts for 30 minutes to an hour.

, Once the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is confirmed, your doctor will want to treat you very quickly. This is because the treatment for ectopic pregnancy is much simpler when done sooner rather than later. Also, it is impossible for an ectopic tubal pregnancy to ""survive""; in other words, the fetus won't be able to live anyway, so removing the pregnancy sooner rather than later prevents complications (which, if left too long, may become life-threatening)., The most commonly administer medication in this scenario is methotrexate. It is given via intramuscular injection, one or more times, depending upon how much is needed to successfully get rid of the ectopic pregnancy.After the injection of methotrexate is given, you will receive repeat blood tests to check your β-HCG level. If it drops to near zero (undetectable in the blood test), the treatment will be deemed successful; if not, you will receive more methotrexate injections until this goal is reached, and if it still not attained you may need surgery., During surgery, your doctors may also repair or remove the damaged fallopian tube if needed. Indications for surgery include:Severe blood loss requiring urgent treatment.
Failure of methotrexate treatment.

Monitor the frequency and timing of intercourse.,
Determine the time of your ovulation.,
Use a basal body thermometer (BBT) to chart your temperature every day.,
Use an ovulation predictor kit.,
Have gentle sex and avoid orgasm.",How to Conceive a Girl1," The Shettles Method is based on the fact that the Y chromosome (boy) sperm are smaller and less robust, but move faster than the larger X chromosome (girl) sperm.Therefore, having intercourse further away from ovulation will favor the slower moving X (girl) sperm.;
, One way to do this is to chart your cervical mucus daily. Just before ovulation, cervical mucus is watery and elastic, with the consistency of a raw egg white.


By charting your cervical mucus for one full month, you should be able to pinpoint exactly when you are ovulating.Shettles recommends sexual intercourse up to 3 days before ovulation in order to increase your odds of conceiving a girl.

, Shettles recommends taking your temperature before you get up each morning, and being extremely careful to lie as still as possible, as any activity can give you an inaccurate reading. The reason for the temperature charting is that at the time you begin to ovulate, your temperature will spike., These kits will detect when your body has released Luteinizing hormone (LH), which is a precursor to ovulation; which is most likely to start about 24 hours after you get a positive reading for LH.

, Shallow penetration is more likely to deposit the sperm closer to the entrance of the vagina, which is more acidic than the area near the cervix.The theory is that the acidity will weaken the Y (boy) sperm while allowing more X (girl) sperm available for egg fertilization.


The female body produces a substance after orgasm that make the vagina more alkaline, which favors the Y (boy) sperm.
The contractions produced during an orgasm will help propel the sperm up and into the cervix, which gives the Y (boy) sperm the advantage.

Know that diet may play a vital role in selecting the sex of your baby.,
Eat plenty of calcium and magnesium.,
Avoid salt and potassium, which may create hospitable environments for male sperm.",How to Conceive a Girl2," Some research suggests that diet can influence whether you have a girl or a boy, although the research is doubted by some.Specifically, researchers say that a diet of magnesium and calcium may be helpful in conceiving a girl.

, Diets rich in calcium and magnesium may increase the alkalinity of the mother, which may not be as hospitable for male sperm.


Foods rich in calcium and magnesium include:

Nuts, such as almonds and cashews
Beans
Vegetables such as spinach and broccoli
Yogurt and tofu
Oatmeal



, The following foods should be put on the no-no list if you're adhering to the calcium and magnesium diet:


Anchovies, smoked salmon, and shrimp
Bacon, salami, and processed meats
Breads and pastries
Olives
Potatoes

Understand the Ericsson method.,
Find a doctor who practices the Ericsson method.,
Expect to pay anywhere from $500 to $1,000 for the Ericsson method.",How to Conceive a Girl3," Dr. Ronald Ericsson based his gender selection method on the idea that X-sperm (female sperm) swim slower than Y-sperm. Sperm are deposited into a column with albumin, a glue-like substance, and start swimming down the column. After a while, the idea is that the Y-sperm will have traveled further down the column than the X-sperm, and X-enriched sperm can be isolated. The X-enriched sperm are then used to inseminate the mother.

, Check with your local fertility doctor about the Ericsson method, and whether they know any practitioners. Although many fertility doctors don't support the Ericsson method because it isn't backed up by widespread scientific support, you should be able to find a practitioner.

, Although this isn't cheap, it's far cheaper than IVF and methods like MicroSort.

Use the Chinese Lunar Birth calendar.,
Determine the days on which conception would produce a girl.",How to Conceive a Girl4," While not scientific, some parents and even some doctors, recommend following the Chinese Lunar Birth calendar. According to this ancient mystical calendar, the gender of a baby is determined by the mother’s age and the month in which she conceives. A simplified example would be if a woman is 25, she should try to conceive in the months of January, April, May or July.

, The Chinese birth chart is determined by the mother's age and the month of conception, so figure out how old you are and which month on the lunar calendar would produce a girl. Read more about how to select the sex of your baby using the Chinese birth chart.

Analyze the clinic’s success rates.,
Understand the costs.,
Determine your insurance coverage.,
Consider the size and location of a clinic.",How to Choose a Fertility Clinic1," While high success rates might indicate a high-functioning fertility clinic, this might not be necessarily true. To successfully interpret a clinic’s success rates, determine if their success rates represent live birth rates rather than the percentage of cycles that end in pregnancies.A quality clinic will list both IUI and IVF success rates by birth. These success rates should also be broken down by age and the type of technology used, i.e., IUI and IVF.
You can fact check a clinic’s success rates by contacting the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART).;
, Costs vary from clinic to clinic, however the average cost of an IVF cycle is $12,000, plus an additional cost of $3,000 to $5,000 for medication.They also vary depending on your individual circumstances. When you are given a quote, it is important to know exactly what is included in that quote, i.e., diagnostic procedures and treatments.


The clinic you chose should have programs that help you pay for some of the costs. If they don’t, you might want to consider looking into another clinic.It is important to pick a clinic that is affordable and convenient for you to access, but try not to sacrifice quality for these things.

, When considering a clinic, determine which procedures your insurance covers and does not cover. Most women do not have any infertility coverage under their insurance, so you may need to pay out of pocket for any treatments you receive. Or, you might only have partial coverage. For example, if IVF isn’t covered by your insurance, your insurance might still cover fertility diagnostic procedures.It is important to choose a doctor that is covered in your insurance plan.


Double-check the clinic’s hospital affiliations. You want to choose a clinic that is affiliated with a hospital that your insurance covers.When contacting your insurance provider, first, ask if your insurance covers infertility. If it does, then you can also say something like, “Before I choose a clinic, I want to make sure the doctors are covered by my insurance. I would also like to know if the hospital the clinic is affiliated with is covered by my insurance, and what other procedures my insurance covers and does not cover. Can you please give me this information?""

, When choosing a clinic, the size and location is also important. Since you may be visiting your clinic weekly or daily, you might want to choose a clinic that is close to your home or work. If your top choice is farther than your second or third choice, don’t sacrifice quality for convenience. Also weigh the pros and cons of the clinic’s size. A bigger clinic might have better technology, while a smaller clinic might have a more personal feel."
"
Determine what treatment options and services are available.,
Make sure the doctors are board certified.,
Schedule a consultation appointment.",How to Choose a Fertility Clinic2," If a clinic only offers IVF treatment or pushes it more than other options, then you might need to look into other clinics that are open to all options. Less expensive options include timed intercourse or oral medications that stimulate ovulation, like Clomid.Many OB/GYNs can offer these treatment options, so you might want to start by getting these treatments done by them before you move to an infertility clinic.


Choose a clinic that offers male infertility programs as well. Your doctor will usually require a semen analysis from your partner before performing any treatments or giving medications. However, there are rare instances in which male infertility is discovered after the woman has been receiving fertility treatments. Starting out at a clinic that offers male infertility services or having your partner visit a urologist will prevent you from having to switch clinics if a problem is discovered later on.

, When choosing a clinic, you want to make sure all the doctors are board certified. Having board certification ensures that your doctor has the training and practice to perform the procedures. Make sure your doctor is certified by the American Board of Obstetrics, and has a certification in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility., Scheduling an initial consultation appointment is a must. Think of this initial consultation as a job interview where you are the employer. It will allow you to get a sense of the fertility clinic’s services and their nurses and doctors. You want to choose a clinic whose doctors and nurses genuinely care about your outcome.Questions to ask your doctor are:What are some reasons for why my partner and I haven't conceived yet?
What tests do we need or do you recommend?
What treatment do you recommend and are there any side effects?
If your recommended treatment does not work, what is the next step?
Consider the impression the doctor or nurse left on you after the appointment. Did they make you feel hopeful, excited, and like a unique individual rather than a case? If yes, then the clinic might be right for you. If no, then explore your other options.

"
"
Determine the quality of the clinic’s services.,
Be your best advocate.,
Determine what other services the clinic provides.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Choose a Fertility Clinic3," Determine the quality of a clinic’s services by answering these questions:Were you greeted with a warm welcome?
Does the clinic see patients seven days a week?
Do they enforce positive and frequent communication with their patients?
How accessible are the doctors and nurses after hours?
How do they define success?
Is the doctor available full-time and does the doctor work in-house?
If the answers to these questions are positive and “yes,” then this might be the clinic for you.

, You can be your best advocate by becoming knowledgeable about all the treatments that are available, as well as each treatment’s pros and cons. During every appointment, take notes on what the doctor says. Afterwards, research the things you did not fully understand. Then, write up a list of questions that you would like your doctor and nurses to answer for you.If there comes a time when you seriously question your doctor’s advice after you have raised valid points and concerns, try getting a second opinion. You may need to switch doctors or clinics if you find that your doctor cannot provide adequate care and treatment.

, See if the clinic offers group support, counseling, or psychological services. Fertility treatments can be extremely stressful. Therefore, it is very helpful if a clinic has onsite psychological counseling to help you cope with the stresses of uncertainty during this difficult time.

, If you’re having second thoughts about a fertility clinic, do not feel as if you have an obligation to stick with that clinic. Remember that you always have options when it comes to choosing a fertility clinic. If you’re unsure about one fertility clinic, schedule a consultation appointment with another clinic. The doctors and the nurses at fertility clinics should make you feel comfortable, hopeful, and safe.


If you’re having second thoughts about a clinic, always communicate with your partner how you are feeling. Communication is very important during this time; perhaps your partner is having second thoughts about the clinic, as well. When choosing a clinic, make sure that you and your partner both agree that the clinic is the right one.

Let go of deciding what’s fair.",How to Deal with Baby Envy when Trying to Conceive," Conceiving may be an ongoing process for you, so when a friend or family member conceives on the first try, you may feel envious, angry, bitter, or resentful. Know that you cannot will your envy away, even if you don’t like it. You’re not a bad person for feeling the way you do. In fact, it’s normal to be sad, upset, or jealous when someone else gets something you want and do not have.Find an outlet for your feelings. This might be writing in a journal or talking about your frustrations with a friend. You may want to express yourself through art or through music if words aren’t how you like to express yourself.;
, You might think that you’re envious of your friend who is pregnant. Yet, your envy has very little to do with them. Your envy has everything to do with the fact that you want a baby, and fear that you may not have one. While your friend may trigger these feelings, the envy has more to do with your desires and fears than your friend.It is okay to let yourself be envious or angry for a little while at first before transitioning to a more understanding place. After you give yourself a chance to feel these feelings, try to let your friend off the hook and don’t resent them. Instead, recognize where your feelings come from and go from there.
Think about your desires and fears and write them down. Be honest with yourself and remind yourself that these are things that drive your envy, not your friends.

, You might feel devastated (“Why you and not me?”) and happy for your friend at the same time. Having mixed emotions can be confusing and difficult. You want to be happy and support your friend, yet you feel sad for your own situation. It can be especially difficult hearing about an unplanned pregnancy. Give yourself a heavy dose of compassion and let yourself feel whatever emotions come up.Say to yourself, “I’m happy for them but sad for me.”

, When you’re trying to conceive, even the thought of attending a baby shower or christening may fill you with sadness. You may pull away from people with children or pregnant friends and family. While it’s important to acknowledge your pain and struggles, also consider how your actions may affect your relationships. You may not want to pull away permanently from friends and family, yet you may want to or need to take a break.For example, while it may be difficult to attend a baby shower, consider mailing a gift or a card.
If you need some time away from certain friends, say, “Conceiving has been difficult for me, and so while I am happy for you, please understand that seeing you pregnant fills me with sadness. I want to support you, but I need some time away for now.”

, When you’re struggling with baby envy, you may choose to change who is close to you. For example, it may be painful to keep some friends close or you may want to distance yourself from a nagging mother who wants grandchildren. You may choose to be closer to some friends and not others during this time, and that’s okay. Make sure to ask your support network for what you need. Do you need to talk or cry? Do you need to be distracted with something fun? Do you need help researching options?
Whatever you do, maintain some friendships and find people who support you and bring you comfort.
Say, “This is a difficult time for me, and I hope I can lean on you for support.”

, If you’re putting all of your effort into conceiving, you may be neglecting your relationship with your partner. Make sure your relationship stays a priority without focusing all of your effort onto conceiving. Problems with conceiving can often take a toll on a romantic relationship, so make sure you continue to spend time together.Make sure you are spending time talking about things other than conceiving and doing things that you two find fun. Your partner can support you through these difficult times and knows the situation better than most other people.

Say to your partner, “Even though we are struggling to conceive, it’s important for us to stay strong as a couple. Let’s spend as much time as we can enjoying our twosome for now.”
Once you conceive and have a baby, time with your partner may become slim. Enjoy the time you have together.

, If you feel envious of others conceiving, you might feel alone or isolated in your struggles. Meeting with other people who are having similar experiences can be helpful. You can ask for advice, share your struggles and triumphs, talk about your feelings and how you’re coping, and ask for resources and help.Find a local support group by asking your OB/GYN, physician, or mental health clinic. You can also join an online community support group.

, Problems with fertility can affect your romantic relationship, relationship with yourself and your body, and your relationships with friends and family. If you’re feeling alone, fearful, envious, and are having difficulty managing your emotions on your own, it might be time to reach out to a therapist. A therapist can help you cope with stress and talk about your feelings in a safe, nonjudgmental way.Ask your healthcare professionals for a recommendation for a therapist specializing in fertility problems. You can also call a mental health clinic or a friend or family member for a recommendation.

, When you’re feeling at your worst, practicing gratitude can help. Instead of focusing on what you don’t have, give thanks for what you do have. After each pang of jealousy, think of something you are grateful for in your life. Get in the habit of writing a gratitude list each day, even if it’s small.Start a gratitude journal, draw a picture, or take a photo of something you’re thankful for each day. Start your journal entry with, “Today I am grateful for my loving partner.”
Visual prompts can be very helpful for staying grateful. Post your list somewhere visible, or set a reminder on your phone to go off a couple of times per day and remind you of something you are grateful for.

, If you start to feel envious or sad, don’t suppress those feelings. Recognizing how much you want a child can feel like a burden, especially if you have to wait. Instead of feeling envious, turn your feelings to excitement and hope. Make a baby blanket or write a letter to your child for when they turn a certain age.Channel those feelings into something positive that can help you feel loving toward your future child.

Record a video with your partner to your future child. Let them know that you love them and cannot wait to meet them.

, Whether you choose to volunteer at an after-school program or to take your friend’s baby while they get some time alone, hang out with some babies or children while you wait. It can be nice to indulge some baby snuggles or practice some parenting skills while helping someone else out.Reach out to friends with children and offer to babysit here and there if it is comfortable for you.
Keep in mind that if being around children is too emotional for you, then you don’t have to do it. Another option might be to get involved with a cause that helps children and families, but where you won’t be directly interacting with children.

, Your envy may be great if you feel like you’re more deserving of a child or would make a better parent. It might feel totally unfair to you that someone who didn’t want a baby got pregnant while you’ve been trying for over a year. It’s normal to feel this way and to feel like it’s unfair.If someone gets pregnant and you don’t, this does not mean that you are inferior or somehow less deserving.When you start thinking or feeling, “This isn’t fair!” it can make the envy deeper. Just because it doesn’t feel fair doesn’t mean you won’t conceive.

Forgive yourself.,
Try your hardest to find out why the miscarriage occurred.,
Stop stressing!,
Identify why you're so upset about having the miscarriage in the first place.,
Know that everything happens for a reason.,
Talk to other women who have experienced miscarriages.,
Think gain instead of loss.,
Get some rest.",How to Get Through a Miscarriage," Having a miscarriage is often a chromosomal problem & usually has nothing to do with any neglect on the mother's part. Either way, some women have a way of blaming themselves for the miscarriage & rather or not they have valid reason to, the first thing to do FOR yourself is to forgive yourself. Forgive yourself if you've been told (by a doctor) that your actions or negligence has caused the miscarriage and/or if this is not the case, forgive yourself for even thinking so.;
, The best way to find these answers are through the doctors that have alerted you of the miscarriage and/or treated you for the miscarriage. A lot of doctors will inform you that even if they had caught the problem, there was probably nothing they could do. But sometimes, if there is a specific cause (example: tilted uterus, cysts on ovaries, smoking, too much stress, etc.) it's best to know these causes because it'll give you some breathing room to know & understand why the pregnancy didn't work out and/Or any treatment that could prevent further miscarriages. If your doctor cannot identify why the miscarriage occurred or IS occurring, consider this a good thing, thus the chances of the miscarriage happening from specific health conditions or actions from the mother (smoking, drinking, smoking, not eating healthy, etc.) was highly unlikely. There is always a chance that your doctor can fix or treat any specific problem that might have/be causing your body to reject the pregnancy., Not only will your body literally be experiencing some physical changes and/or discomfort, but your mental state will also be off balance too. If you've had a D&C procedure after the miscarriage, understand that the best thing you can do for yourself at this point is to rest. Don't focus too much on the physical pain. If granted permission by your doctor, take whatever over-the-counter or prescription medications to help ease the physical discomfort. Remember that your hormones were already imbalanced & raging all over the place from being pregnant in the first place, so understand that even after a miscarriage, those same hormones may not go back to normal right away. It's normal to experience even more severe moodiness and/or irritability. If you understand the changes & the fixing that's being done inside of your body, it will make things go smoother for you, emotionally as well as physically.

, Did you desperately want to have a baby? Have you had previous miscarriages before & prayed that this pregnancy would not end in the same result? Are you over the age of 35 & afraid that your time for having a successful pregnancy is running out? Did you want to have the baby for the wrong reason(s)? What future consequences or strife will come from having the miscarriage? Are you just freaked out that the pregnancy wasn't successful (whether the pregnancy was planned or not)? Either way, it's important that you are HONEST with yourself about what's bothering you the MOST in losing the pregnancy. Remember, you can't solve/fix the puzzle if you don't have all the pieces.

, Everyone will tell you this & most of the time we are told this during the times that we absolutely do NOT want to hear this. But have you ever wondered why people use this phrase so often when they hear of miscarriages? It's because this phrase is literally true. Miscarriages aren't always life-ruining for women; sometimes miscarriages are eye-openers for women: her chance to start over & to protect herself, specifically if the pregnancy was unplanned & unwanted in the first place; her chance to evaluate if she was in a relationship or situation with the right presumed child's father anyway; her chance to learn about medical conditions or problems that she wouldn't have been aware of had she not had the miscarriage; her ability to learn about herself & see her plans of her own future through tough & vulnerable times; etc.

, Sometimes others in your life won't understand where all of your grief & stressing over the loss is coming from. Miscarriage affects every woman differently & usually tends to have the longest & most traumatic affects on the women who were previously depressed or not happy with their lives way before the pregnancy was known of. It's easy to shut off & to feel even more hurt after seeing how others can sometimes use the phrase, ""get over it"" too loosely. Talking to other women who've experienced miscarriages will, if anything make you understand & see that you are not alone. You'd be surprised at how many other women have experienced the same grief you are experiencing & how similar their stories of the pain and/or moving on are quite similar to your own story. As with anything, it's always best to interact and/or connect with others who have been through the same ordeal you've been through. Even those who've gone through this before are very helpful in providing further tips on how to cope, forgive yourself & move on.

, As with anything in life, if you keep reminding yourself that you've encountered great loss, eventually these thoughts will start to consume you & take over/control your emotions. There is no such a thing as too much grief in any loss, but understand that in order for others to support you the way you deserve, they must first be able to come to you with open arms to help you. And this means being rational & calm enough to express your emotions & make it possible for others to try to intervene & help you. There is always a gain from any loss, even with miscarriages. Make a list of all the things you will/can gain from having the miscarriage. After all, you might gain knowledge of any problems/medical conditions you wouldn't have known about had the miscarriage not occurred; you can gain the ability to release some old emotions that were suppressed in other situations, that willingly decided to come out during the miscarriage, thus adding to healing from more than just the miscarriage; you can gain clarity on your current relationship/friendship with the presumed father of the child (after all, every man will show his true colors for the best or for the worst when he finds out that the pregnancy test came out positive); and best of all, you might have gained a better appreciation for life, including for your own.

, Be patient with your body after the miscarriage, as your body is preparing to heal from the damage/rejection of the pregnancy, thus eventually going back to normal. Hang around positive friends (specifically the friends who've shared your experience), keep up with your normal routines & take up an extra hobby to keep your mind off of things. You don't have to exercise your body too death, but at least keep your physical self in top shape, as this will be very important & essential for the next time you become pregnant. Go on a road trip with friends or by yourself. Meditate. Spend hours listening to your favorite music. Do some research on how to get yourself back in top shape like before. There are a million things you can do to physically persuade your hormones to go back to normal. Instead of surrendering to your emotions, take the control back.

Check your vaginal mucous.,
Pay attention to your aches and pains.,
Analyze your pregnancy symptoms.,
See your doctor to be sure.,
Know the different types of miscarriage.,
Call your physician if the bleeding stops on its own.,
Seek treatment if the bleeding doesn't stop.,
Watch your symptoms.,
Look into grief counseling.",How to Determine If You Had a Miscarriage," Miscarriages most often occur in the early weeks of pregnancy. Chromosome abnormalities are the most common cause, and in most cases there's nothing the mother could have done to prevent it. The risk of miscarriage drops after thirteen weeks of gestation. By then, most chromosome abnormalities would have already caused the pregnancy to end. The following factors put people at higher risk of having a miscarriage: Older women have a higher risk. Women who are 35 to 45 years old have a 20-30 percent chance of miscarriage, and women over the age of 45 have up to a 50 percent chance.
Women with severe chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or lupus, have a higher risk of miscarrying.
Abnormalities in the uterus, such as scar tissue, can lead to a miscarriage.
Smoking, drug use and alcohol use can cause miscarriage to occur.
Women who are overweight or underweight are at higher risk.
Women who have already had more than one miscarriage are at higher risk.;
, Heavy vaginal bleeding is the most common sign that a miscarriage is occurring. It is often accompanied by cramps similar to those you might feel during your period.The blood is typically brown or bright red in color.Light spotting, and even moderate bleeding, can occur in healthy pregnancies. Heavy bleeding with clotting may indicate miscarriage. Notify your physician any time you experience bleeding during pregnancy.
According to the American Pregnancy Association, 50 to 75 percent of miscarriages are chemical pregnancies. This means they occur shortly after implantation. Often, the woman does not realize she was pregnant and she experiences bleeding at the time her normal monthly period is due. Bleeding may be heavier than normal and cramping may be more severe., Symptoms of miscarriage include pink-white vaginal mucous, which may contain pregnancy tissue. If your discharge looks like clotted tissue, or is solid in any way, this may be a sign that miscarriage is occurring or has occurred; you should see your doctor right away.


Most pregnant women experience increased levels of clear or milky vaginal discharge called Leukorrhea.If you have high levels of this type of discharge, there's no need for alarm.
You may also mistake spot of urine for vaginal discharge. Urinary incontinence is a common occurrence in healthy pregnancies.

, Any pregnancy brings a variety of aches and pains along with it. During a miscarriage, pain is usually located in the lower back and can range from mild to severe. If you experience lower back pain, talk with your physician right away.Occasional twinges or aches in your abdomen, pelvic area and back are often the result of your body adjusting to accommodate your growing fetus. If pain is severe, persistent or occurs in waves you may be miscarrying, especially if there is also bleeding.
It is also possible to experience ""true contractions"" if you're having a miscarriage. The contractions occur every 15 to 20 minutes, and are often severely painful., With pregnancy comes a slew of different symptoms, all caused by increased levels of hormones in your system. If you experience a reduction in symptoms, this may be a sign that a miscarriage has occurred and your hormone levels are returning to their pre-pregnancy state.


If you've had a miscarriage you may notice less morning sickness, less swelling and tenderness of the breasts, and a feeling of no longer being pregnant. In healthy pregnancies, these early symptoms often subside on their own at about 13 weeks, which is also the time miscarriage risk decreases.
Symptom occurrence and severity varies in every pregnancy. A sudden change prior to 13 weeks warrants a call to your physician's office.

, Visit your physician's office, emergency room, or the labor and delivery area of your hospital for a definitive answer as to whether you miscarried. Even if you experience all the above symptoms, there still may be a chance that the fetus can survive, depending on the type of miscarriage.


Depending on how far your pregnancy has progressed, the physician will use blood tests, pelvic exam or ultrasound to check the viability of the pregnancy.
If you experience heavy bleeding early in your pregnancy, your physician may not have you come in to the office unless you wish to do so.

, Miscarriage affects every woman's body a little differently. In some cases all pregnancy tissues leave the body quickly, while in other cases the process is longer and a bit more difficult. Here are the different types of miscarriage, and what affect they have on the body:


Threatened miscarriage: The cervix remains closed. It is possible that the bleeding and other miscarriage symptoms will stop, and the pregnancy will proceed as normal.Inevitable miscarriage: Heavy bleeding occurs, and the cervix begins to open. At this point there is no chance that the pregnancy will continue.
Incomplete miscarriage: Some pregnancy tissue leaves the body, but some stays inside. Sometimes a procedure is necessary to remove the remaining tissue.
Complete miscarriage: All pregnancy tissue leaves the body.
Missed abortion: Even though the pregnancy has ended, the tissue stays in the body. Sometimes it comes out on its own, and sometimes treatment is needed to remove it.Ectopic pregnancy: This is not technically a type of miscarriage, but it is another type of pregnancy loss. Instead of implanting in the uterus, the egg implants in the fallopian tube or ovary, where it will not be able to grow.

, If you experience heavy bleeding that eventually subsides, and it's still early in your pregnancy, you may not have to go to the hospital.Many women prefer not have an extra hospital visit and would rather rest at home. This is usually fine as long as the bleeding stops within ten days to two weeks.


If you're experiencing cramps or other pain, your physician might tell you how to make yourself more comfortable during the miscarriage.
If you want to confirm that a miscarriage occurred, you can schedule an ultrasound., If you experience heavy bleeding and other miscarriage symptoms, and you are not sure whether the miscarriage is complete or incomplete, your physician may proceed using one of the following strategies:


Expectant management: You'll wait and see whether the remaining tissue eventually passes and the bleeding stops on its own.
Medical management: Medication is given to cause the remaining tissue to expel from the body. This requires a short hospital stay, and the bleeding that follows can last up to three weeks.
Surgical management: Dilation and curettage, known as a D&C, is performed to remove the remaining tissue. The bleeding usually stops more quickly than it does for those who use the medical management method.Medication may be administered to slow the bleeding.

, If your bleeding continues past the time when your physician said it would slow and stop, it's important to seek treatment immediately. If you experience any other symptoms, such as chills or fever, see your doctor or go to the hospital right away.

, Losing a pregnancy at any stage can be emotionally traumatic. It is important to grieve your loss, and seeking counseling can help. Ask your physician for a referral for grief counseling, or book an appointment with a therapist in your area.


There is no certain amount of time after which you should feel better; it's different for every woman. Give yourself as much time as you need to grieve.
When are ready to try to get pregnant again, talk with your physician about making an appointment with someone who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. This is usually only necessary for those who have had two or more miscarriages.

Identify what you are feeling.,
Talk about the loss with your husband.,
Consider your husband’s grieving style.,
Tell your husband what kind of emotional support you need.,
Ask your husband what kind of support he needs.",How to Deal with an Unsupportive Husband After a Miscarriage1," Before you talk with your husband about how you are feeling, make sure to take some time to think about how the miscarriage has affected you. Spend some time alone and reflect on your feeling. Try writing out how you feel before starting a discussion with your husband.

For example, you might write about feeling sad, disappointed, angry, frightened, etc.;
, Miscarriage affects everyone differently. Your husband may be having a hard time coming to terms with what has happened, too. Sharing your feelings with each other may be painful, but it is a necessary step towards working through your grief.Grieving is often more effective when you voice your thoughts and feelings with someone who shares the loss. You might say to your husband, ""I am heartbroken about the miscarriage. I was so excited about our first child. I know you must be hurting, too..."" Recognizing that he suffered a loss, too, can open the door for honest conversation.

, Different people sometimes grieve differently. Your husband may channel his pain into taking care of practical things and trying to move on, rather than dwelling on the event and his emotions. Even if your husband is putting on a good face to the world, that doesn’t mean he isn’t sad, angry, or depressed inside.Think about other losses or setbacks your husband has experienced in your time together. How did he respond? Was it similar to how he is responding now?
Ask your husband what he needs, and express your own needs, too. Say something to the effect of, ""It helps me to mourn the loss if I talk about what happened. But, I understand that this type of grieving won't work for everyone. What can I do to help support you as you grieve our baby?""

, Your husband may not know how to comfort you, or he may be worried about saying the wrong thing. Instead of hoping he’ll know what to do and then feeling resentful when he doesn’t, ask him directly for what you need, whether that means a listening ear, a hug, or just some company.For instance, you might say to him, “Today has been a rough day for me. Can I talk to you about how I’m feeling?”
Some people are more comfortable expressing their emotions non-verbally. Your husband might have a hard time talking about the miscarriage, but be eager to comfort you in other ways, such as holding you or taking care of things around the house.
Look for ways in which he is trying to comfort you or make your life easier, and recognize him for those to strengthen your bond. For example, if you notice that your husband has been helping out more than usual with household chores, then this might

, Your husband might be acting brave in the face of the loss, but he needs support too. By taking the initiative to comfort him, you’ll make him feel more comfortable doing the same for you. Address his feelings when you talk about the miscarriage, and ask him what he needs from you.If your husband isn’t forthcoming about his feelings, make sure he knows you’ll be there for him in the future if he changes his mind. Say, “If you ever want to talk about this, just let me know.”
Affectionate touch like hugs and back rubs can be a good way to communicate your love and support to your husband.
You might think about a few ways that you could support him and pass them along for him to think about, making it clear that you mean no pressure.

Give yourselves time to recover from the loss.,
Spend time together.,
Resume sexual activities only when you are ready.,
Confront a husband who refuses to connect.",How to Deal with an Unsupportive Husband After a Miscarriage2," Grief affects everyone differently, and there’s no set timeframe for when you should feel “okay.” Avoid putting pressure on yourself or your husband to recover sooner than you are ready.Be aware that your husband may recover faster than you, or vice versa. Don’t take it personally if he starts to feel better before you do – grieving is unique to each person.
Also, keep in mind that sometimes grief is delayed. It might not set in until months after the miscarriage.

, Ask your husband to go for a walk with you, help you with the grocery shopping, or just be present with you. Spending time with each other can strengthen your bond as a couple and help you support each other through the aftermath of a miscarriage.For example, you could watch a new series or read a new book together to give you something to preoccupy you, talk about, and connect over.

, After a miscarriage, you and your husband may have ambivalent or negative feelings about sex. Avoid rushing into physical intimacy again until you both are emotionally prepared.


Have an examination to make sure sex is safe for you, and communicate with each other about your feelings and fears. Once you are both ready, sex can be a powerful way to bring you closer together.In the meantime, you can trade massages, have a candlelight dinner, or cuddle on the sofa while watching Netflix to maintain intimacy and affection in your marriage. Physical affection is one of the most effective ways to feel better due to the release of Oxytocin in the brain. Exchange long hugs and make genuine eye contact with each other.

, Despite your attempts to establish intimacy with your husband after the miscarriage, he could push you away. Although this is hurtful, you should try your best not to take his withdrawal personally. Different people just grieve differently, and he may require more time.


However, if your husband continues to push you away or even blame you for the loss, you should openly discuss it with him. Find a time when both of you are in pleasant moods, and maybe at a neutral location outside of the home to start this conversation so that it's not threatening. You might say something like, ""I feel like you have grown distant from me since we lost the baby. Can we please talk about that?""
Miscarriage can have a negative impact on your marriage if both partners are not willing to share their feelings.Consider marriage or grief counseling to discuss any unresolved guilt or blame in order to move forward.

Practice good self-care.,
Seek support from other women in your life.,
See a therapist.",How to Deal with an Unsupportive Husband After a Miscarriage3," When you’re in the throes of negative emotions, it’s important to take good care of yourself, even if you don’t feel like it. Start by having a medical examination to make sure your body is recovering. Then work on eating well, getting enough sleep, and doing some light exercise.Activities that promote mindfulness, like meditation and yoga, may help you feel better as well.

, Many women have a firsthand or well-informed perspective on miscarriage. These women will be able to empathize with you and support you. Seek out the company of your mother, a sister, or a close female friend to share your feelings when it’s too hard to bear them alone.There are also online support groups, or sometimes you can find live support groups through your OBGYN or PCP's office.


An estimated one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, so it’s likely that some of the women you know have been in your situation before.

, If you’re having trouble coping with your emotions, or if you’re not feeling any better as time goes on, make an appointment with a therapist.Couples counseling is a good option if your husband is willing to accompany you. Couples counseling will teach you to manage your individual emotions and support each other better as you grieve.

Additionally, your insurance plan may require you to obtain a referral from one of these doctors before consulting with a fertility specialist.If you are male, ask questions such as, “Is it a good idea for me to have my sperm tested for quality and motility?” “Could I have a hormone imbalance causing my problems?”
If you are speaking with your gynecologist, you could ask questions such as, “Can you recommend a specialist who deals with older women trying to conceive?” “What types of tests should I ask the specialist to consider for me?” or “Which fertility experts have the best success rates?”;
, It will be helpful to understand exactly what your specialist has studied and how they will approach your care while you are considering choosing a fertility doctor.


An obstetrician/gynecologist (OB-GYN) specializes in the female reproductive system and may receive training to further specialize in reproductive problems caused by female hormonal imbalances and/or cancers in the female reproductive organs.An andrologist is the male counterpart to the OB-GYN, specializing in the male reproductive organs. They are urologists certified to treat male infertility.A board-certified reproductive endocrinologist is an OB-GYN with an advanced education in female and male reproductive issues. Board-certified reproductive endocrinologists must have at least two additional years of clinical experience and pass written and oral exams., When talking with potential fertility doctors, it is essential that you understand the different treatment options available to you and your partner. The Office on Women’s Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is a good resource for basic information on infertility and treatment.Additionally, reputable medical websites, like mayoclinic.org and clevelandclinic.org, are good sources of information as well.


Fertility drugs, such as clomiphene and gonadotropins, stimulate ovulation. They are the primary treatment for women facing infertility due to problems with ovulation.Intrauterine insemination (IUI) involves healthy sperm being deposited into a woman’s uterus via a catheter. This is timed to take place around the time the woman is ovulating.Sometimes surgery, such as laparoscopy, is performed to correct problems in the woman’s reproductive system, such as blocked fallopian tubes, fibroid removal, or treatment of endometriosis.Assisted reproductive technology (ART) encompasses any fertility treatment in which the egg and sperm are handled by medical professionals. ART includes in vitro fertilization (IVF), in which mature eggs are retrieved from a woman and they are fertilized with the man’s sperm in a lab. The resulting embryos are then implanted into the uterus.Donor eggs or sperm are sometimes used for ART if there are problems with either the eggs or sperm.As surrogate woman may also be used to carry the baby.

, Only some states require insurance coverage for fertility treatment, and not all treatments are required to be covered.


Resolve, the National Infertility Association, has a searchable list of states that require insurance coverage for infertility treatment.Call the member services number for your insurance plan. Ask questions such as, “Do I need pre-certification or a referral to see a fertility specialist?” “What are the copays if I consult a reproductive endocrinologist?” “Am I covered for IVF?”
Other questions to consider asking include, “Are there age limits for infertility treatment?” “Does my plan cover fertility drugs?” “Is all lab work covered?”
Insurance plans typically have online physician searches, which allow you to narrow your choices by specialty and location.

, Odds are, you will develop a close relationship with your fertility doctor and their staff, one that could span several years. When looking for a fertility specialist, look for one who has a calm and patient bedside manner who listens to your questions and takes your concerns seriously. There are other traits to consider as well.


Do you prefer a male or female doctor?
Are there any language or cultural considerations important to you?

, Acquaintances and family members who have struggled with infertility are good resources for finding doctors in your area. They can give you honest advice on the pros and cons and tell you about their own experiences.


You can ask about the doctor’s approach to infertility and how aggressive and fast–acting they are.
Your friends will be able to give you insight into the doctor’s personality and demeanor, as well as those of the support staff at the practice.
Ask questions like, “How long did you have to wait to get in for your first appointment?” and “Was the office environment friendly and supportive?”

, Fertility treatment often requires that you are seen multiple times, sometimes daily for a while. Because of this, you will want to think about how accessible and convenient your doctor and/or clinic is.How far from your house or work is the doctor’s office?
Does the doctor or clinic have early morning or evening hours to accommodate your work schedule?
Can someone at the practice see you on a weekend, if necessary?
Is there a satellite facility where you can receive treatment that is more convenient for you?

, Not everyone who experiences infertility will have to use the services of an IVF clinic, but this may be an important factor in choosing a doctor.


Some clinics have on-site labs and procedure rooms, while others send their patients to local hospitals for procedures and lab work.

, Once you’ve received some referrals from either your own doctor or from friends or relatives, you can try to research these specialists by looking for information online.


Online patient satisfaction reviews, such as those found on HealthGrades.com or RateMDs.com, offer one way to help you assess potential doctors. You can see how the doctors are ranked regarding personality, waiting times, or medical knowledge. While such reviews may be helpful, it is important to remember that they are based on personal opinions, not medical expertise.Members of the Society for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (SREI) must be certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology in both obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive endocrinology. The society’s Website offers an interactive search tool to find credentialed providers in your area.Membership in the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) and adherence to the guidelines set forth by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) are both indications that a provider stays current on industry trends and standards. You can check the Websites of both of these societies to find providers in your area.The licensing board in your state is also a good resource to check for licenses, find out if there are any restrictions on their license, and to see if they have any malpractice lawsuits.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers an interactive Website that features searchable reports of success rates from fertility providers throughout the country. This information can be helpful when choosing a provider., Once you’ve researched your potential doctors through talking with friends and looking for reviews and credentials online, it is time to meet in person with the doctors you are considering. Only through a face-to-face encounter will you be able to tell whether you feel comfortable entrusting the personal matter of infertility treatment with these potential doctors. In addition to gauging your comfort level with each doctor, you also need to get some specific information out of your interviews

, You want to use this opportunity to see whether the doctor is as open to new technology or approaches as you may be or whether they are more aggressive than you prefer when planning your treatment.


Questions to consider asking include “What do you think about pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) or cryopreservation of embryos?” and “Do you implant only one embryo during IVF or multiples?”, From your online research, you probably already know how long they have been in practice and where they went to medical school. Now, you can ask more in-depth questions about how they may treat your issues.You should ask questions such as, “What kind of tests would you recommend for me?” “What treatment would you suggest we try first?” “What are your success rates for people in my age group?” and “How long would we try this method before moving on to something else?”
Other questions to ask include the following: “Do you have an age limit on patients you see?” “What is the rate of multiple births for your practice?” and “What types of complications are common for your procedures?”
You can use this time to sketch out a possible treatment plan with the doctor so that you can compare it with those of other doctors you meet.It is not uncommon for a fertility doctor to partner with a network of other reproductive specialists, so you may see a different doctor each appointment. Find out what you can expect in that regard, as well as who you would call for urgent after-hours situations.

, When you meet in person with the doctors you are considering, pay attention to how they interact with you. This will be a good indicator of how they will treat you once you become their patient.


Some things to consider are whether the doctor is sensitive to your issues or cold and dismissive. It is also important to note whether the doctor listens to you and thoroughly answers your questions.
If a doctor cuts you off mid-sentence or does not answer your questions before moving on, this may not be a good fit for you.

, You will be interacting with many people, such as nurses, therapists, financial advisors, and embryologists. If possible, try to meet with at least some of these auxiliary staff when you meet with your prospective doctor to get a fuller picture of the care you will receive.Additionally, many practices offer payment plans and support services, so it’s a good idea to check about the availability of these as well.


Ask questions such as, “Are counseling services or support groups available?” and “Do you offer alternative therapies and support, such as acupuncture, nutrition classes, or fertility yoga?”To be able to start to understand the costs involved in treatment, be sure to ask questions about payment options: “Does the practice offer payment plans?” and “Do you recommend any financing options to help pay for treatment?”, Making a final decision on a fertility doctor can be daunting, but you can make this easier by reviewing your information and analyzing it systematically.


Use the information you’ve gathered to make a comparison sheet for each doctor and review it with your partner or a close friend.
Remember to emphasize the factors that are most important to you, such as the costs of the different doctors, office locations, or personality of the provider.

, Once you have chosen the right fertility doctor for you, call as soon as possible to set up an appointment. Time is often of the essence in fertility treatment, so you want to get started as quickly as possible.


Since you may have already done some preliminary tests and treatment with your regular OB/Gyn, make sure that your records are sent to your reproductive endocrinologist’s office before your first appointment.

, In the excitement of meeting a potential father for your child, you might forget something, so make sure you have a list to fall back on. Putting some thought into this list will help you get as much as possible out of the meeting.

, Ask the potential donor about his motivations for donating, and see if his answer aligns with your plans. For example, he might be donating because he wants to father a child and expects to be involved in the child's life. This is something you should know before you proceed.

, This will give you an idea of his success as a donor. Think about whether you are still willing to use his semen if he has fathered lots of children.

, It's absolutely crucial to make this clear from the offset. To avoid legal and personal problems in the future, this will need to be clear and recorded from the beginning.

, If you want the donor to be involved in the pregnancy beyond insemination, discuss and strategize his involvement.

, Confirm his age and know that for men over 40 or 45, the potency of their sperm might be lower. Ask about his general health as well.

, Many significant physical and mental health issues are genetic, any medical history from his family could affect your child. You should have a thorough understanding of any issues or potential problems before you make a decision.

, Be upfront when asking about smoking, drinking, and drug use. These may be personal topics, but if he might father your child, you have a right to know.

, If he has not taken a fertility test, ask him to do so at a nearby sexual health clinic. Do not commit until you see those results!

, Again, though this may seem awkward, you have a right to know. Ask him to get tested for any sexually transmitted diseases that might affect you our your child.

, This is often a very high in priority for women looking to receive sperm. Ask about his profession, academic background, and personal hobbies and interests for an overview.

, Remember, no question should feel too personal or embarrassing. You're picking the father of your child - everything about the potential donor could make a difference.

, Never make such an important decision on the spot decision, no matter how perfect he seems! Go home and think, and even sleep on it, before you commit.

Continue to seek social support and therapy throughout the pregnancy (if needed).",How to Have a Safe and Healthy Pregnancy After a Miscarriage," Your first questions after going through a miscarriage may involve around when it is safe to try to conceive again. The correct timing usually depends on two different factors: your physical health and your emotional wellbeing.Physically, it is possible to get pregnant again as soon as menstruation recommences and you start to ovulate. This generally occurs four to six weeks following a miscarriage.
You can begin trying again after one menstrual cycle has passed. However, you can wait longer to try again if you want to.
It may actually be better to conceive sooner than later after a miscarriage. Research suggests that women who get pregnant within 6 months of a miscarriage of their first pregnancy are more likely to carry to term versus those who wait two years or more.;
, Miscarriage can be devastating emotionally both for you and your partner. Thus, it is important you allow yourself to grieve and do not rush into a new pregnancy too soon.


Even if you are physically ready for another pregnancy, it might take you longer to prepare emotionally. Thus, you should assess your emotional wellbeing before you try to get pregnant again to ensure you are ready both physically and emotionally.
Talk with your partner and sort through your feelings together. Do not shut each other out but instead understand the emotional toll that the miscarriage had for each of you.
If you are having difficulty dealing with the miscarriage, consider hiring a therapist. They can help you to work through any feelings of sadness, anger or guilt that you are feeling and enable you to accept the loss.

, Miscarriage can occur for a variety of reasons, even if you are perfectly healthy. Becoming aware of possible causes of miscarriage can help you find direction in your family planning. There are some factors that cause miscarriage that are out of your control:Genetic abnormalities within the fetus can cause the pregnancy to terminate prematurely, which is the most common cause of miscarriages.
Uterine abnormalities may trigger a miscarriage if the uterus cannot support the pregnancy; uterine polyps or scar tissue are examples.
Your chance of suffering from a miscarriage increases as you advance in age or if you have a chronic illness.
However, there are some factors that increase the risk of miscarriage that you can change including stopping smoking, avoiding alcohol, maintaining a normal weight, and reducing stress. Consuming lots of caffeine may also increase your risk of miscarriage, but a moderate amount of caffeine will not.Try to keep your caffeine intake below 200mg per day, which is about the same as a 12 ounce cup of coffee.
In addition, certain infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and poliomyelitis) may cause miscarriage and thus you should consult your doctor how to avoid these.

, If you have had multiple miscarriages, then you may need to have some tests run to check for problems. Before trying to get pregnant again, you can undergo diagnostic tests to help you navigate any underlying fertility issues.A blood test allows your doctors to determine hormone levels in your bloodstream and any components of your immune system that may affect your pregnancy.Chromosomal tests from both you and your partner allow your doctor to discern if you are carriers for chromosomal abnormalities that might lead to a miscarriage.An ultrasound allows your doctor to create an image of the internal organs in your pelvis, allowing them to identify if there are abnormalities with your uterus.A hysteroscopy is another imaging test during which your doctor inserts a camera into your birth canal in order to see your uterine walls and fallopian tubes., Genetic carrier testing provides important insights about the genetic material you pass on to a possible child. Meeting with a genetic counselor allows you to find out if you are a carrier for a genetic disease.


Some genetic disorders contribute to increased risk of miscarriage if there is a chromosomal abnormality in the fetus., You can increase your body’s ability to support a healthy pregnancy by preparing it ahead of time. Ensuring you get all the necessary vitamins and minerals is one of the first steps you can take.


Pregnancy increases the demands on your body and thus, preparing beforehand can help your body be ready for the pregnancy.One of the vitamins that is essential for a healthy pregnancy is folic acid. Because deficiency in folic acid can increase the risk of neural tube defects, it is vital you eat foods high in folic acid (such as cereal, spinach, asparagus, broccoli, avocado, mango and oranges) or start taking pre-natal vitamins even before you try to conceive.Your body also needs more iron during pregnancy. Iron is a component of a protein called hemoglobin, which is necessary for carrying oxygen. Thus, taking iron supplementation or eating iron-rich foods (such as spinach, broccoli, wheat germ, lean red meat, poultry and chicken liver) before conception can help support conception and the early phases of pregnancy.Calcium is another important mineral during pregnancy. Calcium is the main element that helps in the formation of the baby's bones and teeth. Calcium is present in dairy products, seafood, kale, collard greens, broccoli, tofu and green snap beans., Because weight gain and loss can affect your body’s ability to maintain a pregnancy, it is important to keep it in check. Make sure that you are maintaining a healthy weight for your height and body type.If you are overweight, try to lose some weight before you get pregnant. This is a good place to analyze your diet and start eating healthier for you (and your baby).
Start a regular exercise program that you can also continue during your pregnancy. Try walking, jogging or swimming, which are often also safe to do during pregnancy.
If you are underweight, you may want to analyze your diet and ensure you are getting enough nutrients and calories to support you. During pregnancy, it is even more vital to get enough calories and nutrients to support your growing baby.

, Caffeinated beverages should be generally avoided while trying to get pregnant. Elevated levels of caffeine have been linked to miscarriage.March of Dimes recommends that you should limit your caffeine intake to the equivalent of one cup of coffee (less than 200 mg of caffeine) while trying to conceive.Also check the caffeine content of other beverages (such as teas and sodas) and even medications.

, Stress can negatively affect your health and pregnancy by affecting your body, appetite, energy levels, and sleeping patterns. Take steps to reduce stress and learn to manage your stress levels before and during pregnancy.Heightened stress during early pregnancy can raise your blood pressure and have negative effects on the baby.Because stress affects your amount of energy and your appetite, it can adversely affect your weight when you are trying to get pregnant.
Reduce stress by engaging in meditation, breathing exercises, and yoga


, Alcohol, cigarettes, and illegal drugs are not only harmful to your health but also to the health of your baby. Using harmful substances can decrease your chances of conceiving, increase the risk of miscarriage, and impact your ability to have a healthy pregnancy.Alcohol, the nicotine in cigarettes and the content of certain drugs can cause harmful and irreversible effects to the growing fetus. Thus, it is a good idea to stop using these products even before you become pregnant.

, Prenatal checkups allow your doctor to assess your health and follow your pregnancy to ensure your baby is developing normally and you are not suffering from any complications.Pre-natal checkups are often scheduled once a month for the first two trimesters. As you get closer to your due date, your doctor may want to increase the frequency of the checkups.The purpose of pre-natal checkups is to make sure you and your baby are healthy and the pregnancy is moving along as it should. This includes ensuring you are doing well both physically and mentally.
If you have any concerns about your pregnancy, pre-natal checkups are the place to bring these to your doctors attention.
Your doctor can also give you valuable advice about your diet, exercise routine, and dietary supplements in order to maintain a healthy pregnancy.

, Maintaining a healthy weight helps support a healthy pregnancy for both you and your baby. If you have a healthy weight before pregnancy, a normal weight gain during pregnancy is usually around 25 to 35 pounds total.However, if you are overweight before pregnancy, you should only gain about 15 to 25 pounds. If you are obese, your weight gain should be even less (around 11 to 20 pounds).
If you are underweight before pregnancy, you should be able to safely gain anywhere between 28 and 40 pounds during pregnancy.
The general guidance recommends you gain 2-4 pounds a week during the first trimester and 1 pound a week during the rest of your pregnancy.
Gaining too much weight can increase your risk of complications such as gestational diabetes and premature birth.

, Your developing baby relies on you for all nutrients and calories and thus, it is essential you eat a balanced diet that helps support both you and your baby.Your nutritional needs increase when you become pregnant, meaning that you need more protein and vitamins in order to accommodate your body’s changes and to meet your baby’s developmental needs.
However, this does not mean you can eat anything you want. In fact, you should only get around 300 extra calories per day compared with your normal calorie need.You also should not gain your extra calories from eating unhealthy foods that are high in saturated fats and simple sugars.
Build your diet around lean protein (chicken, turkey, low-fat dairy), leafy green vegetables (kale, spinach), fresh fruits, and whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat pasta and bread).
Monitor your intake of fish. While fish contain many good nutrients, they also contain mercury, which can be harmful to your baby.You should also avoid raw seafood (so say no to raw sushi and opt for cooked rolls), lunch meats and other uncooked foods that can cause a food poisoning.

, Regular exercise is not only good for maintaining proper weight gain, but it also helps you to prepare for the delivery. Labor and giving birth has a great toll on your body. Having a strong cardiovascular system and muscle tone can help you get through the long hours of labor and delivery more easily and prepared.


Regular exercise also helps you prepare for the extra weight you gain during pregnancy, including building your muscle tone to support your growing belly and strengthening your cardiovascular system.If you were not physically active before pregnancy, consult your doctor and start slowly. Walking, swimming and yoga are great low-impact exercises that are generally safe during pregnancy.Avoid strenuous, high-impact exercises later in pregnancy and anything that bears a risk for falls and injuries (such as skiing, horseback riding and team sports with risk of collision)., Because your baby receives a blood supply from you, any chemicals that pass the placenta will come into contact with your baby and can cause fetal abnormalities.You can come into contact with harmful environmental chemicals at work or at home without even realizing it.
Even secondhand smoke can be harmful for your developing baby.
If you work in an environment that exposes you to radiation or harmful chemicals, talk to your doctor about how to properly protect yourself.
Blood-borne illnesses (such as HIV and toxoplasmosis) can also harm your baby. If you are exposed, see a doctor right away.To reduce risk of toxoplasmosis, avoid contact with cat waste and if you have a cat, ask your partner to change the cat's litter box. You should also wash your hands after gardening and avoid eating under cooked meat, especially lamb, venison, and pork., Your body goes through dramatic changes during pregnancy. Getting enough rest helps you successfully navigate those changes.


Getting at least six hours of sleep a night decreases your chance of needing to have a C-section.Your energy level and health are directly linked to your amount of sleep, so make sure you rest up., Having a proper support network throughout the pregnancy can help dampen the stress and ensure you are well-supported during your pregnancy.


Even if you are healthy and your pregnancy is moving along as it should, your previous miscarriage can loom in your mind and cause you to feel stressed, even unconsciously. Having a support network behind you will help you if you feel vulnerable and need someone to talk to.

Think about when you last had sex.,
Notice when you've missed your period.,
Watch for changes in your breasts.,
Check if you're feeling overly tired.,
Pay attention to stomach problems.,
Notice if you're running to the bathroom more to urinate.,
Look for implantation bleeding.,
Keep an eye out for mood swings.,
Watch out for dizziness.",How to Know if You are Pregnant1," You must have had vaginal sex to be pregnant. Oral sex doesn't count in this case. Also, consider whether you practiced safe sex. If you weren't on a birth control pill and didn't use another form of contraception (such as a diaphragm or condom), you have a much higher chance of getting pregnant than if you did practice safe sex.It actually takes about six to ten days after you have sex for the fertilized egg to start the implantation process, which is when you officially become pregnant. That's also when your body starts releasing hormones. A pregnancy test is generally not accurate until after the first day of your missed period.;
, A missed period is often one of the first signs that you may be pregnant. If you go past your expected start date by a week or more, that could be an indicator that you're pregnant.If you track your period, figuring out when you had your period last should be easy. If you don't, try to remember the last time you had your period. If it's been more than a month, it could mean you're pregnant.
However, this indicator isn't foolproof, especially if you have irregular periods.

, While your breasts will increase in size over the course of your pregnancy,you may also notice changes early on. Hormones fluctuate in your body when you become pregnant, which can cause tenderness and swelling in your breasts. Once you adapt to the hormonal changes, this particular pain should decrease., Pregnancy can often bring on fatigue. You're growing a new life inside you, and that's hard work. However, in early pregnancy, this tiredness is more due to the fact that you have an increase in the hormone progesterone, which causes drowsiness., ""Morning sickness"" is a common issue, which refers to nausea which tends to be more. It's a term that refers to the fact that many women get nauseous during pregnancy and typically in the morning. (Although it can occur at any time of the day). Often, this symptom starts about two weeks after conception and eases up after the first trimester.You may also experience aversion to strong smells or certain foods, while at the same time, you may start craving other foods.You may have other digestive problems like constipation.
Note that while this is a common symptom of pregnancy, many women do not have morning sickness or food or smell aversion during gestation. While it is a trope in television and movies, in reality many women do not have this issue.
Many women develop a heightened sense of smell, and pick up on noxious smells like spoilage, smoke, and body odors more sensitively. It does not necessarily lead to nausea if exposed to smells.

, One of the early symptoms you may notice is running to the bathroom to urinate more often. This symptom, like many of the symptoms you'll experience if pregnant, is due to a change in hormones.Later in the pregnancy, the baby can put pressure on your bladder, which causes you to run to the bathroom. However, early in pregnancy, frequent urination is more likely to be due to hormonal changes.

, Some women have a bit of spotting around when their period should begin. You may notice a bit of blood in your underwear or some brownish discharge. It may continue for a few weeks, but it will likely be lighter than your normal period., The hormonal changes of pregnancy can affect your moods, causing you to be euphoric one minute and crying the next minute. While not everyone gets mood swings early on, it can happen. If you find you're crying at the drop of a hat or snapping at your loved ones, that could be an indicator you're pregnant., Dizziness can happen at any time during pregnancy, including early pregnancy. In early pregnancy, the cause is likely the fact that your body is creating new blood vessels (causing a change in blood pressure). However, it could also be caused by low blood sugar."

Take a home pregnancy test.,
Decide if you need to do it again with a negative result.,
Confirm a positive result with a doctor.",How to Know if You are Pregnant2," A pregnancy test is very accurate if you take it after you should have had your period. You can buy pregnancy tests at drugstores, big box stores, and grocery stores. You'll find them with either the family planning products or feminine hygiene products.A few tests are accurate before your missed period, but it should say so on the box.Take the test when you wake up, as it will be more accurate. Follow the directions on your box, but generally, you urinate on one end of a stick that has a test strip. After you're done, put it on a flat surface.
Give it about five minutes or so to work. The package should tell you what to be looking for. Some tests show two lines for pregnant, while others are a single blue line., Most of the time, if you get a negative result, you're not pregnant. However, if you did the test too early (before your first missed period), it may come back with a negative result even if you are pregnant. If you want to be sure, you may need to take the test again.Try taking it again after you should have had a period.

, Although modern home pregnancy tests are highly accurate, you want to be 100% sure. Plus, if you are pregnant, you'll want to make a plan, such as deciding if you want to keep the baby or starting prenatal care. You can either take a confidential urine test at a family planning clinic like Planned Parenthood or at your physician's or gynecologist's office.Even if a urine test is positive, your doctor may draw blood to confirm that you are pregnant. Then the doctor can help you figure out a plan.

Decide if you are in a place to raise a child.,
Discuss it with your partner.,
Begin prenatal care.,
Consider if you want to end the pregnancy.,
Research adoption.",How to Know if You are Pregnant3," If the pregnancy came as a surprise, you'll need to decide if you want to keep the baby or not. Think about whether you're in a place to raise a child, both physically and financially. If you're not, could you make the necessary changes to care for the child? A child is a big responsibility, emotionally, physically, and financially. While no parent is perfect, you should at least want the responsibility of caring for another human life., Think about whether you would want to raise a child with the father of the baby. Your relationship needs to be mature enough to handle the responsibility of caring for and raising a child.If the father is someone you would considering raising a child with, discuss your pregnancy with them to see how you want to move forward together.


If the father is not around, discuss the pregnancy and your situation with someone who cares about you, such as a parent or a sibling, just to have someone to bounce ideas off of.

, If you decide to go through with having the baby, you'll start prenatal care.Prenatal care is basically keeping the baby healthy through regular checkups at the doctor. Your doctor will check on your own health, including screening for sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, and the health of the baby at your first visit. Your doctor will help you set up a schedule for the rest of your visits., You may decide that you don't want to have the baby, and that's a valid choice. If that's the case, your main option is an abortion, though the morning after pill can work up to five days after you've had sex.Research abortion clinics in your area. They can help you with your options. Keep in mind, though, many states and countries have laws in place that require doctors to tell you certain information, which is intended to discourage you from having an abortion. Don't let it discourage you if an abortion is what you desire - just make sure you are fully aware of all the risks involved in having an abortion. Some states may require an ultrasound before you can have an abortion. Depending on the state, you may need to get your parent's permission if you're under 18.The two main types of abortion in the first trimester are medical and surgical. Don't let the word ""surgical"" scare you, as it generally doesn't involve any cutting. Usually, a tube or forceps are used to open your cervix, and then a suction action is used.A medical abortion is when a pill is used to induce abortion., If you want to have the baby but feel like you can't raise it yourself, then giving your baby up for adoption can be another option. It is a difficult decision to make, and it is one that is binding, once the papers are signed. If you think this option is for you, begin by reading books about it, researching on the internet, talking to close friends, and talking to an adoption lawyer or an adoption professional.Talk to the father. In many states in the United States, the father has to give his consent before the adoption becomes official. If you are under 18, you need to talk to your parents before making a decision.
Decide what kind of adoption you want. You can go through an agency or you can hire a lawyer to arrange an independent adoption outside of an agency.
Choose the adoptive parents carefully. You may want a family who raises your child in your faith tradition, or you may want a family that's open to you being in the child's life. Also, in some adoptions, the parents may pay for your prenatal care and other medical expenses.

Seek therapy or counseling if you are feeling emotional or upset.,
Maintain a well balanced diet and a healthy weight.,
Exercise daily, but avoid strenuous activity.,
Take daily prenatal vitamins and folic acid supplements.,

Avoid all medications and drugs, unless necessary.",How to Prepare Your Body for Pregnancy After Miscarriage," It can be very difficult to deal with your emotions in the aftermath of a miscarriage and you may feel like you should try to get pregnant again as soon as possible to move on. Some women feel empty and want to fill this emptiness by trying to get pregnant again a few days or weeks after their miscarriage. But it is recommended that you give your body time to recover and rest by waiting at least one to two months, or two periods, to try to get pregnant again.Physically, it will take only a few hours to a few days to recover from the pregnancy and your period should return in four to six weeks. But it is important not to rush the grieving process and to take some time to come to terms with your loss.Some healthcare practitioners recommend waiting six months to before trying to conceive, but no research has confirmed it is necessary to wait that long to conceive after a miscarriage. If you are healthy, you have had at least one period, and you are ready to conceive again, you do not need to wait.;
, Talk to your doctor about any risks or complications that may have occurred due to the miscarriage.Some women may experience a molar pregnancy, which is a noncancerous tumor that develops on their uterus. This occurs when the placenta develops into an abnormal mass of cysts and prevents a viable pregnancy. If you have had a molar pregnancy, it is recommended that you wait six months to one year before trying to conceive again.
If you miscarry due to an ectopic pregnancy or have had an ectopic pregnancy in the past, your doctor should examine your fallopian tubes to ensure one or both of them are not blocked or damaged. If you have a blocked or damaged fallopian tube, your risk of another ectopic pregnancy may increase., Women who have had more than one miscarriage in their lifespan should undergo testing to determine if there are any underlying issues before attempting to get pregnant again. Your doctor may conduct tests like:A hormonal factors test: Your doctor will test your thyroid level, and possibly your prolactin and progesterone levels. If they are abnormal, your doctor will give you treatment and then re-test you at a later date to check your levels.
A hysterosalpingogram: This exam is done to check the shape and size of your uterus and any scarring in the uterus, as well as polyps, fibroids, or a septal wall. These could all affect the implantation of another egg during IVF so its important to evaluate your uterus for these issues. Your doctor may also do a hysteroscopy in your uterine cavity, which is an exam done with a small camera through your cervix.
Other potential tests include a blood test or even DNA testing of both partners or an ultrasound.

, To ensure you have a smooth pregnancy after a miscarriage, you should be tested for infections like STIs and treated for any infections before trying to conceive again. Certain infections can increase your risk of another miscarriage, including:Chlamydia: This is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that usually has no symptoms. If you or your partner may be infected, get tested and treated before trying to get pregnant.
Infections in your uterus or vagina: Your doctor can test you for any infections in these areas and provide treatment.
Listeria: This infection is caused by consuming unpasteurized cheese or milk.
Toxoplasmosis: This infection is contracted through dirty fruit and vegetables, as well as meat. Always cook meat thoroughly and wash all fresh fruit and salads. Wear gloves when cleaning out litter trays for cats and when gardening, as cats carry this infection in their guts.
Parvovirus: This is a viral infection, also referred to as “slap-cheek”. It can cause a miscarriage, though most women who are infected can have a normal pregnancy.

, Your doctor may be able to refer you to a support group or a counselor for you and your partner as you go through the emotional process of dealing with a miscarriage. Talking to others who have experienced the same loss you have may help you to find some peace and closure. Going through the grieving process together with your partner can also strengthen your relationship and better prepare you both for getting pregnant again.You can also reach out to family and friends for support. Sometimes, it helps just to have someone close to you listen to your anxiety and fear around trying to get pregnant again.

, To reduce your risk of another miscarriage, you should eat a well balanced diet that contains the four food groups: fruits and vegetables, protein, dairy and grains.Make sure your daily diet consists of five portions of fresh or frozen fruit, six ounces or less of protein like meat, fish, eggs, soya, or tofu, three to four servings of fresh or frozen vegetables, six to eight servings of grains like bread, rice, pasta, and breakfast cereals, and two to three servings of dairy like yogurt and hard cheeses.It is also important that you maintain a healthy weight for your age and body type. Avoid being underweight or overweight. You can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) using an online BMI calculator and determine how many calories per a day you should be consuming to maintain a healthy weight.

, When you are recovering from a miscarriage, it is important that you avoid intense exercise and focus on mild activity, like walking, yoga or meditation. Maintaining a daily exercise routine will keep you feeling healthy and energized. It can also ensure your body is at its best and ready to conceive again.Doing gentle exercise like yoga can also help you reduce any stress or anxiety you may be experiencing due to the miscarriage. Managing your stress is essential to remaining healthy and ready for pregnancy., Maintaining a well balanced diet and a healthy weight through exercise will provide your body with many essential nutrients and minerals. But prenatal vitamins and supplements like folic acid have been shown to reduce the risk of a miscarriage and having a baby that is premature or small for its gestational age. Talk to your doctor about taking folic acid supplements to help you recover from the miscarriage.Folic acid supplements can help to reduce the risk of neural tube defects like spina bifida, where your baby’s spinal cord does not develop normally. Once you become pregnant, you will be prescribed folic acid supplements free of charge.

, Research has shown that drinking, smoking, and caffeine consumption can increase your risk of a miscarriage.Limit or cut out alcohol from your diet. Women who drink every day and or more than 14 units a week have a higher risk of miscarriage. Stick to one to two units of alcohol a week or stop drinking completely while you try to conceive. If your partner is a heavy drinker, this could reduce the quantity and quality of his sperm.
Be safe and cut down on smoking or stop smoking while you try to conceive.
Pregnant women are told to limit their caffeine intake to 200mg a day, or two mugs of coffee. Keep in mind caffeine can also be found in green tea, energy drinks, and some soft drinks. There may also be caffeine in certain cold and flu remedies and in chocolate. Try to cut down on caffeine, especially when you are trying to conceive.

, Unless your doctor recommends certain medications to treat an infection or other medical issue, you should avoid all medications and drugs when you are trying to get pregnant. Avoid over the counter medications, as well as herbal remedies. Herbal remedies are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so you should always check with your doctor before you take any herbal remedies or medications.If you are taking antibiotics for an infection, wait until you have completed the antibiotic course and the infection has cleared up to try to conceive.
If you are taking medication for an ectopic pregnancy, wait three months after methotrexate treatment to try to get pregnant.
If you are being treated for an illness or infection, wait until you have finished the medication course before you try to conceive.

Know that your baby is safe.,
Get vaccinated.,
Treat HPV.,
Recognize the symptoms of genital warts.,
Learn about cervical cancer.,
Understand other cancer risks.",How to Become Pregnant With HPV," If you are pregnant and you know you have HPV, it's important to get regular screenings for cervical cancer throughout the pregnancy. This can help prevent the chances of complications arising down the line., Many pregnant women with genital warts caused by HPV find that the warts increase in size and and spread during the course of a pregnancy.Because of this, it is important to prevent the outbreak from worsening in order to prevent complications during pregnancy.


Talk to your OB/GYN about a safe way to treat wart outbreaks during pregnancy.Some OB/GYNs may recommend holding off on treatment until after the delivery. Your OB/GYN's course of action will most likely be determined based on the scope of your outbreak and the likelihood that it may cause complications during delivery., In some cases, HPV-related genital warts may become large enough or spread out enough to block the birth canal. In these cases, a cesarean section (C-section) may be necessary to safely extract the baby.Talk to your doctor and OB/GYN about the risk of birth complications caused by genital warts, and if necessary, create a C-section plan with your doctor.

, Having HPV does not typically cause any complications for the baby.


It is possible for a mother to transmit HPV to her baby during the delivery, and that transmission may cause respiratory issues or genital warts in the baby.However, these cases are very rare.Even when HPV is transmitted to the baby he is typically able to recover from the symptoms, either with his own immune system or through medical intervention., Vaccines, when given to males and females at an early age (around 11 to 12 years old), have been shown to prevent the contraction of HPV and its complications, including genital warts.Young women should be given two vaccines - Cervarix and Gardasil - around age 11 to 12 to prevent the forms of HPV that are most likely to cause cervical cancer. These vaccines also prevent the contraction of genital warts and anal, vaginal, and vulvar cancers.Young women through the age of 26 may still be given the Cervarix and Gardasil vaccines if they were not fully vaccinated at a younger age.Young men should be given the vaccine Gardasil around age 11 to 12 to protect against genital warts and anal cancers. Young men through age 26 may still be given the Gardasil vaccine if they were not properly vaccinated at a younger age.Vaccines cannot be used to treat HPV once it has been acquired. Vaccines also cannot be used to prevent cancer once HPV has been contracted. The vaccines are only effective in individuals who have not yet acquired HPV., Treatment typically involves removal of warts or application of antiviral medication to treat precancerous lesions.The exact course of treatment will vary, depending on the individual's health and the doctor's recommendations..


At-home treatments for genital warts include Podofilox, Imiquimod, and Sinecatechins. These prescription-strength medications are applied to the affected area to remove genital warts.Your doctor may administer cryotherapy every one to two weeks as needed to freeze warts.Podophyllin resin may be administered by your doctor every one to two weeks as needed.Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloracetic acid (BCA) may be administered by your doctor every one to two weeks as needed.Surgical removal may be recommended by your doctor. Do not attempt to surgically remove genital warts at home., Genital warts are a common complication of HPV, though the transmission of HPV does not always lead to genital warts.Approximately 360,000 individuals acquire genital warts each year in the United States alone.Genital warts may appear as a small bump or group of bumps. There is great variance in the appearance and size of genital warts. They may appear small or large, raised off the skin or flat, or may appear lumpy like a cauliflower crown.If left untreated, genital warts may go away on their own, they may remain unchanged, or they may spread and grow larger.Genital warts that grow large and spread to the birth canal may cause complications during a pregnancy., Cervical cancer is the second most common form of cancer in women living in under-developed regions of the world. In 2012 it caused almost 270,000 deaths worldwide.Cervical cancer usually does not present any noticeable symptoms until it enters advanced stages, at which point it can become life-threatening and difficult to treat.Having regular Pap tests can help identify and treat cervical cancer before it enters the advanced stages. Regular Pap tests are the most effective means of detecting and preventing cervical cancer., Though cervical cancer is the most serious complication related to HPV transmission, the virus has been linked to numerous other types of cancers that can affect both men and women worldwide.


Vulvar cancer - cancer of the vulva (the outer portion of female genitalia) is often caused by HPV. Almost seven out of every ten cases of vulvar cancer, and virtually all incidents of vulvar pre-cancer, are linked to HPV transmission. Routine physical examinations by a medical professional are the best means of detecting vulvar cancer.Vaginal cancer - over seven out of every ten cases of vaginal cancer are linked to HPV transmission. The same Pap tests used to detect cervical cancer are sometimes used to detect vaginal cancer and pre-cancer.Penile cancer - men exposed to high-risk HPV strains may develop cancer of the penis. In fact, roughly six out of every ten cases of penile cancer are linked to HPV transmission. There is currently no approved screening test to detect the early stages of penile cancer, and many cases go undetected until the later stages of cancer.Anal cancer - nearly all cases of squamous cell cancer of the anus across both men and women are caused by HPV transmission. The best way to detect anal cancer is by performing an anal cytology test, sometimes referred to as an anal Pap test. These exams are typically only performed on individuals determined to be at a high risk of cancer formation, such as people with compromised immune systems or individuals who have received an organ transplant.Mouth and throat cancer - over seven out of every ten cases of cancer in the back of the throat (including the tongue and tonsils) are linked to HPV transmission. Mouth and throat cancer, also known as oropharyngeal cancer, does not currently have any approved screening test to detect the early stages."

Rest as much as possible during the first 24 hours.,
Take painkillers to relieve abdominal cramping.,
Monitor your temperature, as it could be a sign of infection.,
Use sanitary towels or tampons to control bleeding.,
Use hot and cold compresses to ease cramping and headaches.,
Follow a healthy diet, as it will help your body to heal.,
Avoid having sex for the first 1 to 2 months following a miscarriage.",How to Care for Yourself After a Miscarriage1," It is essential that you rest as much as possible in the 24 hours immediately following a miscarriage, as this gives your body time to adjust to its new condition and recover from the loss.


Sleep as much as possible — if you are having difficulty in getting to sleep, try drinking a glass of warm milk. The warm fluid will relax your body and help to induce sleep.
Between resting periods, try stretching your arms and legs for ten minutes each. You can also take daily 20 minutes walks — the exercise is good for you and will help you to sleep better.;
, Abdominal cramping is very common following a miscarriage and is usually accompanied by bleeding. The pain varies from person to person, and can depend on whether the fetus was expelled naturally, or removed surgically.


Taking drugs like ibuprofen help to relieve the pain, while drugs like cyclopam and buscopan are antispasmodics which lessen pain by reducing the strength of the contractions in the muscles of the uterus.
The pain of the cramping should reduce naturally over time. If the pain increases over time, it is advisable to seek medical attention, as there may be more tissue left in the uterus that will need to be removed.

, For the first five days following a miscarriage, it is recommended that you check your temperature everyday. Any temperature over 37.60 degrees C (99.7 degrees F) should be reported to your doctor, as a high temperature may be a sign of infection in your uterus or elsewhere.

, Heavy to moderate vaginal bleeding is expected following a miscarriage, as the uterus expels tissue leftover from the pregnancy. Sanitary towels should be used to absorb the heavier bleeding, but you can switch to tampons once it eases off a little. Both sanitary towels and tampons should be changed every 8 hours, at the very minimum.


You should also make an effort to shower at least once a day (and preferably twice). This helps to maintain good hygiene and reduces your chances of developing an infection.
Avoid douching and don't use any strong disinfectant soaps or chemicals around the vagina. This can irritate the area and cause an infection.

, Hot and cold compresses can be used to relieve the pain of headaches, along with abdominal cramps and back pain. Alternating between hot and cold compresses is a good idea, as heat helps to relax the muscles, while cold helps to numb any pain.


You can buy special hot and cold packs for this very purpose, or you can make your own by soaking a washcloth in hot or cold water and wringing it out before using. You could also use a bag of frozen peas for a cold compress and a hot water bottle for a hot compress.
Press the hot compress against the painful area for 20 to 25 minutes at a time, then switch to the cold one, or vice versa.

, Following a healthy diet is essential after a miscarriage, as healthy foods will help the body to heal itself and allow it function normally. It will also give you more energy, which will help you to feel better overall. Eating poorly will only make you feel worse.


Follow a balanced diet that contains healthy portions of protein, carbohydrates, fiber and fat. Try to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day.
Increase your calcium intake to about 200mg per day. Any calcium is absorbed by the baby during pregnancy, so you may be deficient following a miscarriage. Drink milk, eat dairy products and eat fish such as sardines and salmon.
Increase your folic acid intake. Folic acid is necessary in blood formation and you tend to lose a lot of blood following a miscarriage. Get more folic acid in your diet by taking a supplement and eating leafy green vegetables and fruits.

, It is advisable to avoid having sexual intercourse for the first 1 to 2 months following a miscarriage — this gives the vagina time to heal.


Once you begin having sex again, it is recommended that you use contraceptives because there is an increased likelihood of becoming pregnant again before your normal period is due (usually one month to six weeks after the miscarriage).
This is particularly important if you and your partner do not want to conceive again so soon.

Plan what you want to say.,
Choose the right time.,
Talk to your younger child.,
Break the news to an older child.,
Have a support system.",How to Explain Miscarriage to Children1," This will be a difficult, but important conversation. You may want to take some time to carefully consider what you want to say to your child. You might be emotional when breaking the news, so it can be useful to have an idea of what you want to say.Decide if you want to bring faith into the conversation. If you are a religious person, you may choose to explain that the baby went to heaven.
Remember that children can't always understand complex concepts. It is best to keep your explanation simple.
You might try saying, ""The baby wasn't healthy, so he wasn't able to keep living."" Decide whether or not you want to use the words ""death"" or ""dead"".;
, Children are very sensitive to moods and emotions. Even a small child can tell when you are sad or upset. Try to find a time to tell your child about the miscarriage as soon as you are feeling up to it.Pick a time when your child will have the best attention span. For example, you may not want to broach the subject when he is hungry or getting ready to head to school.
Make sure that you will have plenty of time to talk. Your child might have lots of questions, so it's a good idea to have this discussion when you have time to answer them.
Explain to your child that you want to have an important discussion. You can try saying, ""Tom, I need to talk to you about something really important. Do you have time to sit down and talk to me?""

, When you are deciding how to tell a child about your miscarriage, it is important to take your child's age into account. You will want to base your words and explanation on their comprehension level. For example, your preschooler might not have a grasp on what it means to die.Be honest and direct with a young child. Keep your words simple. You don't need to offer any medical explanations.
Try to avoid saying that you ""lost"" the baby. Your child might think you simply misplaced the baby, and could find it later. Your child could also worry that he might get lost, too.
It's usually best not to say, ""The baby feel asleep and didn't wake up."" This could cause your young child to develop a fear of going to sleep.
You could try saying, ""Remember how mommy was pregnant? Something happened to the baby and it could not live. So that baby is not going to come to live with us.""

, You can be a little more specific when you are talking to an older child. By the age of 8 or 9, most kids will have a pretty clear understanding of death. Teenagers can understand death the same way that adults do.It is still best to be direct and honest. You can try saying, ""Susan, I had a miscarriage. The baby died.""
Older children might have even more questions for you than younger children. Be ready to address what, specifically, happened. If the doctor doesn't know what caused the miscarriage, you can share that information.
Allow your children to comfort you. Your child may want to offer you comfort and support. You can say, ""Yes, thank you, a hug would be wonderful right now.""

, After a miscarriage, you may be feeling a wide range of emotions. Remember that is completely normal. If you think it would help, consider having someone there to support you when you talk to your child. It might give you some comfort during a difficult conversation.A younger child might respond well to having someone else in the room. You might become very emotional, which can sometimes frighten small children.
Ask a close, trusted friend to be with you. You could say, ""Ann, I have to tell the kids about my miscarriage. Would you mind being there, just to support me and them?""
A grandparent or other family member might be another good choice. You might explain, ""Mom, I have to have a tough talk with Amy. Could you be there to help me answer her questions?""

Hook them up with another friend.,
Find them some good, helpful books on the subject.",How to Console Someone Who Had a Miscarriage," Many people don't know how to react when someone they care about goes through a great loss like this. It is common to feel like maybe you shouldn't say anything: either because acknowledging it is too painful or because you're afraid that you'll say something hurtful. However, saying nothing can be even more hurtful than saying the wrong thing. Do acknowledge this terrible loss, even if only briefly. It will help and even this small gesture can make them feel less alone.


All you have to say is something like, ""I heard that you lost your child. I want to extend my deepest sympathy to you and your whole family. Please, let me know if there's anything at all that I can do to help you."";
, Many people just don't know what to say in deeply serious situations like this. Admitting that you don't know how to react in a helpful way can actually, in itself, be helpful to your friend. When you do this, you show your humanity and communicate that you aren't avoiding them because they feel tainted or because you think they did something wrong. It also shows that you honestly do care about their feelings and don't want them to be hurt further.


Say something like, ""I don't really know what to say to make this better. I'm not very good at this kind of thing. But I hope you know that I am very sorry for your loss.""

, The best place to start when consoling your friend is to simply ask her if there's anything that you can do. She might not want consoling, but there might be someone other way in which she could use your help. She'll know best what she needs from you right now.


It is important that if you tell her you would like to do something for her, that you do what she asks. Going back on your word at this point can leave an incredibly powerful negative impact on your relationship.

, You may find that your friend does not seem that upset by her loss. You may also find that your friend grieves very openly and loudly. Your friend might start acting very differently, such as always wanting to go out. On the other hand, she might want to just hide herself away and cut off most contact. These are all normal reactions to grief. Even if you went through a miscarriage yourself, you can't expect your friend to grieve in the same way.


For example, you have another friend that's gone through the same experience and commemorates every anniversary of their terrible loss. This doesn't mean that your friend who has just lost their child will want to do the same and you shouldn't push them with phrases like ""this is the best way"" or ""you'll feel better"".

, You might feel like your friend is grieving for too long over what may have been a short pregnancy. No matter how short the pregnancy was, the sense of grief can still be overwhelming, especially if the woman was particularly hopeful or excited for this baby. Everyone grieves in different ways and even if you feel that you would have been over it by now, it's important not to judge your friend for taking a long time getting back to normality.


Even having another child will not always remove the sense of loss of this child. They may always feel a slight sense of grief. This is normal and should not be looked down upon.

, Most of the things that people usually say in this situation are exactly the wrong things to say to someone who is grieving. This is most common when the person saying these things has not experienced real grief before. Your best bet is to avoid any comment which minimizes the sense of loss that your friend and her partner are feeling right now. Don't say things that downplay the situation or make it sound like a bump in the road. Even if it's true, those kind of comments don't help.Avoid these common phrases:


""Don't worry. You can try for another baby again later.""
""Maybe you should have..."", ""Maybe you shouldn't have..."", ""Did the doctor say what happened?"" and other statements which shift blame onto the mother.
""It's for the best"", ""This happened for a reason"", or ""This is all in God's plan.""
""At least you miscarried early in your pregnancy"" or other, similar ""be grateful for"" statements.

, After a miscarriage, it’s very easy for a woman to feel alone, especially if many of her other relatives, friends, and acquaintances don’t know how to react to the situation. Make sure that you’re available to her to help keep her company. You don’t have to say anything or even discuss her feelings if you don’t want to. Sometimes a simple presence can make a world of difference.


One good option for keeping your friend company is to have her over for a good cup of tea and a movie of her choice. This makes it easy to give her a warm shoulder to lean on and a good excuse not to talk, so that neither of you feels pressured to say anything if you don’t feel like it.
Send her a text or email first asking if she wants company. Not everyone is up for it after something like this, especially if you yourself are pregnant. If she’s up for it or if it would help her, she’ll let you know.

, Sometimes, your friend may really need to talk to you about their experience but they think that because it’s sad or weird or “gross”, she can’t. If you’re willing to talk to them about the problems that they’re going through, you should make sure they know that you’re open and ready to deal with whatever they have to say.


Say something like “I know there’s nothing I can do to fix this but if you just want someone to talk to, I hope you know that I’m here whenever you need me.”
Be careful, however, not to leave them feeling like they’re obligated to talk about their experience. A one time offer to talk or just simple hints that you’re there for them (such as arranging quiet and private opportunities to talk) is plenty.

, If your friend does feel like talking about her experience, then it’s going to be important for you to do more listening than anything else. If she doesn’t feel like talking about it, then you still need to be ready to just be quiet and let her cry on your shoulder. Hugs are helpful and Kleenex distributing duty is important but should be done silently.

, Don't try to buck her up or divert her attention. This is an incredibly sad experience and in order to process her feelings, she’s probably going to need to be sad for awhile. You can offer her other activities if she’s up for them but generally it's much healthier to experience the pain and go through the stages of grief.The stages of grief do not necessarily go in order and not all are required but generally you might see your friend go through five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.Watch for each step in this chain to occur and you should see that progressing normally. Don’t pressure her to rush through it.

, Some women like to commemorate the anniversary of their loss. Some women will do something even sooner, such as for when they would have gone to their final checkup, their due date, etc. If your friend mentions wanting to commemorate that experience, you should help her in any way you can.You can provide a small commemoration, even if she doesn't mention wanting to do anything. A bouquet of flowers or a donation to a miscarriage charity (or perhaps an international charity that deals with infant mortality) can show your support.

, It can be a great emotional burden on a couple that has just had a miscarriage to have to inform everyone of their loss. If you know your friend had made her pregnancy known to people, you can offer to let people know about their loss and save them that terrible experience. Of course, you shouldn't tell people unless she wants you to and you shouldn't ""out"" her if people didn't know that she was pregnant to begin with. Only discuss this situation with people if she allows it.


It might be helpful to ask the couple for a list of people that they want to be sure know. You may have to use your judgement on telling anyone beyond the list.
Another additional way to help is to give an article like this or an informational pamphlet to the other people you tell. That way, they'll also know the best ways to help and talk to your friends in their their time of grief.

, You've probably had the experience of being very upset but stuck with obligations that force you to wear a smile. Save your friend the embarrassment of having to run into the back room to cry and take on some of their responsibilities. There are lots of ways that you can do this. You can:


Give a coworker one or more of your paid sick days, watch their other kids for them so that they can have some time to grieve alone, cover their shift at work, etc.
Another responsibility they may have now is dealing with all of the things that they may have bought for the baby. Most mothers don’t want to keep the items, so a long process of returning items to stores, selling the items, or bringing them to a charity will begin. You can offer to do this for her, since the experience can be even more soul crushing.

, Even the most simple daily tasks can feel overwhelming when we're going through a hard time emotionally. By taking on some of these tasks for them, you can give them the chance to relax and go through the normal emotions of grief. This is also doubly helpful to a woman who has miscarried, as the physical repercussions can be painful and last up to several months.


You can make them food. Try filling their freezer with a week's worth of dinners ready to go in the microwave.
You can clean their home for them; vacuuming, doing the dishes, cleaning the bathroom, etc.
Taking care of the yard is another household chore that's bad enough when you feel great, nevermind when you just want to cry in bed.

, Don't help your friend and talk to them for just two weeks and then go on with life, pretending like nothing has changed. This makes the effort you put in and the concern you showed seem insincere. Instead, check in with your friend every once in a while and see how they're doing. This tells them that you really do care about their wellbeing, which can go a long way towards helping them recover.


You don't have to say much or even mention the miscarriage explicitly. All you have to do is call them up or invite them out for coffee every now and again and say something like, ""How are you? Tell me how things have been going with you. I've been so worried but you do seem like you're doing better.""

, A lot of the time, people focus on consoling the woman who miscarried and forget all about her partner. It takes more than one person to make a baby and this person has also suffered a great loss. Even if you don't know your friend's partner well, you should still offer your condolences, even if its just in the form of a card that your friend can pass along. This can mean the world to your friend's partner, especially if few people have been offering their support to them. Encourage your friend to talk to their partner too, if they aren't. Your friend might feel like they can't discuss the loss with their partner. They may also share the misconception that just because men grieve differently, that they aren't grieving at all. Encourage your friend to give their partner a safe environment in which to express their grief. Going to a couple's counselor can also help.

, Support groups can be hugely beneficial for people that are going through grief or complex situations like miscarriage. With a support group, your friend can find advice and see that they aren't alone in this experience. You can find information about support groups for this situation through your local hospital. They should have a list of local support groups and counseling services.


Online forums. If there isn't a group in your local area, you can find websites online which serve the same function. These online forums are filled with mothers who are going through this loss, and many who have come out on the other side.
Go with them. Sometimes, it can be scary to go meet a bunch of strangers and talk about your deep personal feelings. Offer to go with your friend as backup emotional support. Once past that initial hurdle of the unknown, they might be more comfortable going on their own.

, A grief counselor is similar to a support group but this professional has many years of training and experience in helping people with their pain. They may have more tools available and may be more directly helpful in getting your friend back on their feet. You can usually get a reference to a good grief counselor from your local hospital or church.


Professional grief counselors will generally charge money. You can show your support for your friend by paying for a session or two. If they feel it helps, they may go to more on their own.
If neither of you can afford the service, there may be grants and financial assistance available. Contact your local health department to find out more. You can also often get free grief counseling services from your local church.

, If you know someone else who has gone through the same experience, you may want to arrange for the two of them to meet. This can be less intimidating than a support group and may be just as helpful. Arrange for them to meet at least once when you can introduce them face-to-face. Offer to leave or give them privacy while they talk, however.


Say something like, ""I have a friend who suffered a similar loss. She's doing a lot better these days. If you'd like to talk to her and get some advice, I'd love to have you both over for dinner so that you can have some nice quiet time to talk.""

, Some people are more private in how they experience grief. If you notice that your friend is having trouble expressing her emotions and talking to others about her feelings, a book may be a better route. A book allows her to approach grief at her own pace and at a time place that feels safe for her. Good examples of books on this topic include:

Grieve the loss of your baby.,
Discuss your feelings with a close friend or family member.,
Do some light exercise and meditation.,
Do yoga.,
Ask your doctor about antidepressant drugs, if necessary.,
Go back to work when you feel ready.,
Plan future pregnancies with the help of an obstetrician.",How to Care for Yourself After a Miscarriage2," Different people react to miscarriage in different ways, but everyone — regardless of the circumstances of the miscarriage — needs time to heal. It is important to grieve the loss of your baby as much as you need, as this helps you to accept the loss and begin the healing process.


If you are feeling constantly down and can't seem to recover from your miscarriage, it might be a good idea to seek the help of a counselor. They can help you to work through your feelings and allow you to make sense of what you're going through.
It is important to find a counselor that you feel comfortable around, so you feel comfortable opening up about your sadness, fear and anxiety.

, The hormonal changes that take place in the mother’s body following a miscarriage can heighten feelings of sadness or anger, which your partner may not be able to fully understand. Therefore, finding a friend, a close relative or even a support group to whom you can express your feelings is very important. This helps to promote healing and prevent depression.


However, it's important to be be conscious of the fact that a miscarriage is a distressing experience for both the mother and the partner. Both experience the emotional strain of losing the baby, so don't shut your partner out — it is essential that you support each other throughout the grieving process.
Also try to keep in mind that both partners may grieve differently. For example, you may cry out loud, while your partner keeps their grief to themselves. This does not mean that their pain is any less real, so try to be understanding.

, Once you get over the initial physical symptoms of a miscarriage, it's recommended that you work out as much as possible. Any form of exercise is good, as it reduces the levels of androgens (stress hormones) in our body and releases endorphins (happy, relaxing hormones) instead.


Start out by going for a daily 20 minute walk to get the blood flowing — the fresh air will do you good. After that, you can move on to more strenuous activities, like running, biking or rowing.
Find a type of exercise that you enjoy doing — anything from dancing to rock climbing to horseback riding. The months following a miscarriage are a difficult time, so it's important to indulge in activities that bring you happiness

, Doing yoga everyday is highly recommended for women recovering from a miscarriage, as it provides a form of light exercise and helps to calm the mind and relieve tension.


Yoga involves a series of breathing exercises, which promote feelings of calmness and relaxation while also delivering more oxygen into the blood stream, relaxing the muscles and helping you to feel better physically.
Yoga can be practiced in the comfort of your own home, with the help of a yoga mat and DVD, or you can find out about classes in your local area. For more detailed instruction on how to do specific yoga breathing exercises, see this article.

, Anti-anxiety and antidepressant drugs are available to help with depression and anxiety if these feelings become overwhelming. These medications work by inhibiting the serotonin receptors that cause more depression and grief.


These medicines can take up to 3 weeks before you feel a noticeable difference, but over time they tend to produce good results.
Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription.

, The time it take to returning to work and resume normal, everyday activities following a miscarriage varies from one person to another.


Some people will return to work early as a way of dealing with the emotional trauma associated with the loss of their baby. Other people take more time because they don't feel ready to face the real world just yet.
How much time you take off after a miscarriage is a completely personal choice, which should be informed by how you feel both mentally and physically. Take as much time as you need — there's no need to rush the decision.

, Following a miscarriage, it is recommended that you plan any future pregnancies with the help of an obstetrician.


The obstetrician will advise you on any precautions you can take to avoid future miscarriages — this may include instructions to rest enough during pregnancy and follow a balanced diet.
He or she may also prescribe you drugs to minimize the chances of miscarrying. This can help you to feel more relaxed and secure during your next pregnancy.

Understand that there are different types of miscarriages.,
Know if you are at risk.,
Learn to recognize the symptoms of a possible miscarriage.,
Understand how the doctor determines whether a miscarriage has occurred.,
Understand how tissues are removed following an incomplete abortion.",How to Care for Yourself After a Miscarriage3," A miscarriage is defined as losing a fetus before 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, within this definition, there are several terms used to describe the exact nature of the miscarriage:



Spontaneous abortions: These occur when the fetus is aborted naturally in before 20 weeks of pregnancy, due to factors like genetic abnormalities, drug or alcohol abuse, infections or hormonal problems which make it impossible for the fetus to survive.

Incomplete abortion: This is when the fetus gets aborted but part of the tissue is still left in the mother's womb. This tissue needs to be removed by a doctor, or it could lead to infection.

Complete abortion: This is when the fetus is expelled with all of the accompanying tissues (also known as products of conception).

Inevitable abortions: These are a class of abortions where the symptoms cannot be prevented or stopped and will eventually lead to a miscarriage. Symptoms include vaginal bleeding and dilation of the cervix.

, Some women are at higher risk of having a miscarriage than others. In some cases these risks can be avoided, but in others they are inevitable. Women who are at risk include:


Those who smoke, drink alcohol or take drugs during their pregnancy. These behaviors are known to reduce the amniotic fluid in the body, which induces labor-like symptoms in the body and can lead to miscarriage.
Those who are over the age of 35 upon conceiving their first child.
Those who have a history of miscarriage.

, If you are pregnant, it's important to learn how to recognize the first signs and symptoms of miscarriage. If you notice any of the following symptoms, you should call your health care provider immediately to get checked out.



Vaginal bleeding: Vaginal bleeding (often accompanied by cramping) is one of the most obvious signals that you are about to miscarry (or that you have already). Please visit the nearest physician if you should notice any vaginal bleeding. The bleeding occurs when the placenta starts to separate due to various factors, such as decreased HCG levels in the blood or drug and alcohol use leading to spontaneous contractions.

Passage of clots: In some cases, there may not be any bleeding (at least at first) but you may notice clot-like tissues coming out of the vagina. These occur due to low levels of HCG in the blood, which means that the mother's body is unsuitable for carrying a baby to full term and will naturally self-abort.

Abdominal or back pain: Any form of abdominal or low back pain should raise suspicion of a miscarriage. These kinds of pains are often the initial sign that the uterus is contracting due to decreased levels of estrogen and HCG in the blood.

, In some cases, it is not immediately obvious whether or not a miscarriage has occurred, even if symptoms such as vaginal bleed and cramping are present. In these situations, doctors need to run several tests to find out if the pregnancy is still valid. These tests include:


A routine CBC (Complete Blood Count) test is carried out to determine the levels of haemoglobin in the blood and how much has been lost.
Blood grouping is done to find out the Rh compatibility. Rh compatibility indicates whether the mother's blood group and the fetus's are the same or different.
Ultrasound of the abdomen and/or the pelvis may be advised.
Blood HCG levels are tested to find out if they are low or normal. Low levels of HCG increase the probability of a miscarriage.

, Following an incomplete abortion — where the fetus is expelled but products of conception remain inside the womb — it is necessary to remove these products of conception to prevent the uterus from becoming infected. This is done with a procedure known as dilatation and curettage.


During the dilatation and curettage procedure, the patient is given an anesthetic and put to sleep so they won't feel any pain. The cervix is then dilated and an instrument called a curette is used to remove the content of the womb through the opening of the vagina.
Once the tissues are removed, the uterus is cleaned with an antiseptic betadine solution, which helps to prevent infection.

Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise regularly to boost sperm count.,
Work on maintaining or achieving a healthy weight.,
Keep your stress under control.,
Prevent sexually transmitted infections.,
Take a multivitamin.",How to Increase Fertility in Men1," Your diet can have a big impact on all aspects of your overall health, including your fertility. Eat a balanced diet rich in healthy foods to help get your fertility on track.Make sure to include healthy foods from all major food groups. Your diet should be a mix of a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Cook your foods in a healthy fashion. Bake and grill foods instead of frying them, for example.
Nutritionists recommend that you try and make half of your plate vegetables at each meal. This will increase your fiber intake and overall wellbeing.
Antioxidants may increase sperm count.Try adding antioxidant-rich foods to your diet, such as berries, pears, apples, asparagus, broccoli, kale, tomatoes, and nuts.;
, Regular physical activity can help your overall health, which could cause an increase in fertility. If you're trying to increase fertility, work on developing a healthy exercise routine; however, you may want to avoid certain activities. While more studies are needed, research has linked a drop in fertility to certain forms of physical exercise.Some studies indicate biking may cause a drop in fertility. Very strenuous forms of exercise, such as training for a triathlon, may also cause a drop in fertility.
Stick to lighter, consistent physical activity to boost your fertility.

, Being underweight, overweight or obese may reduce sperm count and increase the likelihood of producing abnormal sperm; therefore, work on getting to a normal weight if you're over- or underweight for your height.Talk to your doctor about how to get to a good weight. You may need to eat more or less depending on whether you need to gain or lose weight. It's best to have your doctor monitor your weight loss or gain to make sure it's done in a healthy fashion.

, Not only can stress interfere with your sexual health, high levels of stress can cause changes in hormones that affect sperm production, reducing fertility. If you have a high-stress lifestyle, take steps to reduce stress. This can potentially cause an increase in fertility.Reach out to people socially on a regular basis. Regular social interaction can greatly reduce your stress level. Hang out with friends and family members who are pleasant and engaging.
Avoid unnecessary stress. Do not agree to commitments you cannot fulfill. Stay away from people who stress you out. If something on the news stresses you out, avoid reading about it.
Try to have perspective. In moments when you feel stressed out, pause and think, ""How will I feel about this in a day? In a week?"" Chances are, a lot of your problems are blown out of proportion unnecessarily.

, Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can have an adverse effect on fertility. If you're not sure if you have an STI, get tested at your doctor's office. If you test positive for anything, have it treated right away.Take measures to prevent STIs if you want to protect your fertility. Always use latex condoms during sex. You can also practice monogamy by only sleeping with one partner, as this can reduce your risk of contracting an STI.

, Daily multivitamin supplements contain vitamins C and E, as well as a good supply of other essential nutrients for male reproductive health. Some research suggests a daily multivitamin may increase your sperm count.Choose a multivitamin that also contains selenium, zinc, and folate, which have been linked to healthy sperm production.
While there is little evidence that a daily multivitamin is harmful, you should always check with your doctor before taking one. You want to make sure a multivitamin is safe for you given your current health and any existing medications.

Actively listen.,
Answer questions.,
Expect various reactions.,
Have a follow up conversation.,
Make your child feel safe.",How to Explain Miscarriage to Children2," No matter how old your child is, it is important that you communicate as effectively as possible. During the conversation, show them that you hear them. Actively listening is one of the best ways to have a constructive conversation with your child.After you have told your child about the miscarriage, give them a chance to respond. Listen carefully to your child's reaction.
Show that you are listening by maintaining eye contact. You can also use touch, such as putting an arm around a shoulder.
Try paraphrasing. You could say, ""I hear you saying that you are confused and sad. I understand.""

, Your child might have a lot of questions and concerns. Although it might be emotional for you, be prepared to answer their questions as honestly as possible. Remember that it is normal for kids to be curious.Very young children have a very ""me""-centric view of the world. Be prepared for questions such as ""Will this happen to me?"" or ""Was it my fault?""
Take care to reassure your child. You can say, ""No, it was not your fault. And no, the same thing will not happen to you.""
Older children might have more specific questions. A teenager might say, ""Will this happen again? Are you going to try to have another baby?""

, A big part of communicating effectively with your child involves respecting their reaction. It is important to understand that each child will process the information differently. Try to prepare yourself for a variety of reactions.Younger children might appear to be apathetic. Maybe your child responds to the news by saying, ""Ok. Can we go to the park now?"" Try not to take this personally.
A teenager might respond by acting out. Slamming doors and playing loud music might be how they express their emotions.
Explain to your child that everyone is entitled to feel their own emotions. There is no right or wrong way to feel.
Find a way to help your child express their feelings. For example, a young child might find it helpful to draw a picture.

, No matter how constructive your conversation feels, be prepared to have another discussion. Miscarriage is not a topic that can generally be dealt with in just one talk. Be ready to answer more questions at a later time.It might take your child some time to process the information. Don't be surprised if the day after the talk, your preschooler asks where the baby is. Be ready to have the conversation again.
Check in with your older child. A few days later it would be a good idea to say, ""How are you feeling? Is there any way that I can help you?""
Some children might feel the need to honor the baby. You could consider saying a few words as a memorial, or maybe singing a song together.

, Unpredictable events, like a miscarriage, can lessen your child's sense of security. After you explain the miscarriage, take care to reassure your child. You can use words and actions to help your child feel safe.Stick to routines. As much as possible, try not to disrupt your child's life. If he is used to eating dinner at 6, try to make that happen, even when you're having a rough day.
Keep reminding your child how much you love them. You can say, ""Mommy is sad, but you make me happy. I love you very much.""
Follow through on promises. For example, if you promised that grandma would come visit when the baby was born, try to arrange a visit with grandma.

"

Talk to your doctor.,
Consult friends and family.,
Use a book.",How to Explain Miscarriage to Children3," After a miscarriage, you will understandably be going through a difficult time. If you find yourself needing help, make sure to ask for it. Your doctor can be an excellent resource.Ask any medically related questions that you have. Sometimes getting answers can help you cope.
Maybe you are having a tough time dealing with grief or sadness. Ask your doctor to recommend a therapist.
Talking to a counselor might help you deal with your emotions. Consider going to therapy for a while.

, Let your friends and family know what you are going through. It is important to tell them what you have told your child. That way, they know what is appropriate to say.For example, you can say, ""Rachel, we've told Charlie that the baby died. I just wanted you to know, in case he brings up the subject."" Let your friends and family know how they should react if your child brings up the miscarriage.
Communicate with the school. If you have a young child, let his teacher know what's going on. You want your child to feel supported at school, too.
You can try saying, ""We just wanted to let you know that Max is going through a hard time. Please let us know if he asks you any tough questions.""

, It might be very difficult to figure out how to talk to your child. A miscarriage is very emotional. You could consider using a book to help your child understand.You can try a children's book that deals with death. For example, The Velveteen Rabbit might be useful.
There are also books written specifically to help children understand miscarriage. For example, Goodbye Baby and All Shining in the Spring have been helpful for some people.

Know how to deal with any issues.",How to Get a Medical Marijuana ID Card," Medicinal marijuana is prescribed for a wide variety of conditions, spanning from physical ailments to mental health issues. However, what conditions qualify you for a medical marijuana card, known as qualifying conditions, vary widely from state to state.


Legality varies widely, so make sure you know if your condition is covered before beginning the application process. Some states, such as Montana and Wyoming, only allow access to cannabis oil and only prescribe it for seizure disorders related to epilepsy. Other states have a wide array of qualifying conditions and allow cannabis to be sold in multiple forms.Common conditions covered include cancer, HIV/AIDS, Crohn's Disease, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain. Some states include symptoms of underlying disorders, such as nausea, as a qualifying condition.You should be able to find a list of qualifying conditions on a variety websites that advocate for medicinal marijuana or you can check your state's Department of Health website. If your condition is listed, you qualify for a medical marijuana card.;
, The distribution of medicinal marijuana varies from state to sate. Figure out if your state allows caregivers, dispensaries, or both.


Under the caregiver system, patients can designate a particular person as their caregiver. Caregivers grow marijuana, and give or sell it to the patient. Some states require the caregiver to manage the patient's well-being in regards to their use of marijuana, but no medical training is required.While a few states have no restrictions, most states using the caregiver system limit the number of patients a caregiver can have. States that have the dispensary system intact usually allow caregivers as an alternative option.The dispensary system allows medicinal marijuana to be sold through businesses. These businesses are referred to as dispensaries and you must have a valid, state issued medical marijuana card to enter and make purchases.Restrictions on dispensaries vary from state to state, but most states require all employees undergo a background check, that the dispensaries be located a certain distance from schools, and dispensaries must subject themselves to periodic state inspections., Each state sets limits for how much marijuana a qualified individual or caregiver can possess or grow. As you do not want to inadvertently violate the law, be aware of the limits in your state.


Caregivers, as stated, can only have a certain number of patients but restrictions often apply to how much they can grow. Explore your state's Health Department website to figure out the limitations and discuss them with your caregiver.

, Your medical marijuana ID card is valid in your state only unless the state you are visiting accepts your state's ID card.


Arizona, Delaware, Maine, Michigan, and Rhode Island accept out of state ID cards. New Hampshire does sometimes accept out of state cards, but only with a note from the original state.If you are not in one of the above listed states, your ID card is only valid in the state it was issued. In the event you move, you'll need to apply for another card., To get a state issued ID card, you need to visit a doctor who is licensed to prescribe medicinal marijuana. They can give you a written recommendation that you can use to secure your card.


Your doctor will want to know your medical history and might need medical records from previous doctors that include information relevant to your qualifying condition. Make sure you are able to access your medical records before making an appointment.
Directories of medical marijuana doctors are available online. You can also find qualified doctors from a dispensary's website, if you live in a dispensary state. Some dispensary actually have doctors on staff so you can make your appointment through them.If you meet qualifications, your doctor will write you a recommendation for a med card. Some dispensary will allow you to buy medical marijuana with this recommendation alone. However, it's better to pursue your card first to avoid any legal troubles., While some states allow you to receive benefits based on a doctor's recommendation alone, most states require you to fill out an application and submit it to the state for approval.


Application requirements vary from state to state. Most will ask for basic information, like your name, address, and phone number. It will also usually ask for a variety of information related to your condition and medical history.You should include your doctor's written recommendation with your application.
In some cases you can bring your documentation and fee to your county health department or health services department. In other cases, you must mail everything off to your state's health department. In other states still, the application process is done entirely online.

, There are fees associated with obtaining a medical marijuana card; typically, you must pay administrative fees to both the county and the state. Some states will charge a reduced fee to patients if they receive Medicaid benefits, Social Security Disability, or other supplemental income or are part of other state-aid programs. Full fees can range from $100 to $250. Check the guidelines for your area to learn the exact costs.

, In order to obtain a card, you need to prove your identity and that you live in the state where you're applying. When you apply to receive your card from the State Health Department, you'll need proof of residence and identity.


For proof of identity, you can provide a state issued driver's license or ID.Proof of residency can come in a variety of forms. You can include a rent or mortgage agreement, a utility bill, or your motor vehicle registration., Once you've submitted your application, the state will take a few weeks to review and approve the materials. Once approved, there is a waiting period to receive your card.


The waiting period depends on a variety of factors and can range from a few days to a few weeks.
You can either have your card sent through certified mail or schedule a pick up at the state health department., Once you've received your card, you are now legally able to receive medicinal marijuana to treat your qualifying condition. You need to decide which route to obtain your medicine is best for you.


If you want a caregiver, make sure you understand the rules and regulations surrounding caregivers in your state and choose someone you trust to provide you with your medicine.
Dispensaries vary in their selection and refutability. Ask around your area, talking to other medicinal marijuana patients, to find a dispensary that suits your needs. Different strands of marijuana work better for particular ailments and may not be available in all dispensaries.

, While most patients are able to obtain a card with little trouble, issues do arise from time to time in regards to legality. The best way to prepare is to be well informed on potential issues.


Rejection happens on occasion. The bulk of the time, your application is rejected for simple reasons, such as forgetting to include certain materials. In most states, you will receive a letter detailing the reasons for your rejection. You will be provided a date by which to resubmit your materials and the review process begins again.Money can be a road block for many when it comes to securing a card. Costs vary, but a consultation appointment with a licensed doctor can cost around $200. There are some discounts, by state, for low income patients. If money is a factor for you, you can look into discounts or see if you can raise money through local charity or online campaigns like GoFundMe.While medical marijuana is legal in certain states, it remains illegal on a federal level. Therefore, some businesses are still legally allowed to issue drug tests to employees and enact a zero tolerance policy when it comes to use of marijuana. This can be a difficult hurdle for patients who need their medicine but do not want to risk losing employment. Some states, however, provide state-wide protection of medicinal marijuana users or protect the rights of patients under state disability acts. Know the policies on drug testing and drug use in your place of work and what protection, if any, you have as a patient in your state."

Look for good resources.",How to Cope With a Miscarriage," A miscarriage is a significant emotional loss. It is normal to mourn this loss the same way you would mourn any other loss of life. Try to familiarize yourself with the grieving process so that you will understand that what you are feeling is normal.The first stage of grief is denial. You might find yourself thinking, ""This isn't really happening.""
The second stage is feeling anger, guilt, or depression. Common thoughts include, ""This isn't fair!"" or ""Why me?""
The final stage is acceptance. You will of course still feel sadness, but you will begin to accept the reality of the situation.;
, Remember that this emotional experience is different for everyone. Everyone will move through the different stages at their own pace. You might move quickly through the denial stage, but then find yourself stuck on anger. That's ok.Make an effort to be kind to yourself. Take a moment each day to acknowledge your emotions. Just don't judge them.
Don't rush yourself. Take the time you need to heal and process your emotions.

, Healing is a process. As time goes on, you will make progress and feel better. You will also likely experience some bumps in the road. Setbacks are difficult, but you can get through them.Maybe you experience a setback when your sister tells you that she is pregnant. After your loss, this is going to be hard for you to hear.

You can look back at your notes to help detect patterns of times when you feel better.
Journaling can also be very therapeutic. You might feel better just by knowing that you have a place to express your feelings.

, When you are exhausted, all of your emotions will feel heightened. For example, when you're tired, a feeling of irritation might turn into true feelings of anger. Try to get plenty of rest so that you can heal emotionally.You might have also had to have a surgical procedure relating to your miscarriage. In this case, you also need to get plenty of rest so that you can heal physically.

, You might find that well-meaning friends and relatives are offering a lot of unsolicited advice during this time. Remind yourself that they mean well. However, that doesn't mean that you have to listen to everything they say.For example, maybe your mom suggests that it is time to donate all of the baby clothes that you bought. Eventually, this might be something that you want to consider.
If you're not ready now, don't do it. It is your right to say, ""Thank you for the advice, but I'm not ready to take that step right now. Please respect my pace.""

, It might help the healing process if you can find a way to honor your child's memory. Many people find it helpful to do something that will help preserve memories and help with the healing process at the same time.You might consider holding a memorial service for your lost child.

If necessary (and possible), consider taking a little time off from work.Take care to eat a healthy diet. Focus on whole grains, fruits and veggies, and lean meats. For example, you could heat a whole wheat pasta dish with some grilled chicken, spinach, and mushrooms.

, You may have friends or family members who have gone through a miscarriage of their own. Naturally, they will want to give you advice on how to handle it. It’s fine if you want to listen, but it’s ok to feel like your situation is different.It’s fine to tell someone, “I appreciate your advice, but I really need to handle this in my own way. Thanks for being respectful of my wishes.”

, Your partner will also be going through a difficult time. They might also be experiencing sadness, anger, or grief. Take time to talk to one another about your feelings.Be open and honest. If you are feeling depressed, don’t be afraid to say so.
Your partner could be your best source of support. Don’t be afraid to lean on them.

, When you’re going through a wide range of emotions, it’s normal to want to vent your frustrations. That’s fine, but remember to try to treat your partner with kindness and respect. They’re having a tough time, too.Instead of saying, “You don’t understand!” try saying, “I don’t think you’re hearing me. Could you listen to me talk through my feelings?”

Your body and your mind will need extra rest as you cope.Choose what kind of help you want. For example, a friend might ask if you want to go to a movie. It’s fine to respond, “I’m really not up for leaving the house yet, but it’d be great if you want to come over and watch something on Netflix.

, Try to resist the urge to scour the internet trying to discover the cause of your miscarriage. Instead, use your doctor as a resource. Ask any questions that you have, and don’t be afraid to follow up.You can also read reputable sites such as your hospital’s website or the website for American Pregnancy.

Think about what type of organization you would like to work for as you conduct your research on available jobs.;
, Consider joining the American Association of Healthcare Administration Management (AAHAM), the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA) or the Association for Healthcare Administration Professionals (AHCAP) to enhance your qualifications. Joining these associations will enhance your resume and it will also provide you with networking opportunities, access to a members only job lists, and access to webinars.Look into fellowships with healthcare organizations as well. Many of them offer fellowships, which can be a great way to gain experience.

, Most healthcare administration positions do not require any sort of certification, but there are a few exceptions. If a special license is required for the position, the job posting should include this information. You can also check your state’s requirements since they may vary from state to state., Since your resume is the first thing that employers will see, it is important to make sure that it makes you look like a great job candidate. Your resume should include your contact information, a brief paragraph that summarizes your qualifications, a list of your professional experience, education, special certifications and licenses, and professional organization memberships.Look at sample resumes to get ideas for how to format your own resume.
If you are a recent graduate of a healthcare administration program, visit your university’s career center to get help with writing your resume.

, Talk to people who are already employed as healthcare administrators to expand your network. Ask former professors about events for healthcare administrators and attend conferences relevant to your intended profession. For example, you could attend the American Association of Healthcare Administration Management’s National Institute.Another good way to network is to ask your friends and family if they know anyone who works in healthcare administration. If so, ask to be introduced to the person so that you can talk to them about their job.
When you network, don’t ask people if they can help you get a job, just try to get to know them. Ask how they like their job, how long they have been there, and what advice they have for someone who is just starting out. Be kind, polite, and gracious when people share their knowledge with you.
Keep in mind that making these types of connections may not lead to a job right away, but it may be part of the reason why you get a job offer later on.

, While many hospital jobs are available to healthcare administrators, you can also look for jobs with other healthcare providers in your area. Healthcare administrators can be found at any of the following medical services:Group physician practices.
Clinics.
Nursing homes and elder-care facilities.
Home healthcare organizations.
Outpatient care centers.
Mental health organizations.
Rehabilitation centers.

, There are thousands of healthcare administrator positions available across the United States, but it can sometimes be a challenge to find a job in your area. Watch your local paper’s classified section for information on local jobs and check with local healthcare providers, such as hospitals and clinics. You should also perform daily searches of job search websites to see what jobs are available in your area.


Check healthcare providers’ websites. Some businesses are large enough that they post a ""Jobs"" or ""Careers"" section on their websites. You can often apply for these jobs by sending your resume and cover letter directly to the company’s hiring manager. If no jobs are available, check again in a week or two.Visit large job search sites. While the jobs listed on Monster, CareerBuilder, Indeed, SimplyHired and Craigslist are highly competitive, they will show the high profile jobs in your area. On some of these websites, you can request to receive alerts about relevant jobs so that you can apply to them as soon as they are posted.

, If you are a recent graduate of a healthcare administration program, you may need to spend some time working in an entry level position to gain experience and additional skills before you can land your dream job. Keep in mind that starting with an entry level position is a normal part of professional development. These jobs are often easier to get and you may advance quickly depending on your abilities.To find entry level positions, look for job postings that include terms like “assistant” in the job titles.
You may also consider looking into post-graduate fellowships to gain experience., You may be able to get promotions within your organization if there are enough opportunities. If there are not enough advancement opportunities and you no longer feel challenged, you can look for higher level positions with other companies after spending a few years in an entry-level position. Check the job posting descriptions to determine whether or not you are qualified for a higher level position., If you prefer to work in a nontraditional healthcare setting or if you are having trouble finding jobs in traditional settings, consider applying to work for a private organization. Depending on your personal career interests, you can focus on business administration or conducting scientific research into the effectiveness of medications. Healthcare administration graduates are qualified to find jobs with:Healthcare management companies.
Pharmaceutical companies.
Biotechnology companies.

, Healthcare recruiters can help healthcare administrators find good jobs, but this option is not for everyone. Entry level healthcare administrators are better off seeking a job on their own, but experienced healthcare managers may benefit from the help of a healthcare recruiter. If you are an experienced healthcare administrator seeking a management position or if you are a recent MBA graduate seeking employment in an upper level healthcare administration position, then a healthcare recruiter might be able to help you., After establishing yourself in the field, you might consider becoming a healthcare consultant. You can use your expertise to advise healthcare providers on management techniques and advanced training for staff members. This employment option will require you to work on a project by project basis, which can be exciting. But keep in mind that you will also have to seek out clients, which can be stressful for some people., To have a career as a healthcare administrator, you will need to earn a degree in healthcare administration or in a related field. Healthcare administrations students take courses in public health, health services, and health administration. Depending on what type of healthcare administrator you would like to be, you may also need to seek additional training.Look for a program certified by the Association of University Programs in Healthcare Administration (AUPHA). AUPHA-certified programs have high standards, including a requirement that their students complete a 120 hour internship in a healthcare setting., Completing an internship is essential for getting hands on job experience and finding a job after you graduate. Some programs even require students to complete an internship before they can receive their degrees. Discuss your internship options with your academic advisor or the internship coordinator at your university., While there are many entry level positions available to healthcare administrators with bachelor’s degrees, a healthcare administrator with a master’s degree can seek higher level positions, such as healthcare manager or director positions. Some upper level healthcare administration jobs may even require applicants to have a master’s degree to advance.Keep in mind that an advanced degree may not stand in for practical experience. Even with a master’s degree you may still need to start out with an entry level position if you do not have much work experience. Therefore, you might consider waiting to obtain a master’s degree until you have 5 or more years of work experience in healthcare administration.

, To get your foot in the door with an organization that you’d like to work for after graduation, you can also consider volunteering. Taking a few hours out of your week to volunteer at a hospital or long-term care facility that you’d like to work at someday will provide you with opportunities to demonstrate your skills and get to know some people who already work there. The impressions and contacts you make may help you to land a job with the facility later on."

Confirm that the person performing the procedure will be a registered medical professional.,
Be wary of before and after photographs.,
Don’t commit to the dermatologist during the consultation.",How to Find a Dermatologist," Your primary care doctor will likely known a reputable dermatologist he can refer you to. Be specific about whether you are looking for a general dermatologist or a cosmetic dermatologist.A general dermatologist treats rashes, acne, and skin conditions like rosacea or moles. They also offer anti-aging prescriptions for wrinkles and brown spots.A cosmetic dermatologist treats deeply etched wrinkles, scars, or persistent skin discoloration. They also offer peels, injections, and laser treatments.;
, Believe it or not, there is no law that prevents doctors from practicing in medical fields they may not specialize in or be trained in. All the dermatologists listed on the American Academy of Dermatology websiteare Board-certified, which means they have completed medical school, a 3 year residency in dermatology and passed a rigorous exam administered by the American Board of Dermatology. They are also retested every year by the Board.There is a doctor locator option on the American Academy of Dermatology website so you can easily find a Board-certified dermatologist in your area.

, Ask your friend specifically what she liked about the dermatologist, and other questions such as:Was the doctor’s staff helpful and friendly? Did the doctor offer several options for her problem during her consultation? Was the doctor supportive and open during and after the procedure?
You should also confirm how long your friend has been going to their dermatologist. If she has been seeing the same doctor for several years and over many visits, you should weigh her recommendation more than someone who has only been to the office one or two times.
Look at your friend’s skin. One of the best recommendations for a dermatologist is how their patients look. Is your friend’s skin improving? Does it have a healthy glow? If she has had Botox, does it look natural and light or frozen and fake?

, Dermatologists who retain their patients and do consistent, good work don’t usually need to advertise. The only reasons a doctor would advertise is if she does not have enough patients and are not receiving referrals from her current patients or other doctors. So if you see a lot of advertising around a certain dermatologist, be cautious before scheduling a consultation with her., If the dermatologist you are considering has a website, check for the American Academy of Dermatology board certification. Also note if the doctor’s focus is on general or cosmetic dermatology. Usually a good dermatologist will specialize in one or the other, not both types.A dermatologist who names laser treatments or Botox and fillers as specific services she offers will likely be more experienced than a doctor who claims she does all types of skin procedures.

, These are usually the busiest days for a doctor’s office. This will allow you to take advantage of a full waiting room and ask the other patients about their experiences with the dermatologist.If you have to wait several weeks for a consultation, don’t get frustrated. In fact, this is a good sign, as this shows the doctor is in demand.
Keep in mind most doctors charge for a consultation, but that fee is usually put toward the cost of a procedure if you decide to go with the dermatologist.

, Though you might assume the doctor will be present for your consultation, not all states require the Medical Director (or doctor) of a cosmetic dermatology center to be on the premises more than an hour or two a month. So there could be little to no training, supervision, or quality control for the technicians performing the treatments, or even a doctor present during these treatments.Always confirm the doctor will be present for your consultation and your first treatment.

, When you meet the dermatologist for the first time, provide a rough sense of what you’re looking for. Specify if you are looking for general skin treatment or cosmetic skin treatment and what areas of your body you are looking to treat. Then, let the doctor talk. Listen to how she addresses your concerns and the possible treatments she offers.The doctor’s approach to your needs will give you a sense of how aggressive she is as a dermatologist. If she recommends drastic treatments like a chemical peel or an injection for a simple issue like a mole or discoloration on your skin, she should explain the rationale behind her recommendation.
The dermatologist’s answers to your problem and your questions will also give you a sense of how well she listens to your needs as a patient. After all, you are entrusting her with your skin. So you want to be sure you can have good communication with her.

, If she treats at least three to five cases a day similar to yours, this is a good sign. The more familiar the doctor is with your condition, the more likely she can effectively treat it.If you are looking at laser treatment, ask the doctor if she owns or rents the devices. If she rents the devices, she likely isn’t performing many laser treatments a day. This may be a sign of lack of experience with laser treatment, so she may not be the dermatologist for you.

, If the doctor’s practice has been in business for more than 5 years, this indicates she is keeping her patients happy and running a high quality practice., Talk to the doctor about who would be involved in a certain procedure, such as laser treatment or Botox.Many Board-certified dermatologists will delegate lasers or injections to registered medical professionals, who are trained and supervised by that doctor. But they should be up front about the qualifications of their staff, and the level of supervision or hands on treatment they will provide for a certain procedure.
Many of these medical professionals have the training, experience, and judgement to operate the equipment and complete treatments successfully. But its important to confirm the clinic is not just employing “techs” who have no medical training or supervision. So ask about the certification of the staff at the practice and confirm the staff at the clinic have the necessary credentials.

, Though it may be tempting to get sucked into stunning after photographs of perfect skin supplied by the dermatologist, try to be suspicious of this tactic. Doctors will always put their best before and after photos on their website or up in their office. But when you look at the photo, you can’t be sure whether 1 out of 100 people got that result or whether 90 out of 100 got that result. These photos may not provide an accurate assessment of the doctor’s skills.In the current digital age, it is also very easy to digitally alter images. So you can’t be sure if the photographs are real or have been altered.
If the dermatologist shows you before and after photographs, ask her if you will see the same results on your skin as in the photograph. If she answers honestly by explaining the differences between your skin and the skin of the person in the photograph, this shows she is willing to be ethical and up front about your specific condition.

, Thank the dermatologist for her time. Accept any supplementary material she gives you. Then, go home and think over your initial experience with the doctor.If the doctor is reputable, she should not pressure you to commit to a procedure or product during the consultation. In fact, she should welcome your desire to take a few days to think about how you felt during the consultation.
A reputable dermatologist will encourage you to think over the pros and cons of a procedure and to take time to decide if you are comfortable with becoming her patient.

Think of a bloom––it blooms amid many other blooms and does not compare itself to all those blooms, instead it does what it was made to do––bloom.


Comparison with others can lead to bitterness that you're missing out on things. This can cause you to feel less worthy too because instead of concentrating on what you have, you only see what you don't have.
Walk away from any person who causes you to feel that you have to prove your own worth. That person is not healthy for you.;
, Criticizing others comes as a result of your inferiority complex and does little to help build your self worth. If you appreciate other people's work, others will always appreciate you, which is a form of respect and satisfaction that adds to your sense of self-worth.

, Surround yourself with like-minded people. In this way, you can create your own space, and you will feel worthy.

, Every person has certain limits––you are not a super human who can (or even should) do everything. Instead, enjoy your own individual qualities and abilities.

, Everyone has a separate dream. Find your dream and pursue it in the way that matters for you. Give respect to your individuality.

, Often helping others further shapes and builds up your character. You will feel worthy,when you see the love for yourself reflected in other people's eyes.

Start your day off right by having a high-protein breakfast of egg whites or oatmeal.
When you are craving a snack, try something like a handful of almonds and a thin slice of turkey breast.
Swap out high-fat meats and cooking styles. Instead of making fried chicken, try breaded, oven-baked chicken breast.
Try to limit proteins that are high in saturated fat like red meats and whole milk.;
, Many comfort foods, like sweets, mashed potatoes, breads, and pasta are carbohydrates. You want to limit your intake of simple carbohydrates because they are mostly just sugar; however, to fight your stress with food, you do want to eat complex carbs because they help your body make serotonin.Include whole grains like oatmeal, pasta, and whole-grain breads in your meals. Swap brown rice for white rice and choose whole wheat or corn tortillas instead of flour.
Eat sweet potatoes, corn, and beans when you feel like you need a comfort food.
Try to avoid eating lots of foods high in sugar and corn syrup. They can give you a brief energy boost, but it doesn’t last and these foods can hurt you more than they help.
For example, limit your cookies, cakes, and other sweets.

, Most seafood contain omega-3 fatty acids which has been found to reduce anxiety and stress hormones like cortisol.If you are trying to fight stress with food, make sure you are including plenty of fish in your diet.


Not all seafood contains omega-3 fatty acids but fatty fish like salmon, albacore tuna, mackerel, and sardines do.Try to have fatty fish at least twice a week.
Foods like chia seeds and walnuts are also high in omega-3 fatty acids and are great for snacking.

, These vegetables are packed with folate which helps your brain make the chemical dopamine.Dopamine, in turn, helps you feel calmer and happier. They also contain magnesium which can help improve your mood.Make sure you are getting enough leafy greens to fight your stress with food.


Try adding vegetables like kale, collard greens, turnip greens, rapini, romaine lettuce, and spinach to your regular diet.
If you aren’t a big salad eater, try adding leafy greens to a smoothie. They don’t change the taste of the smoothie and give you nutrients you might miss otherwise.

, It’s hard to fight stress when you aren’t physically well or lack energy. Berries can help you fight stress because they contain phytonutrients and antioxidants that boost your immune system, so regularly grab a handful.Add fresh berries like strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries to your whole-grain cereal or oatmeal for breakfast.
Put some berries on the top of your salad to give it an extra kick of flavor and nutrition.

, While alcohol and caffeine can both temporarily make you feel less stressed (although in different ways), both of these can do much more harm than good. In order to fight stress with food, limit the amount of caffeine and alcohol you are consuming.


Alcohol use can lead to you making bad decisions in the moment that can actually add to your overall stress.
Caffeinated beverages can give you a boost, but can also leave you feeling too ‘wired’ to get the rest you need.
Instead, drink plenty of water to combat your feelings of stress.

Detect the early warning signs.,
Buy yourself time with counter-pressure maneuvers.,
Get to safety.,
Move towards someone who can catch you.,
Fall onto a sofa or bed.,
Lean against a wall.,
Slide slowly to the floor.,
Wait until you feel completely better before trying to stand up again.",How to Fall when You Faint1," When you faint, you lose consciousness and will not be able to do anything to help break your fall. Because of this, it's important to know what the prodromal stage or ""presyncope"" feels like. This will give you a few seconds to act. While not everyone experiences fainting episodes the same way, most people have some combination of the following:


Increased sweating despite a cold sensation.
Nausea.
Discomfort in the center of your lower chest or upper abdomen.
Sudden extreme fatigue.
A feeling of weakness.
Dizziness or vertigo.Confusion.
Blurred vision or seeing spots.
Ringing in your ears.;
, These are actions that increase your blood pressure, delaying and sometimes preventing syncope altogether.


Cross your legs while tensing them along with your abdominal muscles.
Clench an object with some give, such as a rubber ball, as hard as possible.
Grip one hand with the other and tense your arms, moving them slowly away from your body., The most dangerous part of fainting is the possibility that you will injure yourself when you fall. Do your best to get away from high-risk areas and towards places where you are less likely to hurt yourself. You may be able to take just a few steps while experiencing presyncope, but that distance is often all you need to prevent injury.


Some examples of high risk areas include streets, train terminals, staircases, and anywhere with a nearby steep drop. Staircases pose a unique problem. If you are already standing on a staircase, do not try to go up or down, even if it's just a few steps. Instead, hold on to the railing and gently slide down to sit on the step you are currently standing on.
Try to get to a better place to fall. If you are standing in an area that has hard flooring or furniture with sharp edges, try to get to an uncluttered space with either carpeting or grass. When you're feeling faint, ideally you should lie down on a couch or bed with your legs elevated., When you lose consciousness, the people around you will be the ones who can make sure you stay safe. Even in an uncluttered area with soft flooring, your fall can still cause potential injury. If someone can catch you and lower you gently to the ground, your risk becomes greatly reduced.


Try for someone you know. A stranger is less likely to catch you when you fall. Unfortunately, many people with fainting disorders are often misinterpreted as being under the influence of drugs or alcohol.If you can still talk, try saying ""Help!"" or ""I'm fainting!"" This will alert people around you, who may be able to react in time to catch you.

, If you are close to soft furniture, try to aim your fall so that your unconscious body will land on it lying down. Face towards the furniture and shift your weight forward. The couch or bed will give you a safe place for you to fall onto, preventing injury. Having your legs elevated will also help your blood get to your brain more easily, shortening the episode's length.

, If you are near a wall that doesn't have sharp-edged furniture nearby, try getting to it before you faint. Do not try to lean against a wall with outcroppings that you could hit your head on. It's best to lean with your back against the wall, but using your arms and chest will also work if you are unable to do so., From the leaning position, gradually bend your knees and slide to the ground. Once you get low to the ground, lean forward and stay in a squatting position or lie down. Either method will minimize injury while getting your blood pressure back to normal faster., Standing back up too quickly may cause you to faint again. Whether you actually lost consciousness or only experienced an episode of presyncope, do not try to stand up again until your symptoms have completely passed. This may take a few minutes.


The exception to this rule is if your fainting was caused by immediate physical danger. If that's the case, try leaving the area as quickly as possible.

Eat meals at regular times.,
Plan your meals.,
Give in to your snack attack.,
Avoid emotional eating.",How to Fight Stress with Food2," When you’re hungry it can add to your stress and you are more likely to eat things that will actually increase your stress instead of reduce it. But, if you make a habit of eating meals at regular times, you can fight stress with food by making sure your body has the nutrition it needs when it needs it.Although you don’t have to eat immediately when you wake up, you should have breakfast every morning.
Try to have lunch each day. A midday meal can give your body the energy it needs to fight the stress of the afternoon.

, Planning and preparing your meals in advance will give you the opportunity to select foods that will help your body fight stress.Because you already have planned what you will eat, you will be less likely to eat foods that increase your stress.


Each week think about what meals you will have so that you are meeting all of your nutritional needs for the week.
For example, you might think about needing to eat fish several times, more vegetables, and less simple carbohydrates.
Check the kitchen to determine if there are any ingredients you need to buy for your meals.
Plan to include foods that will help you combat stress. For example, plan to have fish at least twice a week and to include leafy greens in at least one meal a day.

, There is nothing wrong with having a snack or two throughout the day. In fact, having a healthy snack can give you the boost of nutrients you need to fight stress.Occasionally it’s okay to snack on chips or candy bar, but this shouldn’t be an everyday snack.
Snack on things such as fresh fruit and vegetables. For example, a sliced tomato sprinkled with pepper or a cup of mandarin oranges.
Try to bring snacks from home so that you are less tempted to buy something unhealthy just because it’s convenient.
Watch your portions so that your snack doesn’t become meal.

, There are times when you are feeling stressed and even though you aren’t hungry, you are craving your favorite snack. It’s okay to give in occasionally, but using food as a regular coping mechanism can lead to obesity, eating disorders, and more stress.Avoid using emotional eating as a way to fight stress with food.


Emotional eating can lead to binging on food because you aren’t paying attention to how much you are eating.
Before you eat, ask yourself if you are actually hungry or if you are eating just to make yourself feel better.
You might think something like, “Is now the right time to eat? Am I hungry or just trying to make myself feel better?”

Be more mindful.,
Get active.,
Keep a journal.",How to Fight Stress with Food3," Mindfulness can help reduce your stress in general because it requires you to focus all your attention on what you are doing.This can help you reduce stress by allowing you to think about what and when you are eating. When you are focused on your food, you have less time to think about the things stressing you and more time to enjoy your food.


Practice mindfulness in all of your activities. Instead of multi-tasking, focus on what you are doing in the moment.
Being mindful when you are eating will help you recognize when you are full and enjoy your food more.
For example, when you are preparing a meal or eating, slow down and take the time to pay attention to the colors, textures, smells, and flavors of your food.
For instance, you could say to yourself, “This couscous feels really grainy and smells fragrant with all the spices.”

, One of the best things you can do to fight stress, in addition to eating well, is to be physically active. Physical activity not only boosts your mood but it also aids in digestion, which means all the nutrients that you are eating will have an effect on your stress levels quicker. So make sure that you are getting regular physical activity.


Try going for a walk after you eat lunch or dinner to help your food digest.
Go hiking or biking once or twice a week. Take a healthy, energy boosting snack like almonds and dried cranberries with you.
Participate in a team sport like volleyball, rugby, baseball, or cricket. Being around other people can encourage you to stay active.

, Journaling is great for reducing stress because it gives you the opportunity to honestly express how you are feeling about the things going on in your life. You can also your journal to keep track of which foods seem to help you fight stress better.


Write about the things that happen in your life, as well as how you feel about these things.
Try to keep a log of what you eat when you are stressed so that you have an idea of the foods that are most (or least)effective in helping you fight stress.
You can also write about how eating makes you feel or your experience with eating mindfully.
For example, you might write, “It was really enjoyable to taste the blend of flavors and textures in the fruit salad.”

Talk to a doctor.,
Discover and avoid your triggers.,
Lie down if you can.,
Elevate your legs if you can.",How to Fall when You Faint2," If you've fainted with no known cause, it is very important to see a physician about the problem. Your doctor will help you to find the cause of your fainting and hopefully rule out any serious heart or nervous system disorders. If the episodes are caused by an underlying medical issue, it may be treatable. Treatment may eliminate your fainting spells entirely.

, Your doctor may have diagnosed you with vasovagal syncope. This is the most common type of fainting, especially in otherwise healthy individuals. In vasovagal syncope, fainting is triggered by certain stimuli that vary from person to person.


Think about what you were doing each time you either fainted or felt like you were about to faint.
If your trigger is a situation you can avoid, such as dehydration or the sight of blood, try not to put yourself at risk again.
If your trigger is something unavoidable, try to find a way to prevent the drop in blood pressure. Your doctor may have some solutions. For example, some people faint when having blood drawn. If this is your trigger, tell your phlebotomist. He or she will likely have a protocol to prevent fainting that likely includes some way of keeping your legs elevated., When you encounter presyncope, attempt to lie down instead of falling. From a horizontal position, your body is better equipped to recover from fainting. Lying down makes it much easier for your heart to pump much-needed blood back to your head., Keeping your legs elevated is the easiest way to prevent blood from pooling in your feet, decreasing blood flow to your brain. This will shorten the fainting episode and possibly prevent it altogether.


Sitting down with your head lowered between your knees will have the same effect."

Take your time.,
Stay hydrated.,
Eat healthily.,
Ease your muscle aches.,
Exercise with moderation.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Feel Better After You Have Been Sick1," One of the quickest ways to end up back in a sickbed is to push yourself to be active too soon. Yes, you probably have a lot to do and might be missing school or work, but letting your body recuperate from an illness is extremely important. Don’t try to do too much until all of your symptoms have subsided. Relaxing and getting lots of sleep should be #1 on your priority list until you feel like you are 100% better.


Healthy adults need between 7.5 and nine hours of sleep every night, and someone who is sick will need a great deal more. Make sure you are allowing yourself adequate time to rest, whether this means calling in sick to work or school, canceling plans, and/or going to bed early.;
, Being sick can take a lot out of you; it is always an exhausting experience, both mentally and physically. Help your body bounce back faster by drinking plenty of fluids. Be sure to drink an 8 oz. glass of water every few hours throughout the day to replace fluids lost during your illness. You should also drink a nutrient-rich drink like orange juice or soup broth a few times per day even after you feel better., Getting back into the swing of eating after a bout of illness can be unappealing at best. However, it is very important to revive your body with much-needed nutrients and sustenance so you can keep getting better. Since you have probably only eaten crackers, dry toast, or broth for the past days or weeks, start reintroducing some healthy, nutrient-rich foods into your diet again. Some tips:Avoid eating any rich, fatty foods.
Eat smaller, lighter meals more frequently throughout the day instead of three main meals.
Try eating a fruit smoothie once a day. It will help you to ingest a lot of nutrients that are key to getting you back on your feet.
Soups, in particular chicken noodle soup, tom yum, pho, and miso soups, are a great way to reintroduce proteins and vegetables back into your diet.

, Part of feeling better after you’ve been sick is dealing with associated symptoms like soreness and muscle aches. You might not be coughing every five minutes anymore, but your back might hurt still from all the hacking. The best way to alleviate any associated soreness once you start feeling better is with heat treatments. For example:Relax in a nice long bath. Try adding a cup of Epsom salts or a few drops of relaxing, anti-inflammatory essential oils like eucalyptus, peppermint, or lavender to promote additional healing and relaxation.
Try using a heat pad to help with site-specific pain. For example, if you’re having lower abdominal cramping post-stomach flu, you can heat the pad up and place it on your abdomen for some relief.
Carefully massage pain relieving ointment like Tiger Balm wherever you feel sore. Like the heating pad, use this ointment to treat any sore areas, like applying a dab to your temples for any associated headaches. Just be sure to wash your hands afterward, as these rubs are very potent and whatever skin it touches will heat up!

, Getting up and moving around after being sick will get the blood flowing and help flush toxins out. But wait until you are completely recovered to begin exercising, and avoid intense workouts completely for at least two to three weeks after being sick. Get back into working out slowly, giving yourself a week buffer after being sick before you start a moderate workout like walking or jogging short distances. You could also ease back into exercising with a hot yoga class where you’ll sweat out any toxins or remaining congestion.Just remember to stay hydrated!

, Being sick can take a real toll on your appearance. All of that sneezing, coughing, and wiping can leave you with raw, red skin. Once you’ve started taking care of the inside of your body, turn your attention to your neglected skin. Purchase a moisturizer that has lanolin in it and dab it onto areas like your nose for instant relief from painful, chapped skin. Consider also purchasing a lip balm that contains ingredients like coconut oil or argan oil, which are excellent for chapped lips

Watch for dizziness.,
Watch for changes in vision and hearing.,
Sit or lie down immediately.,
Get yourself some space.,
Try to fall against a wall.,
Be very careful on stairs.,
Ask someone for help.",How to Faint Safely1," You might feel a slight, or severe, dizzy spell immediately before you faint. This is a strong warning sign that your circulation system is not functioning normally. As soon as you start to feel dizzy at all, stop what you are doing and try to get lower to the ground via sitting or lying down., Your senses will most likely be affected as well in the minutes right before you faint. You may experience tunnel vision or feeling as if your vision is collapsing into one small tunnel to look through. You may see spots or blurs. Your ears might start to ring or feel as if they are giving off a slight buzz.Other major symptoms include a clammy and pale face, numbness in your face and exterior limbs, feelings of severe anxiety, or sudden onset nausea or stomach pains.

, When you experience any symptoms related to fainting, the goal is to get as low as possible as quickly as you can. Many people receive serious injuries not from the fainting, but from the fall to the ground connected with the loss of consciousness. It is best to lie down on your back or side, but if that is not an option it is okay just to sit down.When you lie down it puts your head at roughly the same level as your heart and encourages circulation to be restored and your blood to head back to your brain easier. If you are pregnant you should lie down (and usually sleep as well) on your left side to lessen the burden on your heart.If the area is crowded, for example, and it is only safe to sit down that can work as well. For maximum benefit, hang your head between your legs. This will encourage the blood to follow gravity and head back down into your brain., If you are in a crowded area it is probably best to touch a wall and slowly try to lean yourself against it. If needed, you may slide yourself slowly down the wall. This will prevent you from being trampled while you are on the ground. Getting away from the crowd might also lower your temperature and make breathing easier.

, If it is too late to lie down in a controlled way, then you will want to control the direction of your fall as much as you can. As you begin to lose consciousness, do your best to angle your body towards a wall if there is one within arm’s reach. This will allow you to slide down the wall instead of going into a free fall.


You can also make an effort to buckle your knees. This will have the effect of lowering you to the ground and will lessen your final fall.

, If you are on stairs and the symptoms start to appear, move from the inner rail to the outer one connected to a wall. Sit down on a stair. If you are close to a landing, try to scoot down on your behind to it where you can then lie down.


If you feel yourself going down before you can sit, try your best to maintain a firm grip on the rail. It can help to guide you down to the floor even as you lose consciousness. If nothing else, draping your body partially over the outer rail (against the wall) will slow the course of your fall and turn it into a slide down.

, Call out for assistance using your voice. If your voice isn’t working properly, wave your hands in the air and mouth out the word “help” repeatedly. Be careful trying to walk towards someone to get help as you could go down mid-step.


If you see someone you might say, “Help! I’m about to pass out!” Or, “Can you help me? I think I’m going to faint.” Don’t be afraid to approach strangers who may be able to help you stay safe.
If you are lucky and someone helps you, they should start by assisting you to the floor if you are not there already. If you do fall and injure yourself, they should apply pressure to the bleeding area and call for medical assistance.The person assisting should also remove any tight clothing that could be constricting blood flow to your head, such as tight neckties.They will need to make sure your airway is clear and stays that way. It may be necessary to tilt you to the side if you begin vomiting. They should check for signs that you are breathing properly, even when unconscious. If anything looks concerning, they should dial for emergency assistance immediately and wait until help arrives.

Identify general risk factors.",How to Evaluate Your Hepatitis C Risk," Some people may be at higher risk for getting Hepatitis C. Organizations such as the World Health Organization and the Mayo Clinic suggest screening for these individuals. Consider testing for Hepatitis C if you:Inject drugs.
Use intranasal drugs.
Have received infected blood products at a facility with inadequate infection control practices (usually before the 1980's).
Have had invasive medical procedures at facilities with inadequate infection control practices.
Are the child of a mother with Hepatitis C.
Have HIV.
Are or were incarcerated.;
, There is no vaccine for Hepatitis C, but taking preventative measures can minimize your risk for contracting the disease. Figuring out occasions on which you may have been exposed to Hepatitis C can help you better evaluate your risk for the disease.Think about and note any occasions on which you may have been exposed to Hepatitis C. Consider things such as where you were, what you touched, and if you required medical treatment. For example, if you were traveling to a country that doesn’t screen blood and required medical care, you may have been exposed to Hepatitis C. You may have been a Good Samaritan and helped a person in an accident. If you came in contact with any of the person’s blood, you may have been infected with Hepatitis C.Another common cause is if you receive a transplant that is coinfected with Hepatitis C. Transplant recipients who receive organs from HCV-positive donors have a high risk of acquiring HCV infection and liver disease., This can minimize your risk of not getting prompt screening for the disease. Symptoms of Hepatitis C include:Fever.
Fatigue.
Loss of appetite.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
Abdominal pain.
Dark urine.
Clay-colored bowel movements.
Join pain.
Jaundice.
Bleeding or bruising easily.Itchy skin.
Swelling in the legs.

, However, 70 to 80% of individuals infected with Hepatitis C don’t have any symptoms. If you suspect you’ve been exposed to the disease, it’s important to undergo tests for a diagnosis.Consider getting tested for Hepatitis C if you have any doubt. There is no harm in getting screened, even if your risk is fairly low. This could minimize the risk of serious health conditions and prevent you from transmitting the disease to someone else.

, One of the best ways to share your concerns about the risk of contracting Hepatitis C and evaluating your risk is speaking to your doctor. A medical professional will consider various factors and determine if screening is necessary.Let your doctor know about your concerns. Inform them about known risk factors and situations in which you may have been exposed to Hepatitis C.
Ask any questions you have about the disease and things that may make you at risk for Hepatitis C.

, A person can contract Hepatitis C by coming in contact with the blood from an individual who has the disease. Most people today are infected with Hepatitis C by sharing needles or other implements to inject drugs. People infected with Hepatitis C can also transmit the disease even if they show no symptoms or are unaware they have it. Other ways that Hepatitis C spreads include:Sharing needles or syringes. Injection drug use accounts for 60% of cases.
Needlestick injuries in health care settings. Healthcare setting injuries account for less than 5% of cases.
Mother to a fetus or infant. Perinatal exposure accounts for less than 5% of cases.
Sharing personal items, such as razors, with a person who has the disease (rare).
Sexual contact with an infected person. Sexual contact accounts for approximately 15% of cases.
Unlicensed and/or unhygienic tattooing or piercing conditions (rare).
Receiving a blood transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products. Blood transfusion infection rates account for 10% of patients., Just as it’s important to know how Hepatitis C is spread, it’s also vital to know how you can’t get the disease. This can minimize your concern about contracting Hepatitis C and may help you avoid potentially uncomfortable situations. You cannot get Hepatitis C by:Sharing eating utensils.
Breastfeeding.
Hugging.
Kissing.
Holding hands.
Coughing.
Sneezing.
Sharing food or water.
Being bitten by a mosquito or insect.

, Any person can contract Hepatitis C. There are some general risk factors that may expose you to Hepatitis C. You should consider these when evaluating your own risk for the disease. The risk factors include:Injecting street drugs or past drug injection.
Receiving donated blood, blood products, or organs.
Hemodialysis patients or those who received it for a long time.
Getting a tattoo or piercing in an unsterile environment.
Being infected with HIV.
Being the child of a mother with HIV.

Strip your bed sheets.,
Deep clean your bathroom.,
Disinfect your kitchen.,
Sanitize any other points of contact.,
Wash all of your sick clothing.,
Air out the house.",How to Feel Better After You Have Been Sick2," When you’re sick you spend most of your time in bed, so cleaning your sheets should be the first priority. You sweat a lot more when you’re sick and your sheets are covered in unhealthy germs, so killing the bacteria on your bed is very important. Strip your entire bed, including pillowcases, and wash them in hot water with color-safe bleach. Treat any stains with a stain remover before washing. Let your mattress breathe for a few hours before putting any new sheets on., Regardless of the type of illness you had, you probably spent a lot of time dealing with the symptoms of your flu in the bathroom. Whether you were just there to grab more tissues or slept in there for two nights vomiting, giving your bathroom a deep clean is another top priority after being sick. Some tips for sanitizing your bathroom:Wash any bath towels, hand towels, rugs, robes, or other fabrics in hot water with color-safe bleach.
Disinfect all surfaces, focusing mainly on the countertops and the toilet. You can use a store-bought product with bleach, or you can make your own with one part water to one part rubbing alcohol or full-strength vinegar.
Empty the trash can, and then disinfect the trash bin.
Replace your toothbrush or soak your toothbrush head in hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes to kill any bacteria.If you used a sponge to wipe everything down, throw it out when you’re done. If you use a cloth wipe, wash it with the towels when you’re finished.

, You might not have used your kitchen much while you were sick, but even just making a pot of tea can leave a trail of germs that can spread your sickness to other people. Disinfect your kitchen with disinfectant wipes, a product with bleach, or a homemade sanitizer with 1 part water to 1 part rubbing alcohol or full-strength vinegar. Key places to wipe down in your kitchen:Countertops
Refrigerator handle
Faucet handles
Pantry, cabinet, and drawer handles
Any dishware used

, It’s hard to remember everything you touched in your house while you were sick, but it’s important to try to sanitize anything you may have had contact with. This will help you stay healthy and reduce the likelihood of you getting anyone else sick. Just be sure to use disinfecting products that are safe for use on a variety of surfaces, such as electronics. In addition to the areas you have already cleaned at this point, the most common points of contact in a house include:Thermometer
Bathroom cabinets and drawer handles
Door knobs
Light switches, including the light switch plate
Electronics like laptops, cell phones, landline phones, TV remotes, and the computer keyboard and mouse

, Now that your bed, bathroom, kitchen, and points of contact are clean, you have to remove the last location of your sick germs: the clothing you wore. Take all of the pajamas, sweaters, and comfy clothes you recuperated in over the past days and weeks and do one last load of laundry using hot water and color-safe bleach. This will ensure that you have killed all the bacteria you possibly can and will have a clean, healthy slate., After you’ve been sick and cooped up in your house with the windows closed and the blinds drawn, it’s a great idea to air out your house. Open any windows and let a cross breeze move some fresh air in and around your house for a little bit. Replacing the stale, sick air in your home with fresh air will get rid of any airborne particles and it will leave you feeling refreshed and energized. If it’s really cold outside, only do this for a minute or two; otherwise, keep the windows open for as long as you like!"

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Eat multiple small meals throughout the day.,
Avoid drinking alcohol.Alcohol can increase your risk of fainting, so it is best to avoid it if you are prone to fainting.,
Pay attention to your medications.,
Go slow for the rest of the day.,
Call for emergency assistance, if needed.",How to Faint Safely2," Don’t be in a rush to get up after a fainting spell. Your body and mind need time to recover. You should stay in your current position on the ground for at least 10-15 minutes. If you get up too soon you risk triggering another episode., Simple fainting episodes are usually resolved by rapidly elevating the person’s feet and legs. While you are on the ground see if it possible to elevate your feet at all. Making it so that they are higher than your head is best, but an elevation will help. If you are lying down, see if you (or your helper) can stuff a jacket under your feet. This will improve the blood flow to your head and speed up the healing process.

, While you are waiting to stand again, inhale a series of deep, calming breaths. Fill your lungs to full capacity by breathing through your nose and then slowly release the air via your mouth. If you are still in a stuffy or hot area, you will want to carefully monitor your breathing until you can safely walk to a better space.

, One possible cause of fainting is dehydration. So, to prevent another episode, you will want to drinks lots of water immediately after standing and for the remainder of the day. Be very wary of drinking alcohol after a fainting spell as it will dehydrate you only further, thus adding to the initial problem., Eating more frequently and avoiding skipping meals may help to prevent you from fainting.Try eating five to six small meals per day instead of two or three large meals.

, If you do drink, make sure that you only drink in moderation, which is no more than one drink per day for women of all ages and men over 65, and no more than two drinks per day for men under 65., Some medications may cause dizziness and fainting.Consult your medical provider about which medications may cause these symptoms. Some blood pressure medications may even be taken at bedtime to prevent fainting.

, Recognize that your body needs time to recover and give yourself a bit of a break for the remainder of the day. Make sure to walk slowly and carefully. It is probably best to avoid exercise for the next 24 hours or so. Try to minimize your stress by putting off important tasks until tomorrow.

Keep your blood circulating.,
Avoid situations that trigger episodes.",How to Faint Safely3," Whether this is your first episode or one in a series, it is a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor to talk over what you experienced. They will decide if any additional action is necessary and this will give you peace of mind moving forward. They might also ask you to watch for particular warning signs, in addition to fainting, such as increased thirst.


Your doctor may order tests such as a blood sugar draw, a general blood test to check for anemia and nutrient levels, and an EKG (to scan for heart issues). These are all fairly standard diagnostic tools.Your doctor may also place restrictions on your behaviors until the cause of fainting has been established and treated. They may request that you limit your driving and avoid operating any kind of heavy or complex machinery.It is helpful if you can bring with you a statement or brief note from someone who witnessed you faint. After all, you were unconscious for part of this time and this person call “fill in the blanks” regarding what happened to you., There is a possibility that your doctor will prescribe medication to you to treat and prevent future fainting episodes. These medications usually address the underlying cause of the fainting. For example, corticosteroids are drugs that help to boost hydration via the elevation of sodium levels.Make sure to follow the exact directions on any medication that you receive. If you fail to do so, you run the risk of your fainting spells getting worse.

, This is good advice in general but is especially helpful if you’ve fainted in the past. Carry small snacks with you that are high in sugar and salt. For example, drink some juice or eat some mixed nuts. This will to help to prevent your blood sugar from dropping too low, a common cause of fainting., Focus on substances that will improve circulation and heart health overall. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements are good in that they minimize inflammation allowing your blood to circulation more efficiently. You can also focus on herbal remedies, such as green tea, also praised for its anti-inflammatory properties.Carefully discuss all herbs and supplements with your doctor to ensure that they do not interfere with your current medications or possess problematic side effects.

, You’ve probably seen these before and they are easy to order from your doctor or even online. A medical ID, certificate, or card includes your name, medical status, emergency contact information, and known allergens. This is an especially good idea if you suffer from frequent fainting episodes or if you plan to travel., Fainting can also result from emotional events or stress. Learn to control your body’s reaction by practicing deep breathing techniques. Enroll in a yoga or meditation class to learn the methods that are best suited for you. Some even suggest hypnosis as a way to lower overall stress levels and regulate blood pressure., These can help with circulation by improving blood flow from your legs back up to your heart and brain.However avoid wearing girdles, garters or other constricting garments that may decrease venous return.

, Rising too quickly from a seated or lying position may lead to fainting. Try to transition from one position to another slowly to help prevent fainting.For example, sit up on the edge of the bed in the morning before standing up.

, Make a habit of periodically flexing your leg muscles or wiggling your toes when standing or sitting for periods of time. This will help to improve your circulation allowing your heart to work a bit less. Even swaying slightly from side-to-side will help when standing.You can also wear pressure stockings that encourage the blood to move from your lower extremities up into your upper body and head., Each time that you faint consider the underlying causes in consultation with your doctor. You may need to avoid seeing blood or perhaps overheating is the issue. Standing for long periods might be the problem for you. Or, perhaps you get overwhelmed with fear and pass out. When you know what triggers your fainting you can actively work to avoid those situations."

You may also want to set up a couple of cushions on the floor to sit on as you meditate. Set the cushions so they are near each other, but so that there will be a bit of space between you and your partner.;
, Get into a position that is comfortable for you and your partner. You can either lie down or sit up with your legs in the lotus position. You and your partner can meditate while wearing something loose and comfortable or while not wearing anything at all if you prefer.


Keep your spine straight, whether you are sitting or lying down, with your arms by your sides. Rest your arms loosely in your lap if you meditate in a seated position.Keep your chin up and your head aligned with your spine if you are seated., When you are ready, you and your partner can close your eyes and start the meditation. Then, try to remain aware of your surroundings at first. Pay attention to your body, your breath, and any sounds that you hear.Try to ignore intrusive thoughts and simply focus on the present moment. If a thought pops into your head, acknowledge the thought and then let it pass. For example, if you think of something that happened at work, then you might think to yourself, “yes, that happened,” and then picture the thought drifting away.

, As you meditate, focus on your space and breathing. Take deep, soothing breaths and pay attention to air entering and leaving your body. As you breathe in, pull the air down into your abdomen and imagine stress leaving your body as you exhale.Try to be aware of yourself and how you feel. Take stock of how the air feels around your body, how all your different body parts feel from your hands to your feet., As the meditation starts, visualize your own body. Think about how your body looks inside and out as well as how your body's energy looks. Think about the shapes, colors, and sounds of your current feelings. For example, you might imagine the desire that you are feeling for your partner looks like a red orb.Focus on your physical sensations. Try to be as aware of your own body and the sensations you're feeling as possible. The goal of sexual meditation is heightened awareness, which can lead to increased sexual arousal., Once you're done visualizing yourself, shift focus to your partner.

Look at your partner. You can open your eyes and look into your partner’s eyes. Make sure that you notice your partner's breathing as well. Glance at the movements of your partner’s body.For example, you might watch your partner’s stomach and chest as they fill with air and then deflate again.

Communicate with your partner without speaking. Try to use your face, hands, and eyes to show your partner what you are feeling. Watch your partner's expressions as well. Try to see what he or she is feeling as well., After about 20 minutes of sexual meditation, transition into sexual intercourse. If intercourse is more enjoyable after sexual meditation, talk to your partner about doing regular sexual meditations.

, It can be difficult to concentrate with outside noises, so playing some nature sounds or some music meant to enhance meditation may help you and your partner to relax. Try playing some rain sounds, ocean wave sounds, or some new age music.


Make sure that you choose something that will last long enough to play while you are meditating and having sex.

, Once you've tried basic sexual meditation, try to move on to more complex forms. Taoist sexual meditation is a form of meditation that focuses on you and your partner merging desires.



Matching breaths. You can start Taoist meditation by holding your partner and trying to merge your breathing. That is, match the pace of your inhaling and exhaling so that you and your partner are inhaling and exhaling at the same time. Keep going until you breathe as one.

Hand pulsing. Pulsing is another form of Taoist sexual meditation. Gently open and close your partner's hand or squeeze your partner’s hand using a smooth, gentle rhythm. Your partner can also squeeze your hand., Tantric sex is a way of using sex to meditate, so incorporating some tantric practices may be enjoyable for you and your partner. Some easy tantric sex practices that you can try are:



Eye gazing. Try to maintain eye contact with your partner while you have sex and as you climax as well.

Alternating breaths. Try to alternate breaths with your partner. For example, you can breathe in as your partner breathes out and vice versa."

Understand why people do it.,
Do your own research on the topic.,
Ask your doctor about placentophagy and its potential benefits.,
Let your doctor, midwife, or birthing assistant know.,
Decide how to eat your placenta.,
Keep track of your body's reactions.,
Do not treat your placenta as a cure.",How to Eat Your Placenta," The supposed benefits of eating one’s own placenta include increased energy, increased quantities of breast milk, and balancing of hormones (as the placenta contains iron, vitamins B6 and B12, estrogen, oxytocin, and progesterone) which could reduce the risk for postpartum depression and insomnia.


Although most scientific studies on the practice have yet to overwhelmingly yield definite benefits for humans, positive individual accounts and experiences have brought this practice to light. An exception to this is a recent study from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in which 76% of the new mothers studied who ate their placenta after delivering experienced positive effects (primarily increased levels of energy, lactation, and an overall better mood).
The only negative effects placentophagy presented were headaches, along with unpleasant burping, taste, and smell. There has been no study on the possibility of positive placentophagy results being due to the placebo effect.;
, Some people find this practice to be appealing, and others completely the opposite. In order to determine if it's right for you, do your own research.


Research scientific studies, newspapers articles, personal accounts
Find out how placentophagy worked (or didn’t work) for women who have tried it. Some women may have had positive experiences (increased energy, good mood) while others may have had negative experiences (nausea, feeling sick).
If you are considering placentophagy for a specific reason (such as preventing postpartum depression), research other options for the same concern, such as over-the-counter drugs, prescription medication, herbal supplements, homeopathic remedies, or hormone replacement therapy.

,


Talk to your doctor about your specific situation. If your pregnancy conditions are abnormal, ask your doctor about what effect it may have on your placenta. For example, preeclampsia may cause stress proteins to form in the placenta. The effects of eating “abnormal” placenta have yet to be studied and are unknown.

,


Arrange to keep your placenta in advance. This will ensure that it is not put into biohazardous waste or disposed of.
In the case of a practitioner or hospital whose policy is against placentophagy, you can either find a different provider or request a change of procedure.
Make sure to have these arrangements settled ahead of time to avoid any miscommunication or accidental disposal during delivery.

,


You can hire a professional placenta preparer to make capsules. The placenta is dehydrated, ground into powder, and filled into small, pill-shaped capsules for easy consumption. These pills are to be taken daily for several weeks.
You can also treat the placenta as any other type of meat. This means either freezing or cooking it right after birth to avoid spoiling. From then on, you can incorporate it into your regular meals as any other type of meat, such as chili and stews.

, Monitor any changes you feel in energy level, mood, appetite, and overall wellness.reaction


If the ingestion of your placenta, no matter how you decide to do it, harbors negative reactions (nausea, vomiting, feeling sick), stop ingesting it.

, If you are feeling unusual pain, exhibiting concerning mental and/or physical symptoms, or suspect you have postpartum depression, do not wait for the placenta to start working. See your practitioner immediately as these could be signs for threatening conditions; your practitioner may prescribe medication for these issues, so let them know of your placentophagy practice to avoid any harmful effects.

Avoid alcohol and caffeine.,
Have a light meal before your flight.,
Avoid taking sleeping pills.,
Recline your seat.,
Take your shoes off.,
Use your neck pillow, your sleep mask, and your earplugs.,
Put on the compression socks to improve your blood circulation.,
Avoid looking at bright screens, like your laptop or a television screen.,
Ask the flight staff not to disturb you.,
Set an alarm 30 minutes before your flight lands.",How to Sleep on a Plane," Unless you can afford to book a lie-flat seat, which is often only available in first class on most planes, you will end up in an upright seat. It can be difficult to get a good rest, even when you recline your seat, so choosing which side of the plane your seat is on and if you are in the aisle seat or the window seat are essential. Determine if you sleep on the left side or the right side of your bed at home. If you sleep on your right side, you should choose a seat that is on the right side of the plane, and vice versa if you are a left side sleeper. This will mimic your natural sleep position and help you get to sleep on the plane.Avoid a seat in the bulkhead area of the plane or in the exit rows. Some exit row seats do not recline and some bulkhead seats have armrests that cannot be raised. This could seriously cramp your style and leave you feeling stiff and tired at the end of your flight. You should also avoid seats in the last row of the plane, by the lavatories. The smell from the bathrooms could keep you up and many of these seats do not recline.As well, if you are taking a flight at night, go for the window seat. In general, a window seat is ideal as you will have more space to sleep and you will retain control of the window shade.;
, Try to fit all your items into one bag and keep a few small necessities near the top of your bag, like a book or magazine, a bottle of water, or a snack. Most airline only allow one carry-on per passenger and reducing your luggage means you will not crowd the legroom underneath the seat in front of you with extra bags., Create a sleep kit for the plane that includes all of these items. The neck pillow will help support your neck, even in turbulence as you try to slumber in your seat, the sleep mask will block out any light that could keep you awake and the earplugs will reduce any noises around you.Earphones can also work to block out any surrounding noise on the plane and help you focus on sleep.


Compression socks are also very useful for flying, as they reduce your risk of travel-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition that can lead to blood clots. If you are at risk of developing DVT, you should purchase compression socks at your local pharmacy, usually referred to as “flight socks”. Look for graduated compression stockings that you can wear up to your knees with class 1 compression. The slight pressure from the stockings helps to prevent blood from pooling in your calves., Dress for the plane in comfortable layers and be sure to always carry or wear a sweater as you may get cold on the flight due to inactivity and constant air circulation.You should also wear comfortable shoes you can take on and off easily. Taking your shoes off during the flight will improve your circulation and can help you fall asleep. If your feet tend to get cold on the plane, you should wear socks with your shoes or bring an extra pair of socks in your carry on.

, Alcohol and food or drink that contain caffeine, like coffee, tea or soda, can keep you awake during the flight and make it more difficult to get some rest. Resist the temptation to have a quick coffee before you board and stick to water or juice when the beverage cart comes around during your flight.

, Don’t get stuck paying too much for a bland sandwich or a bag of chips during your flight. Airline food isn’t only expensive, it can cause indigestion and gas, which will make it more difficult to get some sleep. Instead, go for a light snack or meal before your flight that consists of easy to digest items like yogurt, nuts like raw almonds, and fruits like oranges, which are a good source of vitamin C and liquids.A smoothie made with fruits and vegetables is also a good way to fill up your stomach, without causing indigestion or dehydration. If you are craving a hot beverage, go for herbal tea with no caffeine. As well, you should always drink lots of water before and during your flight to stay hydrated.

, Many people take sleeping pills or sleep aids, such as the hormone supplement melatonin.But use sleeping pills with caution, as taking them and then flying at high altitudes can cause blood clots and DVT. If you do feel you need to take sleeping pills, ask your doctor which type is right for you before you use any pills for flying.Always talk to your doctor about any risks or complications due to taking sleeping pills. Several prescription sleeping pills you might take are Ambien, Silenor, and Lunesta.You can also take Benadryl, an over the counter antihistamine that causes drowsiness and may help you get to sleep. Taking a melatonin supplement is another option. Speak to your doctor before you take any over the counter sleeping medications to help you sleep.It’s important to time when you take the sleeping pills to avoid waking up feeling groggy and tired. If you are flying from London to New York, for example, take the pills at your bed time in New York, using the time zone in New York. If you are flying from London to Beijing, take the pills at your normal bed time in Beijing, while you are on board the flight.While it’s important that you sleep during your flight, you should also try to get up and walk around at some point to avoid blood pooling in your legs and to lower your risk of blood clots.

, You are used to sleeping flat on a bed, so try to mimic this as much as possible during your flight by reclining your seat back. Before you do so, give the person behind you a heads up, as they may have a beverage on their tray.Most people will recline their seats during a night flight, as they are all after sleep like you.

, Get comfortable by slipping off your shoes and placing them under the seat in front of you. Put on your socks, if necessary, and wrap your sweater or your jacket around you so you stay warm while you sleep., Before your flight, pull out these important items and place them in the front pocket of your seat. When you’re ready for a snooze, take these items out to prepare for sleep.If you are using earphones and are going to listen to music to help you sleep, ensure the volume is not set too high so you don’t disturb those around you.
There are several apps available via your smart phone that provide calming sleep sounds to help you drift off, such as SleepStream., Prevent tingling or uncomfortable leg pains, as well as more serious conditions like blood clots, with a pair of compression socks. This preventative measure is especially important if you plan to sleep for several hours on your flight and are not going to be moving around very much.It’s important for your blood circulation to try to stand up and walk down the aisle for five to ten minutes every few hours on a long flight, though this may interrupt your deep sleep.

, The bright light from a laptop or a television screen can linger even when you close your eyes and make it difficult to shut your brain off for sleep. Prepare for sleep by putting away your laptop, dimming the light on the screen in the seat in front of you, and lowering the brightness of your phone.


Remember that though you may feel you can be productive on a long flight by answering emails and watching the latest release, sleep is never a waste of time. Arriving at your destination well rested will be worth it.

, Before take off, pull a flight attendant aside and politely ask not to be disturbed if you fall asleep during the flight. Most attendants will let you sleep during a flight and will follow the do not disturb protocol, but give the staff a gentle reminder so you are left in peace.

, Once you get to sleep on your flight, you may not want to ever wake up. Rather than be jolted awake by bright lights or a captain’s announcement, set an alarm on your phone so you have time to wake up and get organized before the plane lands. Waking up 30 minutes before landing will give you time to go the restroom, gather your sleep items, put on your shoes, and get ready to disembark, feeling well rested."

Protect your heart and your arteries with a low-fat diet.,
Eat diverse fruits and vegetables.,
Eat lean, not fatty, meats.,
Manage your weight with six to eight servings of whole grains per day.,
Control your fat intake with low-fat dairy products.,
Reduce your hypertension risk with a low-salt diet.,
Limit the amount of sweets you eat.",How to Eat to Protect Your Heart1," Eating a high-fat diet increases your risks of obesity, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke. Try to eat no more than three servings of fat per day. A tablespoon of butter is a serving. Ways to do this include:Check the labels on food to see what types of fat they contain. Saturated fats are generally solid fats like butter and shortening. They increase your cholesterol and risk of heart disease. Keep saturated fats to 14 grams per day or less.
Trans fats also increase your cholesterol, increasing your risk of clogged arteries and heart attacks. Try to eat no more than two grams of trans fats per day. If food says that it has fats which are “partially hydrogenated,” they may be trans fats.Unsaturated fats like monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are thought to be healthier than saturated and trans fats. They are found in oils, avocados, nuts, and seeds.
The Mayo Clinic recommends the following fat sources: Olive, canola, vegetable, and nut oils; avocados; nuts; seeds; trans-fat-free margarine; cholesterol-lowering margarines like Benecol, Promise Activ, and Smart Balance. Less healthy fats include: Butter, lard, bacon fat, gravy, cream sauces, nondairy creamers, hydrogenated margarine, hydrogenated shortening, cocoa butter, chocolate, coconut, palm, cottonseed, and palm kernel oils.;
, Many people don’t eat nearly enough fruits and vegetables. Try to consume four to five servings of both fruit and vegetables daily. A serving is a half a cup. Fruits and vegetables are great sources of vitamins and minerals and they are low in fat.Healthy ways to get fruits and vegetables include eating them fresh or frozen. If you purchase canned items, look for low sodium vegetables and fruits that are canned in juice or water.
Avoid eating vegetables that are fried, breaded, or have heavy cream sauces. These are high in fat. Fruits that are canned in sugary syrups or are frozen with added sugar will increase your calorie intake.
Prepare healthy snacks of fresh fruit and vegetables and keep them handy for when you are hungry. You can bring them with you to work or school for between meals. Apples, bananas, carrots, cucumbers and green peppers all make convenient, satisfying snacks when you are on the go.

, Great sources of lean meats include poultry and fish. Limit your consumption of fatty red meats. The fat and cholesterol will build up in your arteries and increase your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and heart attacks. Limit your meat consumption to 6 servings per day. A serving is an ounce of meat or an egg.Trim the fat off your meat and remove the skin. There is often a layer of fat beneath the skin.
Bake, grill, or roast meat instead of frying it.
Salmon, herring, trout, and tuna are great sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which will help control your cholesterol. Try to eat them at least twice per week instead of other meats.
This is exceptionally important when people have high cholesterol, blood pressure or other heart risks.

, Whole grains have more nutrients so they will fill you up faster than processed white breads. This will help you control your portion sizes. A serving is a slice of bread or a half a cup of cooked rice. Try making some easy replacements to increase the amount of whole grains you consume:Purchase whole wheat flour instead of white flour.
Eat whole wheat pasta and breads instead of white.
Eat brown rice instead of white.
Barley and buckwheat are excellent additional sources of whole grains and fiber.
Eat oatmeal instead of commercially prepared breakfast cereals. If you do eat commercially prepared cereals, look for ones that provide at least 5 grams of fiber per serving.
Avoid eating muffins, frozen waffles, doughnuts, biscuits, quick breads, cakes, pies, and egg noodles.

, Low fat dairy can provide you with calcium and vitamin D, which is important for maintaining healthy bones. However, it is important to eat low-fat and low-salt varieties to avoid compromising your heart. Too much salt will increase your blood pressure and a high fat diet can increase your cholesterol and increase your risk of heart attacks; full-fat dairy, like cheeses and yogurts, contain high levels of both saturated fats and sodium. A cup is a serving. Limit your dairy intake to a maximum of three servings each day.Eat only low-sodium cheeses.
Drink low-fat or skim milk, eat low-fat or skim yogurt, and avoid cream sauces. Restaurants often make cream sauces with heavy cream which is high in fat.

, Hypertension, or high blood pressure, increases your chances of having heart disease. You can lower your blood pressure, and with it, your heart disease risk, by cutting down on salt. Try to eat no more than 2,300 mg of salt per day. Easy ways to cut your salt intake include:Removing the salt shaker from the table. Many people add a few shakes of salt to their plate right before they dig in. Try to eliminate this extra source of salt.
Don’t salt rice or pasta water when you cook. If recipes call for salt, you can still add some salt, but try reducing it by at least half. If you are baking bread that will rise, it may need a small amount of salt, but you can still reduce the amount in the recipe.
Check the labels on canned foods. Many have salt added. If possible, try to purchase low-salt canned foods. Because sodium is in salt, it may say ""low-sodium"" on the label.
Replace salted snacks with a fruit or vegetable. Instead of eating chips, pretzels, or salted nuts, try eating a carrot or an apple.

, Sugar is high in calories, but low in nutrients and fiber. This means it makes you prone to overeating when you are eating sugary foods. Because obesity increases your risks of developing heart problems, you should minimize the amount of processed sugars you eat. Eat five servings or less per week. A serving is a tablespoon of sugar or jelly.High levels of carbohydrates (which your body converts to sugar) negatively impact triglyceride levels which have a direct impact on the heart.
Avoid candies, cakes, cookies, puddings, pies, and pastries.
If you drink coffee or tea, don’t add sugar.
Drink water instead of sugary sodas.
Go easy on artificial sweeteners like Splenda, NutraSweet, and Equal.

You should always try a mattress before buying it to ensure it is comfortable and supportive for your body.Often, a medium firm mattress is more comfortable as it allows your shoulders and hips to sink in slightly. If you have lower back pain, you may want to consider a firmer mattress with a padded cover for support.
Check your existing mattress to make sure it does not sag at all or cause you any discomfort. If so, it may be time to invest in a new mattress. Though you can use boards underneath the mattress to help with the sagging, this is a temporary fix and you will eventually need to buy a new mattress to get a good night’s sleep.

Don’t eat the entire meal when you go out to eat. Restaurants often serve much more food than is healthy. If you enjoyed the meal, take it home and finish it the next day.

, Alcohol is high in calories. Drinking too much may make you prone to obesity, which will then increase your risk of heart problems. If you drink, do so in moderation.Women and men over 65 should have no more than one drink per day.
Men under 65 should limit their alcohol consumption to two drinks per day.
A 12 oz beer, 5 oz glass of wine, or 1.5 oz of hard liquor qualifies as a drink.

, Many people are reluctant to quit smoking because they are worried it will make them gain weight. Smoking and chewing tobacco increase your risk of having hard, narrow arteries. This increases your blood pressure, your risk of heart attacks, heart disease, and strokes. If you need help to both quit and manage your weight simultaneously, there are many resources available:Talk to your doctor or see a counselor
Consult a nutritionist or dietician to develop a meal plan that will work for you
Join support groups or call hotlines
Discuss medications or nicotine replacement therapy with your doctor

, Exercise will help you to lose weight and keep it off. It will also help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels.Do 75–150 minutes of physical activity per week. You can spread it out however it works best with your schedule. Great low-cost options include walking, running, biking, swimming, and playing sports such as basketball or soccer.
If you need to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, try to do at least 40 minutes of physical activity three to four days a week. You will probably be surprised how quickly you feel yourself getting fitter.

Do not eat or drink alcohol several hours before bed.,
Wind down before you go to bed.,
Consider eventually rolling over onto one side.",How to Sleep on Your Back Comfortably2," Alcohol is known to cause restless and disturbed sleep. As well, eating a heavy meal right before bed can lead to restless sleep, causing snoring and constant moving or shifting in bed.Try to only drink water a few hours before bed and eat dinner several hours before bedtime. This will ensure your body has had time digest your food and is ready for a good sleep.

, To help you prepare for bed, do a relaxing activity like taking a long bath, reading a book, or having a quiet discussion with your partner. Winding down before bed will help you get comfortable and ease into sleep.


You may also want to have a warm beverage, like herbal tea, before bed. Avoid any beverages that contain caffeine, as this will only keep you up at night.

, Though you may begin your night sleeping on your back, you may want to consider rolling over to one side as you start to fall asleep or if you wake up in the middle of the night. Sleeping on your back can lead to snoring and restless sleep. If possible, try to roll to one side so your body is more comfortable and able to sustain a deep sleep throughout the night."

Enjoy a bath or shower.,
Make sure to eat something.,
Stay hydrated.,
Get some sun.",How to Enjoy a Sick Day2," Chances are if you're sick, you're feeling tired. Energy levels can drop when you're not feeling well and you might feel like sleeping on your sick day. This is a natural immune response and sleep is a requirement for good health. Use your sick day as an opportunity to catch up on lost sleep and start to feel better.Take as many naps as you need during the day.
Don't try to stay up late. Go to bed early and get a good nights rest.

, Depending on your symptoms, a bath or shower can help you feel better. Both hot and cold showers will have different effects and should be used in different cases. Review the following information to learn when you should use hot or cold water: Hot water can help relax and ease muscle or joint pain. It may also help with de-congestion.Cool or lukewarm showers and baths can help reduce swelling and can lower a high fever.
Very cold showers can actually raise your temperature due to shivering.
Never take a hot shower or bath if you have a fever as this can raise your temperature to dangerous levels.

, Although you may not have a big appetite when you are sick, you still need to eat and maintain caloric energy. Eating can help you recover from your illness and can even reduce stress. Make yourself something tasty to start feeling better.Carbohydrates are important when you are sick and you'll want around 150 grams of them per sick day.
Half a cup of apple juice can have up to 15 grams of carbohydrates.
Half a cup of sorbet will give you around 30 grams of carbohydrates.
Try to eat around six small meals per sick day, instead of the usual big three.

Set a cool room temperature.,
Put blackout shades on your windows.,
Create a quiet atmosphere.,
Use your bed only for sleep.,
Turn off all technology at least an hour before bedtime.",How to Sleep Longer (for Kids and Teens)1," When you fall asleep, your body temperature naturally cools. In order to facilitate this process and help you fall asleep, keep your room at a relatively cool temperature. For example, your room temperature should be between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15-20 degrees Celsius), while sleeping. If your parents won't change the temperature of the entire house, you may want to use a fan in your room.You can also try taking a warm bath or shower before bed. This will warm up your body making your room feel cooler.;
, Remember that your sleep-wake cycle is light sensitive. As a result, you want to create a dark environment to help you get to sleep.Try using blackout shades on your windows or an eyemask to manage light pollution.In the morning, open your blinds to let in natural sunlight. This will help your body wake up.

, Loud noises can prevent you from falling asleep. In order to create a quiet atmosphere, tell other members of your family to be quiet when you go to bed. Alternatively, you may need to try earplugs. These are an excellent option if you can hear your parents talking or the TV from your room.They can also be helpful if you live in a loud neighbourhood and you can hear your neighbours or street traffic.

, You may find it easier to fall asleep if you associate your bed with sleep only. Your bed should not be the place where you complete your homework or play video games. This is because you may begin to associate your bed with the frustration that comes along with completing assignments.Set up your video game system in your living room or rec room instead of your bedroom.

, This means you will have to turn off your cellphone, tablet, TV, computer, and any video game system. The light from the screens can actually interfere with your ability to fall asleep.The light that is emitted from technological screens causes your brain to make less melatonin, a hormone that signals your body to fall asleep.This also prevents you from using social media around bedtime, which can cause stress, making it more difficult to fall asleep. For example, you may struggle to fall asleep after reading that your crush has just started dating someone."

The first step is to ensure that the nutrients of the food are not lost.,
Use Smart Fat .,
Pick Whole Grains.,
More Fruits and Vegetables.,
Use Low Fat Dairy or go with non-dairy.,
Use sweeteners judiciously.,
Limit Sodium intake Whether anybody in your family or you have blood pressure or not  it is really wise to keep a check on your sodium intake.

,
Use organic flavor enhancers No meal is complete without proper flavors.",How to Ensure Healthy Cooking," Cooking on traditional stove tops heats the food to a level where most of its nutrients escape. Hence it is best to cook your meals in a microwave oven which shortens cooking time by about a third as compared to traditional cooking. Microwave oven follows a cooking technique that enables nutrients to be preserved. All you need is a safe microwaveable cookware (preferably glass) and the freshest ingredients you can find.  ;
, The next step to cook healthy is to choose the right kind of cooking medium. One must understand that not all fats are bad. Most of the food we eat needs to be made in some kind of oil. Opt for unsaturated over saturated fat like butter and mustard oil for your cooking purposes. Olive oil is still the gold standard for cooking oil.

, Grains form the staple for meals in most of the countries and cultures across the globe. We have been oriented to choose refined gains over whole grains. For once, let us change our regular practice and choose whole grains instead. Whole grains such as brown rice and bulgur have their bran intact and thus they are rich in nutrients like fiber, vitamins, magnesium and zinc.

, Make fruits and vegetables a major part of your meal. Green vegetables are rich in iron, calcium, magnesium and other trace minerals that are beneficial for blood and bone health. Choose grass-fed lean meat and poultry and fish to lessen exposure to antibiotics and chemicals. Incorporating fiber-rich food could turn a simple menu into a healthier meal., Often we make meals with dairy products. One must always remember that dairy products are rich source of calcium as well as fat. So instead of avoiding their use completely we can replace the whole milk dairy with low fat or non fat dairy. This is an easy and effective way to cut saturated fat in your diet.

, Often the meal we cook require some amount of sweetener to get the specific taste. Sugars of any kind whether corn syrup, white sugar, brown sugar, honey or maple syrup, add significant calories without any nutritive value. Barging from the use of sweeteners much often can effectively cut good amount of calorie from your meal and make it healthier. Again there are some recipes where you cannot avoid the use of sweeteners; in that case you can use honey and other fat free replacements of sugar easily available in the market.   

,, So the last step of cooking healthy food includes the choice of seasoning such as fresh herbs, spices and citrus to enhance flavor while preserving the original taste of the food.

Ask your doctor about prescription sleep aids.",How to Sleep Longer," This is one of the most important things to consider. Good beds don't always mean ""soft,"" so get one that provides good support to your back and make sure you are comfortable sleeping on it., Be sure to use a pillow that is comfortable and supportive for your sleeping style. Having the right pillow will ensure that you wake up feeling refreshed and pain-free. If you are comfortable, you will be more likely to sleep longer.

, Keep your bedroom properly ventilated so you get plenty of fresh air. Set the temperature of your room appropriately, not too warm or too cold. Typically this will be between 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit, but you should adjust the temperature so that you feel comfortable. Setting the temperature just slightly cooler than comfortable -- so that you're fine, but still need covers -- will help you sleep.If your room is stuffy, try cracking the window a bit before bed time.

, In addition to providing extra airflow and controlling room temperature, a fan produces a low, consistent level of background noise. This can help eliminate auditory stimuli that keep you from falling and staying asleep.Keep in mind that for some, a fan might not be helpful. If it doesn’t work for you, then don’t use one.

, Try to keep your room dark at all times. Your brain is stimulated by light signal, so keeping a dark room helps you get to sleep faster.You can help with this by installing blackout blinds or curtains


This applies even to small lights, like those on your T.V., a digital clock or D.V.D. player. The absence of light eliminates the presence stimuli that can alter or affect your sleeping patterns.
If there is some reason you cannot, or do not wish to, install blinds or curtains, you can invest in a sleep mask to help simulate darkness.

, Check if your room is free from mosquitoes and other pests. Also, if you have pets in your home, make sure they can’t access your bed or enter your room to avoid disturbances while sleeping., There is evidence that it is easier to sleep in a fresh, clean, or nice smelling space. Try spraying your room with a mild room spray to lighten up your mood and the ambience in your bedroom.If you choose to use scented candles, be sure to put them out before falling asleep to avoid fires in the home.

, Above all else, you must establish and follow a strict sleeping schedule. This will help you ensure that both your body and mind are prepared to sleep each night.This means that you should go to bed and get up at the same time every single day (even weekends).


In the event that it is not possible to get to bed at your usual time, it is important to still get up at the normal time. You may feel a bit more tired, but you will mess up your routine even more if you sleep in. If you are very tired, you can take a power nap during the day. Don't nap for more than 20-30 minutes, though.

, Getting the right amount of physical activity during the day helps prepare your body for sleep each night. Doing light workouts should help you fall asleep faster and sleep longer.You can try activities such as jogging, swimming, or walking.


Do not work out right before bed. Getting your adrenaline flowing before bedtime will negatively impact your sleep schedule. Make sure there is at least a two hour gap between the time you exercise and the time you want to go to sleep.

, After a busy day, it is reasonable to expect that your mind will be trying to process a lot of information. To give your brain some wind-down time, listen to soothing music or read a book for about 10 minutes before going to bed. Try to keep this wind-down period to about 10 minutes, as any longer may risk further sensory stimulation and cut into your sleeping time.Avoid reading on back-lit screens, though, as these tend to disrupt your sleep patterns.Don't try to have deep conversations right before bed, either. If you have a problem with your spouse, for example, don't wait until just before bedtime to bring it up. Resolve your concerns earlier in the day so they don't plague you at night.

, Finish having your dinner at least 2 hours before going to bed and don’t eat again after dinner. Your body will have an easier time adjusting to sleep if it is not in the process of digestion.That being said, if you feel very hungry before bed, try having a cup of herbal tea or some crackers to curb your hunger. It may also be difficult to sleep if your stomach is rumbling.

, Caffeine’s energizing effects remain long after you have ingested it.Therefore, limit yourself to about 200mg of coffee (about 2 cups of coffee), and try to ingest your last caffeine at least six hours before bedtime.If you can, try to avoid caffeine altogether, or as much as possible. Some studies suggest that even caffeine digested six hours before bed can have disruptive effects on sleep., Soaking your legs and feet in warm water for about two minutes before going to bed will help with relaxation and will also increase circulation to that area. Ensuring proper blood flow to your extremities will help eliminate restlessness of your legs.Alternatively, a nice, warm bath or shower just before bedtime can have the same benefits.

, Make sure you use the bathroom before bedtime so you don't have to go during the night, which will disrupt your sleep pattern., Being able to breathe freely is important for a good night’s rest. Lie down and take deep breaths of air before bedtime to clear your nostrils. Avoid sleeping with blankets and pillows over your face., It is critical that you do not hit the snooze button when your alarm goes off in the morning. Snoozing interrupts your sleeping patterns and makes you more tired when trying to wake in the morning, while providing you with no additional quality sleep time.Set your alarm for a later time. If you have the time to hit the snooze button and go back to bed after waking in the morning, then you have additional time to sleep in. So, set your alarm for a later time. This will help ensure you get the maximum amount of uninterrupted, quality sleep., Maybe you need to wake up earlier to make breakfast or a bag lunch for the day or you need the extra time to clean up and groom yourself. One way to sleep longer is to handle these types of issues in the evening before you go to sleep. Make your bag lunch and put it in the fridge. If you need coffee in the morning, set your pot to turn on automatically. If you need to bathe, do it before you go to bed. Making minor adjustments to your nighttime routine can allow you more time to sleep in the morning.It is important to note that showering before bed can contribute to difficulty falling asleep at night, so take a warm bath instead of showering.

, If you find that you are waking up frequently throughout the night, try to avoid opening your eyes or getting out of bed. The best tactic is to keep your eyes shut and do not move from a comfortable sleeping position if you awake prematurely. This will help you fall back asleep immediately, leading to longer periods of sleep.If you find that you can’t fall asleep again within 20 minutes of waking up prematurely, then it is likely a lost cause. Wake up and go through your daily routine again so that you will be ready to go to sleep and stay asleep the next night.
If it is still several hours before your usual wake up time, try having an herbal tea or reading a book for a few minutes. These things may help you relax enough to fall back asleep.

, While it is not always possible, one way to get more sleep at night is to eliminate pressing or stressful matters from your morning schedule. If you are nervous or anxious about something that will occur in the morning, it can impact your ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep throughout the night. As such, try to schedule important meetings or other events in the afternoon or evening., Before turning to a sleep aid, you should first take note of your existing sleeping patterns and habits. This can help you identify and eliminate any problems impacting your sleep patterns before seeking out a medicinal cure., Once you have chronicled your sleeping patterns, speak with your doctor. Sharing this information with a doctor could yield surprisingly simple and effective solutions to your sleep problems. A doctor should also be able to identify and treat any underlying medical issues that are causing or contributing to your sleep deficiency. After seeing a doctor and sharing your sleeping habits with him or her, you will be in a better position to determine if a sleep aid is right for you., For years, sleep aids were considered a dangerous solution to sleep pattern problems because the user would form a dependency, needing the sleep aid to sleep each night, regardless of the surrounding circumstances. However, recent advances in sleep aid medicine have yielded non-habit forming pills that can help you get to sleep faster and stay asleep for longer. Common over-the-counter sleep aids rely on the following active ingredients:


Diphenhydramine, which is found in brands such as Benadryl and Unisom SleepGels, is an antihistamine with sedative effects. The side effects of diphenhydramine are dry mouth, drowsiness, blurred vision, urinary retention and constipation.
Doxylamine succinate (found in Unisom SleepTabs) also contains a sedating antihistamine. Doxylamine succinate and diphenhydramine have similar side effects.
Melatonin is a hormone that helps to regulate your natural sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin supplements have been shown to be potentially helpful in treating jet lag. It also has been shown to help people fall asleep quicker. Potential side effects to look for are headaches and daytime sleepiness.
Valerian supplements have been used as sleep aids in some circumstances. While some research has shown potential therapeutic benefits, other studies have suggested it is ineffective as a sleep aid. Valerian does not seem to cause any side effects in users.Most over-the-counter sleep aids rely on the sedative effects of antihistamines to help users go to sleep. However, people can quickly build a tolerance to antihistamines, making this type of sleep aid a temporary solution at best., Never mix sleep aids and alcoholic beverages. While a “nightcap” and a sleep aid will definitely make you drowsy, the side-effects of mixing alcohol and sleep aids together can be dangerous and potentially deadly., Make sure that the sleep aid you choose is safe to take with existing medications you are taking. This is important for two reasons. First, it will ensure that you are not putting yourself at risk for a negative interaction between the two drugs. Secondly, any interference with your regular medication routine can negatively impact your ability to fall and stay asleep, as your pre-existing health problems can recur.When speaking with your doctor about starting a sleep aid, be sure to mention any medications you are currently taking, whether they are prescription or over-the-counter.

, If over-the-counter sleep aids don't work for you, talk to your doctor about prescription options to help you fall asleep and stay asleep longer.Common options include:Benzodiazepines. These medicines slow down your nervous system, making it easier for you to fall asleep. However, they may have serious side effects.
Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics. These medications are more targeted than benzodiazepines and may have fewer side effects.
Melatonin receptor agonists. These work much the same as over-the-counter melatonin and help alter your circadian rhythms.
Orexin receptor antagonists. These block orexin, a brain chemical that may cause sleep difficulties.
Some of these medications may not be safely used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about any medical conditions you have before taking any prescription medications.

Take whatever steps you need to ensure none of these things will distract you come morning.


Be sure to turn off any alarms that usually wake you, whether on your phone or a clock on your nightstand. While you're at it, turn any digital, lit clocks away from your face so that you won't wake and stare at the clock, which will distract you from sleeping longer. In fact, studies have shown that blue light emitted from electronics like clocks can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, the hormone that signals your brain to sleep.Make sure you shut and lock your doors you do not want any disturbance while you’re snoozing. If needed, place a ""Do not disturb"" sign on your bedroom or front door.
Turn off your cell phone, or at least turn it to silent. If you have a landline, turn off the ringer or unplug it.;
, Nothing is more unpleasant than waking up with the sun in your face. In fact, your brain is wired to wake up fully when you're in a lighted environment, so if your room is not completely dark, your body will tell you that you need to get up. Block as much sun as possible.


If you find yourself unable to sleep in on a regular basis, it might be worth it to invest in some light-canceling window draperies. These are made of an extra-thick material that keeps your room pleasantly dark even when the sun comes up.
If you can't cancel out the light in your room, try wearing a soft eye cover or sleep mask. It might look funny, but a good eye cover will block light and help you sleep longer.

, Eating a good meal a few hours before bed can help you sleep in so that you don't wake up early feeling hungry for breakfast. However, you have to be careful that you choose the right food; some foods can actually make sleep difficult.


Eat something that combines carbohydrates and protein to help make yourself sleepy. For example, you could have a piece of cheese with a few crackers, or a banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter.Try a few cherries or tart cherry juice about thirty minutes before bedtime. Cherries have been shown to help increase melatonin, the hormone that helps you get a restful night's sleep.Try a glass of warm milk. Warm milk has long been touted as a sleep aid. Milk contains tryptophan, which increases serotonin levels and helps you sleep better.Avoid anything with caffeine or other energy supplements. This might seem obvious, but a cup of joe in the afternoon can affect your sleep even many hours later. In one study, participants who consumed coffee six hours before bed lost an average of an hour of sleep!To be on the safe side, avoid coffee, tea, soda, or other caffeinated foods and drinks in the afternoon and evening.
Avoid anything with a high fat content or a lot of salt (like fried foods or most fast food). These foods can cause heartburn and interfere with rest.You should also avoid acidic foods, like citrus or tomatoes, for the same reason.
Avoid alcohol as well. Although alcohol may relax you and make you feel sleepy, it can also disrupt your sleep by causing you to wake up in the middle of the night. If you share a bed with someone, then alcohol can also be a nuisance for your partner by making your snoring worse., There are several things you should do to be sure that your bedroom is optimal for a restful night's sleep, which will help you linger longer in the morning.


Set the thermostat to the right temperature: Most people get their best sleep in a room that is around 65 degrees Fahrenheit.You might find that you prefer a few degrees higher or lower, but keeping it cool can contribute to a longer sleep period.
Use a fan. The noise of a fan can be very relaxing. This is called “white noise” and it can help you to sleep better.Some people enjoy the feeling of a cool breeze on the face while sleeping; others don't. You can turn your fan towards you or away from you depending on what you prefer. Or you can try a white noise machine or Youtube video that simulates the sound of a fan or another soothing sound, such as the sound of rain falling or waves crashing on a beach.
If you live in a noisy environment, consider using ear plugs to eliminate sounds that might disturb you.

, While this technique does not work for everyone, if you are desperate to sleep in late, sometimes staying up late can help you achieve that. By pushing yourself into exhaustion, your body might overcompensate in the morning by sleeping in past your normal wake time.


While this technique is probably ok occasionally, avoid staying up late on a regular basis. Doing so might be bad for your health; some studies have linked night owl behavior with higher blood sugar, diabetes, and excess body fat., You can't just go from a stress-filled day to your bed and expect to rest well. You need to get your body and mind in the right state to fully relax and commit to a deep sleep.


Turn off the television and all electronic devices. Using electronics near your bedtime actually affects your body's production of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone. The light emitted from electronic devices signals for your brain to stay awake and alert, which makes it harder to wind down at bedtime. You should turn off electronics at least two hours before bedtime.Take a warm bath or shower about an hour before you plan to hit the sack. Your body will become sleepy as you cool off from the warm shower and your body temperature drops.Be sure to use the bathroom right before turning in, so that you don't have to wake early to relieve yourself.

, In order to fall asleep you must relax both your body and mind. Learn to shut off the to-do list in your mind and fully relax for a good night's rest, which will help you sleep in longer.Try deep breathing techniques to help you relax. As you breathe deeply, your body gets more oxygen which can slow the heart rate and help you to relax. Take a slow, deep breath through your nose and let the air expand your belly, not your chest. Hold the breath for a second, then slowly let it out through your nose.
Keep a worry journal near your bed, and if a worrying thought or another item for your to-do list pops into your head, write it down and forget it until the next day., Even if you prepare a restful room, you might still wake earlier than you would like. In this situation, you need to quickly and easily allow yourself to slip back into sleep without fully rousing, or else you will lie there alert and awake and not be able to fall back asleep. Mindfulness is a meditative practice that can help you calm your mind when you wake up unintentionally.


As you feel your body moving from a state of sleep to gradual wakefulness, keep your body in a comfortable sleeping position and keep your eyes closed. Calmly think about falling back asleep. Think about how comfortable the bed feels around you, how relaxed your mind is, and try to gently guide your mind back to rest.
If you were dreaming, you can help your mind move back into a sleep state by re-entering the dream world. Think about where you left off in the dream, and use your imagination to think about what might happen next in the dream.

, A mantra is a short, simple phrase that you can recite over and over in a form of meditation, as a way of getting control over your mind and body. A mantra can help you to lull yourself back to sleep. In fact, reciting a mantra can help to lower your blood pressure and heart rate, helping establish a sleepy state.Your mantra can be as simple as ""Rest. Rest. Rest."" or ""I welcome sleep."" A soft lullaby, relaxing prayer, or self affirmation can be a nice way to lull yourself off to sleep.
It helps if it is something you have also made a habit of reciting at bedtime, so that it serves as a cue to your mind and body that it is bedtime

, If you find you wake up and have to use the restroom, try to do so as peacefully and quietly as possible, so that you can return to your bed and get more rest.


Get out of bed and pull your blankets back up to the pillow. If you use the restroom quickly, this will keep your side of the bed warm with your body heat while you're away. Otherwise, you'll return to cold sheets that can make it hard to get cozy again.
Don't turn on the lights, open the blinds, or check your phone. If you wear glasses but can navigate safely to the bathroom without them, don't put them on. Each of these things will rouse your mind and can cause you to wake more fully.

, If you wake up earlier than you wanted to but find that you can't fall back asleep, don't just lay there tossing and turning! If it has been more than fifteen minutes or so since you woke up, get up and make the bed. Then, do something relaxing like gentle yoga or listening to soothing music.

If you start to feel drowsy, go back to bed, turn down the covers, and curl up in a ball or your favorite sleeping position. This way your body continues to associate the bed with sleep and the rest of the house with wakefulness. By making the bed and turning down the covers when you go back to bed, you are sending your brain the signal that you are starting over with your sleep. This can help you fall back to sleep easily., It can be hard to fall asleep at night or to sleep late in the morning if you are not getting adequate physical exercise every day, which exhausts the body and helps you rest more thoroughly at night.


If you do not regularly exercise, ease into a regular routine of about 30 minutes of moderate activity a day. This can be as simple as a walk around your neighborhood. In addition to sleeping better, there are so many benefits to regular exercise, including better immunity, emotional health, and self-confidence., Going to bed and rising at the same time every night is actually the best way to feel rested, instead of relying on sleeping in to ""catch up"" on lost sleep throughout the week.Instead of sleeping in on weekends, try going to bed thirty minutes to an hour earlier than your typical bedtime during the week. Then, on weekends, go to bed and rise at the same time as you do during the week. This will add in the needed extra sleep without compromising your sleep schedule.
Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep a night to feel rested and productive;children and teenagers need significantly more (anywhere from 9 to 11 hours).The exact amount varies depending on your body's needs and how active you are throughout the day.

, Your body's natural circadian rhythm is strongly linked to light: you are naturally wired to be alert in the daytime and to sleep at night, so light contributes to wakefulness and dark contributes to sleepiness. You need to ensure that your daytime environment, whether it's an office or your home, is full of lots of natural light to keep your circadian rhythms in balance.Open up the blinds, take heavy draperies off the windows, and turn on your lamps or other lights in your home during the day. If you can't get a lot of lights in your indoor environment, be sure to spend a lot of time outdoors in natural light.

, One of the biggest contributing factors to poor sleep quality is high stress levels. Learning coping techniques to lower your stress level can help you sleep better at night, so that you'll feel more rested and won't need to sleep in.



Practice positive self-talk. Research has shown that having a good attitude can actually reduce stress levels. You can begin changing your attitude by saying positive things to yourself instead of negative things throughout the day. Instead of thinking about your faults and failings, think about your strong points.

Try to get 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.,
Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.,
Write in a diary or journal before bed.,
Engage in relaxing behaviours before bed.",How to Sleep Longer (for Kids and Teens)2," Kids and teens need anywhere from 8\ to 10 hours of sleep every night. This likely means that you need to go to bed earlier. During this time in your life, you are undergoing a period of intellectual, emotional, and physical growth. This requires a lot of energy and the extra rest allows you to wake up refreshed and ready to meet a new day!To ensure that you are getting enough sleep, try making a sleep journal to track your sleep.

, This allows your body to find its natural 24-hour circadian rhythm for going to sleep and waking up. This rhythm is based on the amount of light and darkness you experience during the day. It determines when you go to sleep and wake up each day. Consistency will make your sleep more restful.You can still sleep in slightly on the weekends, but try not to adjust your sleep schedule by more than two hours. If you stay up too late or sleep in until noon on weekends, your body will not be able to easily adjust on Monday, making you tired and unproductive., Perhaps you have trouble sleeping because you have a lot on your mind. Deal with your worry and stress before you get into bed by writing a journal. This can be a great way to relax and unwind before bed..

, Rather than playing video games or watching TV right before bed, try engaging in a relaxing activity. This will help you transition into a more relaxed state. Once this behaviour has become habit, your body will associate it with sleep.For example, try an activity that calms you, such as breathing exercises, reading, yoga, or listening to quiet music.
Avoid taking part in overly stimulating activities such as listening to loud music or watching a horror movie.

Avoid caffeine products in the afternoon.,
Exercise during the day.,
Make your mornings easier.,
Take a short nap during the day.,
Cut back on extracurricular activities.,
Practice time management skills.",How to Sleep Longer (for Kids and Teens)3," Thinking about your homework is stimulating, so you want to complete it a few hours before going to bed. If you leave your homework to the last minute, you will need time to unwind before you will be able to fall asleep.For example, avoid doing homework within an hour of your regular bedtime., Caffeine is a stimulant and could make it difficult to fall asleep if consumed before bed. As a result, you should avoid drinking caffeinated beverages, such as soda, energy drinks, coffee, and tea anytime after midday., Exercise helps to increase your metabolism and provide you with energy. If you take part in exercise during the day it can actually tire you out, making it easier to fall asleep at night.

, You will be able to sleep in longer if you prepare for the school day before you go to bed. For example, you can bathe or shower in the evening to save time the next morning. The evening is also a convenient time for you to pack your school bag and plan what you will wear, eat for breakfast, and take for lunch the next day.Even if you wear a uniform to school, you can lay out your clothes including socks, shoes, and any hair accessories to help save time in the morning.
Ask your parents to make you a breakfast that can be eaten on the bus. For example, peanut butter toast with a banana on the side.
Preparing the night before, will allow you to wake up at the last possible moment before heading to school!

, It is okay to take a short nap if you come home from school feeling exhausted. Your nap should be no longer than 20 to 30 minutes and should not take place after 5pm. If you are going to take a nap, set an alarm so that you do not oversleep.Sleeping for longer than 30 minutes could cause you to go into a deep sleep and you will feel groggy when you wake up.
Similarly, napping too close to bedtime could make it difficult for you to fall asleep.

, Many young kids and teens, like yourself, engage in a variety of extracurricular activities. Although these are often fun and positive experiences, they may impact the amount of sleep you get each night. For example, your extracurricular commitments may cause you to complete your homework later in the evening, making it difficult to fall asleep.Make a list of all of your after school activities and commitments, such as a part-time job, track and field practice, homework, socializing with friends, etc. Then decide which activity you can cut in order to ensure you get enough sleep.

, You must be as productive as possible throughout the day. For example, work on your homework during short periods of free time between different activities.

For example, your entire family could focus on developing good sleep habits. If everyone in the house is trying to get more sleep it may help you sleep better as well. Ask your parents if you can dim all the lights in your house or apartment around bedtime. This will help signal to your body that it is time for sleep.Similarly, the whole family could try turning off all technology after 9 pm. The lack of distractions will help everyone begin to wind down and prepare for bedtime.

, In some instances, a lack of sleep could be a result of an underlying sleep issue. If you are struggling to get enough sleep and it is impacting your ability to concentrate during the day, you should seek medical attention. For example, perhaps you are suffering from chronic insomnia, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, reflux, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), or restless legs syndrome (RLS).Explain to your doctor how much sleep you get each night, and how you constantly feel tired and drained of energy.
You should also explain where your sleep issues come from. For example, do you have trouble falling asleep at night? Do you wake up throughout the night as a result of bad dreams or difficulty breathing? Do you nod off in the middle of school?

, In order to diagnose an underlying health or sleep issue, your doctor will likely complete a number of medical assessments. For instance, they may evaluate your overall health and sleep habits, ask about your family medical history, and inquire about any medication you are taking.


This assessment will help your doctor determine the type of treatment necessary for your particular situation.

, If your doctor discovers that there is an underlying medical condition, such as sleep apnea or insomnia, they may provide you with treatment options. Depending on the issue, you may be treated with medication, light therapy, or other sleep techniques.Be sure to follow all instructions and tips provided by your doctor.

Reduce the amount of water you drink.",How to Sleep In," It's much easier to sleep in a dark room. Close your blinds or curtains, and keep your door shut to block light from the rest of the house. You'll be sleeping during brighter hours than usual, so do what you can to make up for it.


If your curtains are thin, try slinging a blanket over your curtain rod.;
, Ever go from tired to wide awake in ten minutes? This happens when your body moves to the next part of it sleep cycle. Typically, the cycle lasts about three hours. If you track the times you feel most tired, you can go to bed at that time to get better sleep. Set an alarm for a time when you usually feel awake, and there's a better chance that you'll avoid morning grogginess.

, Most people sleep best in a cool room, kept at roughly 65ºF (18ºC).Adjust the thermostat and bedclothes until you are comfortable. You should be warm enough to fall asleep comfortably, but not so warm that you sweat or kick off the blankets in the night.


Try warmer or cooler pajamas, sleeping without pajamas, or using a hot water bottle.
If you usually shower right before bed, try showering an hour in advance instead. This gives you time to cool down.

, Noise can make it difficult to fall asleep, or lead to a restless night. Mask it by running a fan, or a radio set to static. Some people enjoy falling asleep to relaxing music., This will make you tired in the morning, but it's a risky strategy. If you have trouble sleeping in, there's the chance you'll get up anyway and end up with a nasty sleep debt.

, Exposure to daylight earlier in the day can help keep your body synchronized with the day-night cycle.Outdoor exercise may be particularly effective, so you don't go to bed full of excess energy.


While some people can exercise right before bed, many people find it difficult to sleep until they've cooled down.

, Sleeping pills will knock you out, but overuse can lead to addiction or an inability to sleep without them. Many sleeping medications lead to serious side effects or allergic reactions in some users.Use these only for short-term problems. If you have serious trouble sleeping, visit a doctor and ask about more effective medication.


Melatonin is a safer option, but not as powerful. It's usually most effective at fixing jet lag or another disrupted sleep schedule.It may not be your best bet for a one-time sleep-in.
Most over the counter sleeping medications are antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine or doxylamine, sometimes combined with painkillers or alcohol. Side effects such as next-day drowsiness or dizziness are common, and it's unclear whether these are even effective.Prescription-strength drugs are usually benzodiazepines. These can lead to severe addiction and withdrawal symptoms, and will only work while you are taking them.Most other prescription-strength drugs have not been around long enough to gather complete data on effectiveness or side effects. Talk to your doctor about zaleplon (Sonata), zolpidem (Ambien), and eszopiclone (Lunesta) and ask for recent information., If you wake up before you'd like, resist the urge to get up. Don't move at all, not even to open your eyes or scratch your nose. If you let the initial discomfort pass, you can usually drift back to sleep.

, While lying still, take deep breaths through your nose. Try the 4-7-8 pattern to relax yourself:


Count to four slowly as you inhale through your nose.
Hold as you count to seven.
Exhale as you count to eight, through your mouth.
Repeat until you fall asleep.

, Silently tell yourself that you'll fall back into restful slumber. If you are thinking about what you have to do, or worrying about your inability to sleep in, you'll be less relaxed and more likely to fail.

, If you've waited patiently but still can't fall back asleep, sit up and do something to relax. This is especially useful if you are feeling anxious about your inability to sleep. Read a relaxing book, listen to quiet music, or stand up and stretch. Return to bed within fifteen minutes.

, Some people suffer from temporary paralysis when they wake up, aware of their surroundings but unable to move. This is harmless, but often accompanied by terror or even hallucinations. Following the advice above for restful sleep reduces the odds of this happening. If you still have these experiences, take additional precautions:Sleep on your side, not your back. If you wake up on your back anyway, try sewing a sock on the back of your pajamas and filling it with a tennis ball.
During a paralysis episode, try to move your fingers, toes, and tongue. Some people can even have an ""out of body"" experience by imagining themselves standing up.
Whenever you have a nightmare or sleep paralysis episode, document it in a journal. This can give you the psychological distance you need to overcome your fear.

, Blue light tricks your brain into thinking it's the afternoon, and screens are full of blue light. Avoid computers, television, and cell phones for at least an hour before you plan to fall asleep. This will lead to deeper, more restful sleep.

, Many people take alcohol to help them fall asleep, without realizing that it leads to restless sleep. Similarly, the relaxing effect of cigarettes doesn't outweigh the buzz of nicotine. Avoid both of these substances in the late evening, or you may find yourself awake before your alarm. Finally, as you probably know, caffeine from coffee, soda, or chocolate can make it much more difficult to sleep.


Some people are extra-sensitive to caffeine, and may have trouble sleeping if they drink coffee or tea in the afternoon. Try skipping everything but your morning dose for a few days. Your sleep may improve.

, Eating large portions or rich foods can lead to restless sleep. Eat dinner at least two hours before you go to bed. If you get hungry in the late evening, eat a light snack and drink a glass of water or milk.

, If you have to get up in the morning to pee, you'll have a harder time sleeping in. Drink no more than a small glass of water to stay hydrated.

Eliminate distractions.,
Put the word out to friends and family.,
Use a white noise machine.,
Keep your room cool.",How to Sleep During Daytime1," Turn off your phone, hang blackout curtains or window shades, and consider an eye mask, earplugs, and a “Do not disturb” sign on your door. There is a lot more happening during the day, including the sun shining, and it all makes it more difficult to sleep. By blocking out as much of this external stimuli as possible you can create a faux nighttime atmosphere that will help trick your body into thinking it’s nighttime bedtime.If you have children and need to be reachable for emergencies, set your phone to vibrate on their school’s number only.;
, Remind everyone closest to you that your schedule is reversed and to leave you alone during your sleep time. They will always understand and do their best to let you get the rest you need.

, This will help drown out the sounds of the daytime world which, as you would think, are usually much louder than the sounds of your world at night.You can also have a radio playing softly, a fan humming, or a personal audio device like an iPod playing sounds of the ocean, forest, or a river.

, Whether using an air conditioner, fan, or ceiling fan, keeping cool is a very important factor in sleeping. Nothing interrupts sleep quite like being uncomfortably hot."

Lie down and do a deep breathing exercise.Place one hand on the chest and one hand on the stomach to monitor your breaths.,
Learn to practice meditation.,
Do progressive muscle relaxation when you cannot relax.,
Turn on a guided imagery video to help ease into sleep.,
Get regular physical activity.",How to Sleep During a Manic (Bipolar) Episode1," Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose filling up your lungs. The breath should be coming from your stomach; you should not feel your chest moving. Then, slowly release the air from your mouth, feeling your stomach deflate as the air leaves. Practice doing 4 to 6 breaths per minute, repeating the cycle for 10 or more times.


Get ready for bed as you normally would but perform this exercise to help calm your mind and make getting to sleep easier. You may also perform this exercise while sitting in a chair.
Deep breathing can be helpful for calming the rapid thoughts and anxiety that may accompany mania during any time of the day or night. No one has to know you're even doing the exercise.;
, This technique can be a terrific way to cleanse your mind of negative thoughts and promote relaxation. Sit in a quiet room with your legs crossed on the floor or with your back straight in a chair. Close your eyes. Breathe normally, focusing your attention on each inhale and exhale. Refuse to let your mind wander, returning your attention to the breath each time you go astray. Do this for a few minutes until you build up to longer periods., This relaxation method can be done on your own or with a guided video. Sit comfortably in a chair. Take a few deep breaths, breathing in calm and breathing out tension. Slowly, moving up through your body, tense one muscle groups and hold for a few seconds. Release the tension and notice how it feels. Move up to the next muscle group until you have done your entire body., This form of relaxation involves a number of techniques that use the senses to reduce anxiety and stress. A guided imagery session may require you to imagine that you are on a serene walk through a meadow or wading through the ocean. YouTube has numerous guided imagery videos you can watch free.

, Exercise can be a great way to calm anxiety or your mood during a manic phase of bipolar disorder.However, so that the activity does not further cause disruption in your sleep, try working out in the morning or at least several hours before bed.


Your exercise regimen can include moderate activities like yoga, Pilates, or a walk through the park. You can also engage in more vigorous forms of exercise such as running or high intensity interval training.
No matter what type of exercise you choose, the benefits outweigh those of not doing any at all. Regular exercise can improve mood, lower risk of disease, and may even help with the depressive episodes you experience with bipolar."

Bring your pillow with you.,
Make yourself at home.,
Try to stay in one hotel room or hostel for multiple nights.,
Wear headphones or earplugs to help cut down on noise disturbance.,
Use a white noise machine.",How to Sleep Comfortably in an Unfamiliar Place1," Your pillow might offer a small comfort of home, even by just carrying its familiar scent. You can’t bring your whole bed, so having your pillow at the very least will help aid in feeling more comfortable, no matter where you are.


If you could not bring your own pillow along, creating a makeshift cervical pillow can help you position yourself more comfortably. Fold a small towel so it matches the pillow, and then roll the towel into a small tube. Slide this roll into the near edge of the pillow as a makeshift support for your neck.;
, Make even your hotel rooms feel as much like home as possible by carrying a photo of your family or loved ones in your bag, bringing your own pillow, and wearing comfortable clothing., When you try to sleep in unfamiliar places, one hemisphere of your brain will stay more awake than the other as a means of being more alert to any potential danger.

But, the longer you stay in one place—especially when you have the comforts of home, like your own pillow—you will likely become more relaxed. Good news for those who might be staying in one hotel room for a few nights!, This helps not just in hotel rooms but also if you are trying to sleep on mass transit. Try listening to soft music or white noise.


Earplugs are a particular must if you're sleeping in hostels, where you could end sharing a dorm room with 10 or more people, depending on the size of the dorm.
There are even headphones designed to be worn comfortably while sleeping, as they lie flat against your head in a soft headband.If you travel often, these might be a good idea to invest in.

, These are small machines that fill a room with a noise cancelling sound to help you fall asleep.


If you don't want to invest in a white noise machine or noise-canceling headphones, create your own white noise to drown out disturbing racket. Leave your iPod playing softly, turn on the bedside radio, or use the television, if there is one, on a sleep setting. Be careful, though, because of the negative effect that the light from the TV could have on your ability to fall asleep. If using the TV just for noise, make sure to wear an eye mask to block the light.

Stimulate your heart by getting some aerobic exercise.,
Expend yourself fully.,
Pump some iron.",How to Sleep Better with Exercise1," Aerobic exercise is when oxygenated blood gets pumped to deliver oxygen to the muscles. Given that roughly half of American, middle-aged adults complain of insomnia, figuring out how to improve sleep through aerobic exercise is of utmost importance. Some basic improved sleep concepts follow:Get your heart rate going, but make it moderate enough to allow you to still keep up a conversation. You can choose fast walking, swimming, jogging, cross-country skiing, biking, dancing or using an elliptical machine.
Work out at roughly 75% of your max heart rate (i.e. 220 minus age). Take your heart rate while working out, counting the number of heart beats in 15 seconds and then multiple it by four.
Try to exercise five times a week for 30 minutes. More is fine, but less is not preferred.
Keep at it for about four months. Results will not be immediate, but after an extended time there will be visual benefits as well as probable sleep improvements.
Not only will exercise improve general nighttime sleep, but it will also improve the post-lunch fog that falls over most people.;
, Some studies have indicated minimal physiological difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise.Try pushing yourself as hard as you can in short bursts. Training anaerobically literally means you’re training without oxygen, so you won't be able to do the exercises for extended periods. Figure a way to periodically go as hard as possible.


Try to aim for 85% of your max heart rate, or higher, to go anaerobic.
Sprint like your life depends on it. You won’t make it far, but build in a few rest periods and it will wear you out enough to produce the desired physical and sleep-related results.
Jump up and down with weights. Start with small dumbbells at first, and either increase the weight or the height of the jump as you become accustomed to the difficulty.
People who engaged in regular anaerobic activity lost fat more quickly, and secreted more growth hormones, which helps you to repair your body's systems, heal more quickly, and rest more soundly.You may also wish to try high-intensity interval training in which you alternate periods of low-intensity exercise (like walking) with bursts of high-intensity exercise (like sprinting).

, Lifting weights has been shown to aid sleep in a variety of ways. Aim to lift weights two to three times per week with plenty of rest between muscle group sessions. Once you feel comfortable with a specific weight, make gradual 5–10 percent increases to the repetitions or the weight.Not only does strength training improve sleep, it also lowers weight and helps fight off sleep apnea.
Weight lifting helps with depression.Since sleep is a time for muscle recovery, resistance training acts as a jump-start towards sleep. You may even fall asleep faster and make it through the entire night without interruption.

Treat your depression.,
See your doctor to check for underlying sleep disorders.,
Set aside a time to dwell on your worries.,
Start small.,
Try relaxation techniques.,
Avoid staring at the clock.,
Watch for suicidal thoughts.",How to Sleep Better when You Have Depression1," The best way to help you sleep better when you are suffering from depression is to treat your depression. If it is the cause of your insomnia, treating it will make you sleep better. Most depression treatment consists of psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, and sometimes medication.


Each treatment plan is different depending on the cause and severity of your depression. Discuss your treatment options with your doctor.
There are some antidepressants that can help you sleep, such as mianserin, mirtazapine, nefazodone, and trazodone.;
, If you are unsure if your insomnia is related to your depression, ask your doctor to run some tests to see if you have an underlying sleep disorder or other condition that may be adding to your insomnia. This is especially true if you have tried multiple different things to help you sleep and it hasn’t worked.


There are also some medications that treat depression that may cause sleeplessness. Although antidepressants such as Celexa, Zoloft, and Prozac may not be a problem for some, these medications have been shown to cause insomnia is some patients.Ask your doctor if this may be the cause of your insomnia.If you think you have a sleep disorder, talk to your doctor about sleep treatment so you can cure your insomnia. If you treat your depression but still have insomnia, you are at risk of a depression relapse because insomnia often causes depression, especially if you have suffered from it before., In order to help clear your mind at night, try to set up a time period (no more than two hours) to allow yourself to dwell on the things that are making you upset. This may help to keep your worries confined to a short window before bedtime so that you will not dwell on them while you are trying to fall asleep.


You can also try writing your worries down before you go to bed., Trying to get eight to nine hours of sleep every night right in the beginning may be difficult. Instead, think of your efforts to sleep in small steps, which will keep you from getting overwhelmed and frustrated. Start out by trying to get one more hour of sleep the first night. The next night, try to get an additional hour of sleep. Before you know it, you will be sleeping the whole night through.


It may take more than one night to extend your sleeping schedule. Just take it a little at a to avoid making yourself more depressed by failing to meet your goals., When you are depressed, you may have a hard time relaxing enough to fall asleep. If this happens to you, try relaxation techniques before bed. These include deep breathing techniques, muscle relaxation techniques, or visualization techniques.


You can do a combination of physical and mental relaxation techniques if both your body and mind feel tense.You may need to try a few different types before you find the ones that best work for your circumstances.

, When you are having a hard time falling asleep, avoid looking at the clock too much. This will make you focus too much on the amount of time it is taking you to fall asleep, which can make you even more upset, frustrated, or depressed. Instead, focus on something else, keeping your mind from obsessing about the time.If you find yourself looking at the clock despite your best efforts, try covering the clock or moving it to a place you can’t easily see it from the bed. This will make it much harder for you to see the time and help you focus less on the passage of time.
You should also avoid looking at your phone to check the time as well. Not only will it make you get anxious about the passage of time, the light emitted from the phone can actually stimulate your body enough to make it harder for you to sleep., Two of the major risk factors of suicide are depression and insomnia. Those with depression and insomnia are much more likely to become suicidal as opposed to depressed patients who sleep well.If you find yourself getting to this point, talk to your doctor about getting some help.

Avoid stimulants before bedtime.,
Take care of your body.,
Lay off alcohol before bedtime.,
Shield your eyes from sunlight.",How to Sleep During Daytime2," Since you’re sleeping during the day because you’ve been up all night, make sure you avoid coffee, tea, or anything caffeine or stimulant related after midnight. Something at the beginning of your long night is fine, but just as it is during the day, if you have something too late you’ll be tossing and turning and unable to sleep once you lie down., This is really no different than a normal routine of working or being up during the day and sleeping at night. Eating healthy meals and getting plenty of exercise will help your body acclimate more quickly to being up all night and sleeping during the day.

, While it may very well help you fall asleep, alcohol can cause problems staying asleep, sleeping soundly and comfortably, and may cause you to wake up too early. The best rule of thumb is to avoid any kind of stimulant or depressant when on this reverse schedule.The exception to this rule of avoiding any “medicinal value” items like alcohol or sleep-aids is if your doctor prescribes you medication to alleviate a sleep issue.

, Before going to bed, wear dark sunglasses and even a brimmed hat to keep the sun out of your eyes as much as possible. Sunlight triggers your natural circadian rhythm and can make it hard to fall asleep if you’ve been exposed to it."
"
Take strategically timed naps.,
Create a routine.,
Avoid being up all night on multiple consecutive nights.,
Go outside when you wake up.",How to Sleep During Daytime3," Think of it as the reverse of a typical schedule. You don’t want to take a nap at 6:00pm if you’re going to bed at 10:00pm because it will probably make it hard to sleep at bedtime. The same rule applies here. Generally, right before work and on break (if you’re working at night) are perfect times to catch up on any of the sleep you’re lacking., Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day will help you quickly adjust to your daytime sleeping schedule. Since it goes against your natural biological clock to sleep during the day and be up at night, this is a very important part of making the change easy on your body., Whether it’s work or other obligations that have you up all night, if you can be up just a couple nights at a time followed by a couple nights of sleep you will undoubtedly be able to recover more quickly and easily.

, Getting into sunlight will help your body wake up faster and triggers your natural circadian rhythm so that it thinks it’s early in the morning when really it’s probably late afternoon."
"
Establish a nightly routine.,
Limit bedroom activities.,
Create an optimal sleeping environment.If your bedroom is comfortable and inviting it will be easier to fall asleep there.,
Minimize alcohol and caffeine intake before bed.",How to Sleep During a Manic (Bipolar) Episode2," You may be able to prevent manic episodes from happening in the first place by practicing good sleep hygiene. This can be very effective at curing sleeplessness in individuals with bipolar disorder - even those in a manic episode. Consider developing a winding-down routine to get you in the right mind-frame for sleep.A nightly routine may consist of doing light stretching, tidying up your home, preparing your clothing for the following day, taking a hot bath, and reading a book. Try to do things that do not involve bright lights or technology since these things do not signal to your brain that it is sleep time. Do calming activities that indicate to both your brain and your body that sleep time is nearing.

, The bedroom should be associated primarily with sleeping. If you are a person that does work on your laptop in bed or watches TV while in bed, you may need to change those habits to get to sleep. Try moving distracting activities from the bedroom and do these in another area.

, Get a cozy mattress, bedding, and pillows to create an environment conducive to sleeping. In addition, cover your windows with black-out curtains to let minimal light in. Turn down your thermostat to a cool temperature.

, Depending on any medications you are taking, you may have already been instructed to limit these beverages completely. However, if you have been cleared to drink alcohol and caffeine, keep consumption to several hours before bed.You may be surprised at the advice about not drinking alcohol before bed. Most people will feel drowsy after one or two drinks. Even though alcohol may help you fall asleep, it does not promote good quality sleep and you may wake up hours later and be unable to fall asleep again.
Caffeine is a stimulant, so the last thing you want to do in the hours before bed is stimulate yourself even more than you already may be with manic symptoms. Cut caffeine intake in the afternoon to sleep better at night."

Find a psychiatrist with experience in treating bipolar disorder.,
Consider trying interpersonal and social rhythms therapy (IPSRT).,
Ask your doctor if you can take melatonin.",How to Sleep During a Manic (Bipolar) Episode3," Your doctor will help you determine a medication regimen that will help you control bipolar symptoms. Always take your medications as prescribed, since skipping a dose may induce a manic episode. Alert your doctor if you are having sleep problems. Consistent sleep deprivation may exacerbate bipolar symptoms, affect quality of life, and even lead to a substance abuse problem.Some medications such as antidepressants may actually cause sleep disruption.If you are taking such medications, talk to your doctor to see if you can change your meds or add additional meds to your current regimen that will help you sleep better.

, This is a form of psychotherapy based upon the idea that bipolar disorder is caused or made worse by disruptions to circadian rhythms and sleep deprivation. Its goal is to reduce the reoccurrence of manic episodes.IPSRT can be conducted one-on-one or in a group setting. It focuses on helping people with mood disorders like yourself better manage their everyday lives with routines and strategies to improve sleep and manage stress., Melatonin is a hormone that is naturally secreted by the body. It helps regulate circadian rhythms and acts as an internal clock controlling sleep. Secretion is high at night and low in the morning and during the day. Talk to your doctor to see if this supplement may be useful in helping you achieve better quality sleep.Your psychiatrist may also suggest non-addictive sleep aids that can be purchased over-the-counter like diphenhydramine."

Avoid staring at a clock.",How to Sleep Comfortably in an Unfamiliar Place2," Darkness is the first natural signal to your body that it is time to go to sleep. Too much light will keep your body from being able to properly relax and become ready for sleep.Use curtains on windows or place a rolled towel beneath the door to block light and noise. Pack a couple of clothespins or metal binder clips to hold the curtains shut if necessary.
Wear a sleeping mask to cut down on potential sleep disturbances from too much light. If you make the sleep mask a part of your everyday bed routine, putting the mask on also signals your body that it is time to relax.
This includes artificial light, too. Things like nightlights and even digital clocks can interrupt the process of falling asleep.Eliminate as many forms of light as you are able to, either by shutting them off or wearing a sleep mask.

, That will give the room some time to reach the proper temperature, and you some time to make final adjustments, before you go to sleep.


Since your body normally cools down as you fall asleep and your heart rate slows, keeping your room cool can help get the process started faster., Just like the light from digital clocks can keep you awake, the act of watching the time can make it more difficult to fall asleep.


Staring at the clock can be stress-inducing, so turn digital clocks away and don’t position yourself near any wall clocks when trying to sleep."
"
Maintain your normal before-bed routine even when away from home.,
Stop using your phone, tablet, or laptop just before bed.,
Take any medications at the right time of day.",How to Sleep Comfortably in an Unfamiliar Place3," Having a set routine can help you sleep better at home, but also when you’re away.


Many experts agree that the most successful people read right before bed.So, try reading a few chapters of a book before bed, both at home and while away. It can help relax you and help you to wind down from a stressful day, or even help you block out things going on around you if you are trying to get comfortable in a more public place, like a plane or hostel.

, Research shows that using your phone before bed can hinder your ability to easily fall asleep, due to the blue and white light that the screens of our electronics emit.

This light tricks our brains into thinking it is still daylight, and inhibits the release of melatonin, which is a natural sleep-inducing hormone. Power these devices down a good 60 to 90 minutes before bedtime, both at home and on the road., Daytime cold medicines, for example, contain chemicals designed to help keep you awake, so try to avoid taking those too close to bedtime."
"
Use the bed only for sleeping.,
Avoid caffeine and other stimulants that might keep you awake, beginning in late afternoon.,
Avoid heavy, filling meals too close to bed.,
Avoid stress.",How to Sleep Comfortably in an Unfamiliar Place4," Avoid watching television, eating or working from bed, if possible. If you learn to associate your bed with only sleep rather than with work or wakefulness, it can help make it easier to fall asleep.


Try to stick to a bedtime when you can. This can sometimes be difficult when traveling, but if you try to stick to a certain bedtime, it will help regulate your body’s natural sleep schedule., A study recently showed that drinking a caffeinated beverage even six hours before bed made it difficult for subject in the study to fall asleep.If you are especially sensitive to the effects of caffeine, keep your caffeine consumption to the morning only.

, Eating a large meal before bed could make digestion a bit more difficult, and lead to indigestion, which could then cause you to stay awake—and be uncomfortable., Traveling can bring about all kinds of stressors, and all of these can make it more difficult for us to fall asleep while we’re away. Try to pinpoint the things that stress you out while traveling, and work to correct them.


For example, if you are traveling in a place you have never been and are worried you might get lost, don’t panic! Locals are usually more than willing to help out and point you in the right direction. If all else fails, use the GPS on your phone to navigate the best route. (Just find some WiFi if you are overseas and download directions before you go!)Maybe you are trying to sleep on mass transit and are worried you will miss your stop. If you are wearing headphones, just set an alarm on your phone or iPod. The alarm will sound in your headphones, or even vibrate in your pocket.

Find a time to exercise daily.,
Fight the urge to dismiss exercise.,
Choose the type of exercise that works best with your routine.,
Stay active throughout the day.",How to Sleep Better with Exercise2," For many people, the easiest time to work it in is in the morning. Some studies indicate a morning workout leads to more restful sleep. Many people prefer to exercise in the morning because it helps them to wake up and be energized for the day. It’s possible the exercise sets a body up for the rest of the day, exposing us to sunlight, and even aligning the circadian cycle for the day.You can also exercise in the late afternoon or early evening. Although you may already feel exhausted during this part of the day, exercise at this time may energize you for a few minutes, free up some room for dinner, and use up your remaining energy stores. Some studies even indicate afternoon exercise may be most beneficial for the circadian rhythm. On top of that, the energy release could cause you to have deeper sleep.
As a result of increased body temperature and other factors, some recommend building in a buffer between working out and sleeping. Exercise before sleep, however, has been found in some studies to actually improve the quality of sleep., While many people have a variety of excuses for skipping exercise, failing to exercise may create the lethargy that ends up in a vicious cycle of insomnia and fatigue. Try a few motivation techniques to ensure you get your necessary exercise.Give yourself a visual cue to work out by keeping your workout gear in plain sight. Seeing your running shoes every day could almost shame you to put them on for a run.
Buy plenty of workout clothes. Don’t let laundry day act as an excuse for skipping the gym.
Associate your workouts with a cause. There are plenty of ways to fundraise for charity for great causes that link up well to exercise. Get pure donations or iteration-based donations for a charity you feel connected with and you’ll feel too guilty to become lackadaisical.

, When, where and how you exercise can affect your sleep cycles. If you don’t have a lot of time, try one of the following suggestions:


Do crunches during your commute. Squeeze your abs for 30 second intervals, relax, then do it again.
Use foot power to get to work. Even if it’s jogging from public transportation to your house, fitting in a few minutes every day can make a big difference.
Squats around the house are easy to do if you fit them into your daily routine. Picking items up off the floor, grabbing the oven door, putting on your shoes, there are literally unlimited ways to integrate squats into your life.

, Even if you don't have time to exercise on a given day, you can still help yourself rest better by staying active instead of being sedentary. For example, parking your car farther from a building and forcing yourself to walk, or taking the stairs every day can have positive effects on weight and sleep. They also use up excess energy and add to your body's need to rest at night.

Begin a light yoga routine right before you go to sleep.,
Do an upside down pose on your bed for two minutes.,
Sit on your bed cross-legged.,
Lie flat on the bed with your arms out, palms up.,
Do a child's pose for about 5 minutes.,
Lie flat on your bed, criss-crossing your feet and grabbing your knees.,
Extend your arms and legs and relax into your bed.",How to Sleep Better with Exercise3," A yoga routine designed specifically to help you sleep may help you relax and fall asleep. The poses incorporated into the following routine have been shown to positively affect sleep cycles. Studies have also shown that yoga and Tai-Chi can increase blood circulation and lung capacity. This light exercise will allow you to release muscle tension and stress before sleeping., Align your buttocks with your headboard and put your legs in the air, on the headboard or the wall. Breathe in and out in slow deep breaths.


If your hamstrings are tight, move your buttocks further away from the headboard.
Some people are more limber, and if this pose doesn’t do it for you, scoot closer to the headboard.
Try to relax as you stretch the backs of your legs.

, Do a gentle twist, with your right shoulder moving forward and to the left. Hold for one minute and then do the opposite side.


Do not do this stretch if you have any chronic back problems.
Brace yourself by using your off-hand on the bed.
It’s important to look the way you are stretching to keep proper alignment.

, Bend your knees and let them fall open, with the soles of your feet against each other. If you don’t have the groin flexibility to pull this off, try putting something under each knee to minimize the angle. Rest in this position for three to five minutes.

, In this pose, you kneel on the bed and allow your torso to flatten over your thighs and knees. Your toes should be pointed backward. Lay your arms flat over your head and breathe deeply.

, Rock gently back and forth for one minute while breathing deeply – inhale while sitting up, exhale while going back – as you rock.

, Picture each part of your body relaxing and becoming part of the bed, until you drift into sleep.

Create a sleep schedule.,
Plan a nightly routine.,
Allow time to unwind.,
Use herbs to help you sleep.",How to Sleep Better when You Have Depression2," In order to help your body get used to sleeping on a normal schedule, try to pick a convenient time for you to go to sleep and get up. Make sure it works every day of the week so you can stay on a consistent schedule. After a while, your body will start to respond to the new schedule.


It may be hard at first, especially if you have a hard time getting to sleep or staying asleep. Try to push through so you can get on a schedule. The more tired you are, the more likely you are to be able to fall asleep.
This is true for the weekends as well. Even though you may be tempted to get up later on the weekends, try to avoid sleeping more than one hour past your daily wake up time., In order to help you sleep better, try making a nightly routine that you go through every night. Like your sleep schedule, your nightly routine help you get in the habit of sleeping at certain times. Your nightly routine can also help ease your worries and calm your mind before you get to bed.


Try incorporating relaxing activities into your nightly routine. Taking a warm bath, reading a book, listening to comforting music, or having a cup of decaffeinated tea or warm milk can all be part of your routine.
You can mix your nightly routine up a little if, for example, you don’t need to take a bath each night or you don’t want any milk. Try to keep some similar activities, however, so your body starts to associate the actions with sleep.

, If you are having a hard time falling asleep at night, you need to allow yourself to unwind at the end of the day. This can be for a few hours before you go to bed, but give yourself plenty of time before you try to go to sleep to decompress. This is especially important if you suffer from depression because you often have much more going on emotionally than most people.


This is a great time to focus on things that make you happy or to let go of the things that make you worry or depressed.
This is different than your nightly routine as well, since that typically leads up to you going to bed. Your unwind time is meant to just be time for you to enjoy yourself and focus on relaxation with no intention in mind other than your happiness and well-being.
This time helps you get in the right head space to help you fall asleep. Try relaxing activities such as meditation or watching your favorite TV show., There are many different herbs that may help you sleep. These herbs, such as chamomile, valerian root, lemon balm, or passionflower, can be found as dried herbs that can be made into teas, as essential oils, and as supplements.


Always ask your doctor before you take herbs. This is especially true if you are one medication for depression, since many herbs can interact with medications."
"
Use white noise.,
Keep the lighting low.,
Regulate the temperature.,
Keep your bed for bed related activities.,
Sleep only in your bed.",How to Sleep Better when You Have Depression3," If you are having trouble sleeping, try to incorporate some kind of noise into your environment to help drown out the silence or other ambient noises. This will act as a diversion for your brain and give you something to focus on instead of your anxieties or your efforts to fall asleep.


Sound machines are great for this. They have multiple different kinds of soundscapes, such as ocean waves or thunderstorms, that can help you fall asleep.
This can also be helpful if you live somewhere where there is a lot of outside noise that constantly wakes you up. If this is the case, you may also want to consider ear plugs to help you sleep., When you are trying to create the best environment to sleep in, you need to make sure the lighting is low in your room. This means you should avoid turning on overhead lights or bright lamps too close to bedtime. These lights will lower your production of melatonin, a hormone that helps you sleep.You should also turn off all lights when you go to bed.


If you can’t control the light in your bedroom because of external sources of light, try using blackout curtains, blinds, or an eye mask to help block the light so you can sleep.
If you have to have a night light or similar light to show how to get to a hallway or bathroom, try using a red bulb, which has been shown to disrupt sleep less than normal light bulbs.
The opposite is true for getting up in the morning and trying to stay awake. The brighter the lights, the more awake you will feel., In order for you to sleep well, you need to be comfortable. Temperature regulation in your bedroom is key to getting a good night’s sleep. Find the temperature that you are most comfortable at when you sleep. Try to keep it constant, as extreme temperatures in either direction can disrupt your sleep patterns.


This may be warmer during the colder months and cooler during the summer months.
If you live with other people and you like the temperature at varied levels, try to find a comfortable medium temperature that makes you both happy.
Picking the right sleep clothing can also help you stay at the right temperature at night. Be sure to wear more clothes if you are prone to being chilly or wear breathable fabric if you overheat., When you are having trouble sleeping, you may want to stay in bed all day and try to get more sleep. Avoid doing this because you will start to associate your bed with restlessness and frustration instead of sleep. Instead, if you haven’t fallen asleep within 15 to 30 minutes of going to bed, leave your bed and do something else until you get sleepy again.


Avoid doing anything too stimulating or exciting, which may make it even harder for you to get to bed.
Don’t take your insomnia as a sign of defeat. Thinking like this will only make your depression worse. Instead, just try to relax and do something boring until you get sleepy again., If you are constantly tired, you may be tempted to sleep any place you can fall asleep. This, however, can make it difficult to get your body regulated to a normal sleep pattern. Try to avoid falling asleep on your couch or in a cozy chair in your living room. These places should be for relaxing and wakeful activities and not for sleep.


If you feel as if you can’t keep your eyes open anymore, move to your bed. This will help you sleep better and lower the risk of you being disturbed by inadequate sleeping surfaces or disruptions from others in communal spaces such as living rooms."

Cut back or stop napping.,
Limit alcohol.,
Watch your caffeine intake.,
Turn off electronics a few hours before bedtime.,
Avoid exercising too late in the evening.",How to Sleep Better when You Have Depression4," Having depression can give you an overall sense of lethargy, which can make you want to nap throughout the day. However, you should avoid this behavior if at all possible. Sleeping randomly throughout the day can cause night time disruptions in your sleeping patterns, which can throw your entire sleep schedule off.


If you feel as if you have to nap, make sure it is a short nap of no more than an hour or so. This will help take the edge off of your tiredness but will be less likely to disrupt your nighttime sleep patterns.
Daytime napping may be the only kind of sleep you can get when you suffer from depression induced insomnia. If this is your situation, try to resist napping as much as possible. You will likely be really tired for a while, but eventually you should be able to readjust your sleep schedule to make the bulk of your sleep happen at night., Although it may seem tempting to use alcohol, which is a depressant, to help you sleep, it actually has the opposite effect on your sleep cycle. When you drink, especially larger amounts, you are more prone to multiple sleep disruptions during the night.If you do want to drink, try to cut yourself off a few hours before bedtime and stay within the recommended daily limit. The recommended daily limit is one serving for women and two servings for men. One serving is a 12 ounce beer, 5 fluid ounces of wine, or 1.5 fluid ounces of distilled liquor., Caffeine is a major stimulant that may cause you to lose sleep at night. If you are having trouble sleeping, try to stop drinking caffeinated beverages around 2pm. This will give the caffeine time to get out of your system before you try to sleep.Although there is no clear link to caffeine consumption and depression, caffeine has been shown to affect moods. This means you should try to cut the amount of caffeine you have daily to see if it helps improve your mood.
If you are used to a large amount of caffeine a day, do not cut it out too quickly. This can actually make your depression worse due to the caffeine withdrawals. Instead, try slowly decreasing your daily intake of caffeine until you are at a low level or have cut it out completely.Common sources of caffeine are some sodas, coffee, chocolate, and some teas.

, The light from electronics and the mental stimulation from them can disrupt your sleep cycle. The light decreases the production of melatonin in your body, which can make it harder for you to go to sleep.The mental stimulation that comes along with your electronics can also keep you too keyed up, especially if you use them right until bedtime.


Things accessible on your electronic devices, such as e-mail and social media, can contribute to your depressive state as well. It is best to avoid them for at least two hours before bed., Exercising 30 minutes a day can help promote sleep because it helps burn energy and tire you out. However, exercising too late in the day can actually cause you to sleep poorly because your body is still too wired from the physical activity.


Avoid working out past 7 pm at night. This allows adequate time for your body to come down from the stimulation of your exercise."

Talk to a doctor about sleep apnea.",How to Sleep Comfortably," Believe it or not, it is much easier to fall asleep in a cool environment than a toasty, well-heated room. Try to achieve a temperature in your bedroom between 60º and 67ºF (15.6–19.4ºC). Personal preference has an effect here too, but the ideal sleeping temperature for most people falls into this range. Try it and you may be surprised.;
, If you are a light sleeper, wear ear plugs and eye covers to prevent stimuli from waking you up. If early morning sunlight wakes you up, hang blackout curtains to block it.

, If loud noises in the night are unavoidable, comforting background could help cover them up. Try running a whirring fan or playing quiet, calming instrumental music. If your room is dry, a humidifier can solve two issues at once.

, This is especially important if you suffer from back or neck pain, but anyone can benefit from arranging themselves and their pillows in a comfortable position. Try one of these:


Sleep on your side, with your knees pulled up slightly toward your chest. Place a pillow between your knees to keep your pelvis and spine straight.
Sleep on your back only if your mattress provides comfortable support. Try a second pillow beneath your knees and/or under the hollow of your back for additional support.
Sleeping on your stomach is not recommended, as it can cause breathing issues and neck pain. If this is the only way you can fall asleep, sleep on the edge of a tall pillow, so you can tilt your head slightly for air flow, but don't need to wrench your neck to do so.

, Some people sleep without a pillow, while others prefer one or two large, soft pillows. Go with the option that keeps your neck and shoulders relaxed throughout the night. If you feel tense when you wake up, and can't find a pillow that works for you, try rolling up a towel and placing it under your neck for direct support.


If you can't find a comfortable position for your arms, try holding a large pillow, rolled up towel, or stuffed animal.

, A heavier blanket or cover can increase your sense of security while falling asleep. Depending on personal preference and current weather, you may prefer a light quilt, a warm, thick comforter, or even a weighted bean blanket.

, Change your sleeping setup when the weather gets warmer, especially if you wake up sweaty or feeling trapped in the bedclothes. If you normally sleep naked under blankets, try sleeping in pajamas under just a sheet.


If you don't have air conditioner, wet cloths or paper towels and drape them over your face and arms.

, Work, games, and most other activities should be done at a table or desk instead of on the bed, and in another room whenever possible. Training yourself to associate the bed with sleep or calm bedtime activities can help trigger falling asleep more consistently.

, A way to wind down each night puts you in the right frame of mind for sleeping, especially if you repeat the same ritual every time. If lying awake in bed causes anxiety or fear, this is especially important. Try the following ideas:


Read a calm book.
Listen to a book on tape or a podcast, with your eyes closed. If this keeps you up, listen to nature sounds instead.
Eat a small snack if you tend to wake up hungry, such as a glass of milk, a banana, or a small bowl of low-sugar cereal.

, Exercising is a great idea, as long as you don't wake yourself up with a workout right before bed. Exhausting yourself to extreme fatigue will not produce restful sleep, but some form of physical activity is often a necessity to help you stick to a daily sleep schedule.

, As mentioned above, your body slows down as it starts to sleep, including your metabolism. If you eat a heavy meal before bedtime, your slowed metabolism could keep you uncomfortably full – or return to ""active mode"" and produce unwanted energy.

, When your body transitions from active to resting, everything slows down, and temperature drops. Raising the temperature from a hot shower or a workout session will slow that process down, making it more difficult to sleep. If you need exercise to get tired, or a shower to get comfortable, start it earlier so you have at least thirty minutes to cool down before going to sleep.

, Your brain chemistry interprets blue light as early dawn, which makes your brain more active. Phones, game consoles, and computers are all sources of blue light. Games, work, puzzles, and other activities that involve mental effort may make it especially difficult to sleep.


If you decide to use your computer at night, install Flux to make your computer screen change to redder and pinker ""sunset"" colors at night.

, You probably know that caffeine and sugar keep you awake, including caffeine found in soda and chocolate. Other substances that disturb your sleep include B-vitamins, steroidal medication for asthma, beta-blockers, opiates, ginseng, and guarana.If you take any of these as regular evening supplements, take them earlier in the day instead.


Do not change your medication schedule without consulting a doctor.
Drinking more water can help pass chemicals through your body faster, but this can be counterproductive if you end up waking up in the night to pee.

, The rush from cigarettes or any tobacco source can keep you up or cause anxious, restless slumber. The alcohol advice may seem more unusual, since alcohol puts you to sleep. The rhythm of your sleep after alcohol, however, is significantly disrupted. Avoid alcohol in the two to three hours before bed, or you might wake up in the night, or wake up tired in the morning., If you are having trouble sticking to a sleep schedule or sleeping the whole night through, melatonin can safely be used to encourage this behavior. For severe insomnia, doctor-prescribed sleep medication may be required, but regular use can build up tolerance and even reliance on the drug. Follow your doctor's instructions and skip the drug when possible to mitigate this situation.

, This common condition, characterized by snoring, cuts off air to your lungs while you sleep, causing restless sleep or frequent waking. You are more likely to be affected if you are overweight or have breathing problems. Your doctor may recommend a ""sleep lab"" where your sleep is monitored to find out more.

"

Contact your doctor if your problem is truly severe and you are not sleeping at all or are unable to fall asleep several nights in a row.,
Speak with your doctor if you have pain that is keeping you awake as it is possible that your medications can be altered for a nighttime dose.

,
Try to determine which type of problem you are having.,
Try to stay out of bed during the day if you are having trouble falling asleep, even if you are ill if at all possible.,
Try falling asleep in the hammock in the summertime.,
Try to stay awake during the day.,
Try to get some exercise during the day, if your condition permits, so your body as well as your mind feel tired at the end of the day.,
Do your exercise early in the day, not within a few hours of bedtime.

,
Get some sun during the day.,
Try to limit liquids after 6:00 p.m. if you are waking up frequently to use the bathroom.",How to Sleep Better During a Long Illness," There are now many medications that help you fall asleep that are not habit-forming and have minimal side effects. There are also natural substances available at your pharmacy or health food store (melatonin and Valerian, for example) that many people have found useful, but if you are experiencing a chronic or long-term illness it is imperative that you check with your doctor prior to taking any over-the-counter medication. Even over-the-counter drugs can have unintended consequences for your condition or unwanted interactions with your prescription medications.;
,, Falling asleep and staying asleep are actually two somewhat different problems. There are those people who, once they manage to fall asleep, sleep quite well for several hours at a stretch, and there are those people who fall asleep fairly easily but find they wake up after a couple of hours and are then unable to fall back asleep. Chances are your difficulty is one or the other, not both.

, Reserve the bed for sleeping not for watching TV, eating or reading. Use an easy chair, recliner or a couch for stretching out on during the day, and save your bed for sleeping. You will begin to subconsciously associate the bed with sleep rather than with other activities.

, There is no reason that a hammock and stand have to stay outdoors. Some people sleep better when they have that rocking motion.

, Remember that as someone with an illness, you probably are not using up a lot of energy and your body just might not need much sleep. Even though your brain is tired, your body might not be ready to go to bed. Sleeping during the day disrupts your sleep cycle and makes it harder for you to fall asleep at night as that daytime sleep gets subtracted from the total hours you'll sleep in a 24-hour cycle. More sleep during the day equals less sleep at night.

, It can be as simple as raising your arms up and down or lifting your legs one by one when seated. There are exercise tapes and exercise programs tailored for people with limited strength and mobility. Explore these as they might be what you need until you get better.

,, Exposure to sunlight triggers the creation of certain chemicals in your brain that help regulate when you fall asleep and wake up. Chances are you've been inside and not getting a lot of sunshine. If you can't get outside, sit near a sunny window. If it's dark and gray outside, invest in a full-spectrum light bulb available at most do-it-yourself and hardware stores.

, Use a nightlight or a low-wattage bulb in the bathroom, and avoid turning on an overhead light as it will wake you up even more.

Allow the gynecologist to do a breast exam.,
Know what to expect during the pelvic exam.,
Understand what will happen during the external and speculum exam.,
Prepare for a vaginal swab or pap smear.,
Be ready for a little bleeding.,
Get dressed and ask any further questions.",How to Prepare to See a Gynecologist for the First Time," It is normal to feel nervous when you are scheduled for your first visit to the gynecologist, but it's also important to be prepared so that you are able to get as much information from the doctor as possible .


The first visit will include a lot of talking and you will be asked many questions about your health as the gynecologist gets to know you. The doctor will also ask about your family's medical history and whether you are sexually active or not.
You may feel a little uncomfortable answering these questions but it is important that you are honest because this will allow the gynecologist to help you.;
, Try to schedule the appointment for before or after your period, if possible. Being on your period may interfere with any tests that the gynecologist has to do, and the bleeding may make it difficult for her to see anything when conducting the physical exam, so the appointment may need to be rescheduled.

, You should also avoid using any vaginal creams or products before the exam because these can mask any vaginal conditions and lead to false test results.

, Make a list of all the questions that you're curious about or that have been worrying you. It's a good idea to write them down because you might forget them if you're nervous during the appointment.


Your questions can include any issues to do with menstruation, offensive vaginal discharge, bleeding after intercourse, spotting in between periods, a lighter flow than normal, a heavy flow than normal, pelvic pain or any other unusual pain.
Don't be embarrassed about any questions you want to ask - the gynecologist has heard it all before.

, Before your exam, the doctor or nurse will ask the you some basic questions that are usually recorded in a file. The answers to these questions are used to provide a baseline of information that can be helpful for future visits. You may be asked questions like:


When was your last period?
How long do you bleed for?
Are your periods regular?
Do you feel pain during your periods? If so, how would you describe the pain?
Do you experience any pain after sexual intercourse?
Do you suffer from any discharge, itching or genital pain?
Do you have any other medical issues?
Is there a history of any medical conditions in your family?
Do you have a specific method of birth control that you are using?
When was your last pregnancy?
Do you think that you are pregnant?
Are you trying to have a baby?
What method do you use to prevent sexually transmitted diseases?
Do you have more than one sexual partner?

, Other questions that may be asked will have to do with your medical history.


This includes whether you have been admitted to hospital before, have has any surgery in the past, any miscarriages, how many children you have, whether you smoke and whether you a have a problem holding your urine.
The doctor may also want to review the contraceptive that you are currently using and will ask you if you're happy with it and whether it's causing any side effects.

, It is recommended that you wear clothes that can be easily removed to make it easier for the doctor to do the examination.


Usually, you will be provided with a hospital gown and a drape sheet to cover yourself while the exam is being carried out. The gynecologist will ask you to lie down on the bed so that the examination can be preformed.
If it makes you feel more comfortable, you can ask to have a family member or friend in the exam room with you.

, First the gynecologist will do a breast examination - this helps to identify any irregularities like lumps. The doctor will use their hands to palpate the breast one at a time. This is a good opportunity for you to learn how to do a self-breast examination.

, When it's time for the pelvic exam, you will be asked to rest your heels in the metal stirrups or place your knees on a knee rest. You will then be asked to move your hips to the edge of the couch, as this provides a good angle for the gynecologist to do the pelvic exam.


You will be encouraged to spread your knees wide apart and to breathe deeply in and out to try to relax. This may be difficult for the first visit but it becomes easier with subsequent ones.
Try to relax your vaginal and abdominal muscles, as this will make the exam more comfortable. Don't worry about feeling too exposed as you will usually be provided with a drape sheet to keep you covered throughout the examination.
Don't hesitate to ask the doctor if you have any questions about what they're doing.

, The doctor will also perform an external examination of the genitalia, where they will assess the external parts of the vagina such as the vulva, opening of vagina and the folds. The doctor will check for any signs of irritation, redness, discharge genital warts and cysts.


The doctor will then perform a speculum examination where a sterile plastic or metal speculum is inserted into the internal part of the vagina. The speculum is then opened by the doctor and this helps to separate the walls of the vagina to allow the doctor to see the cervix.
You may feel some discomfort when the speculum is inserted, however most doctors will warm the speculum and lubricate it to make it more comfortable for you.
The gynecologist will then inspect the cervix to look for any abnormalities like irritation, abnormal discharge, or any growths.

, The doctor may take a vaginal swab to test for different sexually transmitted diseases. This includes gonorrhea, chlamydia and human papilloma virus.

The doctor may also do a pap smear by using a tiny brush or spatula to collect some cells from the cervix. The cells are then taken to the laboratory where they are tested for cancerous or precancerous cells.
When the doctor removes the speculum, the walls of the vagina are checked for irritation and redness.

, It is possible (though not certain) that you will experience a little bleeding or spotting after the examination is dome.


This is because the different instruments that are inserted into the vagina during the examination may cause bruising or bleeding.
Therefore, it is advisable to bring a pad or a panty liner to the exam to prevent staining your clothes.

, When the doctor has finished doing the physical exam, you will be allowed to change back onto your own clothes. At this point, feel free to ask any additional questions you might have.


After the exam, you may need to set up an appointment to discuss the results of any tests. Most laboratory tests take between 3 to 14 days before there are any results.
The one exception is a pregnancy test, the result of which are usually available by the end of the visit.
You doctor will be happy to walk you through your test results and answer any questions.

Try a sleep-inducing drink.,
Avoid caffeine or cigarettes after noon.,

The sleep dome – Imagine a dome-shaped barrier sitting over you, protecting you from the world and any tasks you need to accomplish. Focus on the texture, color, and shape of the barrier. Know that no worries can penetrate it. As other thoughts enter your mind, imagine them bouncing off the dome, unable to reach you.
The river of sleep – Imagine yourself floating like a leaf on a gentle stream. Let yourself be carried along, buoyed up by the warm water. Hear its gentle murmur. Feel its caressing you. Relax into it and let it carry you to sleep.

Avoid certain foods and drinks.,
Cut down on light.,
Create a proper sleep environment.,
Maintain a sleep routine.,
Avoid frustration.",How to Sleep Better Naturally1," One way to help you be more tired at the end of the day is exercise. It helps burn off energy and tire you out, with the added bonus of helping your burn calories. It also helps energize you right after you work out, which gives you an extra push during the day. Plus, the tiredness from the exertion comes on later in the day to help you sleep better at night.


Never work out two or three hours before bed. This kind of activity that late is too stimulating for your body and will keep you up.;
, To improve your sleeping situation, you need to improve your sleep hygiene, which is a series of steps that help you get regular and restful sleep. Make sure you limit activities in your bed that don't relate to it. This means you should only use your bed for sleep and sexual activity.


Avoid watching TV or reading in bed, because your body will start associating wakeful activities with your bed, which can interrupt your sleep patterns., One reason your body may not be falling asleep is because it is working overtime to digest food. Because of this, don't eat anything heavy at least two hours before you go to bed. Your body will still be digesting it, which can make you have more energy and cause sleeplessness.


Also avoid caffeine, especially late at night. For some people, caffeine should be stopped after noon. For others, a little later in the afternoon is fine, but make sure you avoid it at night.If you are hungry and need to eat close to bedtime, try foods that have tryptophan, an amino acid that helps produce sleep inducing brain chemicals. These include milk, yogurt, oats, bananas, eggs, peanuts, tuna, and poultry. A small bowl of cereal, for example, is a great snack to eat close to bedtime that may help induce sleep instead of keep you up., To help you sleep, you should avoid letting too much light into your room. Exposure to light decreases the production of melatonin, a hormone that encourages sleep that is stimulated in the dark. If you have too much light, your melatonin levels will stay low, which may cause sleeplessness.


This light can also be from electronic devices. Avoid too much exposure to light in the hour or two leading up to bedtime. , Sleeping requires a comfortable bed and bedroom. This can vary from person to person, but common things that contribute to comfortable bedrooms are cozy sheets and comforters, proper pillows, and comfortable pajamas. Since you are enveloped in these things when you sleep, any irritation from them can disrupt your sleep cycle.


Temperature control is also important when sleeping. If you are too hot or too cold, you may have a hard time sleeping. Find the right temperature for you.
Noise also causes uncomfortable sleeping arrangements. If you live in a noisy area or have noisy roommates, use earplugs or soft, calming music to block out annoying and loud sounds., Every day, follow a routine for going to bed and waking up. This will help your body get used to the activities and make your sleeping patterns more regular. The routine can be anything that works well for you. Activities such as reading, washing your face and teeth, changing into your pajamas, preparing tomorrow’s lunch, sitting outside for awhile, or practicing relaxation techniques are common in nighttime routines. Try a few combinations to see what works best for you.


Whatever routine you choose, make sure it isn't too stimulating and that you associate it in your mind with sleeping and rest., When you can't go to sleep, you may get annoyed and frustrated. Try not to, because this will only make it harder for your to go to sleep. If you don’t fall asleep right when you get into bed, don’t fight it. Just get our of bed and do some part of your routine or something else relaxing that might help you move towards sleep.


In these moments, avoid eating a midnight snack, doing anything too stimulating like video games or exercise, or working yourself up because you can't sleep. The point is to relax in order to move closer to sleep, not move your farther from it.A glass of warm milk may help calm you down, both from the warmth and the tryptophan."

It can be used to diagnose gynecological conditions (such as pelvic pain and unusual bleeding) or visualize the early phases of pregnancy.During the procedure, your doctor inserts a transducer, which is about the size of a speculum, into your vagina. From there, the transducer emits sound waves that allow your doctor to visualize your internal organs.Intravaginal ultrasounds are painless but you might feel pressure and discomfort during the procedure.;
, Intravaginal ultrasounds are performed whenever your doctor needs to take a closer look at your reproductive organs, such as the cervix, ovaries, and uterus. Your doctor may also perform an intravaginal ultrasound to monitor your pregnancy and fetus.Your doctor may order the procedure if you experience unexplained pain, bleeding or bloating.
For example, intravaginal ultrasounds can reveal changes in the shape and density of your reproductive tissues and can also be used to visualize blood flow to your pelvic organs.It can be used to monitor fibroids, ovarian cysts, and cancerous growths in your pelvic organs or diagnose the cause of vaginal bleeding and cramping.
Intravaginal ultrasound can also help diagnose infertility issues or abnormalities in the bladder, kidneys and pelvic cavity.
During pregnancy, your doctor can use it to detect the early stages of pregnancy, monitor the development of your fetus, detect multiples, and rule out an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy., The timing of this procedure depends on the reason why you need to have it done.


During pregnancy, an intravaginal ultrasound can occur as early as 6 weeks after conception but typically is done between 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy.If your doctor is trying to diagnose a reason for unusual pain or bleeding, your procedure will likely be scheduled immediately.
If you need an intravaginal ultrasound for infertility issues, then your doctor may choose to perform it around the time you ovulate.
An intravaginal ultrasound can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle, but it is usually best to have it done right after your period ends, between days 5 and 12 of your cycle. During these days, your endometrial lining is the thinnest, which allows for clearer images of your uterus., You will want to take a shower/bath prior to leaving your home to have your intravaginal ultrasound.


If you are on your menstrual cycle and you are wearing a tampon, you must remove it before the procedure. Make sure you bring an extra tampon (or feminine napkin) with you to use after the procedure., You will need to wear a hospital gown for the procedure so it is a good idea to wear comfortable, easy-to-remove clothes.You should also wear shoes that are not difficult to take off as you will need to remove clothing from waist down.
Sometimes you can keep your clothing from waist up so you may want to wear separates instead of a dress.

, Typically you should have an empty bladder for the procedure. Use the restroom just before the procedure and do not drink anything for 30 minutes prior to your intravaginal ultrasound.Sometimes your doctor may perform a transabdominal ultrasound first. For this, a partially full bladder is preferred as it lifts the intestines and allows your doctor to see the pelvic organs more clearly.If your doctor asks you to have a partially filled bladder, you will need to drink water prior to the ultrasound and not use the restroom.
You should begin drinking water a half an hour before your ultrasound.
You might be asked to empty your bladder before the intravaginal ultrasound.

, Once you get to the hospital or clinic, you must sign a consent form stating that you agree to have the intravaginal ultrasound performed.


Also let your doctor know if you have a latex allergy. The transducer is covered with a latex or plastic sheath before it is inserted into the vagina., Once you are taken into a dressing room or the ultrasound room, remove your clothes and change into a hospital gown.Sometimes you need to undress from the waist down only. In this case, you will typically receive a sheet to use as a cover during the procedure., After you have undressed, go and lie down on the examination table. Intravaginal ultrasounds are performed while you are lying on your back similar to when you receive a normal gynecological exam.You need to bend your knees and rest the soles of your feet flat on the stirrups connected to the examining room bed in order to give your doctor the best access to your vagina., Before inserting the transducer, your doctor will place a plastic or latex sheet over it and lubricate it with a gel to allow for easier insertion.Your doctor will then gently insert the transducer into your vagina in order to begin constructing the image.
The transducer is slightly bigger than a tampon and is designed to fit into your vagina comfortably., Your doctor holds the transducer inside of your vagina and may rotate it slightly in order to create a clear image of your pelvic organs.The transducer is connected to a computer. Once inserted, images of your pelvic organs will begin to appear on the computer screen. Your doctor will check the screen throughout the scan to make sure that everything is showing up in detail. Your doctor may also take pictures and/or live video.
If the ultrasound is performed to monitor your fetus, your doctor typically prints the pictures and gives them to you.

, Intravaginal ultrasound typically last no longer than 15 minutes. After the procedure is over and your doctor removes the transducer, then you are given privacy to dress.You will be given towels to remove any gel that remains on your inner thighs and/or pelvic area.
You may also want to visit the restroom in order to wipe excess lubricant from your vagina and insert a new tampon.

, If your primary doctor performs the ultrasound, she may describe preliminary results as they appear on the screen. If you are referred to a different clinic, then you usually must wait for your primary doctor to receive a written report of your results.You receive the results of your scan based on the complexity and urgency of your condition. If your ultrasound is strictly exploratory, then you will likely wait a few days to a week for your results.

, Stop douching at least two to three days before your exam.

This will reduce your exposure to allergens, which should reduce your symptoms, and thus help you sleep better.The morning is typically the worst time of day for allergens.
You should also avoid going outside when it is very windy or when pollen counts are particularly high.
There are numerous websites (including most weather forecast sites) that offer daily forecasts for common allergens (like pollen and mold) so you can check conditions before leaving the house.;
, To kill off any allergens that might be lurking in your fabrics, wash them at least weekly. Washing in hot water and using the dryer on high heat helps ensure that no allergens will stick around.Pay extra attention to any fabrics that you come into contact with at night, like bedding, towels, and pajamas.

, To prevent allergens from entering your home, keep the windows closed and cool your home with an air conditioning unit equipped with a HEPA filter. The filter will catch pollen and other allergens so they won't end up in your air.If you have central air conditioning, buy filters designed to trap allergens, and be sure to change the filter as often as the manufacturer recommends. If you have a window unit, clean the filter weekly.
If you can't afford an air conditioning unit or you really want to open a window, try placing a HEPA filter in front of the open window to help filter out allergens.

, For added air filtration in your sleeping space, consider using a room-sized air purification unit. These help remove all sorts of allergens from the air, including pollen, dust, and pet dander.Most air purifiers are only meant to work in small spaces, so keep your bedroom door shut for the best results.

, In order to prevent allergens from accumulating in your bedroom and keeping you up at night, it's important to keep your home nice and clean. Be sure to dust and vacuum regularly.Vacuum your mattress as well, as allergens are known to collect there.

, Allergens like pollen can get embedded in fabrics and other soft surfaces. While you may not be able to eliminate all of these surfaces from your home, it's best to keep them to a minimum in your bedroom so that your air can stay as clean as possible while you sleep.Remove any stuffed animals from your room.
Carpet may also harbor allergens, so consider replacing yours with hard flooring.

, You may have collected a lot of allergens on your body during the day, and the last thing you want is to transfer them into your bed. Do your best to remove any traces of pollen and other allergens from yourself before you go into your bedroom.Shower before bed every night during allergy season.
Ideally, you should remove the clothes that you wore outside before going into your bedroom. If possible, keep them in the bathroom or laundry room until you are able to wash them.

, Even if you aren't allergic to animals, your pets may be worsening your allergy symptoms at night. This is because they can drag all sorts of other allergens, including pollen, into your room. To avoid this, do your best to make your bedroom an animal-free zone.If you can't keep your pets out of your bedroom, at least keep them out of your bed.
If your pets must sleep in your bed, make sure to bathe them regularly to get rid of any allergens they might have picked up., Exposure to dust mites can make your symptoms from seasonal allergies worse. To prevent dust mites from inhabiting your mattress and pillows, use allergy-proof covers on them.Covers should zip tight so that mites have no way of accessing the mattress or pillow., Allergens can get trapped in the mucus membrane of your nasal passages, which can cause continuous symptoms. Get rid of them by rinsing out your nasal passages with a saline solution.You can use store-bought saline nasal sprays, which are preferable because they are sterile and have the correct ratio of salt to water — too much salt can burn your nostrils.
You can also make your own solution by adding 1/2 teaspoons of pickling or kosher salt to two cups of warm water (cold water will shock your system and may make you dizzy). Make certain the water has been boiled for at least one minute, then allowed to cool to a tolerable temperature, or that you buy water that specifically states it has been distilled or is sterile. Otherwise you put yourself at risk for introducing (sometimes deadly) contaminates into your body.Use a small bulb syringe to insert the solution into each nostril (no deeper than the width of your finger). Do this while standing over a sink, as the solution will drip from your nostrils.
You can also try using a Neti pot to cleanse your sinuses.

, Eucalyptus is excellent for clearing the sinuses. Try adding a few drops of eucalyptus oil to your loofah or washcloth when you shower at night.Avoid getting it in your eyes, as it will sting.
Making your shower nice and steamy should help clear your sinuses as well.

, Drinking a warm mug of herbal tea before bed is also an excellent way to clear out your sinuses. Make sure it's caffeine-free to avoid disrupting your sleep.If you don't like herbal tea, hot water with lemon will work too.

, It may sound strange that lifestyle changes can affect your allergy symptoms, but it's true. Taking good care of yourself and protecting your immune system can help decrease the severity of your allergy symptoms.Reduce stress as much as possible. High levels of stress wreak havoc on the immune system, which can make your allergy symptoms worse.
Eat foods that fight inflammation and boost the immune system. Nuts, apples, garlic, fish, yogurt, and fermented foods like sauerkraut are all excellent choices.

, Some antihistamines, especially those that also contain decongestants, can disrupt your sleep. If you want to use an OTC allergy medication, be sure to choose one that will not prevent you from falling asleep.Loratadine and fexofenadine will not disrupt your sleep.

, Allergy medications are more effective at preventing allergy symptoms than they are at treating symptoms. If you know you are going to be around your allergen, take your medication early. You will have a more pleasant day and a much better night than you will if you wait until you are suffering to take your medicine.If you have symptoms every day during allergy season, take your antihistamine every day.

, While some allergy medicines are meant to be taken every day, most over-the-counter nasal sprays are meant to be used for short periods of time only. Overusing them can lead to nasal inflammation, which can make you feel more congested.Saline nasal sprays are safe to use frequently and are safe for children.
Decongestant nasal sprays (oxymetazoline, xylometazoline, phenylephrine, and naphazoline nasal sprays) should not be used for longer than three days unless advised by your doctor. Overuse of these sprays can cause ""rebound congestion,"" in which your congestion returns worse than before.
Previously prescription-only corticosteroid nasal sprays (fluticasone) are available over-the-counter and are meant for long-term use. Start using a corticosteroid spray at the beginning of allergy season — even before you have symptoms — and use daily.
If you don't see improvement, consult your doctor and make sure you let her know which sprays you have been using.

, An allergist is a doctor who specializes in treating patients with allergies. If your allergies are not well-managed with over-the-counter treatments, make an appointment with one to get a customized treatment plan.An allergist can identify exactly what you are allergic to, which can be helpful in choosing the correct treatment.
Your allergist may prescribe a prescription allergy medication.

, For some allergy sufferers, allergy shots provide much better relief than other treatments. If nothing else has worked for your allergies, ask your doctor if this may be a good treatment option for you.Allergy shots typically provide relief for the entire allergy season.

, Immunotherapy is another treatment option for people who suffer from severe allergies. The treatment involves gradually introducing small amounts of your allergen into your body, so that you become more tolerant of it.This kind of treatment may take years to be fully effective, but for many it is well worth the commitment.
Immunotherapy is not available for all allergens, but it is available for grass and ragweed, which are two of the most common seasonal allergens.

Buy the right supplements.,
Make an herbal sleep sachet.,
Use herbal essential oils.,
Take melatonin.,
Try 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP).",How to Sleep Better Naturally3," No matter which herbs you pick, you can make them into a tea. Start by boiling water on the stove. While it heats up, add one teaspoon of loose dried herbs or one tablespoon of fresh herbs to a mug of boiled water. Let the herbs steep in the hot water for five to 10 minutes.

Try deep breathing.,
Do Chinese breathing exercises.,
Use progressive muscle relaxation.,
Perform positive visualization.",How to Sleep Better Naturally4," One thing that can help you get better sleep is to be more relaxed when you go to bed. If you can't achieve this on your own, there is a deep breathing technique you can try to help you sleep. Start flat on your back with pillows under your neck and knees in a comfortable arrangement. Place your hands, palms down, right below your rib cage on your stomach area with your fingers touching. Take a large, slow, and deep breath in through your belly using your diaphragm, which pulls more air into your lungs. Your fingers will separate if you are doing it correctly. Do 10 to 12 repetitions.


If you aren't breathing through your diaphragm, keep trying until you do. Many people breath into their chest normally, which causes your shoulders to move up instead.
You may experience some dizziness at first, but this is common. The increase in oxygen can make you lightheaded. If you feel like you are going to pass out or are uncomfortable, stop and rest a moment before you repeat the exercise again.
If you want to make your diaphragm stronger, try a humming breath. This variation follows deep breathing, but adds a humming noise with your mouth as you exhale. , If deep breathing doesn't relax you, try Chinese breathing exercises. Start in a comfortable seated position. Then take one short breath in through your nose, exhaling as you lift your arms in front of you at shoulder level. Take another short breath through your nose, moving your arms to the side while remaining at shoulder level. On your third short breath through your nose, lift your arms over your head. Repeat the cycle 10 to 12 times.


If you feel lightheaded or dizzy, stop this exercise immediately. Return your breathing to normal and let the feelings subside before trying again., Aside from breathing exercises, there are muscle relaxation techniques that can help you get a good night's sleep. Focus on your feet and toes, tensing the muscles in your feet for five seconds, then relax them for 30 seconds. Move up to your ankles and legs, following the same five-30 pattern of tensing and relaxing. Follow this trend up your whole body, including your face, until every muscle in your body is relaxed.


Consciously relaxing your muscles like this helps your body calm down enough for sleep. The addition of the tensing step helps you distinguish between a tense and relaxed muscle in order to increase your comfort., Mental relaxation can be just as important to a good night's sleep as physical relaxation. Positive visualization helps drive away negative thoughts in order to help you relax. For this exercise, think about your favorite place, which doesn't have to be a real place. You can also relive a good or happy memory. Try to recall the smells, sounds, and feelings of the place, or make them up if your place is imagined.


For example, if your visualization take place at a snowy cabin, you may want to recreate the sounds of a serene, snowy natural expanse, smell the fire burning in the fireplace, or stand outside and hold a handful of snow.
After some practice, you will be able to get yourself there without so much work, but the early visualization of these small details can be helpful."

androgenic alopecia (male-pattern baldness or hair thinning/loss)weight gain, especially localized around the abdominal areaOvulatory dysfunction. The most common sign of ovulatory dysfunction is irregular menstrual cycles.Frequent bleeding (more often than every 21 days) may be a sign of ovulatory dysfunction.
Infrequent bleeding (less often than every 35 days) may also be a sign of ovulatory dysfunction.



Polycystic ovaries. The ovaries must be examined by ultrasound. Your doctor will check your ovaries for:

Bilateral enlargement (>10 cc)
Quantity and size of follicles (generally 12 or more, measuring 2-9 mm)
Multiple follicles of similar size
Peripheral location of follicles, which can give a string of pearl appearance

, There is no one single test that can confirm a diagnosis of PCOS. Your doctor will need to perform several examinations and tests. Your primary care physician or your gynecologist can usually do basic examinations and tests. He or she may also refer you to a specialist for further testing.If you have PCOS and are having difficulty conceiving and wish to conceive, you may be referred to see a reproductive endocrinologist. These doctors specialize in treating PCOS with the goal of increasing fertility.
If you have PCOS but do not want to conceive or are not having difficulty conceiving, you may be referred to see a medical endocrinologist.

, Because PCOS can cause so many symptoms, it is important to tell your physician about all the symptoms you are experiencing. Even if you do not think the symptoms are related, give your doctor a full account of any symptoms you have.Make sure you also give your doctor a full medical history. Make sure you note if any family members or relatives have a history of diabetes, insulin resistance, or symptoms of androgen excess., Your doctor will perform several examinations and tests to help determine whether you have PCOS. You can expect the following procedures to be done, either by your general physician or gynecologist, or by an endocrinologist.Medical history. Your doctor will ask about your menstruation, weight, and other symptoms. S/he will probably also ask whether you have relatives who have been diagnosed with diabetes, insulin resistance, or PCOS.
Physical exam. You will probably have your blood pressure, BMI, and hair growth examined. Other symptoms of PCOS, such as acne and thinning hair, can also be checked during this exam.
Pelvic exam. Your doctor may want to check for swelling or growths. Usually, these exams are manual (the doctor uses his or her hands to examine the pelvic area) and by ultrasound.Blood tests. Usually, your doctor will check the levels of androgens and glucose (sugar) in your blood. S/he may also ask to collect urine for analysis.

, Once you have been given a diagnosis of PCOS, there are several questions you may want to ask your doctor.Consider asking the following questions:


What medications are available that may improve my symptoms?
Are there medications or treatments that can improve my ability to conceive?
What do I need to do to manage this condition with my other medical conditions?
What side effects can I expect from my treatment?
What long-term health implications are likely due to PCOS?

Check if you are having a transabdominal (full bladder) exam or an endovaginal/intravaginal (empty bladder) exam.,Realize that everyone's kidneys produce urine at a different rate, so the instructions given to you by the clinic are aimed at the patient with the slowest bladder filling time.,
Drink four (4) 8-ounce glasses of water one hour before the exam which is the usual requirement for the test.,
Start earlier if you think you will be unable to drink the full amount.,
Drink your water a bit closer to the exam time if you drink coffee or other caffeinated products, or take a diuretic (water pill).,
Make sure to have breakfast on the day of the exam.,
Hydrate yourself well by drinking water or other clear fluids the day before the exam.,
Be aware that you may feel uncomfortable, but not painfully full when your bladder is the correct fullness.,
Know that when the bladder is too full for the exam, it is actually in spasm so beginning to pee is difficult.",How to Prepare for a Pelvic Ultrasound," If it's the latter, read Prepare for an Intravaginal Ultrasound. Otherwise, continue here.
,, This means empty your bladder about 2 hrs before the exam time, then drink 32 oz of water over the next hour. Do not empty your bladder until the ultrasound technologist tells you., If you are unable to keep the water down (vomiting), it is likely your bladder will not be full enough because you are already dehydrated. Explain this to the technologist or your doctor. They have the option of doing an endovaginal/intravaginal ultrasound instead., Your bladder will fill more quickly on the day of the exam., Otherwise you will be dehydrated and will need more than the 4 glasses to fill your bladder. Likewise, things like partying with alcohol, a long airline flight, or too much coffee the day before the examination will also dehydrate you., On the day, you should be able to get by with only 3 glasses of water., If you are painfully full, be assured that you can empty your bladder quite a bit, and you will still fill back up within 30 minutes or so if you have taken all the required fluids., Let out enough to be more comfortable (more than 2 cups), then stop the flow with the pelvic muscles, or by starting to stand up, holding toilet paper to catch any remainder. Remember, if you let out too much, you will fill back up again."

Consider hormonal birth control.,
Ask your doctor about Metformin.,
Consult with your doctor about fertility medications.,
Consult with your doctor about gonadotropins.,
Consider In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).,
Ask your doctor about surgical laparoscopy.,
Maintain regular communication with your doctor.",How to Ovulate With PCOS2," If you do not want to conceive, consider talking with your doctor about hormonal birth control. “Combination” birth control pills that contain estrogen and progestin can help you regulate your menstrual cycles, reduce male hormone levels, and help clear up acne.They will also reduce your risk of developing your endometrial cancer. Skin patches and vaginal rings that contain these hormones may also be an option. Your doctor will help you find the option that is right for you.


Medications that contain only progesterone offer some of the benefits of combination birth control. They will help control your menstruation and reduce your risk of endometrial cancer. However, they will not help with symptoms related to androgen excess, such as acne and hair growth., Metformin (Glucophage, Fortamet, etc.) is an oral medication for type 2 diabetes.Your doctor may prescribe metformin to treat your insulin resistance and lower your body’s insulin levels. Research has also suggested that metformin may help with cholesterol levels and weight management.People with a history of liver or heart disease may not be able to take metformin safely. It is vital to tell your doctor about your history of any liver or heart conditions., Your doctor may prescribe a medication to help stimulate ovulation. Talk with your doctor about any pre-existing medical conditions or symptoms so that s/he can find the medication that is best for you.Your doctor may prescribe clomiphene (Clomid, Serophene) or letrozole (Femara). These are oral medications that you take at the first part of your menstrual cycle to stimulate ovulation.You will likely ovulate within 5-10 days after taking clomiphene or letrozole.You should tell your doctor if you have endometriosis, uterine fibroids, a history of liver disease, or thyroid issues.
Side effects of clomiphene or letrozole may include hot flashes, headaches, and breast pain/tenderness.You should also be aware that in from 7-10 out of 100 pregnancies that result from clomiphene or letrozole therapy, multiple implantations occur. Twins are the most common.If clomiphene does not work on its own, your doctor may prescribe a combination of metformin and clomiphene., If clomiphene treatment does not work, your doctor may prescribe gonadotropins.Gonadotropins are hormones that stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple follicles (cysts that contain eggs).Injections are usually started on the second or third day of your period and continued for 7 -12 days.These treatments can be expensive, so talk with your reproductive endocrinologist to make sure that they are right for you.


Gonadotropin injections have a relatively high success rate. Of the women who ovulate after gonadotropin therapy and don't have other factors compromising their fertility, up to 50% become pregnant within 4 to 6 ovulatory cycles.Up to 30% of pregnancies from gonadotropin therapy are associated with multiple implantations. Most multiples are twins, although in 5% of cases it may be triplets or higher.Talk with your doctor about side effects. Most side effects from these injections are mild, but in some cases they may be more serious. A mild form of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) may occur in 10-30% of gonadotropin patients, and a severe form in about 1% of cases. In the severe cases, OHSS can cause nausea, vomiting, weight gain, blood clotting, and other serious symptoms., In IVF, a fertilized egg is surgically placed into the uterus.It is quite effective. However, IVF can often be expensive and is usually considered as an option when less expensive treatments have not worked.Talk with your doctor about whether you are a good candidate for IVF.

People with PCOS respond strongly to fertility medications, so they are often at higher risk for multiple births. IVF allows for the highest degree of controlling the possibility of multiple births.
IVF may cause Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), which can be serious and under extremely rare circumstances can even be fatal.

, Laparoscopic Ovarian Drilling, or Ovarian Diathermy, is a type of surgical treatment that can help stimulate ovulation in women with PCOS. It is not common and is generally considered a last resort for women for whom other fertility treatments have failed.Ovarian drilling is done under general anesthesia. A surgeon clinically destroys part of the ovary using a laser or other device. This reduces the amount of testosterone produced by the ovaries, which can increase your possibility of ovulating.A few studies suggest that about 50% of women are able to become pregnant within a year after having this procedure, at least under the best possible circumstances.Ovarian drilling has serious risks, including infection, internal bleeding, injury to internal organs, and scarring. Always talk with your doctor about the risks and side effects before considering this procedure., When taking any medication or treatment, it is important to work closely with your doctor. This is especially important when you are taking reproductive treatments or therapies.Contact your doctor immediately if you experience any side effects from your medication.


If you are seeing multiple doctors for your PCOS, such as a primary care physician, gynecologist, and endocrinologist, make sure to keep everyone informed about your health. If you experience any symptoms or side effects from treatment, make sure that your health care providers are aware.

Understand the role of insulin.,
Eat a low glycemic index diet.,
Exercise.,
Stop smoking.,
Treat unwanted hair.",How to Ovulate With PCOS3," Insulin is a hormone manufactured by the pancreas. It plays a significant role in regulating metabolism. Your digestive system will break down carbohydrates, such as sugars and starches, into glucose (sugar). Insulin allows your body to absorb and use glucose as energy.Women with PCOS often have a condition called insulin resistance.Insulin resistance causes glucose levels to build up in the bloodstream instead of being absorbed by the body. This can cause prediabetes or type 2 diabetes., Obesity amongst women with PCOS may be as high as 80%.Because women with PCOS have difficulty processing insulin, it is important to eat a diet that does not cause large variations in blood sugar.


Limit processed foods and foods with lots of added sugar. These foods offer little in the way of nutrients and can impact your blood sugar levels.Watch your calories. You may wish to consult with a dietician or nutritionist to determine your optimal calorie level. If you have obesity related to PCOS, reducing your calorie intake may help you lose weight.Eat complex carbohydrates. It is not recommended that you severely restrict carbohydrates. Instead, choose complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, barley, brown rice, and beans. These carbs are high in fiber and are digested slowly, so they don’t cause huge spikes in your insulin levels.Eat plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits. Fruits and vegetables have fiber and plenty of essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals., Exercise can help improve weight loss and reduce your risk for diabetes and cardiovascular complications.Exercise can also help regulate your blood sugar levels.Aim for at least 30 minutes per day of moderate physical activity, such as aerobic exercise.
Studies have shown that physical activity makes your muscles more sensitive to insulin. This can help lower your blood glucose levels. Exercise can also help your muscles absorb glucose without needing insulin.Even small weight loss levels, between 5%-7%, can be enough to reduce androgen levels and help restore fertility., Studies show that women who smoke have higher androgen levels than non-smokers.Smoking can also aggravate insulin resistance., Many PCOS sufferers will experience excessive or unwanted hair growth. The medications your doctor prescribes may help reduce this symptom. Waxing, shaving, and tweezing may be enough to reduce unwanted hair for many women. However, you can also remove unwanted hair by using the following treatments:Laser hair removal. Laser hair removal is a very common procedure that can permanently eliminate unwanted hair after 3-7 treatments.Laser hair removal must be performed by a professional. It can be expensive, and is usually not covered by insurance.Electrolysis. Electrolysis permanently removes unwanted hair with heat or chemicals. These treatments must be done by a professional. Electrolysis may be more successful at permanently removing hair than laser removal."

Avoid taking aspirin or any other blood thinning medication.,
Stop smoking and drinking at least two weeks before the surgery.,
Reduce your salt intake two weeks before and after surgery.,
Drink a lot of water in the weeks before the surgery.,
Fill any necessary prescriptions before the surgery date.,
Take some time off work.,
Fast for 8 hours prior to the procedure.,
Shave your genital area before the operation.,
Arrange for transport to take you home after the procedure.,
Discuss what type of anesthesia will be used with your surgeon.,
Be aware that you will need to abstain from sexual intercourse following the surgery.",How to Prepare for a Vaginoplasty," It is recommended that you make an appointment with your gynecologist before the procedure so that the procedure can be explained in detail. The doctor will explain how the surgery is performed along with the risks that are involved.


Any vaginal surgery best performed when the woman is not on her period, therefore proper planning is essential. This helps to reduce the risk of developing an infection.
As this procedure is performed in order to tighten the muscles of the vagina, it is usually only recommended for women who don't intend to have any more children, as giving birth puts a strain on the muscles.;
, Before your surgery, you will need to provide both blood and urine samples. The blood same will be tested to check the amount of hemoglobin in the blood and ensure that the patient is in good health.


It will also help to determine whether it is safe for the women to go through with surgery, as the woman may lose a lot of blood during the procedure.
The urine sample is used to ensure that the woman is definitely not pregnant before going ahead with the surgery.

, This is very important, especially for the patients who are on blood thinning drugs, because these medications increase the risk of bleeding after surgery. The woman should stop taking these drugs approximately two weeks before the surgery to ensure that there is no risk of increased bleeding.

, It's important to cut out smoking because the nicotine in cigarettes reduces the size of the blood vessels (this is known as vasoconstriction) which can prolong the healing process.


Alcohol also needs to be cut out before the surgery because it increases the amount of toxins in the body, which can also interfere with the healing process.

, This is important, as salt increases fluid retention in the body's tissues, which may lead to increased swelling after the surgery. Therefore, cutting down on salt helps to prevent excess swelling and speed up the healing process.

, The woman is advised to drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day in the weeks running up to the surgery. This helps to flush toxins from the body which could slow down the healing process.

, It's a good idea to fill any necessary prescriptions before the surgery, so that any necessary medications will be easily at hand after the procedure. This is especially important when it comes to the antibiotic and pain medications that will be necessary after the surgery, as these will ensure that the woman remains free of infection and pain.

, It's recommended that the patient take a couple of days off work to go through with the procedure allow for recovery time.


The amount of time needed will depend on the type of work that the woman is involved in, as jobs that are very active or require heavy lifting can interfere with healing and will require more time off.
Most people will take approximately five days off before they resume work.

, This helps to clear the digestive tract, especially the small intestine and the colon. There are different methods that can be used to clear the gut and this will depend on the surgeon advice and the patient’s preference.


Some surgeons will prescribe laxative medications, while others will simply advise the patient to drink a lot of fluids. This helps to ensure that the bowel is clear when the operation is being performed.
It also allows the vagina time to heal after the operation because the patient won't need to pass stool again for some time. This helps to prevent infection at the incision side.
The patient will also be advised to drink plenty of fluids after the operation as this helps to enhance the healing process.

, This helps to reduce the risk of infection. It also provides a good working field for the surgeon as they are able to see the operation site more clearly.

, This may be a close friend or a relative that the patient can call when they are ready to be taken home. Keep in mind that this will usually be 24 hours after the procedure, as the woman will need to stay in the hospital for close observation immediately following the procedure to ensure that she is stable enough for discharge.

, A vaginoplasty can be performed under general anesthesia, where the patient is made to sleep throughout the procedure.


It can also be performed under sedation, where the patient is given a short-acting sedative drug which enables them to sleep while the procedure is being done but wake up just a few minutes afterwards.
The patient is encouraged to be honest with the surgeon and ask any questions. The patient is also encouraged to raise any fears or concerns that they may have concerning the surgery so that they can be explained in detail and their fears can be allayed.

, It is important for the patient (and her partner) to be aware that she will need to abstain from sexual intercourse after surgery in order to give the vagina time to heal and prevent infection


The woman should go for regular check-ups with her surgeon/doctor following the procedure to check on the healing. The doctor will then be able to advise on when it is safe for her to have sex again. This usually takes approximately a month but this can vary from one patient to another depending on how the procedure has been performed.
However, the patient does not need to abstain from sex before the procedure, in fact she can still engage in sex up to a day before the surgery.

The symptoms of PCOS are often similar to other medical conditions, such as thyroid disease and Cushing’s syndrome. You should consult with your physician to ensure the correct diagnosis is made.Common symptoms of PCOS include:irregular menstrual cycles
acne
irregular hair growth in typically “male” locations such as the chest, back, and face
hair thinning or male-pattern baldness
obesity or weight gain, especially with weight around your waist
infertility
pain in the pelvic area
Your doctor will be able to determine symptoms that you cannot, such as androgen levels in the blood or high cholesterol levels.

, Several studies have shown that women with PCOS have a higher prevalence of depression than those who do not.PCOS is also linked to higher levels of anxiety and panic attacks in women.Depression and anxiety have many causes, most of which are complex. The presence of depression or anxiety alone is not enough to indicate PCOS. However, you should see a doctor immediately if you experience symptoms of depression or anxiety.


Symptoms of depression vary between women. Women with depressive disorders do not necessarily have all these symptoms. However, common signs of clinical depression include:Persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or worthlessness
Feelings of hopelessness
Irritability
Fatigue and low energy
Changes to appetite
Changes in sleep habits
Trouble concentrating and remembering
Loss of interest in things or activities you used to enjoy
Suicidal thoughts or actions


Symptoms of anxiety may also vary. You may not experience all of these symptoms. However, common signs of an anxiety disorder (as opposed to occasionally feeling anxious) include:Feelings of panic, uneasiness, or fear
Changes in sleep habits
Difficulty concentrating
Physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, dry mouth, muscle tension, nausea, and dizziness
Fidgeting or restlessness
Shortness of breath, or difficulty catching your breath


Women with PCOS may also be more likely to suffer from an eating disorder., If you have been having unprotected sex (i.e., not using any form of birth control) for more than one year and have been unable to conceive, you should consult with your doctor.Many conditions and factors can cause infertility, so infertility alone does not mean you have PCOS. However, PCOS is often a culprit.
About 30% of infertility problems are due to male infertility. Another 30% are due to female infertility. The remaining cases have unclear causes or may be a result of both partners’ infertility."

Lower your daily caloric intake.,
Add weight training to your daily exercise program.,
Increase your aerobic activity.,
Talk to your doctor about a thyroid test.",How to Maintain Weight During Menopause,"


Studies have shown that women approaching the age of 50 need about 200 fewer calories, because the metabolism slows as the body ages. While cutting 200 daily calories may help prevent weight gain during menopause, additional calorie cutting may be necessary to actually shed excess pounds. As a general rule, one pound equals 3,500 calories. That means that to lose one pound, you must burn 3,500 calories more than you consume.
Consider the nutritional value of everything you put on your plate, so that every calorie you consume provides benefit. Menopausal women need to be particularly concerned about getting sufficient calcium, since they tend to lose bone density during the middle years. Lean dairy products like skim milk and low-fat cheese and yogurt will supply the necessary calcium without adding excess calories.;
,


Women in the menopausal years tend to lose muscle mass, which lowers your resting metabolic rate. This means that your body cannot burn calories as efficiently, leaving you more vulnerable to weight gain during menopause. Hormonal changes during this time of life can also impact your fat-to-muscle ratio. To increase lean muscle mass, add a strength training regimen to your workouts 2 or 3 times a week.
During menopause, women lose bone density, which puts them at a greater risk for osteoporosis. Strength training also strengthens bones and lessens the likelihood of fractures in the later years of life.
Strength training can be done with machines, free weights or even your body's own resistance. If you have never done strength training before, a few sessions with a personal trainer will help you customize a program for your specific needs and ensure you are performing the exercises correctly to get results and avoid injury.

,


While strength training is essential to build lean muscle mass and increase your metabolic rate, there is no substitute for cardiovascular exercise if you want to maintain or lose weight during menopause. Many health experts recommend that menopausal women commit to 45 to 60 minutes of aerobic activity, 4 or 5 times a week. Some examples might include brisk walking, bike riding, swimming and dancing.
Most women find that they become more sedentary as they age. In addition to a structured workout program, find other ways to incorporate physical activity into your day. A walk with friends, washing your car or spending time in your garden can all be ways to burn a few extra calories while participating in an activity you enjoy.







,


Hypothyroidism is a common problem for women in the middle years of life. If you seem to be gaining weight despite a healthy, low-calorie diet and daily exercise program, an under-active thyroid may be the culprit. A simple blood test can help your doctor determine whether your thyroid is functioning normally.

Become physically active.,
Include strength training.,
Consider exercising with the help of a personal trainer.,
Increase your lifestyle activity.","How to Minimize the Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) With Herbal Supplements, Diet and Exercise1"," Regular aerobic exercise is an important component of managing symptoms of PCOS. It may help support weight loss, improve insulin resistance and manage any mood imbalances.It's recommended to include 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week.This is the standard recommendation for healthy adults and will also be appropriate for those who have PCOS.
It's recommended to exercise for at least 20-30 minutes per session.This will elevate your heart rate and keep it elevated for a sustained period of time.
Exercise may improve insulin sensitivity or resistance that is frequently associated with PCOS. Aerobic exercise helps your body use glucose and insulin more efficiently.;
, In addition to regular aerobic activity, studies have shown that performing strength training can also help manage insulin resistance associated with PCOS.Aim to include 2 sessions of strength training each week. Each session should last about 20-30 minutes and work all major muscle groups.Typical strength training exercises include: lifting weights or using weight machines, taking strength training classes or doing body weight exercises (like push-ups, tricep dips or pull-ups).
Yoga and pilates are types of strength training that can both help you build your strength while relieving your stress.

, These fitness professionals can help keep you on track and challenge you so you can obtain optimal results.


Many gyms offer complimentary personal training sessions to new members. They may also offer more low-cost and affordable training sessions compared to independent personal trainers.
You may also want to consider taking a strength training class. Many gyms and fitness centers offer classes that focus only on strength training and will be able to teach you the basics in addition to having a professional assist you.

, Another way to get in extra activity and boost your daily calorie burn from exercise is to increase your lifestyle activity.


Lifestyle activity or ""baseline activity"" are things you do everyday. For example: walking to and from your car or taking the stairs at work.Although each individual activity doesn't burn many calories, over the course of the entire day, you can burn a significant amount of calories from lifestyle activity.
Increasing your lifestyle activity can help you manage your weight and support your weight loss program (if you're following one).

Remove all jewelry.",How to Prepare for a Hysterectomy," Depending on the reasons for the hysterectomy, different parts of the reproductive system will be removed. The term ""hysterectomy"" is an umbrella term for all of these procedures, so it is important to understand which type of operation will be happening to you.A supracervical or subtotal hysterectomy involves the removal of the upper part of the uterus only, while the cervix stays in place.
A total hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus and cervix.
A radical hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus, tissue on the sides of the uterus, the cervix, and the top part of the vagina. This is typically only done when cancer is present.
Your hysterectomy may or may not involve removal of the ovaries (a procedure called ""oophorectomy"").;
, An open surgery, or abdominal hysterectomy, is the most common type, comprising 65% of procedures. This method involves a 5–7 inch abdominal incision, through which the appropriate organs are removed. An MIP hysterectomy (or minimally invasive procedure) may be vaginal (where an incision is made inside the vagina, through which the organs are removed — known as a transvaginal hysterectomy) or laparoscopic (which is a surgery done using a laparoscope, through one or more small tiny incisions, often through the belly button). Sometimes MIP hysterectomies will be a combination of vaginal/laparoscopic techniques.An open surgery hysterectomy usually results in a three-day hospital stay.
MIP hysterectomies generally involve reduced hospital stays, quicker recovery times, less scarring, and a lowered risk of infection.
An MIP hysterectomy results in a three to four week recovery period to resume full activity, compared to a five to six week recovery with an abdominal procedure.
Not all women will be suited for an MIP hysterectomy. Factors such as scar tissue, obesity, and health status can all affect whether or not an MIP is good choice for you.

, A hysterectomy is considered a ""moderate risk"" procedure.Fortunately, most women who have this surgery experience no complications; however, as with any medical procedure, some complications do occur for a small percentage of women. It is important to educate yourself on what could happen, even though the risk is small. Some complications include:Urinary incontinence
Vaginal prolapse
Fistula formation
Chronic pain
Blood clots
Infection
Frequent urination
Heavy bleeding (hemorrhage)
Early menopause
Complications due to general anesthesia

, The most common physical result of a hysterectomy is the early onset of menopause. If your ovaries will be removed during the procedure, you will experience the onset of menopause right away. If your ovaries will remain, you will still likely experience menopause at an earlier age than you would have otherwise. Additionally, after your hysterectomy, you will be advised to abstain from sexual activity or heavy lifting for a minimum of six weeks. On the bright side, after the recommended recovery period, most women report an immediate relief from reproductive pain, problems, and discomfort.

, Before your surgery, gather enough information to feel comfortable about the surgery. Generate a list of questions for your doctor, and talk to them until you feel all of your concerns have been answered. You may want to discuss any medications or hormone therapy you'll need, the effects of this surgery on your sex life, the best ways to accomplish a full recovery, and any other elements that you just aren't sure about or don't understand completely. , Individuals who smoke have been shown to have a much more difficult time recovering from surgery. Take this as a great opportunity to stop smoking for good. Even if you do not want to stop smoking indefinitely, the American College of Surgeons has determined that quitting four weeks prior to your surgery, and staying smoke-free for four weeks afterward has been shown to decrease your rate of wound complications by 50%.Choose a ""quit date"" and mark it on your calendar. Let you friends and family know about your ""quit date.""
Discuss your decision to quit with your physician for support and possible prescription therapies.
Discard any cigarettes, ashtrays, etc. from your home, office, and car.
Purchase some ""oral replacements,"" such as gum, candy, and/or toothpicks.
Decide if you will use some form of nicotine replacement (gum, patch, etc.).
Seek out a support system, such as class to quit smoking, Nicotine Anonymous, or a family member who has successfully quit smoking.

, As with smoking, patients who are very overweight have been shown to have more difficulty with recovery. This is the time to take control of your health and come out of your surgery feeling strong. If you are overweight, talk to your doctor about healthy ways to trim down before your surgery.Start focusing on eating healthy foods, above restricting unhealthy foods. Try to make sure you are getting 5 serving of vegetables each day.
Work on burning more calories — try to get active! This may simply be taking a walk around the block, riding a bike in your neighborhood, or putting on some music and dancing up a sweat.
Follow these methods for one week and see if you have experienced any weight loss. If you have not, begin reducing your caloric intake by 100–200 calories per day, by cutting out food with processed sugar or white flour.
Dropping just 5 to 10 lbs. prior to your surgery can have very positive effects on your recovery.

, You will want to be well-rested before you head into surgery. Improve your health and reduce your stress by aiming for eight hours of sleep per night for the month leading up to your surgery. If you feel like taking an additional nap during the day, go right ahead., This month is all about getting into the best possible shape so that you tackle your recovery with strength and well being. Regardless of your current weight, this includes eating a well-balanced diet of veggies, fruit, lean proteins, and whole grains. If this is new to you, you want to talk to your doctor for support.Try to consume five servings of vegetables per day (like bell peppers, cauliflower, or green beans). If you are having trouble fitting all those servings in, try making a smoothie with frozen fruit and spinach or broccoli. You'll be surprised how good it will taste!
Focus on eating whole grains (like brown rice, quinoa, oats, or millet) instead of processed flour foods (like pasta, white bread, or tortillas). Simply boil your grains in water, broth, milk, tomato sauce, or almost any other liquid.
Avoid foods with processed sugar, like soft drinks and dessert items.

, Another great way to prepare is to make appropriate arrangements at work. You will want to make sure everything is squared away, so that you can take some time to rest and recover, without worry. Speak to the people you work with and take any necessary steps to prepare for your absence., Depending on which medications you take regularly (if any), your doctor may advise you to change dosages or even refrain from certain meds in the days leading up to your surgery. Be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions with regard to medication., As you head into the week of your surgery, make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water). This will help prevent constipation, which can be a side effect of surgery. Try to consume at least 8 glasses of water per day., Ask your doctor to provide you with any prescriptions you will need after the surgery, and get these filled ahead of time. This makes them available for you as soon as you’re done with your surgery, and it is one less thing to worry about during your recovery., Your ability to drive will be curtailed for one to two weeks after your surgery or longer in some cases. Make arrangements for a ride home from the hospital, as well as any place you may need to travel during your recovery., A few days before you head into surgery, it is a great idea to head to the grocery store, stock your pantry, and do a bit a food prep for yourself. You may consider preparing some freezer meals. This way, you’ll be able to nourish yourself and stay healthy without a great deal of effort.

, You are going to want to bring a few items with you to the hospital. Pack your toothbrush, hairbrush, comb, shampoo, and deodorant, as well as an easy-to-wear change of clothes for the trip home.


Bring sanitary supplies.
Pack a robe and some slip-on slippers.
Bring some entertainment, like books, a tablet, or a laptop. Also remember to bring your charger for your electronic items.
Bring eyeglasses, hearing aids and dentures if needed.

, Eating healthy is always important, but avoiding heavy, greasy, unhealthy foods for a day or so leading into your surgery is especially helpful. This can minimize any digestive problems associated with anesthesia, and help your recovery go well., You will want to gather up any medical records, insurance information, a list of any medications you are taking, and your personal identification. If you have had any pre-op screenings or blood tests, you may want to bring the results of those with you as well., In most instances, you cannot have solid foods or liquids after 12:00am, the night before surgery. It is also possible for your doctor to prescribe a “bowel cleansing oral solution.” It is crucial for you to follow your doctor’s instructions when it comes to these pre-surgery preparations., You should not be wearing any jewelry when you undergo surgery, so go ahead and remove any while you are still at home. If you have a piece of jewelry that you cannot remove (such as a wedding ring that has been on for many years), speak to you doctor before cutting the jewelry or taking other drastic measures."

Practice standing urination.,
Wash your hands.,
Remove clothing from the waist down.,
Become familiar with your anatomy.,
Learn body position.,
Start the stream.,
Avoiding spray.,
Preventing drips.,
Do Kegel exercises.,
Trying new techniques.,
Think sanitary.,
Choose a secluded spot.,
Urinate at regular intervals.,
Dress for standing urination.",How to Pee Standing up Without a Device," If you wait until it is necessary before trying for the first time, it could yield complications. Your success with standing urination is determined by how familiar you become with the process.


One way to practice is to stand in the bathtub or shower and practice positioning, testing how effectively you can control your urine stream.;
, Clean hands before practicing, to ensure your hands are germ free and sanitary. Be sure to wash hands again after you finish urinating.

, Practice helps you perfect your technique, but there will always be trial and error. To avoid getting urine on your clothing, remove all clothing on your lower body, including socks.

, Being able to urinate standing require that you know how to position your own body properly. Review female anatomy by looking at a diagram or using a hand mirror to look at yourself.


Find the labia. The labia majora is a collective term for the two outer mounds of tissue on either side of the urethral and vaginal openings. The labia minora refers to inner folds of tissue enclosed within the labia majora. The latter compresses when we are standing with legs together to cover and protect the vaginal and urethral openings.Locate the urethra. The urethra is a tube that drains the bladder through an external opening. It is a tiny small hole, positioned at front of your vagina, behind the clitoris. It is very small, so don’t be alarmed if it takes a few moments to notice., Depending on aim and preference, position yourself slightly in front of or over the toilet or in a shower stall or bathtub. Spread feet apart roughly 2 ft. Crouch slightly or arch back if needed.


Spread the labia. After positioning over or slightly in front of your target, use the fingers of one hand to spread apart the labia minora. This offers an unobstructed opening for the urethra to drain and creates a controlled stream of urine.
Position the urethra. Place the fingers of your other hand fingers slightly in front of the urethra. Pull your fingers up and forward while exerting equal pressure on both sides of the clitoris with two fingers.

, Rotate hips to control the direction of the stream. Apply pressure at the beginning and end of the urine flow. This increases the speed of the flow and reduces dribbling.


You want to keep your stream consistent as opposed to intermittent in order to prevent dripping.
Clean up. Rinse the shower or bathtub. If practicing with a toilet, wipe up any stray urine. Be sure to wash your hands again.

, Finger placement is key to help you avoid spray, as is stretching of the labia.Don’t pull too far. Pulling too far up upward on the urethra can cause spray, as it tends to compress the urethral opening, causing it to flatten slightly. Over time, your fingers will learn what is the right amount of upward tension to keep while urinating.
Stretch your labia. Sufficient tension on the labia insures that it does not interfere with your stream, and is the most important part of mastering standing urination. Over time, you may notice that your labia stretches out a bit to better accommodate standing urination.

, A few random drips are common, even for the most veteran standing urinator (men included). Yet you can refine technique to prevent frequent drips by refining finger position.


Place two fingers on either side of the clitoris, slight ahead of the urethra. When you place pressure directly on either side of the urethra, it stretches the opening slightly and causes side drips.

, Think about your lower body and isolate the muscles that tighten to stop urine flow. Tense them briefly. Note how they seem to tug on your entire undercarriage. These are the muscles of your pelvic floor, and strengthening them can help you control urine flow and prevent drips.Exercise the muscles of your pelvic floor by contracting them for a count of 5 seconds, then releasing them for a count of 5 second. You may gradually work up to intervals of ten seconds. Be careful not to exhaust your muscles as this can negatively impact urination immediately after.
Focus on the right muscle group. When first starting, these muscles may be weak or difficult to control, and it may be tempting to tense the buttocks or abdomen while exercising them. It is important, however, that you focus on only the pelvic floor muscles and teaching them to respond to voluntary control.
Repeat exercises at least 3 times daily. Doctors recommend a regimen of 3 sets at a time, 10 times daily. If that is too much at first, gradually work your way up to this goal. Only do what is comfortable for you.

, As your body becomes accustomed to standing urination and your muscles more responsive, consider trying the “One-handed Method.” It requires greater dexterity but can be easier once you get the hang of it.Begin by washing your hands and moving clothing out of the way.
Form a “V” with the first and second finger of your hand and use it to spread the inner lips of the labia, pulling upward. This encourages urine to drain as a stream and not run down your leg.
You can adjust the direction of the stream by adjusting the upward pressure of your fingers, as well as the position of your hips.

, If you suspect that the bathrooms will be unsanitary or unavailable at your destination, keep a few items on hand to help yourself stay clean:


Wet wipes or tissues. Travel-sized containers of facial tissue or wet wipes are perfect for wiping when finished urinating.
Hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizer plays two important roles in standing urination for women. First, before you urinate, it allows you to clean your hands before using them to guide urination. This prevents unwanted germs in the region that can cause urinary tract infections. Secondly, hand sanitizer can be used to clean up after urination. Because hand sanitizer contains alcohol, it is recommended that you apply only to your hands, using sanitary wipes or tissues for more sensitive areas.

, If you are urinating on a camping trip without restrooms, make sure you have privacy. Getting interrupted while urinating can be startling and might cause urine to get on your clothes.


If urinating in or near an urban area, be advised that this could be illegal per local laws on lewdness and public indecency., Don't hold your urine until there is a sense of urgency. This can cause the urine to drain unpredictably and increase instances of spray and dripping. Instead, go at regular intervals to promote a more controlled urine stream.


A good rule of thumb is to urinate immediately following meals and/or hydration.

, This depends on the person in question. Some women find skirts more conducive. Other women report that they are able to unzip their jeans to urinate and the tension of the denim fabric on the labia actually helps them control their urine stream.Try to decide what clothing is best suited to your experience level and comfort and dress accordingly when you know you’ll have to urinate while standing.

Participate in some type of aerobic activity every day.,
Join a gym and start lifting weights 3 or more times a week.",How to Minimize Weight Gain After Menopause2," Aerobic exercise burns calories, which is a weight control basic.


Aerobic activity entails using a group of muscles for 15 to 20 minutes while your heart beats at 60 to 80 percent of its maximum capacity.
Walking, jogging, dancing, biking, swimming and cross-country skiing are all forms of aerobic activity.
Aerobic exercise helps relieve stress, tones up muscles and may reduce stomach spread.

, Lifting weights will tone up muscles and rebuild muscle mass. Having a slightly heavier muscle mass will help you to burn more calories.

Don't skip meals.","How to Minimize the Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) With Herbal Supplements, Diet and Exercise2"," There is a lot of literature available about how to manage PCOS with diet. Meeting with a registered dietitian can help you sort out which advice to follow, which foods to eat and how much to eat.


These nutrition professionals are a great resource to those with PCOS who want to manage symptoms and/or lose weight. Speak to your dietitian about your medical history, symptoms and what your goals are.
It might also be helpful to bring copies of your medical records, weight history, list of medications and supplements so that your dietitian will have a full background on your health.
Some dietitians may focus only in women's health or clients with PCOS. You may be able to ask your physician for a referral or search for a specialized dietitian.

, Although not all people that have PCOS also have weight problems, a high percentage are overweight or obese.It's helpful to moderate calories to prevent weight gain and induce weight loss if needed.


PCOS affects your body's ability to produce insulin and use it effectively which can cause weight gain. This same problem may also make it difficult to lose weight.If you need to lose weight, aim to do so safely. That means, losing only 1-2 pounds per week. This slow and steady rate of weight loss has been shown to be safe and more sustainable long-term.To lose 1-2 pounds a week, you'll need to cut out about 500 calories daily from your diet. You can also ""cut"" calories by burning them through exercise.If you want to maintain your weight and/or prevent weight gain, you'll need to consume adequate calories daily. This amount will differ for everyone based on age, weight and activity level.
If you search online for calorie calculators you'll be able to figure out about how many calories you need to eat daily to maintain your weight.

, Since insulin resistance is highly associated with PCOS, it's important for all people with PCOS to be mindful of their carbohydrate intake.


All types of carbohydrates increase blood sugar levels. Foods that are high in carbohydrates or are simple carbohydrates can spike your blood sugar very high which is problematic for those with PCOS.Carbohydrates are found in a wide variety of foods. These include: fruits, grains, legumes, dairy products and starchy vegetables. Since carbohydrates are found in so many foods, it's not advised to follow a very low or no carb diet. You'll be limiting too many foods. Aim to reduce the amount of carbs in your diet and choose foods that also contain a lot of other nutrients outside of carbohydrates.
Focus on consuming complex carbs. These foods are higher in fiber and other nutrients and do not cause a quick spike in your blood sugar and insulin levels.Examples of complex carbs include: whole grains, starchy vegetables, dairy and legumes.
Limit simple carbohydrates as these are generally lower in fiber and cause big spikes in insulin and blood sugar.. Refined sugars, white bread, white rice, processed grains, sweets or sweetened beverages all fall into the refined carbohydrate category. Try to limit or avoid these as much as possible.

, Some types of fat have been shown to be beneficial to your health. Omega-3 fats have been shown to be beneficial to PCOS patients as well.


Omega-3 fats are found in a wide variety of foods including: fatty fish (like salmon, mackerel and tuna), olive oil, avocado, nuts and nut butters and seeds.
Healthy fats help you stay satisfied longer compared to other foods. In addition, they can help slow the digestion of meals which helps manage insulin and blood sugar spikes.Try to avoid more unhealthy fats like trans fat or saturated fat which are found in fried foods, processed foods and fatty cuts of meat.

, Fruits and vegetables are a healthy part of any diet or weight loss program. These low calorie, nutrient dense foods can help you manage a healthy weight or help support safe weight loss.


It's recommended to consume anywhere from 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Aim for 1-2 servings of fruit and the rest should be vegetables.If you have PCOS and are also insulin resistant you may want to choose lower sugar fruits (like apples and berries instead of bananas, for example) and non-starchy vegetables over higher sugar and higher carb fruits and vegetables. This can help manage blood sugar and insulin levels.
To keep calories low in your meals and snacks, make half of your plate a fruit or a vegetable. This is a simple way to cut back on extra calories.

, Some health professionals have also recommended that patients with PCOS follow a Mediterranean style diet. This style of eating can help manage a healthy weight and insulin resistance.A Mediterranean diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and moderate amounts of animal protein.
Eating 1-2 servings of healthy fats each day. The Mediterranean diet generally recommends olives or olive oil and fatty fish as sources of healthy fats.

, Adequate hydration is an important component of a healthy diet. When you have PCOS drinking enough fluids can also help manage fatigue - one common symptom of PCOS.Dehydration can cause a variety of side effects including fatigue.If you're not drinking enough fluids, dehydration can worsen or exacerbate the typical fatigue that is associated with PCOS.
Many health professionals suggest aiming for about 8 glasses of sugar-free, decaf beverages daily. You may need more or less depending on your weight and activity level.
Keep a water bottle handy throughout the day. This can help you track how much you've consumed and how much more you need to drink to meet your daily goal.

, If you skip meals regularly, you can increase symptoms of PCOS.


When you skip meals, you increase your chances of fatigue, mood swings and binge eating. These are also associated with PCOS. Skipping meals can worsen these.When you skip meals you will also have disturbances in you blood sugar and insulin levels making it more difficult for your body to manage.Eat at least 3 meals daily. If there is more than 4-5 hours between any meals, you may need a snack to help maintain blood sugar levels.

Blood tests can identify hormone imbalance. The classic signs of too much estrogen are hot flashes and emotional outbursts, but symptoms related to too much testosterone may be less noticeable and take more time to develop. Genetics and unknown environmental factors trigger certain glands (ovaries, pituitary and adrenal glands) to malfunction, leading to excessive testosterone production.Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is often the result of too much testosterone production in women — it can develop at any age post puberty.
PCOS develops because the testosterone prevents the release of eggs from their follicles within the ovaries. Since the follicles can't open, eggs and fluid collects within the ovaries, forming what appears to be numerous cysts.In addition to lack of menstruation and PCOS, other symptoms of excessive testosterone production include hirsutism (increased hair growth), enhanced aggression and libido, increased muscle mass, clitoral growth, acne development, deepening voice, and darkening or thickening of the skin.;
, Type 2 diabetes is characterized by reduced cellular sensitivity to the effects of insulin.Type 2 diabetes is often triggered by obesity and results in an over-production of insulin, which can cause the ovaries to produce more testosterone. Thus, obesity, type 2 diabetes (insulin resistance), high testosterone production and PCOS often occur together within women if given enough time to develop. Your doctor can test your insulin and blood glucose levels to see if you have or are at risk of developing diabetes.


Type 2 diabetes can be prevented and even reversed with weight loss, regular exercise and dietary changes (such as less processed carbohydrates and harmful hydrogenated fats).
Your physician may prescribe medication that reduces insulin resistance, such as metformin (Glucophage) or pioglitazone (Actos). These medications can normalize insulin and testosterone levels, which helps to restore normal menstrual cycles.
When high insulin levels are coupled with high testosterone levels, there's an increased risk of developing hypertension (high blood pressure), blood cholesterol imbalance (too much ""bad"" LDL cholesterol) and cardiovascular disease.In one study it was found that 43% of PCOS patients suffer from metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the co-occurrence of risk factors with diabetes. These risk factors include obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension., Once PCOS develops from chronically high testosterone levels, there's an increased risk of uterine cancer if the menstrual cycle has stopped (in pre-menopausal women).As such, it's important to ""kick start"" normal menstrual cycles to reduce cancer risks. This can be readily accomplished by supplementing with progesterone pills or by taking birth control pills that contain estrogen and progesterone on a regular basis. Remember that menstruating while on the pill will not restore your fertility (ability to get pregnant).


If you have PCOS, the benefits of taking birth control pills are clear, although ask your doctor to explain the potential negative side effects, such as reduced libido, mood changes, weight gain, headaches, breast tenderness and nausea.It usually takes about six months of birth control pill usage for women to notice changes in their symptoms related to high testosterone, such as less facial hair (particularly on the upper lip) and acne., Another option for women who have chronically high testosterone levels, particularly if they don't have diabetes and would prefer not to go on birth control pills, is anti-androgen medication. Androgens are a group of interrelated hormones, including testosterone, which are responsible for the development male characteristics.Commonly used anti-androgen drugs include spironolactone (Aldactone), leuprolide (Lupron, Viadur, Eligard), goserelin (Zoladex) and abarelix (Plenaxis). Your doctor might recommend experimenting with anti-androgen meds at low doses for six months to gauge effectiveness versus potential negative side effects.


Anti-androgen drugs are also used by male-to-female transsexuals as part of their efforts to reduce testosterone levels, particularly if they opt for gender reassignment surgery.
Other diseases and conditions that can lead to high testosterone levels in women include ovarian cancer / tumors, Cushing's disease (pituitary gland problem) and cancer of the adrenal glands.
In healthy women, ovaries and adrenal glands (which sit atop the kidneys) produce up to 50% of their testosterone., Soybeans are rich in phytoestrogenic compounds known as isoflavones (especially genistein and glycitein). These compounds mimic the effect of estrogen in the body, which can reduce the production of testosterone secondarily.Soy also contains a compound called daidzein, which can be transformed in the large intestine by some people (the process needs certain ""friendly"" bacteria) into the highly anti-androgenic compound equol. Equol can directly reduce the production or effects of testosterone.


Soy products are diverse and can be found in cereals, breads, tofu, various beverages, energy bars and meat substitutes (vegetarian hot dogs and burgers, for example).
Soy is a phytoestrogen, or plant compounds that also bind to estrogen receptors. They ""are not"" equivalent to human produced estrogen. Unlike human produced estrogen which acts upon both of estrogen's alpha and beta receptors, plant estrogens preferentially only act upon beta receptors. Despite rumors on the contrary, soy consumption is not associated with breast or thyroid issues (estrogen alpha receptor issues) and have shown in clinical studies to be generally healthful.
Nevertheless, soy has a number of real issues, one may be related to GMO soybeans, the other is food processing. High temperature acid hydrolysis of soy protein commonly used to process soy makes cancer causing substances such as 3-MCPD and 1,3-DCP. Make sure your sauces and soy powders based on soy are processed without high heat. (for soy/oyster/hoisin/teriyaki sauce in particular, this means ""naturally fermented"", a process which weeks not hours.)
Overconsumption of soy may reduce collagen production as collagen is disrupted through the estrogen beta receptor.

, Flaxseeds are high in omega-3 fatty acids (which have an anti-inflammatory effect) and compounds called lignans, which are highly estrogenic (stimulates estrogen production). Lignans are also able to reduce total and free testosterone levels in your body, while suppressing the conversion of testosterone into the more potent dihydrotestosterone.Remember that flaxseed needs to be ground up in order to be digested by people. Sprinkle ground flaxseed on your breakfast cereal and/or yogurt. You can also find whole grain breads with flaxseed added at most quality grocery stores.


Lignans work by increasing levels of sex hormone binder, which renders testosterone molecules inactive by binding to androgen receptors within the body.
Among commonly eaten foods, flaxseed is the richest source of lignans by far, with sesame seeds a distant second., Testosterone is a steroidal hormone that requires cholesterol to be produced. Cholesterol is only found in saturated fat from animal products (meat, cheese, butter, etc.). Some cholesterol is essential for making steroidal hormones and virtually all the body's cell membranes, but diets rich in saturated fat tend to trigger increased testosterone production.Furthermore, diets high in monounsaturated fat (avocados, most nuts, olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil) boost testosterone levels also. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are the only fats associated with reduced testosterone levels.


Most vegetable oils (corn, soy, rapeseed/canola) are rich in omega-6 PUFAs, although consuming them in large amounts to reduce testosterone could very well lead to other health problems, so be cautious.
Healthier forms of PUFAs (rich in omega-3) include fish oils, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring), flaxseed, walnuts and sunflower seeds.
Diets high in saturated fat may also increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, although omega-6 PUFAs may not be much better for your heart. Balancing natural fats is the key, while eliminating hydrogenated fats.

, Refined carbohydrates are high in easily digested sugar (glucose), which spikes insulin levels and triggers the ovaries to produce more testosterone — similar process to type 2 diabetes, although short-term effects instead of long term.Thus, avoid refined carbohydrates (anything with high fructose corn syrup) and choose healthier carbs such as whole grain products, fresh berries and citrus fruits, fibrous veggies, leafy greens and legumes.


Products high in refined sugars that you should avoid or minimize include candy, cookies, cakes, most store-bought baked goods, ice cream, chocolate, soda pop and other sugary drinks.
A diet high in refined sugars also increases your risk of heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes.

, There are a number of herbs that can have anti-androgenic effects (based on various animal studies), although their direct effect on testosterone levels in women has not been well studied. Herbs most commonly used for their anti-androgenic properties include saw palmetto, chaste berries, black cohosh, licorice, spearmint and peppermint teas, and lavender oil.Always consult with your doctor before taking any herb that has a reputation of being able to impact hormones.



DO NOT take these herbal supplements if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or wanting to become pregnant in the near future.
Women who have a history of cancer (breast, uterine, ovarian) or other hormone-related problems, should supplement with these herbs only while under their doctor's supervision.

Limit your alcohol consumption.,
Eat plant-based proteins.,
Cut out saturated fat.",How to Lose Weight During Menopause2," Work with your doctor and a nutritionist to figure how many calories you burn and your daily caloric intake. If you burn more calories than you take in, you'll lose weight. On average, you'll need to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume each week to lose 1 pound (0.45 kg). Your guidelines might be more or less based on your height, weight, and lifestyle., Get at least 64 fluid ounces (1.9 L) of water each day. Green tea will help to stimulate your metabolism and keep you alert. As a bonus, both drinks are calorie-free. Add lemon to your water and stevia to your green tea. Both will add a fruity or sweet burst to your drink and also help to curb your appetite., Hormonal changes during menopause increase your sensitivity to simple carbs, which can wreak havoc on your metabolism. Pass on the sugar, baked goods, white bread, and white rice. Avoid processed foods and fast foods, which rely too heavily on processed corn and corn syrups., Complex carbs fill you up and give you energy.They also make great substitutions for simple carbs. Go for spaghetti squash instead of pasta. Eat brown rice or quinoa instead of white rice. Make your sandwiches with whole grain bread instead of white bread. Enjoy a bowl of cooked rolled oats for breakfast. Even potatoes can be a healthy option without the butter or other fatty spreads., They're nutrient-dense and will keep you full. Slice up a banana in your oatmeal for sweetness and potassium. Snack on grapes or berries if you feel a sugar craving. Toss mushrooms into your spaghetti squash to replace meat. Add garlic and/or onions to your meals to prevent inflammation.Load up on dark leafy greens like kale. They're an excellent source of calcium, which you need more of during and after menopause.Add them to your sandwiches and salads or sauté them with olive oil and garlic for a tasty side dish.

, As a rule, you shouldn't drink too many calories, which alcohol contains. If you have a family history of heart disease, one glass of red wine per day is fine, but let that be your limit. Avoid liquor, beer, and mixed drinks that contain added sugar., Protein keeps you full and promotes healthy muscles. However, too much animal protein can trigger acidosis, which can lead to osteoporosis.Instead of animal protein, opt for legumes like peas, beans, and nuts. If your grocery store has a bulk aisle, get your protein there. If you don't have access to a bulk aisle, buy packaged peas, beans, and nuts that don't contain added salt.


If you're not sensitive to soy, soybeans, tofu, and edamame are must-haves. These foods contain plant protein and mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. By eating these superfoods, you'll not only fight weight loss, you could also alleviate those hot flashes. Just stick to whole soy, instead of byproducts., Eating saturated fat adds unnecessary calories and increases your risk of heart disease and Type-2 diabetes. Avoid margarine, butter, shortening, lard, or any other foods that contain saturated fat. Substitute them with healthy alternatives like olive oil and avocado oil."

Meditate before you go to bed. Listen to relaxing music. Spend time with your friends. Get in touch with nature by walking outside, gardening, or bird watching., Bone health contributes to your ability to exercise. No matter how healthy your diet is, you'll probably have to supplement calcium. Take Vitamin D supplements for calcium absorption. Magnesium also helps with calcium levels and could increase your energy., HRT can increase your body’s diminishing estrogen and progesterone levels. It helps you lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. Discuss your medical history and medications you're currently taking. Let your doctor know if you or a close relative have a history of heart or blood clotting problems.Consider looking into bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT)in place of traditional HRT. BHRT mimics the effects of human hormones, whereas traditional HRT uses synthetic hormones derived from horse urine. BHRT has been associated with fewer negative side effects.
If traditional or bioidentical HRT isn't for you, talk to a naturopathic doctor about alternatives. They'll be able to recommend a variety of herbs like black cohosh and supplements like probiotics., Pesticides, pollutants, and other chemicals in household cleaners can increase your risk for hormonal imbalance and weight gain.Look for products labeled “eco-friendly” or “environmentally-friendly” made with organic or all-natural ingredients. Better yet, use common natural household products as cleaners. Baking soda, white vinegar, and fresh lemon juice clean effectively and leave no harmful chemicals behind.

Understand that having a plan will help to alleviate stress and worry.,
Make a birthing plan.,
Organize for someone to take care of other children or pets.,
Clear your calendar.,
Get your car checked out.,
Pack your bag for the hospital.",How to Enjoy Your Final Weeks of Pregnancy1," Although this might seem like something that would add stress to your life, it can actually be quite comforting for you to know that everything is planned out for when you will not be able to take care of things.Finalizing the plans for getting to the hospital and having everything packed and ready to go makes it much easier to relax and enjoy the last few weeks of pregnancy. After all of the plans are in place, you will have less to worry about and will hopefully be able to relax a bit more.;
, This plan should cover your preferences regarding the details of your child’s birth, such as what medication you will be administered, and whether or not your baby will be circumcised, if he is a boy. Many women find it helpful to put their birth plan in writing so that everyone involved in the birthing process is aware of her preferences since she may not be capable of expressing them clearly while giving birth.It is important to also add some clauses about what you prefer if something changes, such as the need for an emergency caesarean if the baby is having difficulties during the birth.

, If there are other children in the family or pets in the home, plans should be made for someone to care for them while you are giving birth. This person or persons should be reliable and readily available at any time of day or night.


In addition, unless they volunteer, it is usually best to choose someone besides the immediate family, since they may want to be at the hospital when the baby is born.

, Since few babies are actually born when they are expected, it is a good idea for you to clear your calendar for several weeks toward the end of your pregnancy. This means that you should take care of all of your routine appointments, even if it is a little ahead of schedule.


Some appointments to consider are the dentist, hair salon, pediatric appointments for other children in the family, and veterinarian appointments for household pets.
Once all of the appointments are finished and out of the way, you will not have to worry about forgetting to call to cancel them when the baby comes.

, Another appointment that should be made is a tune up for your vehicle. It is important to be sure that it in good working condition before the baby is born. This includes such things as checking the condition of the wiper blades, which many people don’t consider until there is a problem.

, Put in everything that you need for you and your baby. These things include diapers, hygiene products, clothes for you and baby, and towels.Select the clothing that you will wear on your way out of the hospital. Keep in mind that you will most likely have a bunch of pictures taken of you and your baby at that time.
Select clothing for your baby. If you want your baby to wear something special for his or her first day in the world, remember to pack it.

Buy a basal body temperature thermometer.,
Take and record your basal body temperature every day for several months.,
Look for a prolonged spike in temperature.,
Try to anticipate ovulation.,
Understand the method’s limitations.",How to Know When You Are Ovulating1," Your basal body temperature is your lowest body temperature over a 24-hour period.In order to regularly take and monitor your basal body temperature (BBT), you’ll need a basal body temperature thermometer.Basal body thermometers are available in most drugstores and come with a chart to help you track your BBT over several months.;
, To accurately track your BBT, you’ll need to take your temperature at the same time each day: immediately when you wake, before you even get out of bed.Keep your BBT thermometer next to your bed. Try to wake up and take your temperature around the same time each morning.
Basal body temperature can be taken either orally, rectally, or vaginally. Whichever way you choose to take your temperature, continue with that method to ensure a consistent reading each day. Rectal and vaginal readings may offer more accurate readings.Write down your temperature each morning on a piece of graph paper or a BBT chart, which is a pre-made graph on which you can plot your temperature.
You’ll need to track your BBT every day for several months in order to begin seeing a pattern.

, Most women’s BBT raises about half a degree for a minimum of 3 days during ovulation.Thus, you’re tracking your BBT in order to identify when this increase in temperature occurs for you each month, as it will allow you to then anticipate when you’ll ovulate.

, After several months of recording your BBT each morning, look over your charts to try to determine when you ovulate. Once you can identify a pattern of when your BBT rises each month, you’ll be able to anticipate when you’re ovulating by doing the following:


Find when your regular spike in temperature occurs each month.
Mark the two to three days prior to this temperature spike as likely ovulation days.This record can also be helpful to show your doctor if you suspect possible infertility issues., Though your BBT can be a useful tool, it also has limitations you should be aware of.You may not be able to identify a pattern. If you can’t identify a pattern after several months, you may need to use other methods in conjunction with monitoring your BBT. Consider adding one of the other methods discussed in this article to your routine.
Basal body temperature can be disrupted by changes in your circadian rhythms, which can be brought on by working night shifts, over- or under-sleeping, traveling, or drinking alcohol.
Basal body temperature can also be disrupted by periods of increased stress, including holidays or periods of illness, as well as by certain medications and gynecological conditions.

Take advantage of the time before the baby comes.,
Go on a mini vacation or to a day spa.,
Go shopping for some new clothes.,
Spend time with your partner and children.",How to Enjoy Your Final Weeks of Pregnancy2," When everything is taken care of, it is time to relax. Once the baby is born, you most likely won’t have a whole lot of time for yourself for awhile. Because of this, you should take some time to pamper yourself now.This could be something as simple as indulging in an activity that you love but haven’t had time to do, like going out to dinner or to a movie, or even just reading a book in bed.

, Pampering yourself could also include going on a mini vacation where you do not have to be concerned with the many activities that your daily life usually entails. This mini vacation could be a weekend away with your significant other, or simply a day at the spa.


Getting a full body massage can help ease muscle or joint strain related to carrying the extra weight of the baby or sleeping in awkward positions.
Most pregnant women can barely see their feet, let alone take care of them, so a pedicure may be a great way to pamper yourself.

, After wearing maternity clothes for so many months, you might also enjoy going shopping for some new clothes or shoes. Although you won’t be able to try them on while you are pregnant, you can always save the receipt and exchange them if they don’t fit right after the baby is born.


If shopping for yourself isn’t your cup of tea, you can also go shopping for you baby.

, Along with pampering yourself physically, you may also want to pamper yourself emotionally. Spend some quality time with your partner and any other children you may have.


Not only will this make you feel relaxed, it will also remind your loved ones that they are very important to you.

Make sure that you are getting enough rest.,
Eat as healthily as possible.,
Reduce constipation.,
Avoid swelling.,
Reduce leg cramps.,
Cope with heartburn.,
Reduce back pain.,
Deal with any shortness of breath.,
Avoid hemorrhoids .",How to Enjoy Your Final Weeks of Pregnancy3," Toward the end of a pregnancy, many women have trouble getting comfortable enough for a good night of sleep. If this is the case, you should take naps during the day in order to be sure that your body is getting enough rest.


If necessary, you should arrange for a sitter or a family member to help when there are other children in the family so that you can get some sleep.

, Since you and your baby are getting nutrients from the food that you eat, it is important for you to eat often and focus on foods that are healthy instead of foods with low nutritional values. It is alright to satisfy a craving for something of little nutritional worth, but it should be done in moderation. Usually a few bites should satisfy the craving.It is also important to get enough liquids, especially water.

, Constipation is common in pregnant women because the intestine muscles relax and reduce their ability to push food through your system. Constipation can lead to stomach pains and a generally sense of sluggishness.Cope with constipation by eating fiber-rich foods. Fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts, and dried fruit all contain fiber.
Walk or do light exercise because physical activity can help to get your intestines working.

, Swelling is one of the accompanying symptoms of late pregnancy that occurs due to the pressure of the uterine vessels, water retention and a lack of protein intake.


Drink plenty of water so that you and your baby stay hydrated, especially if it is hot outside. Staying hydrated can help to keep your body from retaining water and making you swell up. #*Eat plenty of meat, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and cereals.
Do not eat too much spicy or salty food. These two food groups may make your body retain fluid that can lead to swelling in your arms and legs.

, Leg cramps and restless leg syndrome are common in the last week of pregnancy. The reasons could be lack of calcium, magnesium, or poor circulation.


Calcium is an electrolyte that helps in the transmission of signals through the body. Include dairy products in your diet like milk,yogurt or cheese, as these are all rich in calcium.
Magnesium affects the muscles and their contractions. Try to eat cereals, nuts, and soy that are all rich in magnesium.
A warm bath before bed help to control restless leg syndrome.

, This is a common discomfort during pregnancy. When your intestines do not work as efficiently as normal, food can remain in your large intestine for a long period of time, causing heartburn. On top of that, your baby is pressing on your stomach, so food and acid can get squished back up out of your stomach and cause heartburn. To deal with heartburn:


Eat smaller meals and avoid fatty and spicy foods.
Do not lie down immediately after eating. Wait two to three hours.

, During pregnancy, the organs in your body move and make space for your baby as he or she grows. These moving organs can affect your backbone, causing back pain. To ease your pain:


Try to avoid standing in the same position for a long period of time.
Elevate your legs when you sit down.
Wear flat shoes.

, A growing baby causes your uterus to expand, which in turn can put pressure on your diaphragm. This pressure can make you feel like you can’t catch your breath.Try to control this discomfort by sleeping in a half-seated position and by slowing down your physical activities.

, Due to the increased pressure of the uterus on the veins of your abdomen, your flow of blood can slow down in the area around your rectum This can cause hemorrhoids, which can be uncomfortable and, at times, painful.


To reduce your chances of developing hemorrhoids, try to avoid constipation (see Step 3 of this section for more information).

Understand why making memorabilia is a good idea.,
Put together a pregnancy journal or scrapbook.,
Write a letter to your new baby.",How to Enjoy Your Final Weeks of Pregnancy4," During the final weeks of pregnancy, many women take time off from work and have more time on their hands. This is a wonderful time to make memorabilia so that you and your child can look back at this important time in both of your lives.

, If you haven’t already started a pregnancy journal or scrapbook, this is a great time to put one together. You can purchase one at a store or make one on your own from a blank book. Be as creative as you want to be.


Just because it is a journal does not mean that it only has to contain writing. Paste in ultrasound pictures, cards and other things that you have collected during your pregnancy.
In the same manner, a scrapbook can also contain journal entries whether they are written directly in the scrapbook or written on a piece of paper and glued in.

, Another thing that you can do is write a letter to your unborn child. This letter can be saved and given to your child, or read to your child, when he or she is older. A letter is wonderful expression of love and the joy you are feeling about having your baby.

Begin checking and testing your cervical mucus.,
Distinguish between the different kinds of cervical mucus.,
Chart and record your cervical mucus over several months.",How to Know When You Are Ovulating2," Beginning immediately after you period ends, start checking your cervical mucus first thing in the morning.


Wipe with a clean piece of toilet paper and examine any mucus you find by picking up a bit with your finger.
Record the type and consistency of discharge or note the lack of discharge.

, The female body produces several different types of cervical mucus each month as hormone levels fluctuate, and certain types of mucus are more conducive to pregnancy. Here's how vaginal discharge changes during the month:During menstruation, your body will discharge menstrual blood, which consists of the shed uterine lining and unfertilized egg.
During three to five days following menstruation, most women will have no discharge. Though not impossible, it’s highly unlikely that a woman will become pregnant during this stage.Following the dry period, you’ll begin to notice cloudy cervical mucus.This kind of cervical mucus forms a plug over the cervical canal that prevents bacteria from entering the uterus, and it’s also difficult for sperm to penetrate. A woman is unlikely to get pregnant during this period.Following the stickier discharge, you’ll begin to see a white, beige, or yellow “creamy” discharge that’s similar in consistency to cream or lotion. During this stage a woman is more fertile, though not at peak fertility.You’ll then begin to notice thin, stretchy, watery mucus that resembles egg whites. It will be watery enough to be stretched several inches between your fingers. On or after the last day of this “egg white” cervical mucus stage, you’ll begin to ovulate. This “egg white” cervical mucus is very fertile and provides nourishment to sperm, making this the woman’s most fertile stage.Following this stage and ovulation, the discharge will return to its earlier cloudy, sticky consistency.

, It will take several months of monitoring before you’ll be able to distinguish a regular pattern.Continue recording for several months. Examine your chart and try to distinguish a pattern. Right before the end of the “egg white” cervical mucus stage is when you’re ovulating.
Tracking cervical mucus along with basal body temperature (BBT) can help you more accurately pinpoint when you’re ovulating by allowing you to corroborate the two records."
"
Buy an Ovulation Predictor Kit (OPK).,
Pay attention to your menstrual cycle.,
Begin testing your urine each day.,
Know what your results mean.,
Know the limitations of using an OPK.",How to Know When You Are Ovulating3," OPKs are available at most drug stores and use a urine test that measures luteinising hormone (LH) levels. The levels of LH in urine are usually low but will increase sharply for a 24-48 hour period just before ovulation.OPKs can help you pinpoint when you ovulate more precisely than tracking your basal body temperature or cervical mucus, particularly if you have an irregular cycle.

, Ovulation typically occurs about half-way into your menstrual cycle (about 12-14 days before your period on average).You’ll know you’re a few days away from ovulation when you begin to see watery discharge resembling egg whites.


When you begin to see this discharge, begin using the OPK. Because a kit will only contain a limited number of testing strips, it’s important that you wait until this point before beginning. Otherwise, you may go through all of the strips before you actually begin ovulating.

, Follow the instructions provided with the kit. You should be careful to test your urine at the same time each day.Avoid being either under- or over-hydrated, as it may artificially raise or lower LH levels.

, Many OPKs use a urine stick or strip to measure your LH levels and will indicate your results using colored lines.


A line close to the color of the control line typically indicates elevated LH levels, meaning there’s a good chance you’re ovulating.
A line lighter in color than the control line typically means you’re not yet ovulating.
If you use OPKs several times without any positive results, consider seeing an infertility specialist for consultation to rule out infertility issues.

, Though the test is usually accurate, you may miss your ovulation window if you don’t time the testing correctly.


For that reason, OPKs are best used in conjunction with another ovulation-tracking method, like tracking basal body temperature or cervical mucus, so you have a better sense of when to begin taking the urine tests.

Track your basal body temperature (BBT).,
Track your bodily symptoms.,
Combine the data to determine ovulation.,
Know the limitations of the method.",How to Know When You Are Ovulating4," The symptothermal method uses a combination of tracking physical changes and BBT to determine when you ovulate.Tracking your BBT is the “thermal” part of the symptothermal method, and it requires that you track your basal body temperature every day.Because your BBT will experience a sustained rise two to three days after ovulation, tracking your BBT can help you estimate when in your cycle you’re ovulating. (See the method on Using Basal Body Temperature for more detailed instructions.)
It will take several months of daily tracking to establish a pattern of ovulation.

, This is the “sympto” part of the symptothermal method and involves closely tracking your physical symptoms to determine when you’re ovulating.Each day, carefully track and record your cervical mucus (see the section on Checking Your Cervical Mucus for more) and any other menstrual symptoms you experience, like breast tenderness, cramping, mood swings, etc.Worksheets for tracking your symptoms are available online to print or you can devise your own.
It will take several months of daily tracking to distinguish a pattern.

, Use both the information from your BBT tracking and from your symptom tracking to verify when you ovulate.Ideally, the data will coincide, allowing you to determine when you’re ovulating.
If the data conflict, continue your daily tracking of each until a coinciding pattern appears.

, This method is best used for fertility awareness, and does have certain limitations.


Some couples use this method for natural contraception by avoiding sex during the woman’s fertile period (leading up to and during ovulation). Using this method for contraception, however, isn’t generally recommended, as it requires very careful, meticulous, and consistent record-keeping.Those who use this method for birth control still experience about a 10% chance of unplanned pregnancy.This method can also be problematic if you’re experiencing periods of high stress, travel, illness, or sleep disturbance, which will alter your body’s basal temperature, as will working nights or drinking alcohol."
"
Learn your period cycle.,
Chart your cycle for at least 8 cycles.,
Predict your first fertile day.,
Predict your last fertile day.,
Know the limits of the method.",How to Know When You Are Ovulating5," This method uses the calendar to count days between cycles and anticipate when your fertile days will be.Most women with regular periods have a 26-32 day cycle, though your cycle could be as short as 23 days, or as long as 35 days.A wide range of possible cycle-lengths are still normal. The first day is the beginning of one period; the last day is the beginning of the next period.
Remember, though, that your period may vary slightly from month to month. You could be on a 28-day cycle for one or two months, and then shift slightly the next month. This is also normal.

, Using a regular calendar, circle the first day of each cycle (the first day of your period).


Count the number of days between each cycle (include the first day when you count).
Keep a running total of the number of days in each cycle. If you find that all of your cycles are shorter than 27 days, don’t use this method as it will give inaccurate results., Find the shortest cycle among all those you’ve tracked, and subtract 18 from that number of days.Write down the resulting number.
Then locate day one of your current cycle on the calendar.
Starting at day one of your current cycle, use the number you wrote down to count forward that number of days. Mark the resulting day with an X.
The day you’ve marked with an X is your first fertile day (not your ovulation day)., Find the longest cycle among all those you’ve tracked, and subtract 11 from that number of days.Write down the resulting number.
Locate day one of your current cycle on the calendar.
Starting at day one of your current cycle, use the number you wrote down to count forward that number of days. Mark the resulting day with an X.
The day you marked with an X is your last fertile day and should be your day of ovulation., This method requires careful and consistent record-keeping and can thus be prone to human error.


Because your monthly cycles may shift, it’s difficult to precisely time your ovulation with this method.
This method is best used in conjunction with other ovulation-tracking methods for a more accurate result.
This method will be quite difficult to use accurately if you experience irregular periods.
This method can also be problematic if you’re experiencing periods of high stress, travel, illness, or sleep disturbance, which will alter your body’s basal temperature, as will working nights or drinking alcohol.Using this method for contraception requires very careful, meticulous, and consistent record-keeping in order to be successful. And even so, those who use this method for birth control still experience a 18% or higher chance of unplanned pregnancy. Thus, this method generally isn’t recommended as a form of birth control."

Take a lot of vitamin D.Vitamin D helps your baby develop strong bones and teeth.,
Eat at least one good source of folic acid every day.,
Avoid certain foods during pregnancy.,
Know that food cravings during pregnancy are normal.,
If you love to substitute sugars use NutraSweet and avoid saccharin.

,
Eat seafood frequently.",How to Eat Right While Pregnant," During pregnancy, the baby gets nourishment from what you eat. Remember that you don't need to eat for two, as your level of activity isn't as high as it was before.;
, Too much vitamin A can be dangerous for the unborn child. If you take extra vitamin tablets, read the label on the container. The National Research Council's recommended dietary allowance for vitamin A during pregnancy is 1,000 retinol equivalents (RE)/day, which is equivalent to 3,300 IU as retinol or 5,000 IU of vitamin A obtained from the typical American diet as a combination of retinol and carotenoids, e.g., beta-carotene. An average balanced diet contains approximately 7,000-8,000 IU of vitamin A derived from different sources. The USRDA (recommended daily allowance) established by the Food and Drug Administration is 8,000 IU/day. Supplementation of 8,000 IU vitamin A (as retinol/retinyl esters) per day should be considered the recommended maximum prior to or during pregnancy. , Eat and drink at least four dairy products and calcium-rich foods a day to help ensure that you are getting 1000-1300 mg of calcium in your daily diet during pregnancy.You can also take calcium tablets to ensure your intake on vitamin D.

, Because the central nervous system begins to develop during the first weeks of pregnancy it's wise to take extra folic acid and continue until 8 weeks after conceiving. This reduces the chance of your baby getting neural tube defects such as spina bifida.

,


Avoid alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol has been linked to premature delivery, intellectual disability, birth defects, and low birth weight in babies.
The Listeria bacteria can be harmful for the baby and can even cause a miscarriage. You can find the bacteria in milk, and raw meat or fish. That means that fillet American, half baked steak or carpaccio, and sushi are out.
Limit caffeine to no more than 300 mg per day. The caffeine content in various drinks depends on the beans or leaves used and how it was prepared. An 8-ounce cup of coffee has about 150 mg of caffeine on average while black tea has typically about 80 mg. A 12-ounce glass of caffeinated soda contains anywhere from 30-60 mg of caffeine. Remember, chocolate contains caffeine -- the amount of caffeine in a chocolate bar is equal to 1/4 cup of coffee.Decrease the total amount of fat you eat to 30% or less of your total daily calories. For a person eating 2000 calories a day, this would be 65 grams of fat or less per day.You see the intestine bacteria Salmonella a lot with pigs and poultry. Handle meat products hygienically and prevent cross contamination. By cooking meats thoroughly, you are killing the bacteria.

, Do you have a huge craving in gherkins, chocolate or something else? You are not the only one! Although there is no widely accepted explanation for food cravings, almost two-thirds of all pregnant women have them. Be smart with it: give in now and then, but don't go crazy because you can spoil your appetite. ,, Studies have shown that eating two servings of seafood every week can help child development and even result in higher IQs .

Focus on fish sources with the lowest mercury levels.,
Eat tuna rarely and in small quantities.,
Know where your fish is coming from.,
Check for proper storage of fish before purchasing.,
Double-check your purchase when you open it.,
Watch out for hidden sources of fish.,
Prepare fish how you prepare other meats.,
Thaw fish in the refrigerator.,
Do not eat fish that has a strong odor.,
Cook all seafood thoroughly.,
Do not cross-contaminate.",How to Eat Fish During Pregnancy," Virtually every type of seafood contains mercury, so look for those with the least mercury. Consume no more than 12 ounces of low-mercury fish per week. While moderate levels of mercury may not severely damage you and your child, you should only allow yourself 3 servings of 6 ounces of it each month. If you are eating at a restaurant, ask the waiter to find out how many ounces are in a fish entrée before consuming the entire filet.Examples of high-mercury fish are swordfish, shark, mackerel, and tuna. It is advisable not to eat mercury-rich fish such as these during pregnancy.. Look out for fish that taste especially metallic, a sign of high mercury levels.
Medium-mercury fish include Chilean sea bass, grouper, cod, Mahi Mahi, monkfish, and snapper.Low-mercury fish are the safest for pregnant women. Some examples are anchovies, butterfish, catfish, flounder, haddock, herring, perch, Pollock, salmon, sardines, sole, tilapia, trout, whitefish, and whiting.;
, Light tuna only has a little over a third of the mercury content of regular albacore tuna. That means it is harmless enough for you to eat, but only in moderation. A 5 ounce can of chunk light tuna can be consumed safely every 3 to 5 days, and Albacore canned tuna is safe to consume once every 9 to 12 days., Mercury poisoning is not only a danger with naturally mercury-rich fish. Man-made environmental hazards such as power plants can contaminate surrounding waters and, as a result, nearby fish. Look for labels that tell you the fish came from a clean water source., Stored fish can contain chemicals or food-borne illnesses that can put you and your developing baby at risk of sickness. Though the fishing industry takes steps to properly ship, store, and clean their product, you should still be cautious. Look for fish packaged with a NOAA label, indicating it has been inspected by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.


Only buy fresh fish that is refrigerated or on fresh ice. Fish must be kept very cold to keep from spoiling, and it should be arranged to allow draining.
Frozen fish should not be purchased if the bag has been opened or broken, or if ice crystals have formed on the fillets. Scales may be duller on frozen fish and the flesh may not be as firm once thawed, but it is typically safe to eat if the integrity of the packaging has been assured.
Avoid refrigerated smoked fish. Examples of smoked fish are salmon, cod and tuna. Fish bought in the refrigerator section may contain listeria, a food-borne illness particularly threatening to pregnant women. Unless you are sure the refrigerated fish has been cooked thoroughly in a casserole or soup dish, buy canned fish instead.

, You may not be able to identify all the warning signs of spoiled fish at the grocery store. When you get home, open the package and make sure everything looks and smells right. This will save you the hassle of having to go to a ‘plan B’ at dinnertime if the fish you purchased is inedible.


Check to make sure the fish eyes are clear and slightly bulging. This indicates fresher fish.
Do not purchase fish with discolored flesh. Green or yellow flesh may indicate that spoiling has begun. Dried or darkened edges also indicate that the fish has been sitting for too long and is no longer fresh.
The flesh of fresh fish should be firm and should spring back into place after you touch it. The skin or scales on a fish filet should be shiny and free of slime. Gills should be bright red.

, Certain recipes may contain fish without advertising its presence. Ask about ingredients in egg salads or pasta dishes, ethnic foods like empanadas or sushi, garnishes like fish eggs, specialty spreads like smoked salmon cream cheese, imitation seafood products, and other foods sources. Most recipes for oil-based salad dressings such as Greek dressing also contain fish. When eating in a restaurant, ask the staff about the fish content of foods like these. , You can prepare fish in much the same way that you prepare chicken or pork. There is not much of a difference in how you prepare fish compared with other types of meat., If fish is left unrefrigerated for too long, it can develop dangerous contaminants that can cause serious illness in pregnant women. If you have frozen fish, do not thaw it by leaving it on the counter. Instead, run the fish under cold water until it is thawed or leave it in the refrigerator overnight.

, Stinky fish can make even healthy people sick, and is especially dangerous for your unborn child. Fish with strong fishy or sour smells, or an odor of ammonia should not be eaten. Though most fish generally emit a unique odor, only prepare fish if it smells mild and fresh.

, Do not consume any fish product that has not been cooked through. Undercooked or raw fish may also transmit food-borne illness that may affect pregnant women more than others. The dangers of inappropriately prepared fish can be avoided with thorough cooking and safe preparation practices.


Most seafood should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 °F (63 °C). If you do not have a food thermometer, cook the fish until the flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork at multiple spots in the fillet.

, If you are preparing fish that was previously raw, do not use any utensils, plates, or serving dishes to eat the fish after cooking. Use clean utensils and plates to serve prepared fish. Also, try to avoid mixing serving containers of fish to prevent the spread of fish-borne illness.

, Don't beat yourself up if you don't get around to planning your meals and snacks or if you forget them on your way out of the house. Try to have a backup plan for really hectic days. You might stop by a fresh salad bar, grab nutritious foods from a convenience shop, or eat healthy snacks that you've stored at your office.


When you do have to eat out, avoid overeating and look for nutritious options. For example, instead of getting a burger and fries from the drive through, order a salad or lean chicken sandwich.
If you don't have many options, don't stress yourself out. Remind yourself that the important thing is that you eat something, especially if you've been experiencing nausea.

Perform the exercises once you have your baby.",How to Do Kegel Exercises for Pregnant Women," Tightening your muscles during urination, if you do it correctly, will stop you from urinating. If you succeed, you have identified the muscles that you need to activate while doing kegel exercise.You only need to practice on the toilet while you're finding the right muscles. Once you've figured out which muscles you need to engage, you can do the exercises anywhere.In fact, you shouldn't continue to do the exercises while urinating, as it can keep urine in your bladder. In turn, that can cause bladder infections.;
, If you can't quite get the hang of it just from urinating, you can also try this trick. Remember that you're also trying to stop yourself from urinating as well. You should be feeling both at the same time., When engaging your pelvic muscles, you shouldn't be using your thighs or stomach to help. You also shouldn't be using your buttocks muscles. Make sure you are just using your pelvic muscles., If you are not sure if you are squeezing the right muscles, try to squeeze your finger with the muscles in question. To use this method, wash your hands first. Put your finger in your vagina. If you feel the pressure around it while trying to tighten the muscles of the pelvis, you are tightening the correct muscles.You can also ask your partner to help you with this step if you can't do it yourself. You can ask your lover to use a finger or his penis to see if he or she can feel you tightening your muscles., While you may have located your kegel muscles while urinating, it is not good to practice Kegel exercises while urinating; it can lead to infections, as noted previously. In addition, it's easier to start with an empty bladder so you don't have an accident while practicing., Kegel exercises are so simple that you can do them while you are in any position, even if you are pregnant. On top of that, no one will know that you are doing them. Find the position that suits you best.You can lie down, sit, or stand; any position is fine to do Kegel exercises., You need to contract your muscles. That means that you won't want to push like you do when you're using the bathroom. Instead, you want to pull up, like you're pulling your muscles into you., Once you learn the right motion, you need hold and repeat it to do the exercise. Start with contracting the muscles for five seconds, and then release for five seconds. Repeat this process five times in a row. , After you've managed five seconds of contraction, move up to 10 seconds. Hold the pelvic muscles for 10 seconds, and then release them for 10 seconds. Repeat five times.You can work up to more repetitions, as many as 20 each time you do the exercises., You should try doing Kegel exercises throughout the day, such as when you wake up, while sitting at the computer or watching TV, and when you go to bed., Don't use your stomach, leg, or buttocks muscles while doing Kegel muscles. It's not bad to engage them, per se; it's just that you are trying to work your pelvic muscles, and using the other muscles means you are not working your pelvic muscles as hard.Put your hand on your stomach and tighten your pelvic floor muscles. If your stomach moves, you must focus more on keeping it from moving while you do these exercises.

, Kegel exercises are not meant to be strenuous and you should not hold your breath while doing them. If you are having a hard time breathing when you do these exercises or can’t help but hold your breath, you may want to consult someone, like your doctor, who can help you do these exercises correctly.

, Doing so will help you to hold in your urine, even when your baby is pressing on your bladder. In addition, having strong muscles will help you when you are in labor.For instance, studies have shown that doing Kegel exercises while pregnant decreases your chances of having complications such as pelvic muscle tearing.In addition, you may spend less time in labor if you strengthen those muscles., You can do exercises anywhere, especially if you're stuck waiting. Try doing them at a red light, or while you're waiting in line at the grocery store. You can even do them at your desk while you're working on other tasks., It is usually recommended that women start Kegel exercises in the first term of their pregnancy; however, you can start whenever you like, even before you are pregnant, as it allows time to strengthen the muscles before they become stressed by the weight of the baby during pregnancy.Starting early also allows you time to work on perfecting your routine. At some point, it will become second nature, so that you do not even really need to think about it when you are emotionally and physically stressed in the latter part of your pregnancy.

, Kegel exercises are not just for when you are pregnant. They still provide benefits after you have your baby. You may need to wait a few days after birth to start them up again; ask your doctor when you can begin again.Doing these exercises will help to prevent the possibility of uncontrolled urination due to sneezing, coughing, laughing, fecal incontinence and hemorrhoids,and they can also make sex more enjoyable.Doing these exercises after you give birth also encourages healing."

Nuts and seeds
Yogurt cups
String cheese
Fruit
Hummus and whole-grain crackers

This will give you the chance to make nutritious improvements.Keep in mind that you should avoid eating lunch or deli meat during pregnancy. Make classic nut and seed butter sandwiches with jam, veggie sandwiches, or egg salad sandwiches.
For example, substitute whole-grain bread for white bread. Add fresh vegetables and choose low-fat cheese.

, If you'll be stuck at a desk or in a meeting where you can't easily eat or snack, pack some soup in a thermos. You'll be able to discreetly sip a nutritious meal that will also fill you up. Try to choose low-sodium soups or soups with lots of vegetables and lean proteins. You can quickly drink:Cream of broccoli soup
Tomato soup
Chili
Gazpacho

Pass on heavily processed foods.,
Avoid eating cold deli meats.,
Skip the sodas.,
Read nutrition labels.",How to Eat on the Go During Pregnancy3," You might be overwhelmed by the number of convenience foods that are available to you at many shops or fast food restaurants.

Frozen meals
Frozen burritos
Fast food

, You might think that stopping into a sub shop for a quick sandwich is a healthy choice. However, the American Pregnancy Association advises women to skip cold deli meats because of the risk for listeria. You can still pop into the sub shop, just choose tuna salad or vegetarian sandwiches.If you really want to eat the deli meat, you can ask the shop to heat the deli meat until it reaches 165 degrees F (75 C). This will kill off the bacteria that could cause listeria.

, Most sodas are high in sugar and calories, but they offer few nutrients. If you're in the habit of grabbing a soda along with a quick bite to eat, start bringing a water bottle instead. Or you could purchase fruit juices, milk, or decaffeinated tea. Since fruit juices are high in sugar, look for juices that are blended with vegetables and don't have added sweeteners.Low-calorie or diet sodas also contain a number of artificial ingredients. Try to limit your intake of these sodas or make them a special treat.

, If you can, choose convenience foods that are minimally processed. Look at the nutrition label and choose products that don't have a long list of preservatives, additives, or artificial flavorings.

Although your boyfriend may also be the child’s parent, he doesn’t get a say in whether you have the baby or not. Accordingly, you should feel confident in your right to give birth, even if you are a minor. Make sure to always tell people that you don’t want an abortion but want to give birth.


For example, if your parents drive you to an abortion clinic, tell the workers there that you don’t want an abortion.
Don’t sign any papers given to you. The clinic can’t perform an abortion without your consent.Refuse to give either verbal or written consent.;
, Now that you know you have a right to give birth, you need to identify how you will protect that right. Basically, you can bring a lawsuit in court and ask the judge for an “injunction” against whoever is pressuring you to get an abortion. A “restraining order” is a type of injunction.


An injunction is a court order to stop doing something. It can also be an order to do something.For example, you can get an injunction ordering your ex-boyfriend to stop harassing you. You can also get an injunction ordering your parents to pay for your medical bills during the pregnancy.
There are penalties if the person under an injunction violates it. For example, your parents might ignore the injunction and not let you use a car. In this situation, you can bring a “contempt” proceeding in court. The judge can fine your parents to get them to comply. In extreme cases, the judge could also put your parents in jail until they agree to abide by the injunction.

, Your parents or your boyfriend may be trying to intimidate you into getting an abortion. You need to document the harassment. It can take many forms, including the following:Taking away your car or preventing you from using transportation.
Preventing you from using the phone. For example, they could have taken your cell phone away or not let you use the landline at home.
Threatening you. You should write down any threats made against you. Write down the date and what was said.

, You will need help filing a lawsuit. Even though you are a minor, you can get an attorney. However, the biggest hurdle will be finding one. Look for legal help in the following places:


The phone book. Attorneys still advertise in the phone book. If you don’t have a phone book at home, then check your school library.
The Internet. More and more, attorneys now advertise online. You can find an attorney near you by typing “your town or city” and “attorney.” Look at each attorney’s website and check whether they practice family law.
Legal aid organizations. These organizations provide free legal services to people with little or no money.You might look for a Christian legal aid organization in your area. A Christian legal aid attorney helped a Texas teen win an injunction against her parents.
Local or state bar associations. Bar associations are organizations made up of attorneys. They often provide referrals to their members. You can find your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association’s website.Court-appointed attorney. You can try to file the lawsuit yourself and then ask the judge for an attorney. Since you are a minor, the judge might appoint an attorney to represent you.
Court personnel at a self-help center. Some courts have self-help centers or family law facilitators. These people can answer basic questions and help you figure out a plan of action.

, The most important thing you can do is get professional legal help, so gather your courage and pick up the phone. Remember also that the attorney must keep your confidences, so be honest when describing your situation. He or she cannot call up your parents and tell them what you talked about.


Not every attorney can represent you. Don’t be discouraged or upset if the attorney declines. Attorneys decline to represent people for a variety of reasons—they are too busy, they don’t know the relevant field of law that well, etc.If the attorney can’t represent you, ask if he or she could recommend someone who would. Often, attorneys are a good source of referrals. The first attorney you speak to might not be able to help, but they can connect you to someone who can.

, Your lawyer will start the lawsuit by filing a “petition” (also called a “complaint”). This is a legal document that contains important information, such as why you are suing and what you want the judge to give you (an injunction). Many courts have printed, “fill in the blank” petitions you can use.Check the court’s website.


As the person filing the lawsuit, you are the “plaintiff” or the “petitioner.” The name depends on the court.
The person you are trying to restrain (your parents, boyfriend, etc.) is the “defendant” or the “respondent.”

, Family courts are special courts designed to handle family law issues. Your attorney will probably file your lawsuit in the family law court for the county where your parents or boyfriend lives.In some situations, the attorney may need to file in regular civil court. He or she will know where to file.

, You need to give the defendant/respondent notice that you have filed the lawsuit. You can provide this notice by sending them a copy of your petition and a “summons,” which your lawyer will get from the court clerk.You can’t personally hand over a copy of the petition and summons to your parents. Instead, you will have to follow your court’s rules for providing notice.
Generally, your lawyer can hire a private process server to make hand delivery for a small fee.
Alternately, your lawyer might pay the county sheriff or constable to hand deliver the papers to the right party.

, If your boyfriend or parents disagree with you, they can file a response to your lawsuit. The summons will tell them how much time they have, which generally varies depending on your state. In Florida, for example, they get 20 days to respond.Your parents don’t really have a legal argument for forcing you to get an abortion. For this reason, you should expect them to argue instead that they aren’t harassing you.
After your parents file their response, they should send your lawyer a copy.

, The judge will hold a hearing to determine whether to issue an injunction. Your attorney will prepare you for the hearing. You may have to testify and explain the harassment or intimidation you have faced.


You have the burden of proving that you will be “irreparably harmed” if you don’t get the injunction.This shouldn’t be difficult. Being coerced into an abortion qualifies as irreparable harm.
The judge should determine whether to grant an injunction at the end of the hearing. If so, your attorney will get a certified copy. Your parents or boyfriend will also have to get a copy so that they will know what the judge has ordered them to do.

, Until you give birth, you should check in regularly with your lawyer. Let him or her know how well your parents are complying with the judge’s order. If they stop complying, then you will need to head back to court to file a contempt proceeding.It is probably best to call your lawyer when you are at school or away from your parents. That way, they can’t monitor what you are saying.

, You will need to show the judge proof that your parents aren’t following the judge’s orders. This type of proof can take many forms, depending on the circumstances. For example:


Get a copy of a cancellation notice if your parents cancel your cell phone.

Obtain a copy of a police report if your boyfriend shows up at your home and starts harassing you.
Write down the dates you wanted to use your car to go to a doctor’s appointment but your parents wouldn’t let you.
Save copies of medical bills your parents refuse to pay.

, You enforce the injunction by filing for “contempt.” The process differs depending on your court. Often, however, the court should have a printed form you can use. Download it from the court’s website. You generally have to tell the judge the following:The date you received the injunction.
The substance of the injunction (what it ordered the other party to do or not do).
How the other party has failed to follow the injunction.

, You have to file the motion for contempt with the same court that gave you an injunction.Your attorney will file it for you. Always make sure to keep a copy for your own records.


Just as you gave your parents or boyfriend a copy of your petition, you also have to notify them of any contempt proceeding. Serve a copy of the motion on the other party, using the same method you used to serve a copy of your petition.

, The judge will need to hold a contempt hearing after your parents or boyfriend responds to your contempt motion. At the hearing, you will have the burden of showing that the other party has not complied with the injunction.You should prepare for the hearing by doing the following:


Talk with your attorney about whether you will testify and what questions the judge will ask.
Show your attorney evidence that your parents have not complied with the injunction. For example, they might have cancelled your cell phone. Get a copy of the cancellation notice.

, Your parents cannot decide to stop supporting their children, even if you give birth. An exception exists only if you get married. As part of the injunction, the court can order them to pay for your medical treatment and continue to let you live in their home.


Legally, your parents have to support you until you are 18.As a practical matter, however, your parents might make living in their home impossible.

, You may have to move out of your home simply to protect your physical or mental health. If so, try to find a safe place to stay instead of in a shelter. Reach out to other family members first, such as your grandparents, aunts or uncles, or adult siblings.

, Your state also provides financial benefits for mothers with children. You should sign up for these benefits as soon as possible. You can find information and helpful links to your state’s benefits by visiting the Benefits.gov website.


Click on your state to read more about their programs., Fathers are legally obligated to support their children, generally until the child reaches age 18. You will have to work with your attorney to get a child support order in place. Your attorney will have to file a form in family law court.


Alternately, you can contact your state’s Child Support Division, which is usually part of the Attorney General’s Office. They can help get a child support order in place.
Under federal law, the father’s parents are legally responsible for paying child support if the father is under 18 and you receive government benefits. They must pay until the father becomes an adult."

Confirm that you are pregnant.,
Write down your feelings.,
Consider all of your options.,
Talk to someone you trust.",How to Discuss an Unplanned Pregnancy With Your Spouse1," Before you run through different scenarios in your head, be 100% sure that you are pregnant. Home pregnancy tests are convenient and very accurate. If your home pregnancy test is positive, visit a health care provider to take a blood test. You can skip the home pregnancy test and go straight to the doctor's office if you would like. In a addition to a missed or lighter period, other pregnancy symptoms include:Breast tenderness
Increased nipple sensitivity
Nausea or vomiting
Being unusually tired
Feeling more emotional
Cramps
Bloating;
, You experience many emotions when you find out that you are pregnant. Identifying how you feel about your pregnancy is helpful for both you and your spouse. You need to be able to let your spouse know how you feel. You will not be able to communicate that information if you have taken the time to consider your feelings.Get in a comfortable, quiet area so you can think and process your feelings.
You may feel excited, surprised, confident, peaceful, happy, strong, or alive.
You may also feel disappointed, sad, guilty, worried, confused, or embarrassed.
It is not uncommon to feel conflicting emotions such as being both scared, worried, and excited. You also may feel numb or uncertain about your feelings all together.

, You have three options when you become pregnant: continue with the pregnancy, terminate the pregnancy, or give the baby up for adoption. Make a chart for each option that you are considering and list the positive and negatives of each. Think about how your life would be if you chose each option. Think about what is best for you, your spouse, and your child.""The idea of having an abortion makes me feel ___ because ___ and I'm thinking ___.""
""The idea of continuing my pregnancy and placing my child for adoption makes me feel___ because ___ and I'm thinking ___.""
The idea of having a child right now makes me feel ____ because ____ and I'm thinking ___.""

, It may be helpful to speak with a close friend, family member, or counselor before you talk to your spouse. This person can help support you, comfort you, and offer you advice. A professional counselor can also advise you about approaching your spouse.


Your spouse may not be happy that you talked to someone else before you talked to them. If you talk to a friend or family member, ask them to keep the conversation just between the two of you.
Look for a therapist that specializes in pregnancy counseling."

Ask about potential risks involved with prenatal tests.,
Discuss whether the test can tell you what you want to know.,
Ask about prenatal test accuracy.,
Ask about all available prenatal test options.",How to Decide if You Should Have a Prenatal Test1," Although prenatal tests may offer valuable information about the health of your baby, they also carry some risk to you and the baby.


Some tests have potential side effects or risks that may involve infection, a placental tear, and even miscarriage. Discuss the likelihood and severity of risks for each test and whether you may have any conditions that put you at a higher risk of these dangers.;
, Not every prenatal test can give you the same amount and quality of information.


Get a list of all the possible conditions the test can detect. If it is unable to tell you information about the specific condition you are interested in, you may want to forego the risk of the test.

, Not every test is equally capable of accurately predicting the presence or absence of certain diseases.


In some cases, genetic markers may be present for certain diseases that may manifest only if certain other conditions are present. Other conditions, such as Down syndrome, may be very mild to very severe, but a prenatal test may not be able to give you sufficient information to gauge the likely severity of the condition.

, Some options are much less invasive and risky than others, and some give different types of information than others.


If you are concerned about tests that require samples of amniotic fluid or tissue, ask a health professional what non-invasive options for testing might give you similar information about your baby’s health, such as ultrasounds or parental genetic testing.

"
Weigh the risks of any pre-existing health conditions you might have.,
Ask your doctor whether the position of the baby or placenta requires a C-section.,
Ask your doctor if you or the baby have a physical condition that would make a vaginal birth difficult.,
Assess whether your baby is developing properly.",How to Decide Whether to Have a C Section1," There are some health conditions that can make it safer for you or safer for your baby if you have a C-section. For this reason it is extremely important that your doctor know your complete medical history. Conditions that might lead the doctor to advise a C-section include:If you have a heart problem that could make going through a vaginal delivery dangerous for you.
If you have high blood pressure that makes it important that the child be delivered immediately. High blood pressure related to a pregnancy is called pre-eclampsia.
If y ou have an infection that could be transmitted to your child during a vaginal birth. Examples include genital herpes and HIV/AIDS.;
, Sometimes the baby or the placenta is located in the uterus in ways that makes a vaginal birth more risky. Under these circumstances, the doctor may advise against a natural birth.If your baby is breech or transverse, a C-section may be safer. A breech baby is positioned so that the feet or bottom is born first. A transverse baby is lying in the uterus so that it enters the birth canal sideways with its side or shoulder first. Mothers carrying more than one baby often have one that is not in the normal head-first position.
If you have two or more babies that share a placenta, you may need a C-section to prevent one of them from not getting enough oxygen during birth.
If you have placenta previa, a C-section might be necessary. Placenta previa occurs when the placenta covers your cervix. Because the baby must pass through the cervix to be born, it is dangerous for it to be covered by the placenta.
You may also need a C-section if the umbilical cord, through which the baby gets oxygen and nutrients, is squeezed. This can happen if part of the cord goes through the birth canal before the baby. This is dangerous because it means that the oxygen supply to the baby during birth may be restricted.

, Occasionally vaginal deliveries are not possible due to mechanical reasons. These can include:You have a fractured pelvis or an unusually small pelvis.
You have a fibroid that is in your birth canal which would prevent the baby from fitting through.
Your baby has an unusually large head.
The baby has an anomaly like omphalocele or gastroschisis (the baby's intestine or other abdominal organs are outside of the body), or cystic hygroma (cysts on the baby's head or neck), which would make a vaginal birth dangerous for them.
You are in labor with strong contractions, but your cervix is not opening to allow the baby through.
The doctor has tried to induce labor, but it was ineffective.
You had a prior C-section and the incision that was made into the uterus makes you more vulnerable for a ruptured uterus. This is called a ""classical C-section."" This is not the case for all women who have had a prior C-section. Many do have successful natural births.

, If your baby is not getting enough nutrients and oxygen through the umbilical cord, it may not grow and develop at the proper rate. The doctor will track your baby’s development and evaluate whether a C-section is necessary by:Measuring the your baby’s heartbeat
Measuring your baby's growth by measuring the size of the uterus from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus. If this measurement is not normal for your gestational weeks, then an ultrasound is used to measure the baby.
Checking the blood flow to the baby with a Doppler ultrasound
Measuring your baby’s growth trajectory in the ultrasound images

Share your list of pros and cons with your spouse. This may be easier than relying on your memory and how you feel in the moment.
Avoid starting the conversation with a negative tone. For example, do not say, ""I have some bad news for you..."" Try something more positive like, ""I appreciate you and the life that we are building together. We are having a new addition to our family.""
Do not hold anything back. If you do not want to continue with the pregnancy or are unsure about becoming a parent right now, your spouse needs to know that.

, Your spouse may be feel many of the same emotions that you do. Excitement, fear, nervousness, confusion are all possible. Your spouse also may feel more like a support person and not an equal decision maker because you are the one carrying the baby.Do not be alarmed by any reaction your spouse has. You have been working through your feelings already; allow your spouse to do the same.
If your spouse has a negative reaction, try not to take it personally. Remember that your spouse is emotional and the reaction may not accurately reflect how your spouse feels about you or your child.
If the discussion becomes too heated or comes to a stand still, take a break and revisit it later.

, You and your spouse are in this together. Ask your spouse how they feel about the pregnancy? What options would they like to explore? Are they ready to become a parent? Allow your spouse to communicate and do not interrupt them.


Be empathetic and consider your spouse's point of view.
Avoid words like ""you should,"" or ""why don't you"" when you talk and ask questions. Instead say things like ""I'm thinking,"" or ""I would like to.""
It may be helpful to have your spouse write down the pros and cons and emotions they are experiencing. This can help move the conversation forward.

Talk about your finances.,
Discuss how a child will impact your relationship.,
Get the support of your family and friends.",How to Discuss an Unplanned Pregnancy With Your Spouse3," Children are expensive. They need food, clothes, diapers, health care, and require additional space. Many couples worry about how they can afford a baby that they were not expecting. Look at your current financial situation and see where you can cut back and save some money. You and your spouse can also get expert advice from a financial advisor.
Visit the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion website to calculate the cost of raising a child for the first year., Becoming parents will change the relationship between you and your spouse. Sleep deprivation, decreased intimacy, and new responsibilities are the biggest areas that your relationship will change.Talk with your spouse about how you two plan to handle these aspects of your relationship and create realistic expectations.


If you plan to keep the baby, talk about how you will divvy up the responsibilities (e.g. feeding, getting the baby ready before work, staying at home with the baby, parental leave, etc.)
Intimacy usually decreases after you have a baby. Talk with your spouse about how you will handle this.

, You and your spouse will need support no matter what decision you make. Your family and friends can help you every step of the way. Let them know that you are pregnant and how you and your spouse are feeling. You are definitely not the only couple that has experienced an unplanned pregnancy.


Let your support system know what you need. Be clear if you want advice or if you just need to vent.If you do plan to keep the baby, you will already have a support system in place. You will definitely need help once the baby arrives.

Consider your age and personal health.,
Consider family medical history.,
Get yourself and your partner genetic testing.",How to Decide if You Should Have a Prenatal Test2," If you are in your late 30s or 40s, the likelihood of having a child with a disability or disorder increases significantly. If you know early on, you can research the disability to be prepared, or decide not to keep the baby if you can't handle it (e.g. putting it up for adoption).


In addition to being at higher risk of complications and premature delivery with increasing maternal age, you are more likely to give birth to a baby with Down syndrome or certain disabilities.
If you personally have a genetic disability, your child may be more likely to have the same condition.

, Make a list of genetic conditions found in blood relatives both in your family and that of your partner.


If you are very concerned about your baby’s risk of having the a particular condition, discuss family genetics with a genetic counselor or physician prior to testing; some conditions may only affect one gender or may be recessive, which can significantly reduce your child’s chance of having the disease.

, In many cases, by simply examining both parents with a simple blood test, you can check for a wide range of conditions your baby could potentially have.


Many genetic conditions are recessive in nature and could only manifest in the baby if both parents are carriers and pass the recessive gene to the baby.
Remember that not all conditions are based on the parents’ genetics, and that genetic testing of both parents will not tell you whether the baby may have a developmental condition or chromosomal problem.

Determine whether it would change your decision to have the baby.,
Consider how the results may impact your pregnancy.,
Consider how the results may affect your emotional health.",How to Decide if You Should Have a Prenatal Test3," Some women may choose not to continue with the pregnancy after receiving bad news on a prenatal test. Decide whether you are convinced that you want the baby regardless of test results prior to having a prenatal test.

, Knowing the results of a prenatal test in advance may allow you to alter the way you eat or the frequency of your prenatal medical visits if medical professionals believe it will help prevent further risk to the baby.


In some cases, prenatal surgery or transfusions may be performed to reduce or prevent certain genetic or developmental problems.
If the test results indicate a genetic disorder or developmental disability, knowing in advance about a birth defect or condition will allow you to prepare during your pregnancy for higher medical or education expenses than anticipated, and not having to wonder may help you adjust to the idea of raising a child with a disability.

, In some cases, knowing what to expect in terms of health for your baby may put you at ease and reduce any anxieties, regardless of the test results. In others, knowing the results may only cause unnecessary stress, indecision, less effective mother-baby bonding, and even prenatal depression.


If a genetics counselor believes you to be at low risk of having a child with a problem detectable by prenatal testing, you may wish to avoid the test altogether.
If you are at high risk of having a baby with a detectable problem or if you believe you would prefer to receive difficult news during pregnancy instead of after your baby has arrived, you may wish to have the test to allow you time to prepare yourself emotionally and financially.

Ask your doctor whether a C-section will be risky for your baby.,
Evaluate the risks for you.,
Don’t get a C-section for convenience.",How to Decide Whether to Have a C Section2," Many babies are born without complications during a C-section; however, there are risks that should be considered. These include:An injury during surgery. This does not happen often, but it is possible that the baby could be injured by the surgical instruments as the doctor cuts through the uterus. Ask your doctor if this is likely to be a significant risk for your baby. Minor cuts occur in about 2% of C-sections.
Transient tachypnea. This occurs when the baby’s breathing rate is too fast for the first several days of life. It is more likely after a C-section. If your baby may be having trouble breathing, call emergency responders immediately.
Respiratory distress. Babies born by C-section before 39 weeks old are more likely to have lungs that are not yet fully mature. This puts them at a higher risk for breathing problems.

, Women who undergo a C-section have a longer recovery after birth than women who give birth vaginally. You are also at a higher risk of complications, including:Excessive bleeding. Women who undergo C-sections often lose more blood than women undergoing vaginal deliveries.
An injury during the surgery. Occasionally the bladder or another nearby organ may be nicked when the doctor cuts through the abdominal wall. If this occurs the doctor may need to do additional surgery to repair the injury. If you have had prior C-sections, ask your doctor about these risks. They increase as the number of C-sections you’ve had increase.
A bad reaction to the anesthesia. Tell your doctor if you have previously had any problems with anesthesia. In addition, if you experience bad headaches when you sit up or stand after the delivery, tell your doctor. This may be a reaction to the anesthesia.
Blood clots. You are at a higher risk for blood clots in your legs or pelvic organs after a C-section than after a vaginal birth. Ask your doctor what they recommend for preventing this. Your doctor may also recommend that you walk as soon as possible after the birth to help prevent clotting.
An infection. The most common areas for infections are the incision or in the uterus. Monitor your incision for signs of infection such as swelling, redness, increasing pain, and discharge coming from the wound. Go to the emergency room if you have signs of a uterine infection, such as a fever, pain in your uterus, or a bad smelling discharge coming from your vagina.

, Some people request a C-section because they want to be able to choose a date that is convenient. This is not recommended, both for your health and for the health of your baby. In addition, if you plan to have more children, you would have a higher risk of complications during future pregnancies. This may include:Problems with the placenta
Risk of the scar rupturing during a future vaginal birth

Wash your face daily.,
Use a topical acne product.,
Avoid prescription acne medications.,
Keep your hair clean.,
Avoid picking at bumps.",How to Deal with Skin Problems During Pregnancy1," Your skin may become oily due to hormonal changes during your pregnancy. To help prevent your pores getting blocked and turning into acne, wash your face twice each day. Use a mild cleanser and warm water.You can use cleansers containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.;
, An acne-fighting product may help with your breakouts. Products that are safe to use during pregnancy can contain benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid. Other acne fighting ingredients should be discussed with your doctor.You can try creams, pads, and spot treatments.

, Most prescription medications for treating acne are not recommended for pregnant women. Many can cause birth defects. Even topical retinoids that you don’t ingest may pose a danger. Talk to your doctor about safe alternatives to help with your acne.Examples of medications you should avoid include hormonal therapy, isotretinoin, oral tetracyclines, and topical retinoids.

, The oils in your hair can block your pores and cause breakouts, especially if you have oily hair. Wash your hair often if you are getting breakouts. If you have oily hair, wash it every day. For moderately oily hair, wash at least every other day.Pull your hair back away from your face so that product and oils don’t get on your skin.

, Picking at bumps, squeezing heads, or pulling off scabs can cause your face to be even more irritated. The bumps can get infected if you continually pick at them. They also can leave scars if you pop them or pull off scabs."

Keep turning the body.,
Cut down on shear.,
Buy a special mattress.,
Provide proper nutrition.,
Stay hydrated.,
Identify early signs of bed sores.",How to Prevent Bed Sores1," When you are taking care of a bedridden individual, make sure you move the body every two hours. You don't have to move him to another room or piece of furniture, but the position should be different enough that the same area of the body is not under pressure.


For example, turn the patient from the right side to the left. You can also use a pillow to prop him up.
If you are stuck in bed yourself, you can invest in a trapeze bar and reposition yourself. This only works if you are physically strong enough to use such a device.
If the patient has certain kinds of injuries, such as those to the spinal cord, make sure he is moved in such a way as to not cause more injury.;
, One way that bed sores develop is through pressure on the skin due to sliding. The patient may lose traction when she is elevated, which causes the bedding and the skin to move in opposite directions. For example, the skin of the tailbone may stay in place while the body slides down the bed. The pressure on the skin can cause bed sores over time.


When lying down, make sure the bed is not elevated more than 30 degrees as to avoid sliding and friction.
If the patient can sit all the way up, this will more than likely not occur., There are special mattresses on the market that can reduce the amount of pressure put on the body. This will help the patient avoid having any one area as a focus of pressure. You can also buy a air-filled or water filled mattress to help reduce the pressure on the patient's body. Look for these at a medical supply store so you can purchase a medical-grade mattress for this purpose.


If you are unsure on which to buy, ask your doctor for recommendations for the particular situation.
You can also use a mattress pad or cushions to help protect the bony areas of the patient., Malnutrition can contribute to the development of bed sores.This can develop especially quickly in patient's who are unable to take sufficient calories orally and/or willingly. Make sure the patient eats balanced meals of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.


Make sure you check the dietary restriction of any patient you deal with. Each patient is assessed individually for his specific nutritional needs. , To keep the skin of the patient healthy, make sure that she stays hydrated. If you are not sure how much water she should have, ask the doctor to advise you based on the patient's specific needs. Different illnesses and conditions require different hydration needs.


You can also use juice to stay hydrated and keep up nutrition as well., Bed sores happen over a period of time. Early signs can include: non-blanching erythema or a purple or maroon localized area of discolored, intact skin, which may be painful, firm, mushy, boggy, or a different temperature than adjacent tissue.This indicates early stage of tissue damage or probable wound formation."

Have a Cesarean delivery if necessary.,
Prolong the pregnancy with medications if necessary.",How to Deal With Pre Eclampsia," If you are unsure whether your symptoms are just discomfort associated with being pregnant or signs of pre-eclampsia, contact your doctor to see if you should get checked. Signs of pre-eclampsia can include:Headaches
Shortness of breath
Blurred vision, loss of vision, light sensitivity or other vision changes
Nausea and/or vomiting
Abdominal pain on your right side under your ribs
A decrease in urination;
, Pre-eclampsia can range from mild to severe. If you are experiencing severe symptoms, then it is important to seek immediate medical care. Call your doctor or go to an emergency room right away if you notice a sudden increase in your symptoms or if you are having:severe headaches
blurry vision
intense abdominal pain
difficulty breathing or severe shortness of breath

, Most often women with pre-eclampsia experience a sudden spike in their blood pressure, but it can also increase slowly. Not all women who have high blood pressure feel other symptoms. Because of this it is important for your doctor to monitor your blood pressure regularly.Your blood pressure should be below 140/90 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury).
If it is higher for more than four hours when you are at rest, this is cause for concern.

, The doctor will likely do additional tests to check the health of your other organs and your baby. This may involve:Blood tests. This will enable the doctors to check how well your liver and kidneys are working. The doctors will also likely evaluate whether your blood has the right platelet count so that your blood clots properly.

Urine analyses. This will measure whether you have too much protein in your urine. This may involve either a single sample or repeated sampling over 24 hours.

An ultrasound. During an ultrasound, the doctor uses sound waves that are higher than we can hear to create an image of the baby in your womb. It does not hurt and is not dangerous for you or the baby. The doctor will be able to see if the baby is developing properly by measuring the baby’s size and the amount of amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby.

A nonstress test. During this test the doctor will measure your baby’s heart beat as it moves.

A biophysical test. During this test, the doctor may do an ultrasound at the same time as the nonstress test or at a separate time. The biophysical test uses an ultrasound to detect amniotic fluid levels, fetal movement, tone, and breathing.

, If you are diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, there are several different combinations of symptoms that may have produced the diagnosis. Your doctor will have detected high blood pressure and at least one of the following symptoms:Protein in your urine. The doctor may refer to this as proteinuria.
Other signs of kidney malfunction
Decreased liver function
Not enough platelets in your blood
Pulmonary edema. This occurs when your lungs fill with fluid.
Vision problems
Headaches that are new or different than usual.

, If you have preeclampsia, this is dangerous for both you and the baby. You are at risk of:Seizures
Stroke
Severe bleeding
Placental abruption

, Babies born before 37 weeks are considered premature. They are at an increased risk of breathing problems and bleeding. If possible, your doctor may try to prolong your pregnancy to get you closer to the 37 week mark. However, if it is necessary to deliver your baby before 37 weeks, your doctor may recommend a steroid injection.A steroid injection to help the lungs develop faster if your baby is born at 34 weeks or younger. However, it may take 24 to 48 hours to give the steroids time to take effect.

, If you get pre-eclampsia towards the end of your pregnancy, the doctor may feel that the safest option for you and your baby is to induce pregnancy. The doctor will likely examine your cervix to determine if it is preparing for delivery. If so it will:Start to open. The doctor will refer to this as dilating.
Get thinner. The doctor may call this effacing.
Soften. The doctor may say that your cervix is ripening.

, The doctor may want you to stay in the hospital to be watched until your delivery. If the baby is not yet mature enough to be born or requires medication to speed up lung development, you may need constant monitoring during this time. The doctor may request:Regular monitoring of your blood pressure to make sure it does not increase further
Regular urine analyses to evaluate any changes in the protein levels in your urine
Blood tests to check for damage to your kidneys or liver
Monitoring the baby’s heart rate for signs of distress
Ultrasound checks to evaluate the baby’s growth and activity levels

, Doctors used to tell women to stay in bed, but since then research has shown that it may not be helpful. In addition, it may increase the women’s risk of:Blood clots due to reduced activity levels
Financial difficulties due to being unable to work
Disruption of her social life and social support

, Labor will need to be induced in a pre-eclampsia pregnancy past 37 weeks of gestation. At this point your baby should be fully developed and ready to live outside the womb. Delivering at this time should alleviate the pre-eclampsia and may prevent other complications. If the doctor induces delivery, he or she may:Do a membrane sweep. During this procedure the doctor uses a finger to separate the amniotic sac from the cervix. It will stimulate your body to release hormones which may start labor. It may be a little uncomfortable or cause some bleeding.

Insert a medication into your vagina. This may be in the form of a tablet or gel. This will help your cervix to soften. It may take up to 24 hours for labor to start. If this does not work you may be given another dose or an intravenous hormone drip.

Administer anticonvulsant medications during labor if necessary. For example, if you have severe pre-eclampsia, then you may receive magnesium sulfate during labor to help prevent seizures.However, magnesium sulfate is not necessary if your pre-eclampsia is mild.

, If your symptoms are very severe, it may be necessary for you to have an emergency C-section (Cesarean delivery). This procedure requires that the doctor make an incision through your abdomen wall and into the uterus so that they baby can be removed from the uterus without being delivered vaginally.This would be done if it is too dangerous for you or the baby to continue the pregnancy.
If necessary, the doctors may give you magnesium sulfate to keep you from having seizures during the procedure.

, Medications would combat the symptoms and may enable the pregnancy to continue for a bit longer. This would give the baby more time to mature in the womb. If you do take medications, talk to your doctor about whether they may cause harm to your baby. Possible medications include:Blood pressure medications. If your blood pressure is borderline, 140/90 m Hg, you may not be prescribed medications. But if it is dangerous or you or the baby, the doctor may feel it is necessary to control your blood pressure and reduce your risk of a stroke. The medication labetalol is licensed to be used in women with high blood pressure. Other medications that are not licensed for pregnant women but sometimes prescribed include nifedipine or methyldopa. If you have been prescribed either of these, be sure to discuss the risks to you and your baby with your doctor.

Corticosteroids. These medications can be used to stimulate lung maturation in your baby in 1-2 days. This may be necessary if your baby will have to be born premature. In addition, these medications may be used to reduce symptoms due to problems with your liver or platelets.

Anticonvulsant medications. These medications would be prescribed if your risk of having a seizure is high or if you have already had seizures.

To help with this, use unscented lotion on your belly to keep it moisturized. If it is itching a lot, try anti-itch creams or calamine lotion., Tight, uncomfortable clothing may cause more itching. Uncomfortable clothing may also irritate your skin more than it already is. To help alleviate some of the itching, wear loose clothing that is soft and gentle on your skin.Try cotton and other natural fibers that breathe.

, Take a bath in lukewarm water. Don’t make the water too hot because that could irritate the affected areas. Place a cool compress on the itchy area to give some relief. You can also try using wet clothes on the irritated skin.Don’t use soap when you wash because that may cause more irritation.

, Itching that is accompanied by other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, dark urine, gray bowel movements, and jaundice, may be indicative of a more serious condition. These symptoms may be due to obstetric cholestasis, which is a liver condition.This condition occurs during the third trimester.
If you experience any of these symptoms, go see your doctor immediately.

, Prurigo is a condition that causes small bumps that can itch badly. These bumps may pop up at any point during the pregnancy. If lotion doesn’t help, your doctor may prescribe topical medication like emollients and steroids, along with oral antihistamines.If you have obstetric cholestasis, the doctor may prescribe a medication to help reduce the bile in your blood.

Protect your face from the sun.,
Stay hydrated.,
Use lotion to help prevent stretch marks.,
Avoid standing for long periods.,
Exercise.,
Have skin tags surgically removed.,
Be patient.",How to Deal with Skin Problems During Pregnancy3," Many pregnant women get “mask of pregnancy,” also known as melasma and chloasma. This condition makes dark spots appear on your face, most commonly the forehead and cheeks. To help reduce your risk of this, wear at least an SPF 15 sunscreen.You should also wear a hat to help keep the sun off your face.

, Drinking plenty of water during your pregnancy can help keep your skin looking healthy. Drinking water hydrates the skin, which helps reduce itchiness due to dryness. Staying hydrated may also help reduce the chances of acne.Drink eight 8-ounce glasses each day.

, Stretch marks commonly occur on the abdomen, breasts, thighs, and buttocks during pregnancy. Lotions containing vitamin E and alpha hydroxy acids may help prevent stretch marks in these areas.In many cases, stretch marks cannot be prevented, but they often fade after you give birth.

, Standing for long periods may lead to an increased risk of varicose veins. While you may not be able to completely prevent them from occurring, taking breaks when you have to stand may cause less varicose veins.Try moving around a bit to get the blood flowing in your legs.

, Exercising may help with a few different skin problems during pregnancy. Exercise may help reduce the risk of getting stretch marks by helping you control your weight.Exercise may also help reduce the severity of varicose veins.Try light exercise, like walking, swimming, or riding an exercise bike.
Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercise program while pregnant.

, If you develop skin tags during your pregnancy, a doctor may remove them for you. They can use a scalpel or scissors to remove them. Another removal method is using an electric current to burn off the skin tag.Many skin tags will go away after you give birth.

, Many skin changes that occur during pregnancy are normal and will clear up after you give birth. If you have concerns about your condition, talk to your doctor. However, in many cases, being patient until after you give birth will cause you less stress."

Watch for signs of infection.,
Bandage the sore.,
Use particular cleaning products.,
Use antibiotics.",How to Prevent Bed Sores2," Once bed sores have been identified, they should be watched for signs of infection. This includes fever, areas of redness along the border of the ulcer sore, drainage of pus, and a soft texture beneath the skin indicating that the tissue beneath is likely filled with pus or rotting away., Once infection in identified, ask the patient's doctor for appropriate treatment methods. Typically, the doctor will advise tight gauze moistened with normal saline. The gauze should be removed one to two times daily. This action removes dead skin, which allows healthy tissue to form and the wound to heal. Depending on the size of the ulcer, healing will take around four to six weeks.


Dry gauze should be packed on top of it. The skin around the sores should not be wet like the wound.The type of dressing will depend on the size and depth of the of the wound and the amount of drainage.Talk to the doctor about the best dressing and technique to use for the particular patient.

, Never use hydrogen peroxide or betadine on bed sores to clean the healing skin. Instead, always use mild soap and warm water to clean the wound. If that is not possible, use a mild no-wash cleanser to clean the area.The doctor may order an enzymatic or chemical dead skin removal solution to facilitate healing. The removal of the dead skin through surgical means can be necessary in many cases if there is a lot of dead tissue.Other methods for cleaning bed sores include enzymatic agents, maggots, or high-pressure water jets., If there is infection that sets into the sores, a systemic antibiotics might be prescribed. This will help heal the infection and the skin as well. Intravenous antibiotics may be necessary if a bone infection is present, which is not uncommon in bed sores on the pelvic region."

Learn the risk factors.,
Look for the causes.,
Recognize the stages of bed sores.",How to Prevent Bed Sores3," Patients at risk are those who have limited mobility and spend a great deal of time in bed or sitting. This can be at home, in a nursing home, a hospital, or in a retirement home. The causes for being bedridden include spinal cord injuries, strokes, progressive neurological disease, fractures, comas, and those in intensive care units (ICU).


Around 70% of bed sores occur in patients over the age of 65. The remainder occur in younger patients who suffer from issues that leave them in the bed., Bed sores develop from the abuse of the skin due to immobility, as well as prolonged exposure to moisture. Bed sores lead to a decreased quality of life as well as increased mortality and morbidity.They are localized injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, usually overlying a bony prominence. This includes the bottom, the ankles, the heels, or the hip bones. However, they can occur at the site where a patient is hooked to a ventilator and are constantly rubbed against by the equipment or tubing.


They develop due to unrelenting pressure to the area, which blocks the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the affected area, causing cell death.This can happen despite a caregiver's best attempt at preventing them. However, some cases develop due to inattention and elder abuse.Elder abuse is a public health concern despite being grossly under-reported and under-detected.

, The severity of bed sores ranges from stage I to stage IV. The state of the bed sore affects the health of the patient and changes the kind of treatment necessary.


Stage I is when the sore is an area of redness over a bony prominence, that will not turn pale when pressed with your finger. The redness will not go away or get better.Stage II entails the loss of partial skin thickness to the outermost layer of skin. Often a shallow wound with a pink-red base will occur at the site with a clear fluid filled blister overlying this shallow wound.Stage III consists of a wound with total loss of the thickness to the outer layer of skin, which cuts into the underlying layer of skin. The wound is not too severe, does not continue into the muscle layers and bone, and the tendons and muscles are not exposed.
Stage IV is when all the outer and inner layers of skin are gone, exposing the underlying muscle layers. The bones, tendons, and muscles may be exposed. If there is no underlying fat in the area, the sores, such as those on the ears or nose that occur from respiratory devices, are classified stage IV as well."

The doctor will also take down your medical history, including information about your period, and run both urine and blood tests to make sure you're healthy.They will also want to know what medications you're on, in case any of them shouldn't be taken while you're pregnant., They will also want to conduct a physical exam, including doing a Pap smear to check for any disease-related problems. They'll also do things like check your blood pressure and weigh you.To determine how many weeks pregnant you are, the doctor will check the size of your uterus, usually by pressing on your abdomen. From that information, they will have a general idea how far along you are., Another way to check how many weeks pregnant you are is to have an ultrasound. However, you usually don't have an ultrasound until you're about 10 to 13 weeks pregnant (plus 6 days). When you have an ultrasound, the sonographer will measure your baby, giving you a better estimation of how far along you are."

Talk to your doctor about termination in extremely serious cases.",How to Deal with Hyperemesis Gravidarum," If you have morning sickness (and 70-80% of all pregnant women do), pay attention to the severity of your symptoms and the number of times per day that you are vomiting.


As long as you are keeping some food and fluids down and vomiting only a few times a day, you probably have garden-variety morning sickness. Mention it to your doctor and read up on coping strategies, but know that morning sickness is normal and will probably pass by the end of the first trimester.;
, It’s fine if you don’t gain much weight in your first trimester; in fact, because of morning sickness, many women lose a few pounds (a trend that reverses quickly in the second trimester). But if you lose more than five pounds or so, your doctor may want to evaluate you for hyperemesis gravidarum.


Weight checks should be a part of your routine prenatal care. If your nausea and vomiting get very severe, though, you should also weigh yourself at home. That way, you can make an appointment with your doctor if your weight drops suddenly between scheduled check-ups.

, If you are not keeping fluids down, the biggest immediate concern is dehydration. See your doctor immediately if you are vomiting a lot and you notice any of the following symptoms:


dry mouth and swollen tongue
severe weakness
dizziness or lightheadedness
fainting
confusion
decreased urine output

, If you think you have hyperemesis gravidarum, you need to see your obstetrician as soon as possible, so make an appointment if you do not have a regular check-up scheduled very soon. Explain your symptoms to your doctor as clearly as you can, and in as much detail as possible – how much you eating and drinking, what percentage of the day you feel nauseated, how many times per day you are vomiting.

, Your obstetrician should evaluate your vital signs and general appearance, and he or she should look for evidence of dehydration. Many women with hyperemesis gravidarum appear generally healthy, though, so this examination is not sufficient to rule out the condition.

, Your doctor will probably want to check your blood and urine to help pin down a diagnosis. Have these tests as soon as possible, as they can reveal both the presence of hyperemesis gravidarum and any complications that are developing because of the condition.

, If you are vomiting more than four times a day, losing significant weight, or experiencing symptoms of dehydration, or if your lab tests reveal problems related to your nausea and vomiting, your doctor may diagnose you with hyperemesis gravidarum.

, If you have hyperemesis gravidarum, it’s best not to wait too long between meals (an empty stomach can make your symptoms worse) or eat too much at one sitting (an overly full stomach will probably induce vomiting). Instead, eat small amounts of bland foods at regular intervals.

, Pregnancy taxes your body even under normal circumstances. If you have hyperemesis gravidarum, your body will be seriously drained. Get as much rest as possible.

, If your case is not too severe, your doctor may let you try to treat your hyperemesis gravidarum at home. Possible home remedies include:


pressure-point wristbands (like those used for motion sickness)
vitamin B6 supplements

, If your condition is serious enough to create health problems for you or your baby, your doctor may recommend that you take medications to manage your nausea. Discuss the potential risks and benefits of each medication with your obstetrician – some drugs are safer than others during pregnancy – and follow his or her directions exactly.

, If you are dehydrated, your obstetrician may admit you to the hospital, where you can receive fluids through an IV.

, If your symptoms are very severe, you may need more than just fluids. Your obstetrician may admit you to the hospital for something called total parenteral nutrition (TPN), in which your nutrients are given by IV. For serious cases of hyperemesis gravidarum, this may be necessary both for your health and for the health of your baby.

, If your symptoms are concerning, your doctor may order tests, including ultrasounds, to check on the development of your baby. Try not to worry too much about these tests. In most cases of hyperemesis gravidarum, the baby is not adversely affected.

, In a very, very small percentage of cases, the hyperemesis gravidarum becomes so intense as to be potentially life-threatening for the mother. In these cases, you and your doctor may consider terminating the pregnancy.

Give each child a bath before bed.,
Read to both of your children before bed.,
Avoid computers and television one hour before bedtime.",How to Manage Two Kids with Different Sleep Schedules1," Kids feel more secure and safe when they have structure in their daily lives, including bedtime routines. Predictable times for bed each night have been shown to lead to better sleep.Having a solid routine about bedtime will help to prevent whining or bickering. You can stand your ground, and remind them of what has already been discussed.
Make sure to stick to the set bedtime for each child as much as possible.;
, Each child is unique, including their sleep habits. Focus on how to make each of your children feel special and respected. You can help each child brush their teeth and read them a story. This will help them learn to naturally wind-down before bedtime.


Make sure to check in with your children, particularly if they are older, about what is working for their sleep schedule and what's not. Listen to what might be bothering them from that day. They may be able to sleep easier when you connect with them in the evenings.

Consider reading to both children at the same time. Even if one child is a more advanced reader than the other, pick a book that you think they may both enjoy.

, Electronic devices shortly before bed make it more difficult to wind down and prepare your mind for rest. Televisions, phones, video games, and computers often increase cognitive stimulation. This can impact your child's melatonin (sleep hormones).Teach your children to put away devices shortly before bed. Ideally, if they are having bath time and reading shortly before bed, then this can help to divert their attention away from the TV or video games.
Lead by example. Your children are more likely to follow what you say if you demonstrate how you're putting away your devices. Preparing your children for bedtime should involve minimal distractions.

Make sure your bedroom is sleep-friendly.,
Engage in relaxation techniques.,
Stay away from stimulants and alcohol before bed.,
Stay off your computer and phone.,
Find a way to wind down.",How to Make Yourself Sleepy1," If you're having trouble falling asleep at night, make sure your bedroom is suitable for sleeping. Difficulty sleeping may be resolved by making a few simple alterations to your bedroom.


Keep your sleep life and wake life separate. Do not keep electronic devices like laptops and televisions in your bedroom. Do not do work or go online in bed. Your bedroom should be for sleep alone. This will send a signal to your body that, when you enter the bedroom, it's time to wind down. If you live in a studio or dorm, consider hanging a tapestry or sheet between your bed and the rest of the apartment.Make sure your bedding is comfortable. All cotton sheets are best, as they tend to cause less irritation. Make sure pillows, comforters, and mattresses are not made from allergens. If your mattress is old or lumpy, consider a replacement. If you cannot afford a replacement mattress try investing in a foam sleep pad from a department store.Pay attention to temperature. The ideal temperature for sleeping is between 65 and 67°F (18.3 and 19.4°C). Invest in an air conditioner or box fan if your room is too warm. If you live in an area where it gets cool at night, try leaving your windows open.;
, Many people have trouble sleeping because they have difficulty shutting out daytime thoughts. If this is the case for you, engaging in relaxation techniques before bed can help.


Take a series of five breaths. Place your hand on your belly and breathe in, channeling air in such a way that your hand rises with your stomach. Hold for three counts and then exhale for three counts. Repeat five times.Stay in the present moment by tuning into your senses. Pay attention to how your body feels, how the mattress and sheets feel against your skin. Notice any sounds you hear from the window and any other sensory experiences.Try tensing and then relaxing your toes. Pay attention to how your toes feel, tense them, hold for 10 seconds, and then release., Stimulants, like nicotine and caffeine, as well as alcohol can interfere with your sleep. Avoid these substances before bedtime.


Nicotine, in addition to keeping you awake, comes with a host of other health problems. It's best to work on cutting cigarettes and nicotine altogether. Talk to your doctor about ways to go about quitting.
Caffeine stays in your system for a fairly long time, about six hours, so it's best to stop drinking caffeinated beverages in the early afternoon. Coffee, soda, energy drinks, and some teas all contain caffeine. If you drink any of these beverages later in the day, make sure they're caffeine free.Alcohol can make you sleepy; however, the sleep you have when drinking is of lesser quality. You'll end up waking up tired if you drink before bed, especially in excess. Try to avoid the nightcap if you want to fall asleep faster., The blue light produced by electronic screens stimulates the brain, causing a boost in energy. In the hour before bedtime, stay off your computer and phone. Find another activity, like reading or a crossword puzzle, to entertain yourself just before bed., You should find a way to wind down in the hour before bed. Engage in calming activities that can help slow your brain down and prepare you for sleep.


Reading is great way to wind down and tends to cause fatigue if done around bedtime. Find a relaxing book to read, something lighthearted and fun, and try to read a chapter or so before bed.Watching television can help some people wind down; however, the blue light emitted from the set can have a stimulating effect on the brain. Try limiting your exposure to television before bed to 30 minutes and pick a relaxing show, like a lighthearted sitcom, over something more serious like a news or crime show.Engaging in activities like crossword puzzles or sudoku can help you wind down before bed.

Make older kids ""bedtime helpers."",
Make sure that you give both children attention at bedtime.,
Recognize the pros and cons of sibling room sharing.,
Consider having separate bedrooms for your children.,
Make your children's bedroom more relaxing.",How to Manage Two Kids with Different Sleep Schedules2," Make each child part of the bedtime experience. Attempt to foster nurturing and support in the home, rather than getting frustrated by their differences.Older kids may feel jealous of the attention that the younger kids get, particularly the newborns and infants that require more parental involvement at bedtime.
Show the older kids that you need their help, and that they are vital parts of the family structure. Depending on the older child's age, give them tasks to help, such as helping to read or dimming the lights. Make them feel wanted around bedtime.
Ask the older kid to help out by saying, “I could use a helper with your younger brother. Want to help me tuck him in for bed?”

, Bedtime can be a special time for kids and parents. It is a way to wind down from the day and connect with your children. You may also want to get your spouse involved with putting the children to bed. It will help show that each parent values them by providing them with equal personal attention.Give one-on-one time to each of your children around bedtime, even if one child needs more support than the other. Make sure the other child doesn't feel left-out.
Provide love and soothing words around bedtime. Remind each of your children about what makes them wonderful and special. Use bedtime as a time to feel more deeply connected with them.
You may decide to alternate nights with your spouse as to who puts both kids to bed that evening. Avoid having one spouse put one child to bed while the other puts the other to bed, unless you switch roles regularly to avoid providing unequal attention to each child.

, Some parents may need to have siblings share rooms out of necessity, and others may see it as way to foster stronger relationships with their kids. Either way, understand that there can be pluses and minuses where sleeping is concerned.If one child goes to bed earlier than the other, the latter child may disrupt the sleep of the first child. You may feel like you have to the first child to bed again, after already tucking them in. Consider having bedtimes that are closer together or at the same time for both children.
Room sharing can have benefits, such as creating stronger bonds among children. One child may actually help the other to be less fearful or scared at night. Having a sibling in the room may provide comfort and reassurance.

, If your siblings are constantly at odds, consider ways to have them in separate rooms. Constant tension between siblings could lead to poorer sleep and stress.


If your home currently has space for separate rooms, consider changing the set-up in other rooms to accommodate your children.
If it's financially feasible, consider changing apartments or homes so that there is more bedroom space available for all of your family.
It is very important to provide each child with personal space. Older siblings are more sensitive to personal space issues., If your children are sharing a room, this can be particularly tricky. Find ways to dim or turn off lights when possible. Help to reduce noise both in the room and nearby the bedroom.


Consider getting a white noise machine to help drown out sounds. This can be helpful when two siblings are sharing a room since the one who is already asleep is less likely to wake up.
Find ways to reduce lighting in the room. If your children are sharing a room, and one of them likes to read before bed, consider getting that child a reading light. This way the light is less bright or irritating for the other child.
Keep the area around the bedroom quieter. If one sibling is still up, and the other asleep, teach them to be respectful of quiet time after other child is in bed. Have the child do only quiet activities near the bedroom, or find a space that is farther away.

Talk about sleep schedule rules as a family.,
Teach older kids about ways to not wake the baby.,
Teach them to respect parental sleep.,
Be a role model in setting sleep schedules for the household.,
Talk with your kids about the importance of sleep.,
Have some flexibility in your rules as things may not go as planned.",How to Manage Two Kids with Different Sleep Schedules3," Make sure that all family members feel like part of the discussion, unless they are too young to participate. Foster an understanding that house rules are important for everyone.Pick a time to set house rules about sleep schedules when all household members are present. Consider talking around family dinner time.
Consider writing down your house rules, including the sleep schedule rules. Sometimes having the information visible and in writing can help to foster solid understanding.

, It's common for siblings to get up at different times in the morning as they often have different sleep habits. It's helpful to teach them what to do when they wake up to not disturb the other sibling. For example, if your older child likes to get up early and play, have them play in a certain area of the house that is away from the sleeping baby. Allow certain types of play that are quieter in the mornings or at night.


You may want to create a special area in your living room/basement or another part of the home where an older child can go after waking up.
If a child wants to stay up late or get up early, consider activities such as reading, watching the TV on mute or low volume, playing a computer game with the noise turned off, or doing an activity in the backyard.
Older children can learn how to respect others more with these guidelines. Help to foster at an early age the importance of compromise in a home.

, If a child likes to get up and play, teach them how to entertain themselves rather than immediately waking you up before you're ready. Consider rules about when and what time it's okay to wake you up.


For example, if you don’t want to be disrupted before 7am on a Saturday, make this clear beforehand. If you have already created house rules for sleep schedules, then make sure to integrate this into the rules.
While there may be exceptions to the rules about when it’s okay to wake you up, avoid caving into their needs. Redirect their energy on Saturday mornings to other activities they can do on their own if possible.

, Maybe you have an erratic sleep schedule of your own, and are awake most of the night. If you're inconsistent in your sleeping, your children may wonder why it's okay for you to be up and not them.


Prioritize sleep for both your kids as well as for yourself. Make sure that you practice what you preach, and have a regular routine for sleep too.
Consider a nighttime routine like your child’s. Take hot bath or shower in the evening before bed. Read a book or do something soothing, rather than checking email or doing work before bed.

, Sleeping is a healthy way to feel refreshed and rejuvenated. Give them the wisdom to love sleep rather than fight it.For example, better sleep can help to improve grades and sharpen attention. If they are planning to have a big day tomorrow, make sure they understand that ample sleep is a top priority.
Sleep can also improve your athletic performance. When you have a good night’s sleep, you’ll have more stamina and less daytime fatigue.

, House rules and sleeping patterns will change over time. Be flexible about how make your household adapt with your kids rather than against them.Remember that what may work for one child may not work for another. Follow your instincts about what's working and what's not.
Be willing to compromise. Your kids may test your rules. Sometimes this will help you to see what you're willing to compromise on, and what you're not.
Focus on being an advocate for both of your children's sleep. Be willing to step in and remake the rules so that there is fairness and equity as much as possible.

Be sure to set the device's sleep mode or power saver settings so that the device will turn itself off after the recording has finished.
It is not advisable to use headphones for a guided sleep meditation, since ideally you will fall asleep before the recording is over, and you don't want to get tangled up in the cords in the night.

, Put on your pajamas, darken the room, and get comfy in bed before you hit play. Then relax and listen, and prepare for a night of restful sleep! If you don't fall asleep after the first play-through, take a few deep breaths and begin again.

Try melatonin.,
Use over-the-counter sleep aids.,
Ask your doctor about prescription medications.",How to Make Yourself Sleepy2," Melatonin is a hormone that plays a role in the body's natural sleep/wake cycle. Most supermarkets and drug stores sell melatonin in pill form. If you're having trouble sleeping at night, consider occasionally taking melatonin.


Melatonin works by making you feel sleepier. It can decrease the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep. It's typically used to treat sleeplessness or mild sleep disorders. You typically take about 5 milligrams of melatonin about half an hour before bed.Melatonin should not be used long-term as it can cause dependency. It may cause side effects like dizziness, daytime sleepiness, and headaches. It can interact with blood thinning medications, diabetes medications, birth control, and medications that suppress the immune system. If you're on any of those types of meds, talk to your doctor before you take melatonin., In addition to melatonin, there are a variety of over-the-counter sleep aids you can use. If you're having consistent trouble sleeping, consider trying some of the following:


Diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Unisom SleepGels) are antihistamines that cause sedation. They can cause side effects like daytime drowsiness, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention. Doxylamine succinate (Unisom SleepTabs) is another sedating antihistamine that causes similar side effects.Valerian is plant a supplement sometimes taken to aid with sleep. Studies are conflicted over whether it actually helps with sleep.Talk to your doctor before choosing any over-the-counter sleep meds. You want to make sure such meds are safe for you, given your lifestyle, existing medications, and medical history., If your trouble sleeping doesn't improve with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter meds, talk to your doctor about prescription sleeping pills. These can help you fall asleep faster and have better quality sleep.


Your doctor will probably ask you a series of questions about your sleeping patterns and overall quality of your sleep. They may order certain tests to rule out possible underlying conditions.
Your doctor will make a decision about what type of prescription meds would work for you, given your medical history and any possible condition causing your sleep issues. They will also go over potential side effects of the meds and any lifestyle changes you'll need to make when taking them.
It can take awhile to find the right sleep medication. You might have to experiment with different meds before you find the right type and dose. Insurance companies might not want to cover sleeping medications unless you've been diagnosed with a specific condition, such as insomnia, so your doctor may give you a diagnosis to ensure your meds are covered."

Get on a sleep schedule.,
Exercise.,
Eat better.,
Manage your worries long-term.",How to Make Yourself Sleepy3," Your body has a natural circadian rhythm that works best when you're running on a schedule. If you fall asleep and wake up at roughly the same time each day, you'll feel tired at bedtime and energized in the morning. Try to stick to the same bedtime and wake time, even on weekends. While it can be hard to adopt at first, after a few weeks of a new schedule you'll start to fall asleep more easily., People who work out on a regular basis tend to have less trouble sleeping. Getting on an exercise schedule can help regulate your sleep.

Tense and relax your muscles.,
Return to any muscles that are still tense.,
Enjoy the feeling of relaxation, and let yourself drift off to sleep.",How to Meditate to Get to Sleep2," Progressive muscle relaxation is a meditation technique in which you systematically tense and relax different muscle groups in your body to promote awareness of your body, and an allover state of relaxation. Progressive relaxation can be used day or night for general relaxation, but is especially helpful for promoting sleep at night.

, Take a few deep breaths, and quiet your mind. Begin focusing on your body, and tell yourself that it's OK to relax., Begin at the top of your head, and work your way down in the order described. Tense the muscles just enough to feel the tension, not so much that you feel pain. After five seconds of tension, relax the muscles you are working on.

Enjoy the feeling of relaxation, and allow yourself to drift off to sleep.",How to Meditate to Get to Sleep3," During mindfulness meditation, you will pay focused and intentional attention to the way you are feeling, in order to relax the body and mind. It is important not to judge or analyze the thoughts and feelings that pop into your head while performing mindfulness meditation, just note them and let them go by. The center of your focus should be the physical sensations you are experiencing in the present moment, as you lie in bed., Get ready for bed, darken your room, and prepare to go to sleep., Begin your meditation by taking 5 long breaths, in through your nose, and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of breathing, as your chest expands and your lungs fill with air. As you breathe out, imagine exhaling the events and thoughts of the day along with the air.

, Take a moment to reflect on how your body and mind are feeling. Take your time with this step and don't become concerned by the flood of thoughts that may occur, just take a few moments to observe them and let them rush by.


This is not the time to try to solve problems. If you feel yourself worrying about something, just observe the concern and move on. You can try to work out solutions to issues the next day, when you are well-rested and refreshed.

, Begin by concentrating on the points of contact between your body and the bed. Is your weight equally distributed? Think about how your head is resting on your pillow, and how the blankets lie against your feet. Listen to any sounds you can hear, including your own breath. Observe the temperature of the room, and the way the air is circulating around your face.

, Does it feel light or heavy? Are you experiencing any tension or pain? Mentally scan your body from head to toe, thinking about areas of tension, and intentionally tensing and then relaxing them, as you might do in a progressive muscle relaxation exercise. Repeat the body scan process several times, if needed, to relax any tense muscles.

, Pay attention to the rhythm as you inhale and exhale. Focus on the physical sensations of breathing, and the sounds that your breath makes. If your mind starts to wander, return to the focus of the rising and falling of your chest.

, Take a few minutes to remember and relive the way your day unfolded, from the moment you got up in the morning, to the present moment. Fast-forward through the day, observe and recollect conversations and what you did, but don't analyze or overthink.

, Once your review of the day has caught up with the present, where you are lying in bed, return to the sensations of your body and your breath.

, Beginning with the toes of your left foot, think about each part of your body for a moment, and give it permission to ""switch off"" or ""go to sleep."" Travel from your toes, up your leg, to your waist, then repeat with the other leg. Then continue to check-in with your torso, and each arm, beginning with your finger, and working your way up to your shoulders and neck. Finish with your throat, face and head.

, With your body at rest, your mind will soon follow. Allow your thoughts to wander as they will, knowing you will wake up feeling refreshed and relaxed.


Many people fall asleep long before this last step. If you have not, don't worry. Just remember that your body wants to sleep as much as you do, and that it will eventually happen. Just relax and try not to force it.

Don’t sleep on your back if you are pregnant.",How to Improve Your Sleeping Position2," If you tend to sleep on your back, slide a pillow under your knees to alleviate any lower back tension or pain. It will put less pressure on your lower back. Use a thin pillow and slide it under your knees once you lay down on your back for extra comfort.You can also slide a rolled up blanket or towel under your knees if you do not have a spare pillow.

, Sometimes, sleeping on your back can lead to lower back pain or soreness in the morning. To support your lower back while you sleep, place a rolled up towel under your lower back before you go to sleep. The rolled up towel should slide right under the slight dip in your lower back when you lay down on your back in bed.You can also try sliding a thin flat pillow under your lower back, though this often raises your lower back too high off the bed. The idea is to keep your spine aligned and your back slightly raised, but not raised above your head or chest.

, Sleeping on your back can cause you to snore or make your snoring worse, as it can make it difficult for you to breathe properly while you sleep. If you tend to snore, you may want to try sleeping on your side instead. Sleeping on your side can help to reduce your snoring or make it less severe.If you find it difficult to remain sleeping on your side because you are used to sleeping on your back, try using tennis balls to prevent you from rolling onto your back.

See a doctor.",How to Get to Sleep Faster," Sleeping in a hot room is a recipe for twisted sheets and feverish dreams, whereas a cool, dark environment will help you to fall asleep faster and sleep better. The optimal temperature for sleeping is between 65 and 68 degrees, so turn down the thermostat and snuggle under the covers.


Of course, it won't be easy to fall asleep if your room is frigid, so find a temperature that works for you, just try to err on the cool side. Remember that it's better to pile on the blankets in a cold room than to kick off the covers in a hot room.
If you suffer from hot flashes or night sweats, there are other things you can do to keep yourself cool. Consider investing in a cooling mattress pad and some moisture-wicking sheets to keep body temperature down and draw sweat from the skin.;
, Darkness helps your brain to process the fact that it's time for sleep, causing it to release hormones that induce sleepiness. If you have too much light in your bedroom, or stare at a screen for too long before turning in, this can delay the release of these hormones and prevent you from falling asleep. To combat this, keep your bedroom as dark as you possibly can and turn off all electronics at least an hour before bed.


Avoid having a light up clock in your bedroom. Knowing that it's 3 A.M. and you're still wide awake is not going to help the situation. It will simply increase your anxiety and make falling asleep even less likely.Avoid installing a television or games console in your bedroom and try not to bring your laptop to bed. You want your brain to identify your bedroom as a place of peace and sleep, not one of work and play.
Turn off your cell phone or at least put it on 'do not disturb' mode. If it's sitting on your bedside table, the temptation to check your emails, your facebook page, or even the time will keep you awake.

, If you find your bed uncomfortable, it's hardly a wonder that you have trouble getting to sleep. Consider whether its time to invest in a new mattress, one that's harder or softer depending on your needs. Alternatively, you could try flipping your existing mattress over, as the underside may have less lumps and bumps. People with neck or back trouble may benefit from a memory foam pillow, which contours to each individual's body shape and provides them with the support they need.


If buying a new mattress seems a little extreme, consider a new set of sheets. Go for as high a thread count as possible and choose a finish based on your individual preferences. For crisp, cool sheets, go with percale. For warmth and comfort, choose flannel. For a touch of luxury, use Egyptian cotton.
Launder your sheets at least once a week -- people tend to sleep better on crisp, clean sheets. Also try to get into the habit of making your bed every morning. A made-up bed is much more inviting than a messy one.

, Something as simple as a whiff of essential oil can help your body relax and your mind drift off to dreamland. According to several studies, lavender is the number one fragrance for inducing a deep sleep, while also helping people to fall asleep faster.Get your hands on a good quality bottle of lavender essential oil and use it in one of the following ways:


Sprinkle a few drops of the essential oil on a piece of cloth and slip it under your pillowcase. Dilute a few drops of the oil in some water and place it in a diffuser in your bedroom, or use the lavender water to iron your sheets. If you can swing it, get a partner to give you a relaxing massage using the lavender oil as a massage oil. Lavender bags are also useful to put under your pillow or something
If lavender isn't your thing, there are other relaxing and calming scents you can experiment with in your quest for sleep. Bergamot, marjoram, sandalwood and geranium aromatherapy oils are all good options.

, Distracting or annoying noises can be a big obstacle to falling asleep. Do your best to keep your bedroom as quiet and peaceful as possible, by shutting your doors and windows or asking your housemates to turn down the television. For noise you can't do anything about, like your partner's snoring or the banging party upstairs, consider wearing noise-cancelling earplugs -- They may feel a tad strange or uncomfortable at first, but once you overcome that you will be blissfully unaware of any external disturbances.Another option is to invest in a white noise machine or app, which produces random sounds at a variety of frequencies, thus masking other noises. True white noise can be somewhat harsh sounding, so many of these machines produce what are known as ""color"" noises, which are softer and may sound like a rushing waterfall or a gentle hum.
You could also just find a cd with some relaxing music, or even sounds from nature, and leave that softly playing in the background as you sleep. Try not to sleep with earphones in though, as these can become uncomfortable or get tangled while you sleep.

, A leisurely soak in a hot bath is one tried and tested method for falling asleep faster. There are several reasons why this is so effective. Firstly, having a bath will reduce stress and help you to clear your mind of the worries of the day, which are responsible for keeping you awake at night. Secondly, having a hot bath raises your body temperature, which then quickly drops when you get out. This mimics the actions of the brain, which triggers body-cooling hormones when it's time for bed.You can enhance the sleep-inducing qualities of your bath even further by adding a couple of drops of your favorite essential oil, such as lavender or chamomile oil, to the water. And why not add some soothing music and light some candles, while you're at it?
If you don't have time for a bath (or don't have a bathtub) a hot shower will produce the same effect. Just try to keep the water temperature above 100 °F (37.8 °C) and stay in there for at least 20 minutes, for best results., Although eating a heavy meal right before bed isn't such a good idea, tummy rumbles are even worse for preventing sleep, so try to avoid going to bed hungry. A light snack before bed, such as a piece of fruit, some crackers or a low-fat yogurt are perfect. Drink a soothing chamomile or passionflower tea, or a glass of warm milk which contains the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin.


Any snack that contains complex carbohydrates, such as wholegrain bread or cereals, is good because these increase your body's tryptophan levels. Tryptopin is a chemical which encourages the brain to produce more serotonin, a happy, relaxing hormone which induces sleep.Some great bedtime snacks to consider are any kind of nuts or seeds (especially pumpkin seeds), wholegrain bread or crackers with a little cheese, or cereal and warm milk. Avoid anything very greasy or spicy.

, As mentioned before, being comfortable in bed is essential for falling asleep quickly, so the importance of wearing comfy pajamas cannot be overstated. Avoid pajamas that are too tight, made from uncomfortable materials or have buttons that will stick into you as you sleep. Aim for something loose and soft, which won't leave you too hot or too cold in the middle of the night.


If pajamas feel too constricting, consider going naked. Many people enjoy the sensation of freedom and comfort that comes with sleeping nude, particularly on hot nights. Just make sure no one is likely to walk in on you, especially if you're prone to kicking off the covers!

, Doing a few simple stretches before bed can help to release tension from your muscles and relax your body for sleep. In fact, a study conducted by a Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that women who did 15 to 30 minutes of upper and lower body stretches before bed, decreased their issues with falling asleep by 30%.Try lying on your back on the bed or on the ground and bending your right leg as if trying to touch your knee to your chin. You should feel the stretch in your hamstring and lower back. Hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds, then repeat with the other leg.
Sit in a cross-legged position, place your right hand on the floor beside you and raise your left arm above your ear. Lean to the right, keeping your shoulders down and your butt cheeks on the floor. Hold for 10 to 15 seconds then repeat on the other side. This stretches your neck, back, shoulders and obliques.
For more stretching techniques, see the article how to stretch.

, Reading, writing and simple game playing can help you to unwind before bed by releasing stress and distracting you from thinking about other issues.


If you choose to read, don't go for anything too exciting or scary, as this might get your heart racing! Choose something a little duller, like a newspaper or textbook, which will soon have your eyelids drooping.
Some people find writing in a journal very therapeutic, as it helps them to get any problems or issues out of their mind and on paper instead. Alternatively, you could try making lists, such as everything you ate that day, or the errands you need to run tomorrow. This can be tedious and should hopefully have you nodding off in no time.
Simple word or number games, such as sudoku or crossword puzzles can be a pleasant nighttime activity which can help tire out your brain before sleep.

, Counting is an effective technique for falling asleep. It requires enough mental concentration to distract you from thinking about anything else, but it's also quite boring, which is good for inducing sleep. Try the time honored technique of visualizing sheep jumping over a fence, or use the psychologist recommended method of counting backwards from 300 by 3s.Count to 10 while taking a deep breath in and count to 10 again while taking a deep breath out.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is a tried and tested physical relaxation technique which reduces muscle fatigue, helping you to fall asleep faster. It's done by focusing on each individual body part in turn and consciously tensing then relaxing that body part. Start with your toes and work on each body part in turn until you reach the top of your head., It may sound counter-intuitive, but sometimes the best thing you can do when you're having trouble falling asleep is to get out of bed and and distract yourself by doing something else. Lying in bed and freaking out about the fact that you're not sleeping is not productive. Try reading a book, watching a little TV, listening to music, or making a snack. Stay out of bed for 30 to 60 minutes, or until you start feeling tired. This technique will help your brain to associate your bed with sleeping.

, Visualizing a calming or pleasant image can be a great way to distract yourself. Think of the ocean, a rainbow, a tropical desert island, anything that makes you feel happy and peaceful. A more elaborate version of this is to think up scenarios or imagine activities that you enjoy. Imagine yourself as a superhero or celebrity, mentally design your dream home, or think about playing with a room full of kittens or puppies.

, Music or recordings of peaceful sounds can be extremely effective for distracting yourself and allowing your mind to wander off to sleep. Some people like listening to the sound of rainfall, others like jungle noises, while whale songs float other people's boats. Soft classical music helps other people to fall asleep.

, If you regularly experience problems with falling asleep, it may be time to cut down on your caffeine intake.


Caffeine can last in your system up to five hours after it was consumed, so it's usually best to have your last cup coffee around lunch time.
Switch to non-caffeinated herbal teas for the rest of the evening, and try a special ""sleepy-time"" blend, with ingredients like chamomile or valerian, before bed.

, There are several kinds of supplements available in drug and health food stores which can help boost the level sleep-producing hormones in your system.


Melatonin is a hormone which regulates sleep. It can be purchased inexpensively in supplement form -- usually a low dosage taken before bedtime will do the trick.
Chlor Trimeton, a type of antihistamine, is another supplement that causes drowsiness and can help with sleeping problems.
Valerian root is one of the oldest known treatments for insomnia, but nowadays you can take it in supplement form rather than drinking a tea made from boiling the root itself. It is believed to improve the quality of sleep in addition to reducing the time it takes to nod off., A good strenuous workout 3 to 4 times a week can help you to fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow, while also significantly improving the quality of your sleep.


Try aerobic exercise like running, swimming or cycling to tire your body out, in addition to a multitude of other health benefits.
Try to exercise early in the day, if possible, as exercising in the three hours before bedtime can leave you too pumped to sleep. , Setting up a well-defined sleep schedule can really help to regulate your sleeping patterns. Try to wake up and go to bed at the same time everyday, at least on weekdays.


Over time, this will allow your internal body clock to naturally recognize when it's time to go to sleep, helping you to fall asleep faster.
Don't worry if you sleep in a little on the weekends, as this can actually be good for your body and help it to heal and restore itself after the stresses of the week., If none of the above suggestions seem to be working and you fear you may be suffering from insomnia or sleep apnea, it might be time to make an appointment with a doctor or therapist. They can then assess your sleeping patterns and decide the best course of action, which can be anything from simply keeping a sleep journal to taking prescription sleep medication."

, Your skin is renewing itself while you sleep. Give it a boost by providing it with lots of moisture before bed. For added moisture, try using a mask instead of a lotion or cream. , An afternoon cup of coffee or tea can keep some people from falling asleep. Try not to drink any caffeinated beverages after lunchtime.Watch out for hidden sources of caffeine as well, such as chocolate and energy drinks. Some over-the-counter medications, particularly diet pills, contain caffeine, too.Try not to consume more than 400 mg of caffeine per day, regardless of what time you drink it. This equates to about four cups of coffee., Although alcohol might make you drowsy, the effect is short-lived and people will often wake up several hours later, unable to fall back asleep.

Exercising too close to bedtime may keep some people awake. If you find this is an issue for you, try to give yourself a few hours of relaxation time between your workout and your bedtime.

, Stress can be very unhealthy for a variety of reasons, and it might keep you from getting a full night's sleep. If you find yourself unable to fall asleep because you are worried about things that are happening in your life, you definitely need to take some steps to reduce your stress.Think positively and learn to laugh when you are feeling stressed.

Meditating, exercising, and deep breathing are helpful stress-relievers for many people. Try them out and see what works for you.
Try getting yourself organized and making a rough plan for the next day well in advance of bedtime so that you won't have to think about it once you are in bed.

, The more exposure you have to natural light during the day, the more likely you are to stay in touch with your body's natural circadian rhythm, which will also help you fall asleep at night.Even if you can't get outside, try sitting by a window.

, If you have trouble sleeping at night, napping during the day will probably make the problem worse, so do your best to stay up until bedtime.If you must nap during the day, try to do it as early as possible. Don’t nap later than mid-afternoon, and try to limit your rest to 10-30 minutes long.

, You should go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, even on the weekends. This will help your body to get into a sleep rhythm and make it easier to fall asleep and get up in the morning.Sleeping late, even during the weekends, is unhealthy for your body, as you will find that you will have a harder time falling asleep that night. Your body will have already gotten all its needed sleep earlier, and will refuse to go to sleep.

, To improve your sleep, try eating a carbohydrate-rich snack shortly before you go to bed. Warm milk, herbal teas, and foods that are high in tryptophan, such as yogurt and tuna, are also good choices.Avoid overeating, or you may be kept awake by indigestion.

, Avoiding fluids within one hour of going to bed will reduce the likelihood that you will need to get up and go to the bathroom, or at least minimize the frequency.Try to go to the bathroom right before bed to increase your chances of being able to sleep undisturbed.

, The blue light emitted by televisions and electronic screens interferes with sleep by suppressing melatonin production. For better sleep, shut devices off an hour before bedtime.Avoid other screens as well, like cell phones and tablets.
If you must watch television before bed, don't do it in your bedroom. Try to designate your bedroom as a place for sleeping.

, Try to stop working at least one hour (but preferably two or more) before bed. This will give your mind a chance to unwind so you can go to sleep feeling calm, not hyped up or anxious about tomorrow's deadlines.


Avoid staying up later than you normally would to work or study. Instead, try to plan ahead so you will have time to do these things earlier in the day.

, Instead of watching television or working, do an activity that will help you wind down after a long day. The key is to find something that makes you feel relaxed, then repeat it each night to help you release the day's tensions. Read a pleasurable, slow-paced book. Try to avoid reading a suspenseful book, as you could end up reading for hours, instead of going to sleep. To avoid disrupting your sleep, read a print book or choose an e-reader that is not backlit.Practice a relaxing hobby, such as knitting or painting.
Meditate, practice deep breathing exercises, or gently stretch your muscles.

, When your body temperature is raised in the late evening, it will fall at bedtime, facilitating sleep., If you are used to watching TV or doing work in bed, you may find it harder to relax and to think of the bed as a place to sleep. Ideally, your entire bedroom should be designated as a sleeping zone and not an activity zone.If have no choice but to spend your waking hours in your bedroom, consider adding a comfortable beanbag chair or a small couch into your room for activities like working and watching television, instead of using your bed.
Make sure to actually sleep in your bed. You will not get great quality sleep if you fall asleep on the couch.

, If there is even the tiniest bit of light in the room, it can disrupt your circadian rhythm and your pineal gland's production of melatonin and serotonin.If you can't block out every stream of light, or if your partner has a different schedule than you, try wearing an eye mask to bed.
Keep the light off when you go to the bathroom at night too.

, Turn off the television and any music that contains lyrics, and try to block out as much noise from the outside world as you possibly can.Some people find the sound of white noise, which drowns out background sounds, or natural noises, such as the ocean or forest, to be soothing for sleep. If this helps you sleep, try getting a white noise machine or turning on a fan., You will sleep better if you are neither too cold nor too hot. The ideal temperature for optimal sleep is 60-67 degrees F (15.5-20 degrees C). Your body temperature decreases for sleep and these cooler temps can actually help you fall asleep more quickly, too.Because they have the poorest circulation, the feet often feel cold before the rest of the body. Wearing socks to bed can help keep you nice and toasty.

, Your alarm clock should be loud enough to wake you up, but not so loud that you are startled out of a deep sleep. You can try using one with a more soothing alarm or consider switching to a clock that will wake you up with light.If you are regularly getting enough sleep, you might find that you no longer need an alarm clock to wake up on time.
Your phone is not a great alarm clock because it may disturb you with texts and emails.
Try to avoid alarm clocks that emit blue light, as this can disturb your sleep.
If you do have a clock, try not to look at it when you wake up during the night. If you find yourself doing this frequently, turn the clock away from you, move it across the room, or get a clock that has a sleep setting.

Writing down your thoughts can also help you keep track of what activities or life events seem to get in the way of a good night's sleep, which will hopefully encourage you to make adjustments., If you're having a hard time falling asleep because your mind is racing, try focusing on a single mundane task, like counting backward from 100. This will help you relax and fall asleep faster., If you wake up and can't fall asleep again, try getting out of bed, leaving your bedroom, and doing something relaxing, such as reading. This should help you feel sleepy again.Keep lights dim to avoid disrupting your circadian rhythm.
Stay away from cell phones, televisions, and other electronics.

If you sleep on your side, place a pillow between your knees in order to keep your hips aligned, and to prevent you from twisting to rest your knee on the mattress.If you sleep on your back, you can also place a pillow underneath your knees to make sure your back is in the optimal position.However, be aware that if you snore or have sleep apnea, this position will only exacerbate these issues.If you are a stomach sleeper, then you likely need to work the most to improve your sleep posture, as this is typically considered the worst sleeping posture. Sleeping on your stomach forces you to turn your head to the left or to the right, creating pressure on the spine. If you use a pillow, it also pushes your head higher than the rest of your spine. This can lead to pain, numbness, and tingling.If you are a stomach sleeper and do not wish to sleep in a different position, you can place a thin pillow underneath your pelvis and stomach to try and take some of the pressure off of your neck.;
, At first, it will probably be challenging to sleep in a position that is not the one you are used to. However, over time, you will become more comfortable.

, If you want to start sleeping on your back, place extra pillows underneath each arm, one under your knees, and possibly even one on each side of your torso. If you want to sleep on your side, place a pillow between your knees, and one or two pillows behind your back to prevent you from rolling onto your back. By using pillows, you help your body stay in the new sleeping posture.

, Since it is difficult to control your body position after you’ve fallen asleep, trying to change your sleep posture can be challenging. However, over time your new posture will improve your sleep quality and will eventually feel even more comfortable than your old posture.

, In order to improve your posture during the night, you should also work to improve your posture during the day, as this also contributes to aches and pains that may force us into a particular posture. You may not immediately know what proper posture should feel like, so you should check your posture against a wall several times a day as you begin a back and shoulder strengthening routine.


Stand against the wall.For most people with poor posture, their shoulder blades do not touch the wall. Pull your shoulder blades down and in so that they connect with the wall. Next, lengthen your neck as if someone is pulling the back of your head up. Move it back until your head touches the wall. Move your chin until it is parallel to the ground.
Make sure you stand with equal weight in both legs.Move to a mirror and mimic the pose to ensure your neck and shoulders are straight. Pull your shoulders down as far as possible. Tighten your abdominal muscles.
Consider seeking the help of a physical therapist. If you have trouble maintaining proper posture, you may need to seek the assistance of a physical therapist, who can show you exercises that will help strengthen your core.

, Mattresses generally need to be replaced about every 10 years.However, if your mattress is becoming saggy or lumpy, if you wake up with aches and pains, or if you find that you sleep better when you are away from home than in your own bed, it may be time to start searching for a new mattress.

, There are many things to consider when purchasing a mattress that is best suited for you. Therefore, you should take some time to learn about how to choose a mattress.


It is a good idea to choose a firmer mattress, as a firm mattress provides better support for your skeleton.If you cannot afford to replace your mattress, you can try flipping over your current mattress and placing a piece of plywood underneath in order to provide a bit more support., There are many factors that affect how often you should replace your pillow, including the quality and type of filling in your pillow. However, like your mattress, if you wake up with a sore neck or a headache, it’s probably a good time to look for a new one.To help you determine whether or not your pillow is worn out, you can perform the “fold test”. Fold your pillow in half for thirty seconds and then release it. If it doesn’t spring back into its original form relatively quickly, it’s likely time for a new one.Finally, if you notice that your pillow is very lumpy or that there is a large dent where your head usually goes, it’s likely time for a new one., As with choosing a mattress, there are many things to consider when choosing a pillow. Take the time to learn how to choose the correct pillow for you.


Since you will likely be learning to sleep either on your side or on your back, you will do best with a medium thick to thick pillow, that provides good support for the neck.
Make sure that any pillow you purchase keeps your neck in a straight line with your spine. You do not want the pillow to make your neck go higher or lower than the rest of your spine.

, Make sure the temperature in your room is cool, but not cold. Most people sleep best around 65° F or 18° C, This may not be completely in your control, but do your best to keep your sleeping room as quiet as possible. Invest in ear plugs, or use something such as a fan to mask any outside noise., Especially if you wish to sleep on your back, you should avoid eating a large meal before bed. Give yourself at least two hours to digest your meal. If you consume a large, fatty meal, you are more likely to feel uncomfortable while sleeping., If you have just risen from a seated position, then it is likely your pelvis is tucked forward and you have poor posture. Do the wall test and walk around your house to loosen your muscles.

, By going to bed and getting up at the same time each day, you help your body know when to be ready for sleep.


If you end up going to bed later than normal one night, you should still do your best to get up at the same time. This way you don’t disrupt your routine as much.
If you feel very tired, try taking a short, mid-day nap to help you rather than sleeping in later or going to bed earlier.

, Each night, before going to sleep, have a ritual that you do in the same order to signal to your body that it is time to sleep. For example, you might brush your teeth, wash your face, and change in to your pajamas. You might then do some very gentle stretching or yoga. Finally, you can really get into rest mode by reading for a few minutes before turning out the lights.


It is best not to let electronics, such as smart phones, televisions, or lap tops be a part of your bed time routine. While entertaining, the backlights from these devices can be stimulating and can even suppress melatonin production., Walk around, swing your shoulders in their sockets and do very light stretches. This can ease pain and stiffness, improving posture during the day."

Address any anxieties you have about sleep.,
Practice mindfulness as you lie in bed.,
Try a mindfulness exercise.,
Fight the nightmares.,
Avoid frightening or intense movies, stories, or TV shows before bed.,
Calm down children who suffer from frequent nightmares.,
Get professional help.",How to Go to Sleep when Scared1," One source of anxiety that might translate into fear that keeps you up at night are persistent thoughts about how much sleep you’re getting.Believe it or not, anxiety and fear associated with sleep is a form of performance anxiety.
Don’t allow yourself to continue thinking about what time it is, what time you have to wake up, or anything related to the quality of the rest you’ve been getting.
When these thoughts arise, push them away by thinking about someone or something you enjoy.
Recognize that the fear of sleep, like most anxieties, is based on your perspective.;
, If you’re dealing with a constant source of anxiety in your life, your mind may be translating an inability to relax into a fear of going to bed or falling asleep. Close your eyes and breathe deeply.Taking deep breaths will help calm and center your mind, driving away fear and anxiety.
Remind yourself that it’s normal and okay to be uncertain, even fearful from time to time, and to have nights where you might not sleep as well as others.
If you expect or worry about a disruption during the night, prepare yourself for it mentally by counting on it occurring.
As you’re falling asleep, visualize yourself asleep, being woken up, rolling over, and falling back asleep.

, One of the old standbys is counting backward from one hundred. Keep your eyes closed. See how low you can get.Picture a beautiful outdoor vista you’ve seen or would like to see someday. Imagine the associated sounds and smells. Feel the breeze on your skin.
Imagine yourself sitting calmly in your favorite fantasy realm.
Try softly playing the audio of the setting you're envisioning. Avoid audio with words or other distractions elements. Look for an ambient, calming sound, like waves on the shore or rain falling.
Soft, zen music is great too. An extra benefit of noise is the distraction it provides from frightening thoughts.
Write in a journal before you go to bed. Writing can help you clear your mind by organizing your thoughts and expressing what your feeling externally., While nightmares are common in childhood, adults experiences them as well. If looking to rid yourself of nightmares, distract yourself with what you enjoy.Provide yourself with sources of positive emotions to diminish the chances fear seeps into your thoughts while you sleep.
After around 6:00 PM, only expose yourself to things that make you happy and comfortable.

, Whether you love them or hate them, don’t watch horrific video entertainment before bed. This has less to do with fear in particular than it does with excitability in general.Intense movies up your heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration whether they spook you or not. This is part driven by the novelty of the experience; our minds are interested by (and linger on) things we’re not used to seeing.
Even for movie-watching stoics, psychological arousal lingers in your brain following and intense movie.
Even if you don’t feel frightened, your emotional and energy levels are perked by intense entertainment. And, of course, if you are frightened, it’ll be all the more challenging to fall asleep!
See the wikiHow on how to get a scary movie off your mind.

, The increase in imagination during preschool, coupled with the recognition that bad things sometimes happen to people lead to nighttime distress for many children.There are several helpful steps you can take to prepare a child for more restful sleep.


Give the child a comfort object, such as a stuffed animal or blanket.
Read a positive, cheerful book to the child before bed, maybe even one you know the child enjoys.When your child wakes up from a nightmare, assure them immediately that they are safe.
Talk about fun things the shadows in the child’s room looks like. This will increase their comfort with the space in which they sleep.
If a child brings up disturbing thoughts after a nightmare, speak about them specifically during the day.
Avoid consistently allowing your child to sleep in your bed, as this may lead to a dependence on doing so.
For more specific tips, see the wikiHow on how to help children who suffer from frequent nightmares.


, Both children and adults should see a healthcare professional if trouble sleeping because of fear does not subside. There are doctors who specialize in sleep, and many hospitals even have labs dedicated to treating sleep issues!


Mental health professionals in particular can help tailor a plan specific to your needs.
Fear and sadness are quite similar. Talking about both with someone may not only help you sleep better, but feel better during the day as well!
It may purely be a physical ailment that’s leading you to feel uncomfortable (and maybe fear the way you’re feeling). In this case, a doctor may be able to quickly get you back to sleeping comfortably.

Exercise regularly.,
Expose yourself to sunlight on a daily basis.",How to Have Good Sleep Hygiene," When you maintain a consistent sleeping schedule, your body will adopt its own natural rhythm that allows you to feel more refreshed and energetic on a daily basis. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, even on the weekends, to develop your sleep-wake cycle. In addition to feeling more energetic, you’ll be less prone to bouts of insomnia if your body consistently expects and receives sleep at a certain time.Everyone has a built-in natural system known as the circadian rhythm (or sleep/wake cycle or body clock) that regulates feelings of sleepiness and wakefulness over a 24-hour period. This is controlled by an area in your brain that responds to light. Sticking to a sleep cycle will help keep your circadian rhythm in check.While setting your internal clock, it’s especially important that you wake up at the same time every day, even if you didn’t sleep well the night before.
Don’t deviate more than 20 minutes from your regularly-scheduled time, and not at all, if possible.
If you need the assistance of an alarm clock to wake you up each morning, adjust your bedtime to go to sleep earlier.;
, Dedicate the hour before you go to bed to pre-bedtime habits that help you unwind. Simply engaging in habitual activities will soothe you and let your body know that it’s time to get ready for bed. Because you’ll do them every night, these activities won’t require planning or much thought, allowing you to physically and mentally prepare for sleep. Try:


Taking a warm bath
Drinking a cup of herbal tea with lemon
Doing crossword puzzles
Reading a book (but skip anything suspenseful or that might wind you up)

, Computers, telephones, tablets, and televisions are all stimulating and should be avoided for at least one hour before bed. Even if you dim your screen to remove the brightness or the blue light, electronic devices will prevent your brain from winding down fully, and will likely prevent you from falling asleep at your set time.The blue light emitted from electronic devices has been found to disrupt your circadian rhythm. Consider wearing blue-blocking glasses or installing an app that filters the blue/green wavelength at night.Try using red lights at night (perhaps by changing the bulb on your bedside table to a red one). Red light has the least power to shift circadian rhythm and suppress melatonin.

, If you find yourself lying in bed unable to sleep because your mind is racing, get up. Allow yourself 10 minutes in bed before switch locations. When you do get up, don’t turn on the television or look at your phone. Instead, find a chair in the dark and sit quietly, allowing your mind to race. Get the thoughts out and over with, then go back to bed. Repeat this as often as necessary.No matter how many times you get up in the night, maintain your consistent wake-up time.
Keep a notebook and pen handy. If you find that your mind doesn’t stop racing after 15 minutes, make a list in your notebook of what you’re thinking about, such as everything that you need to do tomorrow, or points you want to make in the conversation with your boss. Get the ideas out and on paper so that you don’t have to worry about them anymore.

, If you need to recharge during the day with a nap, take your nap earlier in the day. Afternoon naps can contribute to difficulty falling and staying asleep. Also, keep your nap short, under half an hour — any longer and you will disrupt your sleep-wake cycle., Your bed is for sleeping, although you might have a tendency to do a host of other things while trying to fall asleep. If you feel like reading, listening to music, watching television, or surfing the internet from your phone, move to another location in your room or in the house. Using your bed for sleeping and no other activities (except sex) signals your body and brain that when you’re in bed, it’s time to fall to sleep and should minimize the time you lay awake in bed., Which pillows and mattress you find the most comfortable is subjective and unique to you. Some people prefer firm mattresses, others prefer soft. Some prefer a pillow top and others prefer memory foam. Similarly, you might like a down-filled pillow more than a synthetic filling. Through trial and error you will determine what combination of pillow and mattress is the most comfortable for you., For optimal sleep, make sure that your room is dark, free of distracting sounds, and is a comfortable temperature. Because you have blankets on your bed, err on the side of cooler rather than warmer when setting your thermostat. Making your room a comfortable, quiet, distraction-free environment will help ensure the best sleep possible., Even when you’re sleeping, your brain still notices every sound in the room, which can be disruptive to your overall quality of sleep by causing you to turn over, stir, or even wake up. A white noise sound machine provides a steady, ambient sound that is a balance between background and foreground noises, and effectively minimizes the impact of room sounds., Use an eye mask or light-blocking curtains to block out any light, however dim, in your room. Your brain will register any light in a room, even a simple nightlight or streetlamp outside, which will disrupt your body’s natural rhythms and sleep patterns and could prevent you from completing a full sleep cycle., To encourage sleep, our body temperatures decrease. If we are too warm or cold, our sleep may be disrupted by restlessness or even prevented altogether. You can help facilitate healthy sleep by setting your thermostat for somewhere between 60 and 67 °F (15.6 to 19.4°C), which is the best temperature range to ensure that you’re neither too hot nor too cold. What you set your thermostat at within that range depends entirely on what’s most comfortable for you., Don’t drink caffeinated products, such as coffee, tea, and soda, less than six hours before bedtime. Caffeine is a stimulant that impacts your heart, breathing, alertness, and brain activity. Ingesting caffeine close to bedtime may prevent you from going to sleep and disrupt your sleep cycle.If you’re thirsty before bed, consider drinking a cup of warm herbal tea with lemon or lukewarm water.
Caffeine can hide in a variety of places, such as soda pops, chocolate, coffee, and even some pain relievers like Excedrin.

, Initially alcohol acts as a depressant, and may help you relax and even fall asleep. As your body metabolizes the alcohol, though, it transforms into a stimulant. Generally, you should limit your alcohol consumption and stop drinking any alcohol at least three hours before bedtime. This three-hour window gives your body time to metabolize the alcohol and for any stimulant properties to wear off.Drinking less than three hours before bedtime can lead to multiple awakenings throughout the night and degrade your overall quality of sleep.

, It takes about three hours for your stomach to process what you eat and then empty itself. Your body relies on gravity to help it digest food, meaning that you need to be sitting upright or standing after you eat. Laying down during digestion hinders the process and can lead to some uncomfortable side effects, the most common being acid reflux.If you find that you need a snack between dinner and bedtime, consider eating a piece of fruit or a handful of nuts.
You might also swap a snack for a 16-oz. glass of water.

, Nicotine (found in cigarettes and e-liquids) elevates your heart rate, making you more awake. It may also prevent you from reaching deep sleep and nicotine withdrawal may cause you to wake up when you're not fully rested.Talk to your doctor for help quitting smoking.

, Exercise is not only essential for overall health, but is a natural stimulant. Daily exercise for 30 – 60 minutes per day will help your body secrete cortisol, which is a natural hormone that helps your body stay alert during the day. Fortunately, exercise during the day will help you sleep better at night, so just make sure that you do it earlier in the day.Exercise at least a few hours before you go to bed. This will prevent your body from becoming stimulated and keeping you awake when you are trying to sleep

, Exposure to natural light will help regulate your body's production of melatonin at night. Melatonin is a natural hormone your body secretes while you sleep that not only regulates your sleep patterns, but your health and other important biological functions of your body.Spend time outdoors throughout the day by exercising or taking your work breaks outside.
Open your window blinds or curtains in your home or office during the day to expose yourself to sunlight.

Know how to treat a fever.,
Address a cough.,
Deal with body aches at bedtime.,
Treat a sore throat at bedtime.,
Take steps to alleviate nausea and upset stomach.,
Address a runny or congested nose.",How to Go to Sleep when You're Sick1," A fever is thought to be the body's way of fighting infection, so unless the fever is 102°F (38.9°C) or higher (for adults), it is important to let the fever take its course instead of treating it. There are, however, ways to make yourself more comfortable if you're dealing with a high fever at bedtime.


For a very high fever over 102°F (38.9°C), try ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin. Be sure you take the proper dosage as indicated on the package, and call your doctor if the fever is 103°F (39.4°C) or higher or lasts for more than three days.For a lower grade fever, try wearing thinner pajamas, using only bed sheets instead of blankets, or even sleeping in the nude if that's more comfortable. You can also go to bed with damp hair or use a damp rag on your forehead or neck while you sleep, as long as you don't feel overly chilled.;
, Coughing fits are extremely disruptive to sleep. Try elevating your body with a few extra pillows at bedtime, and try to sleep on your side to prevent fluids from pooling in your lungs.


Try taking a spoonful of honey to coat your throat before you sleep. You can also drink tea with honey to reduce the urge to cough as you fall asleep.
If your cough is productive, meaning that you cough up phlegm, try taking a medicine to dislodge some of the mucus about an hour or so before bed. These products are labeled ""expectorant"" and they cause you to spit out the mucus.
You can also try using a cough suppressant or a soothing ointment like Vicks Vaporub.

, It can be very difficult to fall asleep if your body is aching, whether it is from the flu, an injury, or an infection. Calming the ache can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.


Take an over-the-counter pain medication like ibuprofen or acetaminophen 30 minutes before bedtime.
If the pain continues, try heat. Put a hot water bottle over any specific areas that feel achey. If your heating pad has a timed off-switch, it may be safe to use at bedtime.

, Falling asleep with a sore throat can be particularly difficult, since these seem to intensify at bedtime.


Before bed, drink a hot herbal tea made with lemon and honey. You can use any herbal tea like chamomile or raspberry, or create your own by simply steeping slices of lemon in hot water and adding a teaspoon or two of honey. The heat itself will help relieve your throat, so the type of tea doesn't matter as long as it is not caffeinated.
First, take a long-lasting pain reliever like ibuprofen about 30 minutes before bedtime. Then, when it is time to lay down, try using a numbing spray like Chloraseptic or Cepacol. These will temporarily numb the pain so you can fall asleep.
Have a glass of water by your bedside to keep hydrated. Ensure you drink each time you may wake during the night. Cuddle a teddy or heat pack to distract you. Use honey to coat your throat.

, Symptoms like gas, bloating, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea can keep you up all night. Take some medicine before bed, like Pepto-Bismol, and try to get comfortable.


For nausea, you can also try sipping a tea made with ginger. If you have fresh ginger and lemon available, slice them and put them in a cup of boiling water to steep for five minutes. Add a bit of honey and sip this slowly before bed. The ginger and lemon will help to settle your stomach.
Sleep with your body curled around a heating pad, if you have one. If you don't, fill a tube sock with dried corn or uncooked rice and tie the end securely. Heat this in the microwave for a minute; the grain will hold the heat and act as a heating pad.

, If your nose is runny or congested, breathing can be difficult and this can cost you precious hours of sleep. Try these strategies at bedtime:


Elevate your head with an extra pillow or two. Whether you are congested or runny, the extra elevation will help the sinuses drain as you sleep, which should make breathing easier.
Use a nasal rinse like a Neti pot or saline spray right before bed. Blow your nose thoroughly afterwards, take a cold medication specifically for runny or congested noses, and then keep a box of tissues next to the bed. You may still have to blow your nose throughout the night, but the medication should slow down the flow.
If you are congested and having trouble breathing through your nose, coat your lips with a thick coating of lip balm or petroleum jelly and try to breathe through your mouth as you sleep.

Set an alarm.,
Allow light into your sleep space.,
Call out for help in the dream.,
Blink in the dream.,
Jolt yourself awake.,
Fall asleep in your dream.",How to Wake Up from Your Dream1," If you are worried you may have a dream that you will want to wake up from, set an alarm for somewhere after 90 minutes into your sleep. REM sleep happens 90 minutes into sleep,and it is during this cycle of your sleep that you dream, so having an alarm rouse you might help.


Some alarm clocks have more than one alarm you can set, so you can wake up from separate cycles of REM sleep. You can also use a mobile device, many of which allow you to set as many alarms as you like.
Be careful not to do this too often, however, as REM sleep is a beneficial cycle of sleep that helps you process information, build memories, and replenish neurotransmitters, including chemicals that give you energy and help you feel good during the day.;
, Leaving a light on or your curtains open may help interrupt especially deep cycles of sleep in which you dream, essentially making you a light sleeper and possibly helping you wake up from a dream more easily. Again, though, doing so too often might have other consequences on your usual ability to get the full benefits of uninterrupted sleep.

, If you find you are somewhat conscious in your dream and can take action, you might try calling out in the dream. You may experience a situation where you call out in your dream, but it's more of a faint whisper. This could because your mouth isn't open in real life. You aren't actually activating your vocal chords or using air, so no sound is actually coming out. If you concentrate, however, you might be able to speak in real life, waking yourself up.


Think to yourself, ""I'm going to actually call for help."" Some people get the sensation of their brain responding with a no. Continue telling your brain that you will in fact call out for help until the sensation goes away. This might be the second or third time. At this point, try to say something. It may seem harder than usual, and that's because you are actually using your vocal chords. This time, a noise should come out, and you should wake up, realizing that it was all a dream.

, If calling out for help in your dream does not manage to wake you up, you might try blinking. When you blink in the dream, your eyes should close. When you open your eyes again, they may actually open in real life. Doing this may manage to wake you up. This technique requires practice, so give it a try—especially during lucid dreams (see method 2)—often so that you can be ready to utilize it should you want to wake up from a dream. Assuming the technique works for you, you will be ready to wake up in a hurry if you have mastered this technique.

, This technique also works well in lucid dreams, but even if you have not developed this ability, you may still be able to jolt yourself awake. Simply attempt to move in your dream with the hope that doing so will move your body in real life, thereby waking yourself up.


Sleep in a position that will make it easy for you to move around.
In the dream, try to kick your legs or move your arms around.

, Once you know that you are dreaming, and want to wake up, simply fall asleep in your dream. This will cause you to wake up in real life.

The easiest way to do this is to (in your dream) get on your knees with your face on the floor, and stretch your arms behind you. You'll be asleep (aka awake) in no time.
If there are other characters in your dream around you, you might have to tell them not to distract you. It's like falling asleep in real life - you can't do it when everyone's talking.

Establish a bedtime ritual.,
Ensure a comfortable sleeping environment.,
Avoid screens right before bed.,
Go to bed earlier.,
Exercise lightly right before bed.,
Watch what you eat and drink.,
Have a bedtime snack.,
Consider the pet.,
Consider installing an alarm in your home.",How to Go to Sleep when Scared2," Commit to a regular, relaxing routine just before you get in bed. This will send a cue to your body that it’s time to rest.For instance, first take a shower, then dim the lights before getting in bed, then read for 20 minutes. Choose an order of operations that you prefer; it’s the consistency that matters.
Turn the temperature down in your bedroom. This will be especially helpful in convincing your body to go to sleep if you take a warm shower before getting in bed.

, Adjust temperature and lighting to help with this. Keep the lights dim in the evening hours, and make your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.Keep a dim light on. If the dark discomforts you, dispel this uneasiness by keeping a light on. Make sure it isn’t too bright, and is positioned well away from your face.
Try a blue or green tinted cover on a small nightlight plugged into the wall across the room from where you sleep.
Keep it as dark as is comfortable. Light is a natural signal to your body to be awake, so you only want to have the minimum amount of light to prevent feeling frightened.Instead of keeping a light on, simply keep a flashlight by the side of your bed and know that you can quickly grab it if need be.

, Turn off all of the screens in your room. Shut down TVs, video games, computers, and even cell phones an hour before you want to be asleep.Aside from the light that screens emit, the operation of a screen keeps you subconsciously engaged with the world outside your bedroom., Going to bed earlier may seem like it will make it harder to fall asleep, but you will likely not experience as much fear. For one, fear about how much sleep you’re getting will be eliminated.Further, fear felt from sleeping alone is less likely if you’re still hearing everyday noises from outside.
Try getting up earlier too. Getting up before sunrise is incredibly rewarding, and you may even find comfort as the pre-dawn darkness gives way to sunshine.
Don’t take a nap during the day. Napping during the day may contribute to a sleep cycle that makes it hard to sleep at night, which in turns leads to anxiety about getting the proper amount of sleep.

, Gentle, restorative yoga or stretching can calm you down and prepare your body for rest.Sign up for a weekly yoga class, or watch yoga videos to learn some poses.
Poses where you fold forward, either upright or on the ground, can be particularly helpful in calming you down.Breathe with purpose. Whatever the pose, breathing is an important aspect of yoga. A 1:2 pattern is great for relaxation; exhale for 2x the count of your inhale, in whatever increment feels most natural. For instance, if your natural inhale is 3 counts, exhale for six counts. Increase these numbers as you relax. Even without doing a pose, this simple breathing exercise will calm you down.Try a forward fold. From an upright, standing position, fold forward as far as it is comfortable to do so, exhaling and extending your spine. Slide your hands down and around to the back of your legs. As you inhale, straighten your back to a horizontal position, sliding your hands towards the back of your knees. Push your chest gently down through your arms. Exhale and bend back down, hands on the back of your legs all the while. Keeping the knees slightly bent throughout the routine, and allow the head to hang loosely when you’re folded forward. After six folds, hold a forward fold pose for ten breaths.During the day, go for a jog, play a recreational sport, or hit the gym – working out will help you fall asleep later on.
Avoid strenuous activity in the few hours prior to going to bed.

, A proper diet is vital to healthy living, as well as healthy sleeping. Do not eat a large meal within two hours of bedtime, as this can decrease your comfort and interrupt your sleep.Eat breakfast. Fruit and whole grains are great options. Start your day with energy, and prevent the urge to overeat later in the day.
Cut the evening caffeine. Don’t drink or eat sources of caffeine (including coffee, tea, or chocolate) after 4:00 pm.Don’t provide caffeine to children (including soda) after 3:00 in the afternoon., Keep it light, but a snack before bed may help you fall asleep more easily. Try a glass of milk, a small bowl of whole-grain cereal or rice, or a handful of nuts.Caffeine-free tea can also be especially effective in preparing your mind and body for rest, without the extra calories before bed.

, If you think a pet will decrease the fear you feel while falling asleep, consider getting one. On the other hand, if you already sleep with a pet but wake up frequently during the night, consider relegating them to their own resting spot.Even if you don’t think your pet is waking you up at night, they may be diminishing the quality of the rest you’re getting. Try sleeping on your own for a few nights and see if it helps.
Dogs not only comfort their owners, they even add a bit of security to your home. You can train a dog to sleep wherever is most comfortable for you, such as at the foot of your bed.

, Not only will this add security to your home, the knowledge of that security may reduce any nighttime fears for you or your family members.

Listen to the news.,
Check all access points to the room or building.,
Check that everyone is sleeping safely and comfortably.",How to Go to Sleep when Scared3," If there’s something happening in your area and you can’t go anywhere to ensure your safety, monitor the news to stay aware. Both natural disasters and conflict can develop rapidly, and being aware will increase your safety.


Hearing that a storm has passed or that a civil scenario has been resolved can reassure you that you’re safe for the night too.
In the event a dangerous scenario is ongoing, be aware of the additional precautions that may be worth taking to keep yourself safe during the night.
If you’re unsure of the safety of the building in which you’re sleeping during inclement weather, go somewhere else or shelter yourself in an especially sturdy room, such as a basement.
Leave a flashlight or other light source near you while you sleep.

, Ensure that the doors are locked and the windows are secured as best as possible. During extreme weather, you may want to cover or remove glass from your vicinity.


Have someone keep a lookout. Take turns and sleep and monitoring the situation. A lookout can wake everyone up should something disturb the peace and need attending to.

, Knowing that everyone else is safely sleep can be a source of reassurance as you know that everyone will be able to better handle whatever the following day may hold.


If people are still awake, reassure one other. Tell stories and reminisce. Talking will help calm any nerves, and diminish any fear.
Snuggle up. Keep warm, stay together and feel the reassurance of being close to others.

Don’t take medicine that makes you jittery before bed.,
Use the right posture for sleep when congested.,
Use a nasal spray before bed.,
Drink something hot right before bed.",How to Go to Sleep when You're Sick2," If Benadryl leaves you wired, make sure to take your last dose for the evening a few hours before bedtime. Ideally, you would simply use a medication that didn't stimulate you, but sometimes there are not good alternatives available. The best you can do is hope that your response has calmed by bedtime.

, When you lie down, your blood doesn't have to fight against gravity to get to your nose and inflame the veins and tissues there; this is why it might seem like you have to sit up in bed every few minutes to clear up your nose when you’re congested. Prop yourself up with pillows when you’re trying to get to sleep, and let gravity keep nasal inflammation at bay.

, A stuffy nose that impedes breathing is a common reason for being unable to sleep while you’re sick. Use a localized nasal spray right before bed, and reuse as necessary throughout the night to keep your nasal passages clear.


Decongestant nasal sprays reduce swelling in the sinuses and nasal tissues. They’re available both over-the-counter and by prescription, but should not be used over a prolonged period of time — three days at the most.Salt-water nasal sprays don’t have compounds that reduce swelling, but are still effective for loosening mucus and making it easier to clear nasal passages through blowing your nose. These can be used as often as necessary.
Nasal strips are a good alternative to sprays if you find that the sprays keep you awake.

, Sometimes, an illness makes you feel so bad that you lose your appetite for both food and drinks, but keeping your body hydrated is necessary for a speedy recovery. More important to sleep, though, is that a hot drink right before bedtime can soothe a sore throat, inhibit coughing, and clear up congestive mucus that would otherwise make it hard to breathe. Avoid caffeinated drinks, like coffee or caffeinated tea, before bed. Find decaffeinated versions of your favorite hot drink.
You can find teas that specifically help your body fight off colds at the grocery store, like teas with added Vitamin C or Echinacea.

Run a humidifier in your bedroom at night.,
Set the thermostat to a moderate temperature, but on the cool side.,
Keep a dark bedroom at night.,
Maintain a quiet, soothing environment.",How to Go to Sleep when You're Sick3," A humidifier is a machine that produces a mist or steam, increasing the humidity or moisture in the air. The moisture in the air keeps your mucus loose, making it easier for air to get through your nasal passages as you sleep.The noise created by a humidifier might keep you awake, though, so look for a quiet machine. If you're buying a new one, look for online reviews to get an idea of whether it is noisy.
Try keeping the humidifier just outside your bedroom door; this way, you’ll still have some moisture in the air, and the noise will be reduced.

, Extreme temperatures — either hot or cold — will keep you from getting a good night’s sleep. Your brain, which regulates your body temperature without you even thinking about it, tries to achieve different internal temperatures when you are awake versus when you’re asleep. Reducing the external temperature slightly will help your body gear down for rest.The ideal temperature for sleep is 68°F (20°C).

, Though you may think that reading a book or watching TV will help you get to sleep, the light from both of those activities will actually keep you awake longer. When your eyes take in and process light, the nervous system stimulates the parts of the brain that control hormones and body temperature. When this happens, your body chemistry stays wired up for consciousness, and you’ll find it more difficult to fall asleep.When it’s time to go to bed, turn off all light sources and cover up any technology that may have blinking lights that will keep your brain engaged.
Stop using all electronic devices — including phones, tablets, and laptops — at least 30 minutes before bed, if not a few hours, as the blue light emitted from the screens will keep you awake.

, If someone else in your home is listening to music or watching TV with the volume up high, ask them to turn down the volume enough to keep you from hearing it in your bedroom. The less distractions you have, the better chance you’ll have of getting to sleep.

Know how you react to your medication.,
Avoid cold and flu medications that include ephedrine or pseudoephedrine.You might have to read the small print on the packaging to see what’s really in your medication, but avoid these drugs, specifically, if you’re trying to get a good night’s sleep.,
Decode the medication’s packaging.Over-the-counter medications often make claims on their packaging that are geared more toward advertising for sales than informing for treatment.,
Be wary of “nighttime” formulas in general.Although nighttime formulas may well get you to sleep quickly, the quality of sleep you get from such medications isn’t healing, restorative sleep.",How to Go to Sleep when You're Sick4," Even though symptom guidelines are a pretty good indicator of how you will react to a medication, observe your body’s actual response to what you’re putting into your body.


For example, Benadryl makes some people sleepy, but leaves other people feeling unnaturally wired.

, Although these decongestants make it easier for you to breathe, they are also light stimulants that might keep you awake, if breathing clearly.

, It’s good to know what the difference between “non-drowsy,” “nighttime” and “daytime” really is.


“Non-drowsy” medication simply means that there are no ingredients that are meant to induce sleep. This does not, however, mean that the medication is specially formulated to keep you awake or prevent you from getting drowsy. Don’t assume that non-drowsy formulas will leave you unaffected: for example many such formulas include pseudoephedrine.
“Nighttime” or “PM” medication has compounds that are intended to make you sleepy. Be careful about mixing or doubling up on your medications; if your “nighttime” medications already treats fevers or pain, don’t add extra drugs on top of them to target those symptoms.
“Daytime” or “AM” medication may be synonymous with “non-drowsy” formulas, or may have caffeine in them to increase alertness. Read the packaging carefully to see what you’re getting. Don’t assume that “daytime” medications are merely formulas that aren’t specifically designed to make you drowsy; if you take one before bedtime, it may well keep you awake.

, Furthermore, the alcohol used in such medications may dehydrate you as you sleep, actually setting your body back in terms of its healing process.


Some nighttime medications can become habitual; prolonged reliance on these products to get to sleep can disturb healthy sleeping habits.

Clean your vagina.,
Prepare the suppository.,
Get your body into position.,
Open the lips of your vulva.,
Push the suppository into your vagina.,
Dispose of the applicator.,
Store the suppository at room temperature.,
Use suppositories even during your period.,
Insert suppositories at night.,
Watch for side effects.,
Know when to get medical attention.",How to Insert Vaginal Suppositories," Use a mild soap to gently wash the outer parts of your vagina and the area around it. Don’t wash out the inside of your vagina. Make sure to wash your hands well. Rinse your vaginal area and hands to completely remove the soap. Pat your skin dry using a clean cotton cloth.Cleaning your vagina and hands can prevent the spread of bacteria into your vagina as you insert the suppository.;
, Unwrap the suppository applicator from its packaging and determine if it's already pre-filled with the cream or tablet. If it isn't pre-filled, hold the applicator between your thumb and forefinger and use your other hand to place the cream or tablet at the other end of the applicator.To fill an applicator with a cream suppository, connect the tube of cream to the applicator so that it's tightly attached. Squeeze the tube of cream till the correct dose is in the applicator. Remove the tube and save it for your next dose.
The applicator provided for delivering a cream suppository usually has marks on it that tell you how much is in the applicator, such as 1 gram, 2 grams, etc.

, Stand with your legs and knees apart. Raise one foot up on a stool, the edge of the toilet, the bathtub or a chair. Or, you can lay on your back with your knees bent. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart. Both of these positions will give you easier access to your vaginal opening which will make it easier to insert the suppository.

, Use your non-dominant hand to separate the lips (labia) of your vulva. This will expose your vagina. Keep it exposed while you use your dominant hand to place the suppository at the vaginal opening.Although it may seem difficult at first, try to relax. Remind yourself that it will take a little getting used to and you can continue to try until you successfully insert the suppository.

, Insert the suppository applicator or use your forefinger to insert the suppository into your vagina. Push it as far as is comfortable so that the suppository is in your vagina. If you're using an applicator, push the plunger so all of the suppository is delivered to your vagina.You'll know the suppository is in your vagina when about half the applicator is in the vagina or your forefinger is in the vagina up to the knuckle.

, Remove the applicator and completely wash it with some gentle soap and water if it's reusable or throw it away if it's not. Wash and dry your hands. It may take up to an hour for the suppository to completely dissolve. At that point, you may notice leaking if you're up walking around.Follow the manufacturer's or doctor's instructions for your specific suppository.
You probably won't feel the suppository once you've inserted it and you won't need to remove it since it will dissolve in your vagina.

, Suppositories are usually made of either fats or water-soluble polymers. They'll begin to melt in your body once you've inserted them into your vagina. To prevent suppositories from melting before you've inserted them, store them at room temperature. Consider refrigerating them if you live somewhere hot, where they're more likely to melt at room temperature.The melting process will release the drugs, herbs, hormones, or lubricants into your vagina.

, If you've been prescribed a suppository, your doctor believes you'll benefit the most from that delivery system. If you start to menstruate, continue to use the suppositories as your doctor prescribed. Just make sure to use a sanitary pad instead of a tampon.If you forget a dose, just remember to insert the suppository at the next scheduled time. Don't take two doses at once.

, Since the suppositories will leak discharge as they dissolve in your vagina, you may want to insert them at night before you go to bed. If you need to use them during the day, consider wearing a sanitary pad or liner to collect any leakage.Avoid using a tampon to soak up the leakage. Using a tampon will absorb the medication, making it less effective. Tampons will also irritate your vaginal walls.

, Since vaginal suppositories are used for a variety of medical conditions (like yeast or bacterial infections, vaginal dryness, and reproductive hormonal imbalances), side effects may differ. Most side effects don't require medical attention. In general, you may experience:


Vaginal discomfort
Vaginal dryness
Burning or itching
Discharge from the vagina as the suppository dissolves

, Let your physician know if you have any pain or discomfort. If you think you're having an allergic reaction, contact your doctor. Signs of an allergic reaction include swelling of the vagina and vulva area, itching, hives and tightness in the chest. Check the document that came with your suppository for specific allergy risks.


Talk with your doctor about whether or not you should refrain from sexual intercourse while you're using suppositories.If you are having problems using the suppository applicator, then talk to your doctor about this. Your doctor or a nurse may be able to teach you how to use it during an office visit.

Try to realize that you are, in fact, dreaming.,
You can also wear something like a watch to focus on as you drift asleep.,
Try the MILD technique.,
Prevent uncomfortable dreams.,
Try light stimulus.,
Combine different lucid dreaming techniques.",How to Wake Up from Your Dream2," This is called ""lucid dreaming."" Essentially, lucid dreaming is simply becoming aware of the fact that you are dreaming while you are dreaming without waking up.Once you successfully achieve this, you can be in control of your dreams. Lucid dreaming makes the possibilities of your dreams endless, and minimizes the risk of an uncomfortable dream.


Make mental notes about your surroundings/environment when you are awake. When you do this in a conscious state on a regular basis, your psyche will bring these habits into the dream state as well. Then, when you dream, you can identify details about your surroundings/environment that will serve as clues that you are dreaming. Once you achieve this, you may be able to become lucid in the dream state., As long as it's comfortable but not so comfortable that it feels like your normal wear.


Besides just making mental notes of your surroundings/environment, you can explicitly ask yourself whether you are dreaming or awake at various times throughout the day. Again, making a habit of such a practice will very likely carry over into the dream world so that you may recognize you are dreaming once in the dream state, should you ask yourself at that time. This is called the reflection technique., Stephen LaBerge developed the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams (MILD) technique as a means to helping people achieve lucid dreaming. It requires that you try to recall your dreams as completely as possible as soon as possible after waking, then tell yourself that you will remember that you are dreaming as you fall back asleep, followed by imagining that you are already dreaming lucidly and imagining the dream itself, and repeating these steps until you are asleep and dreaming again.If you follow these steps effectively, you may be able to become aware of the dream within the dream, thereby becoming lucid and gaining control over the dream.

, Sometimes, with enough concentration, you can determine what you will dream about before you go to sleep. This is called intentionality, and it is another means to dreaming lucidly.Intentionality, actually, is part of some other methods of lucid dreaming as well, so it is a good idea to practice it as you attempt to achieve lucid dreaming, even if it alone does not end up being effective for you. It is important to note that no lucid dreaming technique works for everyone or the same for everyone. For this reason, it is a good idea to try different methods, intentionality being one.


Intentionality basically just requires that you use your imagination to conceive of the dream you want to have.
Imagine the place you want to be in your dream and especially how you will get there. This can help you plan, in a sense, to dream lucidly.

, There are several products on the market that can help you achieve lucid dreaming through light stimulus. These products are masks that have led lights embedded in them that flash near the eyes if you wear the mask while sleeping. The idea is that you could notice the lights as you dream—particularly if you went to sleep with intentionality—and this could help you remember that you are dreaming, allowing you to become lucid in the dream.In addition to light stimulus, there is even an app for smartphones that helps with intentionality and plays sounds that might help the dreamer become lucid during key parts of the sleep cycle.

, Combinations of techniques to help you dream lucidly strengthen the possibility that you will become aware of the dream within the dream. In order to successfully dream lucidly, try different combinations of the various techniques to see what works for you. Some techniques have even been created via specific combinations.


One technique combines intentionality with the mental notes mentioned above (called reality testing).Another technique combines journaling—waking up to record dream memories in a journal—and analysis of the journal entries for common attributes with intentionality. It is called the wake back to bed (WBTB) technique."

Attempt to manipulate your nightmare away.,
Actively change the dream.,
Voice your desires inside the dream.",How to Wake Up from Your Dream3," Once you are able to achieve lucid dreaming, you may not feel the need to wake up any longer because you can change the dream into something less uncomfortable. Lucid dreaming, however, is different for everyone, and it may not be especially easy for you to change your dream—it may require practice. Nevertheless, once you have realized you are in a dream, you might be able to change things that are happening, and remove whatever is scary and making you want to wake up. This may be better than fully waking yourself up.


Once you are lucid in the dream, you should be able to control the dream. You will have more control if you become more aware of the dream world, so pay attention to your surroundings., One very straightforward way of changing the dream is by simply doing what is is you want to do. The difference, of course, is that you are in a dream, so the constraints of the real world do not apply. A common way of testing this out is to produce a brick wall and put your hand through it. Doing so is a good test of your ability to control the dream, and the realization that you are in control can empower you to change dreams that are making you uncomfortable., Another way of exercising control over the dream if you are dreaming lucidly is by voicing your desires. Try saying whatever it is you want to change about the dream, and you may see results. For instance, if you are being chased, try saying that there is no one chasing you, and you may succeed in making whom or whatever is chasing you vanish. In whatever situation you may find yourself in the dream, voicing your desire to change it may work for you.

Practice awareness.,
Try meditation at night.,
Try safe supplements.,
Be careful as you learn.",How to Use Super Powers in a Lucid Dream1," To become aware that you are dreaming, you have to notice your environment and realize, ""This is just a dream."" Some experts say that practicing awareness of your environment while awake can help you do to the same while sleeping.During the day, look around and notice details like the heat of the sun or the feeling of pain when you stub your toe. With practice and attention, when you are dreaming you should be able to notice the absence or difference in these details, and realize you're dreaming. An additional perk to practicing mindfulness during the day, is it can make your dreams more realistic and easier to remember.;
, Since lucid dreaming typically occurs during the REM sleep cycle, which happens toward the end of sleep or just before waking in the morning, some lucid dreamers recommend setting an alarm for 4 hours after you go to bed at night, and then when you wake up, practicing meditation to enter a lucid dream state.Turn off your alarm but try to stay as asleep as possible. Concentrate on the darkness on the back of your eyelids and on your intent to enter a dream state in which you are in control. Think about what you might want to dream about., Some lucid dreamers use herbal supplements like choline or galantamine to induce a lucid dreaming state. These don't work for everyone, and sometimes can have adverse reactions like sleep paralysis, which is a state in which you are awake, but cannot move. (If this happens, stay calm and relax. If you are frightened, it only gets worse.) If you want to try choline or galantamine, try a small amount once a week. These herbs are available from health food stores in pill form. Some experienced lucid dreamers recommend setting an alarm for 3 or 4 hours after you go to bed at night and taking the supplement then, to reduce the chances that you will experience sleep paralysis or nightmares.Although some books and websites will encourage the use of off-label uses of prescription drugs or even illegal drugs to bring on lucid dreams, these are actually hallucinations and not lucid dreams, and can be dangerous. Some people have harmed themselves or others while using drugs., The definition of lucid dreaming is knowing that you are dreaming, but since lucid dreams typically feel very real, it is a good idea to test whether you are dreaming before trying anything dangerous like eating fire or jumping off of buildings.To test whether you are dreaming, do what is known as a ""reality check.""A reality check helps you ensure that you are actually dreaming. To perform a reality check while lucid dreaming, attempt to do something impossible but not dangerous like floating in the air. If you can do that, then you can advance to harder things that would be dangerous in real life."

Identify which surgical procedure you’ll have.,
Discuss a simple or total mastectomy.,
Discuss a modified radical mastectomy.,
Discuss a radical mastectomy.,
Discuss a partial mastectomy.,
Discuss a subcutaneous mastectomy.,
Anticipate your recovery period.,
Ask about breast reconstruction with your mastectomy.",How to Know when to Call the Doctor After Mastectomy Surgery1," The physical outcome of the surgery will depend upon how much tissue your surgeon removes. In some cases, muscle is also removed to prevent or remove cancerous tissue. This will have an impact on the amount of pain you experience and the potential risks for post-surgical outcomes. You should discuss the various mastectomy procedures available with your surgeon before the operation.;
, During a simple or total mastectomy, the surgeon will remove all the breast tissue but no muscle tissue and not the lymph nodes located under the arm.Women with large areas of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or women who are getting a mastectomy for prophylactic reasons will get a total mastectomy.

, During a modified radical mastectomy, the surgeon will remove all the breast tissue and most of the lymph nodes under the arm. No muscle is removed from beneath the breast.Women with invasive cancer who choose surgery will receive a modified radical mastectomy, so the physician can evaluate the lymph nodes to determine the extent of the spread of the disease.

, During a radical mastectomy, the surgeon removes all of the breast tissue, all of the lymph nodes in the area, and the muscle against the chest wall beneath the breast.This is very rarely performed today, and usually only when the breast cancer has spread to the muscles under the breast.


This procedure is used only when the cancer has not spread to the chest wall. The modified radical mastectomy has proven to have similar results and is less disfiguring than a radical mastectomy.

, During a partial mastectomy, the cancerous area and some of the normal surrounding tissue is removed. A lumpectomy is a type of partial mastectomy, but more surrounding tissue is removed during a partial mastectomy than in a lumpectomy., A subcutaneous or “nipple-sparing” mastectomy means that all of the breast tissue is removed, but the nipple is left. This procedure is not commonly performed because it potentially leaves behind some breast tissue that may later develop cancer.If reconstructive surgery is performed at the same time, the nipple may be distorted and numb following this procedure.

, Recovery periods for each of these different surgeries will depend upon several factors, including your previous medical history, overall health and wellness, and your ability to follow the prescribed exercise routine that increases your flexibility and reduces the risk of lymphedema. Surgeries that remove the least amount of tissue will often have the shortest recovery periods.


Hospital stays average three days or fewer.The skin will heal completely within two weeks if no complications with the surgical incision arise.Your body will continue to adjust over the coming months. You may experience transient fatigue over that period of time, you but will have a better recovery if you continue all of your recommended recovery exercises., Reconstruction of the breast tissue can be done at the time of the surgery using your body tissue or an implant called immediate reconstruction. You can also have reconstruction done at a later time, which is called delayed reconstruction.The need for chemotherapy and/or radiation may delay reconstruction.

Identify other serious symptoms.",How to Know if You Have Toxic Shock Syndrome1," Most cases of Toxic Shock Syndrome produce symptoms that can easily be mistaken for the flu or some other illness. Listen closely to your body to help ensure that you don’t miss such important signs of TSS.TSS can cause a fever (usually above 102 degrees Fahrenheit or 39 degrees Celsius), major muscle aches and pains, headaches, vomiting or diarrhea, and other flu-like symptoms. Weigh your risk for getting TSS (for instance, if you have an oozing surgical wound or are a menstruating young woman using tampons) versus your likelihood of having caught the flu. If it is reasonably plausible that you may have TSS, keep a close eye out for other symptoms.;
, If there is a “telltale” sign of TSS, it is a sunburn-like rash that appears on the palms and/or soles of the feet. However, not every case of TSS includes the rash, and the rash can occur on any part of the body.People with TSS may also notice significant redness in or around the eyes, mouth, throat, and vagina. If you have an open wound, look for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, tenderness, or discharge., Symptoms of TSS usually appear two to three days after infection, and often start off mild in nature. They will, however, progress rapidly as the condition worsens rapidly, so be vigilant in watching for them if you have any inkling that you might have TSS.Watch for a rapid drop in blood pressure, usually accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; confusion, disorientation, or seizures; or signs of kidney or other organ failure (such as significant area pain or signs of improper functioning).

You may experience abdominal bloating or swelling due to cysts. You may also feel some kind of pressure or fullness of the lower abdomen.


You may also experience unexplained weight gain.You may also feel pain at the lower right or the lower left side of the abdomen. Rarely, there may be pain at both right and left sides. The pain may be inconsistent and come and go. The pain may be sharp or dull.;
, Some less common symptoms of ovarian cysts may cause some problems with your normal excretions. You may have some trouble urinating or a feeling of pressure on your bladder. This can cause an increased frequency of urination or difficulty emptying the bladder completely. You may also have difficulty having a bowel movement.If a cyst ruptures, the pain can be sudden and severe, which may cause nausea and vomiting.

, Other uncommon symptoms of ovarian cysts may include sexual discomfort. You may experience pain during sexual intercourse. You may also feel pain in the pelvic area, or in the lower back and thighs. Your breasts may also feel more tender than normal.


You may also experience pain during your menstrual cycle, or experience abnormal vaginal bleeding not during your normal period., There are a number of possible risk factors that may lead to ovarian cysts. If any of these conditions apply to you and you experience the symptoms, you may be have ovarian cysts causing your pain or discomfort. The risk factors include:A history of previous cysts
Irregular menstrual cycles
Beginning menstruation younger than 12
Infertility or a history of infertility treatments
Low thyroid function
Treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer
Smoking and use of tobacco products
Chronic inflammatory conditions

Check for symptoms.,
Consider the potential causes.,
Take a pH test at home.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Undergo a physical examination, including a vaginal exam.,
Get treatment.",How to Know if You Have a Yeast Infection," There are a number of physical signs that may indicate a yeast infection. The most common symptoms include:Itching (particularly on the vulva or around the opening of the vagina).
Soreness, redness, and overall discomfort in the vaginal area.
Pain or burning during urination or sex.
Thick (like cottage cheese), white, odorless discharge in the vagina. Note that not all women experience this symptom.;
, If you are having trouble telling whether or not you have a yeast infection, then consider some of the most frequent causes of yeast infections:



Antibiotics - Many women develop a yeast infection after taking antibiotics for several days. Antibiotics kill some of the good bacteria in your body, including the bacteria that prevents the overgrowth of yeast, which can cause yeast infections.If you have been taking antibiotics recently and are experiencing vaginal burning and itching, you might have a yeast infection.

Menstruation - A woman is most likely to develop a yeast infection around the time of her period. During menstruation, estrogen deposits glycogen (a type of sugar present inside cells) in the lining of the vagina. When progesterone surges, the cells shed in the vagina making sugar available for the yeast to multiply and grow. So if you're experiencing the above symptoms and it is near the time of your period, then you may have a yeast infection.Birth control - Some birth control pills and one-time ""morning after"" pills cause a change in hormone levels (mainly estrogen), which in turn can bring about a yeast infection.Douching - Douches are mostly used to clean the vagina after a period. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, douching when done regularly can change the balance of the vaginal flora and the acidity of the vagina, thus disturbing the balance of good and bad bacteria. The level of bacteria helps maintain the acidic environment and its destruction can cause the overgrowth of the bad bacteria, which in turn causes yeast infections.Existing medical conditions - Some diseases or conditions, such as HIV or diabetes, can also cause yeast infections.General health - Illness, obesity, poor sleeping habits, and stress can increase the likelihood of developing a yeast infection., There is a test that you can take to try to figure out whether you may have a yeast infection. Normal vaginal pH is around 4, which is slightly acidic. Follow any instructions accompanying the test.In a pH test, you hold a piece of pH paper against the wall of your vagina for a few seconds. Then, compare the color of the paper to the chart provided with the test. The number on the chart for the color that best approximates the color of the paper is your vaginal pH number.If the test result is above 4, it's best to see your doctor. This is not indicative of a yeast infection, but could be a sign of another infection.If the test result is below 4, it is likely (but not definitively) a yeast infection.

, If you have never had a yeast infection before or are unsure about the diagnosis, then you should schedule an appointment with your doctor or a nurse at your gynecologist's office. This is the only way to know for sure if you have a yeast infection. It's important to get the diagnosis confirmed since there are different types of vaginal infections that are often misdiagnosed by women as yeast infections. Indeed, although yeast infections are very common among women, they can be difficult to accurately self-diagnose. Research has shown that only 35% of women with a history of yeast infection were able to correctly diagnose a yeast infection from their symptoms alone.If you are currently menstruating, consider waiting until after your cycle finishes to see your doctor, if at all possible. But if you are experiencing severe symptoms, then be seen as soon as possible, even if menstruating.
If you are visiting a walk-in clinic and not your regular doctor, be prepared to give a full medical history.
Pregnant women should not treat a yeast infection before consulting a doctor., To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor will examine the labia and vulva for inflammation, usually without having to do a full pelvic exam. He will then then use a cotton swab to take a sample of vaginal discharge in order to view it under the microscope and look for yeast or other infections. This is called a wet mount and the primary method of confirming a vaginal yeast infection. Your doctor may order additional tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as tests for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).Yeast can be identified under a microscope because it takes a budding or branching form.Not all yeast infections are caused by candida albicans; there are some other forms of yeast as well. Sometimes a yeast culture needs to be performed if a patient continues to get recurrent infections
Remember that there are other potential reasons why you may be experiencing vaginal discomfort, including other infections such as bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. For example, many of the symptoms of a yeast infection are very similar to those of an STI., Your doctor might prescribe you a single-dose tablet of the antifungal medication fluconazole (Diflucan), which is taken orally. Relief can be expected within the first 12 to 24 hours. This is the fastest and most effective cure for a yeast infection.There are also a number of topical treatments available over-the-counter and with a prescriptions, including anti-fungal creams, ointments, and suppositories that are applied and/or inserted into the vaginal area.Talk to your doctor about what might be the best treatment option for you.


Once you've experienced a vaginal yeast infection and had it diagnosed by a physician, you can self-diagnose such infections in the future and cure them with readily available over-the-counter treatments.However, even patients who have had yeast infections in the past often misdiagnose themselves. If an over the counter treatment is not working, see your doctor.
Call your physician if your symptoms don’t improve after three days or any of the symptoms change (e.g., vaginal discharge increases or changes color)."

Wash your vulva daily with suitable soap and water.,
Clean the external areas surrounding the vagina.,
Avoid using a loofah and washing too often.,
Avoid douching.,
Avoid scented wipes, deodorants and feminine products.",How to Keep Your Vagina Cleaner1," Washing your vagina the correct way is important in maintaining a healthy pH balance while also preventing infections. A normal pH level ranges from 3.5-4.5 on a scale of 0-14. To keep a regulated pH level:Use a regular, unscented soap instead of a body wash. Don't put soap inside your vagina.
Some products (such as body washes) have a pH level of 8, which throw off your normal pH level and cause itchiness, irritations, and odor.
Regular soap also doesn’t contain as much alcohol content (scent) compared with body washes.;
, External parts, such as the vulva and the labia majora (the larger outer folds of the vulva), should also be cleaned with soap and water every day.Clean at least once a day to get rid of sweat, traces of urine and discharge that accumulates through out the day.
Use a washcloth or free hand while cleaning.

, Rough and hard washcloths and loofahs can create small tears and expose you to infection. Avoid these and use a soft washcloth or your hand instead.Also, do not clean yourself more than once a day. Excessive cleaning can disrupt the pH balance and lead to dryness., Douching flushes water into your vagina, cleaning out natural bacteria and secretions. You should avoid douching because:It interferes with your pH level and reduces the acidity in your vagina. This can make you more prone to infections.
It will only temporarily cover up smell instead of curing it. If you have a strong vaginal smell, consult with your doctor instead of using a douche.

, Products that contain perfume disrupt your vagina’s pH balance and can cause irritation.


If your concerned with the way your vagina smells consult your doctor.
Vaginal odor changes at different times of the menstrual cycle so don’t always think a bad smell is a sign of infection or illness."
"
Choose what you want to be.,
Use a mirror to shape-shift.,
Act out your new shape.",How to Use Super Powers in a Lucid Dream2," You have to clearly have a goal in mind so that you can focus on it. Concentrating on your goal in a sort of meditative practice helps you control your dream.


You can be anything, but many people enjoy becoming something that will allow you to experience the universe differently, like an alien, bird, or fish. You can also use shape-shifting to confront your fears: for instance, if you have a phobia of spiders, you can shape-shift into one and experience life from its point of view., A clear pond, window, or anything else that gives you a good reflection will also work.


Stare at yourself and will your skin to change and form into the shape you desire. You can also start at one end of your body (for instance, your feet) and consciously think of each part changing.
Some lucid dreamers like to walk through the mirror at this point, fully embracing the alternate persona., This is another method if you don't prefer to use a mirror or if you find it hard to visualize a mirror. Simply behave as if you were the thing you want to become. .


For example, if you want to shape-shift into a dog, go down onto your hands and knees. Start barking, and wag your tail. Pretty soon you'll feel your hands turn into paws and your face change."

Perform a reality check.,
Bounce around.,
Find a high place to jump off.,
Start running.,
Focus on details.,
Don't look down until you feel comfortable with flying.,
Remember that you're dreaming.",How to Use Super Powers in a Lucid Dream3," This is to ensure your safety before you attempt flying. Even if you are confident you are dreaming, other conditions (like being high on drugs or sick with a very high fever) can induce a lucid dream-like state, so you need to be sure you're dreaming. Float up in the air or put one hand through a solid object before proceeding. As long as you can do this, you know you're dreaming and can move on.
Reality checks also have the added benefit of increasing your lucidity. The more you are able to control smaller behaviors, the more likely you will be to do bigger things like flying, which takes more mental focus., Before flying, enjoy the landscape of the dream by bounce around, increasing your height with each bound. This gives you a safety net because your height is not that great.Don't focus on the feeling of landing when you come down, just on the feelings of going up. Keep increasing the height and distance that you bounce., While experienced lucid dreamers can often just float up into the air and start flying, one easy way for the beginner is to jump off something high. This will force your mind to decide that you can fly rather than fall.


If you have the ability and control, you can design your dreamscape with mountains or cliffs. Otherwise, you will have to explore your dreamscape to find a suitable place.

, If you're on a cliff, run towards the edge. If you're on a flat surface, you can still make it work; start running in a straight line, like an airplane taking off.


When you reach the edge or decide you are ready, jump into flight like Superman. It helps to make it seem as realistic as possible, so put your arms out and point your toes behind you.

, Lucid dreaming is a lot like meditation and requires concentration and focus to keep it up. To keep yourself in flight, focus on the feeling of the air in your hair and the sensations of flying.


If you start to lose altitude, aim your body up and surge upwards, imagining a rocket propulsion coming from your toes.

, Once you are steady, looking down at how high you are and how tiny everything below you is can be very enjoyable as long as you're not afraid of heights!


If you are afraid of heights, you have a couple of options: you can try to construct a version of yourself who is not afraid of heights (which can be helpful in overcoming your fear in real life), or you can fly just above the ground, sort of like hovering.

, If you do begin to fall, remind yourself that nothing you are seeing is real. It doesn't matter if you fall.


Sometimes, having this conscious thought is enough to steady your flight and help you stop falling.

Fly like a bird.,
Shape-shift into a flying creature.,
Swim through the air.,
Use a flying aid.",How to Use Super Powers in a Lucid Dream4," Some people find it easiest to fly by flapping their arms like a bird. Combine this with a jumping takeoff for the best results.


You can use each flap of your arms to propel you higher into the air. Change directions by shifting your whole body.

, Another way to fly is by changing your physical body into a creature, made up or real, that can fly. Then you can use whatever method they use to fly. For example, shape-shift into a bird, and then simply flap your wings to go soaring through the air.


You can use a mirror method, discussed above, or simply envision yourself as a bird, bat, pterodactyl, airplane, or flying insect.

, This is another method for flying and has the advantage of allowing you to dive into any bodies of water and swim.


You can use any swim stroke you are most comfortable with, and simply pick up your feet and begin the stroke to lift off.

, You can use a broomstick, flying carpet, or, if you prefer something more realistic, try a jetpack or helicopter.


Imagine yourself in or on the object that will help you fly, then allow it to lift off on its own and fly."
"
Use a gateway or portal.,
Teleport without a gateway.,
Use other tricks to ease the teleportation.",How to Use Super Powers in a Lucid Dream5," This technique involves using a door, mirror, or anything else as a gateway to a different location, planet, or universe.Concentrate on the place you want to reach. Your dream is technically a land in your imagination, so imagine it as well as you can. Then simply open the door or walk through the mirror.
If you don't find yourself in the right place, try again or just explore where you are. The place you wanted might be right around the corner.

, Imagine in as much detail as possible, the place you want to go. Then, will your surroundings to blur and fade, and your new location to fill in the blanks.


You can also try spinning in place, knowing that when you stop, you will be in your desired location.

, Close your eyes and decide that when you open them you will be in the right place (be wary of closing your eyes all the way because sometimes the dream will fade away and you will wake up).


If you can't teleport without a gateway, don't worry. It takes more time and practice without a gateway but you'll get it in time.

Note changes in your level of pain.,
Monitor your temperature.,
Observe the incision and wound area for signs of infection.,
Examine the surgical site for signs of tissue death or poor healing.,
Report allergic reactions to your medications.,
Observe for areas of redness and swelling.,
Watch for any bleeding from the surgical site.,
Stay aware of any signs of phantom pain.,
Look for sign of lymphedema in the area.",How to Know when to Call the Doctor After Mastectomy Surgery2," The extent of discomfort, soreness, or pain will relate to the amount of tissue removed. Most patients experience little to no soreness after the surgery.However an increase in pain, tenderness or soreness can indicate a source of infection.


In other words, if your initial discomfort after the surgery was a three on a scale of one to ten, but it suddenly increases to five or six, it’s time to call the doctor.

, If your temperature rises above 100°F or you experience chills, it is time to call your surgeon.Fever may be an indication that your body is fighting an infection. Evaluation and treatment for an infection will improve your recovery and reduce the problems associated with wound infection.


Surgical infections are especially dangerous because they can lead to sepsis (infection in the blood), poor and prolonged wound healing, well as heart and respiratory problems., You must have your doctor address any signs of infection immediately to prevent further complications. Wound infections will be characterized by redness, swelling, and tenderness that increases instead of getting better after surgery. The area of redness around the incision will grow as well.Incisions can be washed with soap and water, but should not be covered with creams or ointments unless directed by your doctor. Do not submerge your incision in a tub or pool.
Wound infections can also have a bad odor.

, In addition to infections, reduced blood supply to the area after surgery can also lead to skin separation and/or dead tissue (necrosis). Flap necrosis occurs in 18 to 30 percent of women who have a mastectomy.This tissue death is caused by a lack of oxygen supply to the tissue used to cover the breast area after surgical removal of the breast tissue. If you suspect that the tissue is not healing, swells, gets numb, is leaking blood, smells bad, is changing color or “just isn’t right,” you should call your surgeon for an evaluation.


Skin flap necrosis will cause the tissue to become a dark red and then the color begins to turn black as the skin cells die. This is because a hematoma develops under the flap, which reduces the perfusion to the flap.
The skin over the incision area may also separate. If this happens you should call your doctor immediately for evaluation and treatment.Separation of the skin will not allow for proper healing and increases the risk of infection. Your doctor may prescribe the use of a breast binder, which can take tension off of the wound and help with healing.

, Reactions to medications can result in rash, itchy skin, difficulty breathing, coughing, or nausea and vomiting. Report these reactions to your doctor. Request a change in medications to if you are experiencing excessive pain or if you feel the medication is too strong.Constipation is a common side effect. Talk to your doctor about over the counter medications that can help.

, Not all redness and swelling means an infection. It can also relate to the development of a hematoma. These may occur over the incision site or in nearby areas to the surgery but will look different from an infection. The changes are related to the release of blood in the area and will appear just like a bruise would if you were bumped.Small hematomas will turn black and blue and be absorbed by the surrounding tissue. However, because the tissue in the area is compromised from the surgery, any indication of hematoma should be evaluated by your surgeon.Large amounts of blood must have a needle evacuation to reduce the potential of ischemia (lack of oxygen and blood supply) to the area, which increases the risk of flap necrosis., Any bleeding from the incision that leaks out from your dressing after discharge from the hospital is not normal and must be reported to your doctor.Some oozing of clear fluid is not a major issue. However, it continues for more than one or two days, or if it changes appearance, contact your doctor.

, If you feel pain in the breast tissue that is no longer there, this is a phantom pain. You may experience itching, pins and needles feelings, pressure, or throbbing. Your doctor can prescribe medication, as well as suggest massage and exercise techniques to minimize phantom pain.


There is no evidence to suggest that phantom pain indicates the recurrence of cancer in the remaining tissue., Because lymph tissue may be been removed, it disrupts the flow of lymph fluid.This disruption can create swelling in the area that is often preceded by a feeling of tightness or reduced flexibility anywhere between the arm and the wrist.


Lymphedema ranges from the very mild (barely noticeable) swelling to extreme swelling that makes the arm difficult to use. Left untreated, extreme swelling can lead to secondary infection, fibrosis (thickening and scarring) of the overlying skin, restricted range of motion, and a rare form of soft tissue cancer.You can treat lymphedema with exercises, wrapping, massage, and compression garments depending upon the extent of the problem. Consult your doctor to learn treatment techniques best suited to your specific case."
"
Discuss pain control methods with your doctor before discharge.,
Talk with your doctor about an exercise program after your mastectomy surgery.,
Begin simple exercises after you get permission from your doctor.,
Attend all of your follow-up appointments.,
Progress your exercise program based on professional recommendations.",How to Know when to Call the Doctor After Mastectomy Surgery3," You will probably be discharged with prescribed pain medication. Your physician may also recommend using ice packs over the area to reduce pain, tenderness, and swelling. Use a towel between the ice and skin to prevent cold injury and don’t use for more than fifteen minutes., Women who have participated in an exercise program to improve mobility in their shoulder and chest muscles report greater mobility and less pain one year after the surgery than those women who did not.Your physical therapist can design an exercise program you can perform at home to improve your outcomes.

, Although they are simple exercises, they will still help to improve the mobility in your arm.However, if there is a risk of flap necrosis or skin separation, your physician may want you to delay any movement and exercise until the risk is over. Some of these exercises include:Use the arm on the same side as the surgery to perform your daily living activities, such as combing your hair, getting dressed and eating.
Lie down with your arm elevated above your heart for 45 minutes three to five times a day to help reduce the swelling in your arm after surgery.
Each time you are elevating your hand and arm are above the level of your heart, exercise your hand and arm by pumping your hand 15-25 times, then bending and straightening the elbow 15 to 25 times. This helps to pump the lymph fluid out of your arm.
Practice deep breathing exercises frequently for the first two weeks. This helps your lungs to fully expand and reduces the risk of developing pneumonia.

, Both your surgeon and your oncologist are likely to schedule a number of follow-up appointments to evaluate your recovery and your treatment. Make sure you attend all of these appointments since your doctors can make changes to your treatment plan based on these exams.


Bring a notebook with you to take notes, and always take your medications or a medication list to each appointment.

, Your physician and physical therapist will design your exercise program to meet your needs and stay within your limitations. General guidelines include:Some tightness in the chest and armpit area is normal and will gradually recede.
Burning, tingling, and soreness on the back of the arm may increase in the first two weeks after surgery. Exercises will help reduce the swelling and irritation to the nerves.
You might find it helpful to do your exercises after a warm shower when your muscles are more relaxed.
Do the movements and exercises slowly. Don’t push, bounce, or otherwise overstretch the area you exercise.
Breath deeply while exercising.
Do your exercises twice a day.

Seek immediate medical help if you suspect TSS.,
Prepare for a substantial but usually successful treatment regimen.,
Take special precautions against recurrence.",How to Know if You Have Toxic Shock Syndrome2," When caught early, Toxic Shock Syndrome is usually highly treatable. However, undetected TSS can progress rapidly and result in lengthy hospital stays and (in rare cases) irreversible organ failures, amputations, and even death.Play it safe. If you have symptoms of TSS, or if you have possible symptoms plus risk factors for TSS (like ongoing nosebleeds or extended female contraceptive use), get medical assistance right away.
Unless otherwise instructed when you contact medical assistance, immediately remove the tampon you are using (if relevant in your situation)., Although TSS can almost always be treated successfully when detected early, hospital stays of several days (sometimes in the ICU) are not uncommon. In most instances, the frontline treatment involves the use of one or more antibiotics.Symptom-based treatments will also occur based on the particulars of you case. These can include the provision of oxygen, IV fluids, pain or other medications, and sometimes kidney dialysis.

, Unfortunately, once you have had TSS, you are approximately thirty percent more likely to get it again in the future. Therefore, you need to make some lifestyle changes and keep a keen eye out for symptoms if you want to avoid a severe recurrence.For example, if you have ever had TSS, you should not use tampons (rely on pads instead). You should also find alternate means of female contraception other than devices like sponges or diaphragms.

"
"
Use tampons cautiously.,
Follow the recommendations for using certain types of female contraceptives.,
Watch for other potential causes of TSS that can affect anyone.",How to Know if You Have Toxic Shock Syndrome3," When first identified, Toxic Shock Syndrome seemed to occur almost exclusively in menstruating women who used extra-absorbent tampons. Increased awareness and product changes have significantly reduced the overall number of incidents of TSS related to tampon use, but they still account for half of all cases.TSS is caused by staph (usually) or strep bacteria that release toxins into the bloodstream and (in a small percentage of people) cause a major immune response with serious side effects. However, it is still not entirely clear why using extra-absorbent tampons that remain inserted for long periods of time is the greatest risk factor for TSS. Some theorize that the extended insertion period creates ideal conditions for bacteria growth, while others believe the tampon dries out over time and causes small cuts and abrasions when removed.Regardless of the cause, your best defenses against TSS as a menstruating female are to use pads instead of tampons whenever possible; use the least absorbent tampons necessary and change them regularly (every four to eight hours); store tampons in a cool, dry place that does not promote bacteria growth (so, not in the bathroom); and wash your hands before and after handling a tampon., While they cause far fewer cases of TSS than tampons, vaginally-inserted female contraceptives of the sponge and diaphragm varieties must be used with care. As with tampons, the length of time in which the device remains inserted seems to be the key factor in the possibility of developing TSS.Basically, keep sponge or diaphragm-style contraceptives inserted for only as long as necessary, and never for more than twenty four hours. Also store them somewhere that doesn’t get warm and humid (and foster bacteria growth), and wash your hands before and after handling., Women, and especially young women, comprise a significant majority of all cases of TSS, but it can affect male and female, young and old alike. If the staph or strep bacteria enters the body, the toxins are released, and the body’s immune system responds in “overdrive,” then any person can develop a serious case of Toxic Shock Syndrome.TSS can also occur when bacteria enter open wounds, after a woman gives birth, during a case of chickenpox, or when packing for a nosebleed is used for prolonged periods of time.
So, clean, bandage, and re-bandage wounds thoroughly and regularly; change nosebleed packing regularly or seek other methods to reduce or stop the nosebleeds; and be vigilant about following health and hygiene recommendations.
Young people are more likely to get TSS, and the best current theory as to why is that older people have built up a greater immunity. If you are a teen or young adult female, then, be especially vigilant against TSS."

See your doctor.,
Have a pelvic exam.,
Expect to take a pregnancy test.,
Undergo imaging tests.,
Treat ovarian cysts.",How to Know if You Have an Ovarian Cyst2," If you know you have an ovarian cyst and experience either sudden abdominal pain or pain along with nausea, vomiting, and fever, call your physician or go to the ER right away. If you experience cold, clammy skin or any rapid breathing or lightheadedness, call your physician or go to the ER right away.


If you are postmenopausal and have an ovarian cyst, you should know that this puts you at higher risk for ovarian cancer. You should be evaluated using an ultrasound and have a blood test for CA125 and/or OVA1. These are markers for a number of different conditions, including ovarian cancer. OVA-1 is more specific for ovarian cancer. If there is any suspicion that the cyst may be cancerous, the cysts should be removed., The symptoms of ovarian cysts are not diagnostic. To really know if you have an ovarian cysts, your doctor will perform a pelvic exam. Your doctor may be able to feel for swelling that is consistent with ovarian cysts.Depending on your other symptoms, your doctor may want to order more tests to measure hormone levels and to rule out other conditions may be ordered as well.

, A pregnancy test is also likely to be ordered by your doctor. If you are pregnant, you may have a corpus luteum cyst. This type of cyst occurs when your egg gets released, and the follicle fills with fluid.Your doctor may also want to rule out an ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy occurs with the embryo implants itself somewhere other than the uterus.

, If your doctor determines that you have a cyst, you will likely have to have some imaging tests, such as an ultrasound. These imaging tests are used to locate and characterize an ovarian cyst.The imaging tests will help your doctor determine the size, shape, and exact location of the cyst. It also helps your doctor learn if the cyst is filled with fluid, solid, or mixed.

, For most women, watchful waiting is recommended as long as the symptoms are manageable. Remember, most ovarian cysts disappear on their own. For some women, using hormones in the form of birth control pills may be recommended. About five to 10% of women may need surgery to remove cysts.Small complex cysts can be removed from a laparoscopy. In a laparoscopy, the doctor will make a small cut on your belly and remove the cyst through cuts in your skin.For more severe, large, or potentially cancerous cysts, you may undergo a laparotomy. A larger cut is made in the belly, and the entire cyst or the ovary may be removed.

Learn the causes of ovarian cysts.,
Know that functional cysts are not serious.,
Identify nonfunctional cysts.",How to Know if You Have an Ovarian Cyst3," During the monthly cycle, one or both of a woman’s ovaries release an egg. Cysts can form in the ovary because of hormonal problems or imbalances, an obstruction to fluid flow, an infection, conditions producing a chronic inflammation such as endometriosis, inherited conditions, pregnancy, age, and a number of other causes.Ovarian cysts are quite common in women during the reproductive years and most have no symptoms. These are called functional cysts. Most of the time, functional ovarian cysts resolve without treatment.
Ovarian cysts are less common after menopause and do put any postmenopausal woman with cysts at a higher risk for ovarian cancer.

, Functional cysts are either follicle cysts, which occur in the area of the ovary where individual eggs mature, or corpus luteum cysts, which occur in what is left of an empty follicle after the egg has been released. These are a normal part of the function of the ovaries.Most follicle cysts are painless and disappear in one to three months.


Corpus luteum cysts usually disappear in a few weeks, but can get large, get twisted, bleed, and cause pain. Corpus luteum cysts can be caused by drugs (like clomiphene) used in fertility treatments.

, There are other types of ovarian cysts that nonfunctional. This means that they are not related to normal ovarian function. These cysts may be painless or cause pain. They include:Endometriomas: These cysts are generally related to a condition called endometriosis where uterine tissue grows outside the uterus.
Dermoid cysts: These are formed from embryonic cells from the woman, not from a fetus. These are usually painless.
Cystadenomas: These cysts can be large and filled with a watery fluid.
In Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a large number of cysts are formed. This is a condition very different from having a single ovarian cyst.

Eat a healthy diet.,
Practice safe sex.,
Have regular checkups with your doctor.,
Wear comfortable and dry clothing.,
Change your menstrual products regularly.",How to Keep Your Vagina Cleaner2," The key to maintaining vaginal health is a nutritious and well-balanced diet as well maintaining proper hydration. Add the following foods to your diet to promote vaginal hygiene:Cranberry juice may help treat and prevent yeast infections.Yogurt may help maintain vaginal pH balance.Soy products help with vaginal dryness and act as a natural lubricant.Nuts and wheat contain vitamin E that help prevent vaginal dryness while also aiding in keeping your skin healthy.Water helps your body function correctly and is essential for the health of the mucous membranes, such as those in your vagina. These membranes rely on proper hydration so getting enough water is essential.
Drinking 8 glasses of water a day also promotes natural lubrication and a milder vaginal scent., Practicing safe sex helps prevent against harmful bacteria and sexually transmitted diseases and promotes vaginal health.Always use a condom when having sex, especially if you are not in a monogamous relationship.
Make sure to always change condoms when switching from anal or oral sex to vaginal sex. This will help prevent harmful bacteria from entering into the vagina.
Use lubricants when having sex. Lube helps prevent the skin of your labia and vagina from becoming irritated.
Lubrication occurs naturally but some women don’t produce enough. Using an artificial lube can help prevent friction and irritation.
Avoid petroleum jelly or other oil-based products as these can break down the latex in condoms, making them ineffective and can cause infection to the vagina.You may also want to shower after having sex so you can remove bodily fluids and residue from the condom that may otherwise cause irritation or infection.

, In order to maintain good vaginal health it’s important to have regular checkups with your gynecologist.


During a gynecologic exam, your doctor will take a pap smear that can help diagnose diseases (such as cancer) or disorders that can affect the health of your vagina as well as your reproductive system.As you reach the ages of 21, your gynecologist will begin cervical screening. These screenings look for changes in the cervix and are used for diagnosing cancer., Keeping your vagina clean and dry is important to reduce the risk of infection and overgrowth of bacteria. Some fabrics can increase heat and moisture in the vagina so avoid the following:Wear cotton underwear instead of thongs.
Avoid wearing tight-fit clothing.
Change out of wet swimsuits and sweaty workout clothes immediately after you’re done., When you’really having your period, your vagina is constantly moist so changing products regularly is vital. Extra moisture and warmth can lead to infection.Change pads or tampons every 2-8 hours during your period.
When you’re not on your period, avoid wearing pads or panty liners to absorb vaginal discharge. These can lock in moisture, which can promote infection if exposed to bacteria or yeast. If you need to use panty liners, change them regularly.

Diagnose and treat yeast infection.,
Diagnose and treat bacterial vaginosis.,
Prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).",How to Keep Your Vagina Cleaner3," Yeast infection is a common vaginal infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans yeast.Overgrowth of Candida albicans can happen due to antibiotic use, pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, impaired immune system or changes in your normal vaginal flora.
Symptoms of yeast infection include itching and burning, painful urination, gray or white vaginal discharge that is thick, pain during sex, and redness/swelling of the vulva.Yeast infection can be treated with antifungal ointment, tablet or suppository, such as butoconazole (Gynazole-1), miconazole (Monistat 3), clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin), and terconazole (Terazol 3).In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication called fluconazole (Diflucan).
Reduce your risk of yeast infection by avoiding douching, wear loose-fitting pants, avoid pantyhose, and change wet clothes as soon as possible., This condition is caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina and is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44.Bacterial vaginosis is thought to result from imbalance in the normal vaginal bacteria. New or multiple sexual partners and douching may disrupt the balance and lead to switching from “good” to “harmful” bacteria.Bacterial vaginosis may be symptomless or you may notice white/gray vaginal discharge, pain or burning, or fish-like odor. Itching inside and outside the vagina may also occur.
Bacterial vaginosis may make you more prone to sexually transmitted diseases.
Sometimes this condition can go away without treatment but your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics. Best way to prevent bacterial vaginosis is to maintain proper vaginal hygiene that supports normal healthy bacterial balance., STDs are bacterial, viral or parasitic infections are transferred from partner to partner during unprotected sex. More than 20 types of STDs are known (such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, and trichomoniasis).Many STDs can be symptomless but if you do experience symptoms they may include unpleasant odor, white, clear, yellow, or green vaginal discharge, itching, and painful urination.Some bacterial and parasitic STDs can be treated with antibiotics whereas others have no cure, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and genital herpes, but can be managed with medications.If you suspect you have an STD, contact your doctor immediately and/or make an appointment for testing.

Note that pessaries come in different sizes. Your doctor should supply you with a pessary based on the size he or she determines you'll need.

, Grab the pessary on either side of the knob and use your fingers to fold the ring in half.Examine the pessary closely. If you're using an open ring pessary, you should see notches along the inside. If you're using a ring-with-support pessary, you should see openings along the center support structure. Both of these areas are the flexible points you will need to fold, and you should grab the ring in between these points. The pessary should only be able to fold in these areas.

, Use your fingers to apply a small dab of lubricant to the end of the ring without the knob.

The lubricant should be applied over the entire folded end of the pessary on the opposite side of the knob. This edge is the edge you'll be inserting first.

, Stand, sit, or lie down with your legs apart. The pessary can be inserted from any of these positions, so use whichever feels most comfortable to you.If you choose to sit or lie down, your knees must be bent and your legs should be spread apart as far as possible without causing discomfort.
If you choose to stand and are right-handed, place your left foot on a chair, stool, or toilet with your right foot on the ground. Lean over your left leg while inserting the pessary.
If you choose to stand and are left-handed, place your right foot on a chair, stool, or toilet with your left foot on the ground. Lean over your right leg while inserting the pessary.

, Use the fingers of your non-dominant hand to spread apart the lips of the vagina.


You should still have the folded pessary in your dominant hand. Use your dominant hand to insert the pessary.

, Carefully push the folded, lubricated end of the pessary into the vagina. Push it back as far as possible without causing discomfort.


Note that the pessary should be inserted lengthwise into the vagina.

, Let go of the pessary. As you do, it should unfold and return to its normal shape.


If the pessary does not feel comfortable, use your index finger to rotate it. The knobbed end should face upward, and you should not be able to feel a pessary once it has been properly positioned.

, Remove your hands from your vagina and wash them again with soap and warm water. Dry well with clean paper towels.


This completes the insertion process.

, A properly fit, properly placed pessary should not feel uncomfortable. In fact, it should hardly be felt at all.


You should also check the fit by bearing down or attempting to use the bathroom. The pessary should not fall out during either action, and you should not have any difficulties using the bathroom after placement.
If altering the placement of your pessary does not resolve any discomfort or other problems, the pessary may not be the right size or style. You will need to consult your doctor at this point.

, You should remove the pessary at least once a week and clean it before inserting it back into place.


Ideally, you should remove the pessary and clean it once a day. Some women may even choose to remove it at night, clean it, and re-insert it in the morning, but you should check with your doctor to verify that leaving it out overnight is acceptable for your condition.
When cleaning the pessary, use mild soap and warm water. Rinse the device and dry it with clean paper towels before inserting it again.
If you are unable to easily remove and insert the pessary on your own, you should go to the doctor every three months for professional examination and cleansing. Never leave a pessary in for more than three consecutive months without cleaning it.

, While you should be able to urinate without difficulty, the pessary may fall out during a bowel movement. If it does, you will need to clean it thoroughly before inserting it again.


Check the toilet after each bowel movement to determine whether or not the pessary has fallen out.
If the pessary did fall out, scrub it clean with mild soap and hot water. Allow the pessary to soak in rubbing alcohol for 20 minutes, then soak the device in clean water for another 20 minutes. Wash it once more with soap and water, rinse it, then dry it before inserting it into the vagina again.

, Even if you are able to remove, clean, and insert the pessary at home, you should still schedule an examination with your doctor every three to six months.


Your first examination should actually be after two weeks or so. Your second examination should occur within three months after that.
Continue seeing the doctor every three months until a full year passes. After using the pessary for a full year, you can usually schedule an examination for only two or three times a year.

, Before removing the pessary, you should wash your hands with mild soap and hot water. Dry them thoroughly with clean paper towels.

, Position your legs apart while standing, lying down, or sitting. You should be able to use the same position used while inserting the pessary.


Remember to keep the legs apart and the knees bent. If standing, place your non-dominant foot on a stool and lean over that leg during the removal process.

, Insert your index finger into your vagina and locate the rim of the pessary. Hook your fingertip under or over the rim.


More precisely, you should locate the knob, notch, or opening along the rim and hook your finger into that.
Note that the pessary should be just beneath the pubic bone.

, Use your finger to tilt the pessary slightly, then gently pull it down until it slides out of the vagina.You should only need to tilt the pessary by about 30 degrees.
Folding the pessary may help you remove it, but it will not fold as completely as it did during insertion. The vaginal walls should usually stretch adequately well for you to remove the device even without folding it, however.
If you have difficulty sliding it out, bear down as though you are having a bowel movement. This action can help push the rim of the pessary forward, making it easy to grab and pull out.

, After removing the pessary, you should wash your hands again using hot water and soap. Dry well.


Clean or discard the pessary as needed after removing it.
This step completes the removal portion of the process.

Progesterone deficiency is not the cause of every miscarriage, but scientific research indicates that adequate amounts of progesterone are needed to support the early stages of pregnancy.Progesterone levels naturally increase during each menstrual cycle once ovulation has occurred. This allows for the uterine wall to thicken to provide support for the pregnancy. This is called the luteal phase.Once the released egg has been fertilized, the lining of the uterus provides protection for the egg as it begins to develop. After the first few weeks, the placenta takes over, producing the additional hormones and nutrients needed.Some women have naturally lower levels of progesterone. Some studies suggest that low levels during the first few weeks of pregnancy can cause the uterine lining to be inadequate to support the pregnancy, causing the miscarriage. Evidence for this is limited, however.Inadequate levels of progesterone needed to support the early stage of pregnancy are sometimes referred to as a luteal phase defect.;
, Using progesterone vaginal inserts may help prevent early miscarriage, depending on the cause of the miscarriage.The scientific literature supports the use of vaginally applied progesterone, via inserts or suppositories, to help maintain the lining of the uterus to support the pregnancy.While other ways to administer progesterone are available, such as injections, oral dosing, and topical creams, for women with luteal phase defects and recurrent or unexplained miscarriages, this is the recommended method of delivery., ART helps to induce pregnancy by using procedures that remove the eggs from the woman, combine them with sperm in a laboratory setting, then return them to the woman’s body, or to another woman’s body.There are many methods that help couples to achieve pregnancy. ART is one only one method. Women that participate in ART require supplementation of hormones, like progesterone, to help their bodies create a healthy environment to maintain the pregnancy., Progesterone administered by either intramuscular injection or by vaginal products have been shown to be effective in establishing the initial higher levels of progesterone needed during ART.Injectable progesterone is sometimes used but carries additional risks for complications since progesterone is very rapidly absorbed and is quickly changed into other chemicals.By altering the delivery system of the injection, the active progesterone can remain in its desired chemical form as long as possible. This means altering the liquid, or vehicle, the active drug is placed in, by using oils, such as peanut oil. Do not use this form of progesterone if you are allergic to peanuts.Possible complications from progesterone injections include developing an allergy to the inactive ingredients, abscesses and pain at the site of injection, and unwanted bleeding into the muscle tissue., Vaginal delivery products produce lower systemic levels of progesterone, but higher levels in the endometrium, which is the goal.A product designed to deliver progesterone in this manner, and specifically in the group of women that are using ART, is a progesterone gel product currently marketed under the brand name of Crinone®.Crinone® is available containing either 4% or 8% of progesterone. The 8% product is recommended for use in women participating in ART.Avoid using Crinone® in some situations. This product should not be used if you are allergic to any progesterone products, have unusual vaginal bleeding, have ever had liver problems, cancer of the breast or genital organs, or blood clots. If you have had a recent miscarriage, see your doctor first., Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling in your face, mouth, or throat.Emergency medical care is also warranted if you experience pain in the calves or chest, sudden headache, numbness or weakness, especially if you notice this to be on only one side of your body, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood. Emergency care is also needed for problems with your vision or speaking, feeling dizzy, faint, or problems with balance, changes in vision or speech, chest pain, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, pain or swelling in the legs, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, low grade fever, or changes in your urine., Amenorrhea is the medical term used when a female is not having a period, when she should be.Amenorrhea can be classed as either primary or secondary. The features of primary amenorrhea involve the absence of a period in a 15 to 16 year old girl who has otherwise gone through normal developmental changes.Secondary amenorrhea is diagnosed when a woman who has had regular menstrual cycles stops having her period.In many cases, the cause of secondary amenorrhea can be changes in your routine, excessive weight loss, eating disorders, excessive exercising, stress, and pregnancy.Other causes for secondary amenorrhea can include medications taken for other medical conditions, such as schizophrenia or chemotherapy agents used to treat cancer. Medical conditions that can cause secondary amenorrhea include polycystic ovarian syndrome, thyroid function abnormalities, and tumors found near the pituitary gland in the brain., Your doctor will do lab work and run tests to look for any underlying medical causes for your amenorrhea.


In some cases, your doctor may prescribe progesterone supplements to correct the problem. Progesterone helps cause a withdrawal bleed similar to your period. You do not necessarily have a progesterone deficiency if you have amenorrhea., Short-term use of either oral medication, progesterone injections, or vaginal gel, may be prescribed to help balance your hormones and cause you to resume your regular periods.If you continue to have problems with abnormal cycles, your doctor may prescribe oral contraceptives that contain progesterone to help establish a regular cycle. He or she will monitor your progress to determine the best time to discontinue the medications., Get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling in your face, mouth, or throat., The use of low-dose hormone replacement therapy, now referred to as menopausal hormone therapy, involves products that contain small amounts of estrogen and progesterone, or their derivatives.Use progesterone to treat symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. Some women begin to notice changes that are consistent with menopause, even before they have stopped having their menstrual cycle. This time is referred to as perimenopause.In some women, progesterone products can be used to help manage symptoms of perimenopause.Research supports the use of progesterone supplementation during this time, as natural levels of female hormones are starting to change., Progesterone products come in several different forms, including oral tablets, vaginal gels and inserts, injections, and topical creams. A prescription strength topical cream is often prescribed to help with symptoms of perimenopause.To use the cream, a small amount is rubbed into the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or other areas where the skin is soft, either once or twice daily., The symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause can be disruptive to your normal routine, and severe enough to treat.Talk to your doctor to determine if combination products that contain both estrogen and progesterone may help to provide the increased progesterone levels your body may need, while maintaining a balance in both hormones.
Women with a uterus require both estrogen and progesterone to treat menopause symptoms with hormones. Women without a uterus do not require progesterone to treat menopause symptoms and should use estrogen only. Using a combination product if you do not have a uterus may increase your risk of breast cancer, heart attack, or stroke., Over time, men also experience changes in naturally occurring hormone levels.In men, progesterone plays a key role in the production of testosterone.As men age, progesterone and testosterone levels drop, and the balance in hormone shifts to make estrogen the dominant hormone.Some of the symptoms men experience when progesterone levels drop can include low libido, hair loss, weight gain, fatigue, and depression.Talk to your doctor if you are male and are noticing these changes. Your doctor will run tests to determine the levels of many different hormones to determine the best course of treatment., If your doctor prescribes medications that contain progesterone or a combination of estrogen and progesterone, get emergency medical help if you have any signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction include hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling in your face, mouth, or throat.Emergency medical care is also warranted if you experience pain in the calves or chest, sudden headache, numbness or weakness, especially if you notice this to be on only one side of your body, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or coughing up blood. Emergency care is also needed for problems with your vision or speaking, feeling dizzy, faint, or problems with balance, changes in vision or speech, chest pain, pain spreading to the arm or shoulder, weakness or numbness in an arm or leg, pain or swelling in the legs, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, low grade fever, or changes in your urine., Your doctor can provide direction, specific to your body and your situation, that can help you choose the best way to increase your progesterone levels.Your doctor is your best resource to understanding the changes or problems you are experiencing. Discuss supplements and lifestyle adjustments with your doctor to be sure that is the best option for you.

, Vitamin C, vitamin E, l-arginine, vitamin B6, selenium, and beta carotene have all been shown to increase progesterone levels.While natural sources of these supplements are part of a healthy diet, the vitamin or supplement content found in natural sources is not enough to make a difference in increasing your progesterone levels. Consider using manufactured products that contain higher concentrations of vitamins and supplements., Studies have shown the following amounts to be beneficial in increasing progesterone levels:


Consume 750mg of Vitamin C per day (increased progesterone levels by as much as 77%).Consume 600mg of Vitamin E per day (Increased progesterone in 67% of patients studied) .Take 6gm per day of L-arginine (improved serum progesterone in 71% of patients) .Take 200mg to 800mg per day of vitamin B6 (reduces blood levels of estrogen and improves concentrations of progesterone) .Add selenium to your daily vitamin doses (consuming selenium at any dose was shown to improve progesterone levels) .Consume more beta-carotene (studies in animals showed improvement in progesterone levels and fertility) ., Losing weight, avoiding large meals, eating a high protein and low carbohydrate diet, decreasing saturated fat intake, and increasing consumption of unsaturated fats, are recommended to improve your levels of progesterone.Studies in overweight women show that losing as little as 5% of your body weight improves your progesterone levels.In an animal study, the amount of available food was controlled during early pregnancy, resulting in higher levels of hormones needed to support pregnancy in the group that was not allowed to over eat.Dietary changes that included higher amounts of protein and lower amounts of carbohydrates were positively correlated to improving progesterone levels in the women studied.One animal study showed significant increases in progesterone when the diet was higher in omega 3 and omega 6 products contained in flaxseed, combined with a lower intake of saturated fats., While dairy products contain only small amounts of progesterone, research has shown a significant increase in progesterone levels in men when they consumed three servings per day of high-fat dairy products., The nicotine found in cigarettes can interfere with the way your ovaries naturally produce hormones, which disrupts processes involved with normal cyclic functioning.Cigarette smoking also adds to the risk of serious, and possibly life-threatening, adverse events when combined with products that contain estrogen or progesterone., Stress only adds to the complications that are already at work as you are trying to provide a healthy hormonal balance.Use relaxation techniques that help you to breathe more deeply and stretch your muscles to reduce tension.Take time out for a massage, and routinely take part in activities you enjoy.Take care of your body by getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and participate in physical activity on a regular basis."

Keep the area clean.,
Change the dressing often.",How to Heal Vaginal Tears1," There are four types of tears that you may get when you have a child. First degree tears are thin tears of the skin. Second degree tears are tears that involve the skin and muscle. These are the least serious types of tears.Third degree tears go down through the perineal muscles and into the anal canal. Fourth degree tears go into the anal canal and rectum.;
, Any vaginal tear from childbirth needs stitches. The doctor will place minor stitches along the tear for first and second tears. Third and fourth degree tears need more involved stitching. Each layer of skin and muscle needs to be sewed separately.For third and fourth degree tears, the doctor will focus on stitching together the muscles that support the anus and rectum.

, No matter the degree of the tear, you should keep the area clean. This can help reduce bacteria and help prevent infection. Wash your vaginal and perineal area multiple times each day.Pat the area dry with a clean towel. Make sure to dry from the front to the back so you don't get bacteria from the rectum in your vagina.

, Make sure to change the dressing or sanitary pads every four to six hours. This helps to keep the wound clean and reduces the risk of bacteria."

This is because reduced levels of estrogen during the luteal phase (starts from the ovulation day where the egg is released from the ovary) leads to a drop in serotonin.


The brain chemical serotonin is responsible for the regulation of mood and sleep patterns and gives a woman the feeling of well-being. A reduction in serotonin will cause mood changes in a woman.;
, You may experience an inability to concentrate or remember things. When hormones in a woman are functioning normally, the level of estrogen aids in regulating the level of cortisol (a stress hormone).


Cortisol can affect the function of neurotransmitters - brain chemicals used for communication.
As estrogen levels drop, cortisol levels are no longer controlled .properly. As a result, neurotransmitters start to malfunction, creating lapses in memory.

, As a result of PMS, your libido can be decreased. Norepinephrine or noradrenaline is a brain hormone that controls sleep, arousal, and emotions. A decrease in this hormone results in a loss of interest in sex.


When ovulation starts, estrogen levels drop. This also reduces the levels of norepinephrine because estrogen competitively inhibits the enzyme responsible for inactivating norepinephrine, thus stimulating its production.

, Hormonal imbalances during menstruation can result in the overproduction of androgens – male hormones present in both men and women.


This produces a flare-up of acne by overstimulating the oil glands and changing the development of skin cells that line the skin’s hair follicles.

, The breasts have many hormone receptors such as progesterone and estrogen which are affected by small changes in the balance of hormones.


The breasts undergo multiple changes each month in preparation for breastfeeding. The ducts in the nipple swell and become tender during PMS because they are filled with fluids.

, During ovulation, the body will send a twinge of sharp pain or a series of cramps to one side of the lower abdominal area (this is the side that a woman is ovulating). This shows that the egg has already matured and is being released by the ovary.

, The brain chemical serotonin is responsible for the regulation of a person’s sleep pattern.


Reduced levels of estrogen during ovulation cause serotonin to drop, resulting in difficulty in sleeping.
This difficulty sleeping can also lead to fatigue.

, Aldosterone levels increase during the start of ovulation (also known as the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle).


This hormone is also called the anti-diuretic hormone because it prevents excretion of water from the body through urination. It does this by reabsorbing sodium; since sodium attracts water, water cannot be excreted easily.
High levels of aldosterone cause accumulation of fluids in different parts of the body, leading to bloating during PMS.

, Estradiol, which is the major component of the estrogen hormone groups, decreases hunger by affecting the appetite center of the brain (which is located in the hypothalamus) directly.


During the first half of the cycle, estrogen dominates. In the second half, there is a surge in the level of progesterone.
Unlike estradiol, progesterone stimulates the woman’s appetite by opposing and blocking out estrogen’s effects on the brain. As a result, a woman may crave specific foods at certain times during her menstrual cycle.

, Estrogen increases the production of opioid and endorphin by the hypothalamus, which are natural painkillers. Reduced levels of estrogen during ovulation makes the body vulnerable to various kind of pain, so you make experience more headaches and muscle or joint pain.

, In the second half of the menstrual cycle, there is a surge in the level of progesterone. This hormone affects the contractility of the gastrointestinal tract, which can result in an upset stomach.

, Reduced levels of estrogen during ovulation cause the body to compensate by finding other sources of estrogen.


Fat cells have the ability to produce estrogen, so during PMS a woman’s body converts calories into fat in order to increase the levels of estrogen.
Unfortunately, fat cells do not burn calories the same way as muscle cells do, which causes weight gain.

, There is no single test to diagnose premenstrual syndrome. However, there are some strategies that doctors may use to help identify its presence.

, Thyroid disorders often occur in women of childbearing age. Some symptoms of thyroid disorders such as weight gain are similar to the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.


Therefore, the doctor may order a test to evaluate thyroid function. Thyroid hormone blood tests are done by getting a blood sample from the patient’s vein using a sterile needle and syringe.

, The doctor may ask you to keep a diary to assess the frequency and severity of your symptoms. This can determine if the symptoms correspond to certain times in a your monthly cycle.


While symptoms may vary from month to month, a pattern or trend can appear after tracking the symptoms for a few months.
If a woman notices that symptoms occur frequently within a time span of 5 days before a period is due or begin up to 15 days before, she must inform her physician for further medical management.

, Premenstrual syndrome can also be very similar to premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMDD is a severe and sometimes disabling extension of premenstrual syndrome.


Although PMS and PMDD can have both physical and emotional symptoms, PMDD can produce extreme mood shifts that can disrupt a woman’s work and damage her relationships.
In both PMDD and PMS, the symptoms usually start 7 to 10 days prior to the start of the period and may continue for the first few days of the period. However, in PMDD, at least one of these emotional and behavioral symptoms stands out.
Possible symptoms include: anxiety, extreme moodiness, marked irritability or anger, sadness or hopelessness.
In both PMS and PMDD, underlying depression and anxiety are the common denominator. So, it is possible that changes in the level of hormones during the menstrual cycle can trigger the worsening of symptoms.

, PMS symptoms can also be very similar to perimenopause. Perimenopause means ""around menopause"" and refers to the time when a woman is approaching menopause. This usually occurs during a woman’s 40s but can be noticed as early as mid-30s.


PMS and perimenopause are both caused by hormonal imbalance and their physical and emotional symptoms are usually the same.
However, PMS symptoms correlate with the menstrual cycle because the symptoms disappear once a woman gets her period unlike in perimenopause. Perimenopause symptoms continue throughout the menstrual cycle and continue even if a woman has her period.

, Researchers believe that the main factor in the development of PMS symptoms is the balance of hormones during the menstrual cycle. PMS tends to develop 7-14 days before menstruation occurs.


During the menstrual cycle, a matured egg is discharged from the ovaries for potential fertilization. Normally, five days before menstruation occurs, the female hormone estrogen is released by the ovaries.
Estrogen aids in thickening the uterus which will sustain an embryo if fertilization occurs. During the 14th day, ovulation (a process wherein matured egg is released) occurs.
Following the process of ovulation, the luteal phase (last phase) of the menstrual cycle starts. In this phase, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome commonly appear.

, Experts think that estrogen and progesterone interact with neurotransmitters in the brain to affect mood and add up to other PMS symptoms. The neurotransmitters that are believed to be affected by estrogen and progesterone hormone during the menstrual cycle include:


Serotonin. This controls mood and sleep patterns. It also generates feelings of well-being. A drop in the level of estrogen during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle may be associated with a decline in serotonin levels. Reduced levels of serotonin contribute to the development of anger, yearning for carbohydrates, depression and irritability, which are all signs of PMS.
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This is linked with depression and anxiety which can be heightened by the production of progesterone.
Endorphins. These intensify feelings of pleasure and reduce pain. Endorphins can be affected both by estrogen and progesterone hormones.
Norepinephrine and epinephrine. These affect the body’s response to stress. The production of estrogen can disturb the production of these neurotransmitters, which can affect the blood pressure, heart rate and mood of a woman.

, Some studies reveal that an unhealthy diet - particularly one that lacks in certain vitamins and minerals - can aggravate PMS symptoms. Such a diet may include:


A disparity in calcium and magnesium levels and a deficiency in B6 and Vitamin E.
A high intake of salty foods, leading to bloating and fluid retention.
Consumption of alcohol and coffee, which may exacerbate mood swings during PMS.
A high intake of simple carbohydrates that can boost irritability, water retention and other PMS symptoms. Simple carbohydrates are present in white bread and sugary snacks.

, However certain diets and vitamins are good to take during PMS such as:


Complex carbohydrates that could elevate the levels of serotonin. Reduced levels of serotonin can contribute to PMS-related depression. Complex carbohydrates are found in vegetables and whole grain.
Multivitamins rich in folic acid which are vital for a growing fetus, should fertilization occur.
Calcium supplements combined with Vitamin D help to keep the bones strong, which may facilitate a reduction in PMS symptoms. An exact explanation as to how diets rich in Vitamin D and calcium could ward off PMS symptoms is still being researched, but it is believed that it may have something to do with calcium’s effect on estrogen during the menstrual cycle.
Vitamin B6 can help to alleviate PMS symptoms, specifically depression. However precautionary measures should be taken as high doses of Vitamin B6 (500 mg to 2000 mg per day) can cause nerve damage.

Be aware of the risks of Essure removal.,

Give yourself time to heal.",How to Have Essure Sterilization Reversed," You should speak with your doctor about why you want to have Essure removed. This will help the two of you come up with a plan for dealing with your concerns.


If you want Essure removed because you want to get pregnant again, your doctor might suggest trying in vitro fertilization without removing the Essure device. You should discuss this thoroughly with your doctor, because it's not clear what the chances are of getting pregnant using this method.
If you want Essure removed because you're concerned about the side effects you’re experiencing, you should ask your doctor to run tests to ensure that any pain or discomfort you’re feeling is because of the Essure coils. The most common side effects of Essure are pelvic pain, heavy bleeding, and cramps, but these could be symptoms of other issues, too.;
, Once you decide to have Essure removed, you need to find someone to perform the procedure. Not all doctors perform this type of procedure themselves, but they can often give you a referral to someone who does.


Make sure the doctor you are referred to has experience with removing Essure. If your doctor can't give you a referral, you can research doctors and clinics that do using a Google search. Make sure any doctor you choose is certified for this type of procedure and has good reviews., The exact cost of an Essure removal will vary depending on the procedure and the doctor performing it, but the average cost of Essure removal runs between $6000 and $7500.


Your insurance may or may not cover the procedure, so you should find out before you make an appointment.
Some clinics and doctors offer payment plans for the cost of the procedure. You should discuss these options with the surgeon (or surgeons) you are interested in before you schedule the procedure., For the easiest removal, you should schedule your procedure within three months of having Essure inserted. It takes about three months for scar tissue to fully form around the inserts and totally block the fallopian tubes. Getting Essure removed before this process is totally complete will be much easier - and therefore cost you less.The Essure removal itself usually takes about 90 minutes and is often performed as an outpatient procedure. However, different doctors will use different procedures for removal, and the type used will depend on a lot of different factors, including how long it's been implanted., Ensure removal carries risks, and doing this - and thus locating the coils - before the procedure can help avoid complications. The makers of Essure recommend doctors perform this imaging to prevent post-removal complications., This procedure allows the surgeon to remove the Essure birth control without removing the entire fallopian tube. The surgeon will cut a small slit in the fallopian tubes in order to access the coils and remove them. This is the procedure for removal recommended by the makes of Essure.


Make sure your doctor has experience with this particular procedure, because it requires making a slit in the fallopian tube. Not every doctor has experience doing this so you want to be sure your doctor knows what they’re doing.
A salpingostomy is NOT the same thing as a salpingectomy, which is the complete removal of the fallopian tubes. Make sure you are clear about the type of procedure you are interested in., In some cases, a complete hysterectomy – the removal of uterus, fallopian tubes, and cervix – might be required. This is not the only way to have Essure removed, but certain mitigating circumstances might require it.


Hysterectomies can cause other types of medical issues, including pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when organs sink into the vagina because the uterus is not there to provide a barrier.
This is something you should discuss in great detail with your doctor. If your doctor immediately suggests a hysterectomy, you might want to get a second opinion.

, This type of procedure requires that the surgeon dissect the fallopian tubes, remove the Essure coils, and reconnect the tubes to the uterus. This procedure allows most women to conceive naturally after the removal.


Because this procedure requires cutting a hole into the uterus to reattach the fallopian tubes, it can be dangerous for women who want to conceive. In some cases, the hole in the uterus can cause the uterus to rupture during pregnancy, which can be fatal to both mother and baby.

, It is possible for Essure coils to break while they are being removed. If this occurs, you may end up with pieces of the coils still in your body, which is very dangerous and can lead to similar - or worse - symptoms than having the Essure in place. Hence, it is important to have your uterus imaged before any procedure and to find a doctor who has experience with Essure removal.

, Having your Essure birth control removed doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get pregnant and there can be issues if you do become pregnant after Essure.


Most studies put the chance for pregnancy after Essure removal between 30 and 40%.This in comparison to about an 80% chance of conceiving after ceasing hormonal birth control, although age also factors into that percentage.Women with the best chance of getting pregnant after having Essure removed are those that have never had any other kind of surgery on their uterus or tubes.If your Essure birth control moves too far into the uterine wall (part of the coil actually protrudes into the uterus) it can cause issues with pregnancy later on. You should discuss these situations with your surgeon after Essure is removed., The amount of time it takes you to heal depends on the type of procedure used to remove your Essure birth control. Listening to your body is the best way to avoid prolonging your recovery time.Women who undergo outpatient procedures should feel relief within days. Most women recover within two weeks.
Women who undergo more serious surgery, including hysterectomy, will have a much longer period of recovery.

Be more fluid in your motions, and refrain from jerking your legs or arms abruptly as you walk., Wearing heels tends to make the hips sway more without your trying.Start with lower, wider heels if you are not used to wearing them. (Try no more than 2-inch heels at first). You can slowly work your way up with time. Don’t try stilettos first—they can be quite daunting to those new to heels.You might want to practice wearing heels at home before you try them out in public.

, Unless you're going for high femme (ultra-feminine) movement, you won’t want to exaggerate the swing of your hips. While a lot of women have a natural swing to their step, a lot of girls don’t sway their hips as much as you might think, often because girls aged 7 to 11, don't have the same shaped hips as fully mature women. (The movies tend to portray more than usually feminine walks)., This will have the effect of narrowing your stride somewhat. It will also contrast the traditionally masculine gait, in which men often walk with feet splayed. If you aren’t used to this, it might seem awkward at first. Heels can help with this as well., Turning the feet inward will help to narrow your stride, but you can also consciously narrow it by bringing your foot in front of the other as you walk. You need not go all the way, as this will produce a more catwalk-like walk, than a traditional casual feminine walk., With the traditional masculine gait, arms are often kept wide, not immediately on the hips. While you will still swing your arms as you walk, you would swing them closer to your sides than you are perhaps used to. , Decreasing the distance between steps can help with the sway of your hips and narrowing your stride, as well as smoothing your stride. The traditional masculine gait usually includes wider steps. Consciously (at first) shorten the distance between steps until it feels comfortable. Some people, in some nations consider a long stride, very unfeminine. , This can help smooth out your stride by helping you move with your lower body rather than your upper body. It will also help you not to plod heavily. Your arms should more easily fall closer to your body with this posture. , Walking at a slower pace can help you focus on adding a fluidity to your movement. You’ll want the pace to still be a reasonable one or you’ll look like you’re struggling in your heels (you might well be). The slower movement will also keep you from appearing as stiff as you walk., Standing up straight can be either feminine or masculine, but in order to put all the steps together confidently for a traditional girl's walk, you need to stand straight as you walk. Align your head above your heart, and this may help you feel confident and feminine as you stand up straight., Traditionally, men tend to carry their shoulders more parallel to their bodies than women. Standing straight with your shoulders back, helps you sway your arms around your hips and create a more traditionally feminine walk., Putting your chest forward can be daunting if you don't feel confident about it, but it will likely make you feel confident once you do. This again will help with the walk by helping you sway your arms in a more traditionally feminine manner., If you want to improve your girl-walk, you'll want to practice. No one, not even models or actors, are born with the gait they have. They learn it like nearly everyone else, through practice and watching other people. Once you feel like you've got it down, then you should be able stride confidently in public., If you have a friend you trust, you can ask them to help you get the walk right. It's even more helpful if they already know the walk themselves, but anyone you trust can help, by giving you feedback on the way it looks.Make sure you can trust the friend to be nonjudgmental, especially if you're trans or non-binary. You might want to vet them before asking for their help. You could say, ""So, as you know, I've been transitioning, and I was thinking of working on my walk."" If they react negatively, you may need to find another friend.

, If you don't feel able to confide in a friend, or you would rather just work alone, you can record yourself with your phone or other camera or use a mirror. This way you can see what you look like and compare it to what you want it to look like. You can watch movies or videos of women walking online (there are tutorial videos for walking like a girl), but any movie from Hollywood is likely to contain an exaggerated feminine walk. You may want to go to YouTube or indie films for a broader variety of feminine gaits., In order to get the walk to where you want it, you'll need to relax. Remember to breath as you walk. If it helps, try breathing into each step you take. If you're dealing with negative thoughts about your attempts, find a mantra to say back to those thoughts, such as, ""I'm learning and no one gets it right the first time,"" or ""I choose my walk, and no one else."""

Go to the doctor if you notice something out of the ordinary.",How to Have a Healthy Vagina," It may seem counterintuitive, but washing your vagina with soap, whether it's bar soap or liquid, isn't the best way to keep clean. The vagina actually stays quite clean on its own without the help of outside cleansers.Like other parts of the body, the vagina has a pH level that needs to be maintained within a certain range - 3.5 and 4.5, to be specific - in order to prevent the growth of unhealthy bacteria and facilitate the growth of good bacteria. Using harsh cleansers can upset the balance, leading to infection, irritation, and even bad smells.


People often refer to the entire area ""down there"" as the vagina, but remember that the vagina is actually the tube-like muscle located inside your body. The vulva, the skin outside the vagina, may be cleansed with no-frills bar soap, as long as you don't find that it irritates your skin.
If you do wash your vagina with soap, make sure to thoroughly rinse it with warm water so that no traces of soap are left behind. Soap left inside the vagina can cause irritation.;
, Douching with chemicals that are supposed to make your vagina smell like a field of flowers actually ends up having quite the opposite effect. They wash out all the healthy bacteria that helps your vagina stay clean and infection-free. The chemicals left behind by douches can cause irritation and even burning, and the same goes for feminine sprays. If you keep your vagina healthy using other methods, there will be no need to try to make it smell different.


Scented creams marketed as a way to change the smell of your vagina can cause the same problems, so these should also be avoided. The same goes for scented pads and tampons and scented wipes.
If you feel like you absolutely have to use a scent on your vagina, go for something completely natural and chemical free. You can make your own body spray by mixing a few drops of an essential oil like rose, lavender or lemongrass with water in a spray bottle. Use the body spray after showering, and make sure you're completely dry before getting dressed.

, Many women experience an increased rate of vaginal infections when they're menstruating, since having blood in the vagina changes its pH and throws things out of balance. To stay healthy during your period, practice the following habits:


Change your tampon frequently. Tampons absorb menstrual blood, and if you leave them in too long, you're keeping the blood in your vagina where it can change your pH. Make sure you change your tampon every few hours to keep this from happening.
Don't use pads or panty liners for longer than necessary. Wearing pads and panty liners all month long or after your period is over can lead to skin irritation.
Consider getting a menstrual cup. These rubber cups are inserted in the vagina to catch the blood, then rinsed out with hot water every few hours. Menstrual cups are a chemical-free choice for handling your period, and they can be really helpful if you tend to get irritated by tampons and pads.

, It's important to wipe from front to back, rather than the reverse, to keep fecal matter from entering your vagina and causing an infection. Use plain, unscented toilet paper to wipe. Avoid using wet wipes or any other product that contains perfumes and chemicals.

, Cotton underwear dries quickly and allows air to flow freely through the fabric. This prevents the development of damp conditions that promote the growth of yeast and unhealthy bacteria that might lead to an infection. Underwear made from synthetic fabrics, silk, lace, or other materials doesn't breathe as well.


If you like wearing underwear made from fabrics other than cotton, make sure the section of the underwear that will be touching your vagina has a cotton liner.
If you tend to get a lot of vaginal infections, try picking underwear made from organic, undyed cotton that hasn't been treated with any chemicals.

, Stretch pants, skinny jeans, and tights trap moisture against the skin and prevent airflow, often leading to yeast infections. Try wearing looser, lighter fabrics that breathe well. Go for skirts and dresses more often, and choose thigh-high tights instead of the kind that pull up around your waist. Pick out shorts that are on the looser side, too.

, Wearing a wet bathing suit or wet workout clothes for a few hours leaves you prone to getting a yeast infection. Make sure you change into clean, dry underwear as soon as possible after swimming or working out. You might even want to keep an extra pair on hand for unexpected situations when you might find yourself in need of a fresh pair.


If you decide to shave the area around your vagina, be very careful not to cut yourself with the razor. Use shaving cream (making sure not to let any get inside your vagina) and take your time shaving around the folds so you don't accidentally get hurt.
Waxing is another option that many women choose. If you go this route, make sure you do some research and choose a reputable waxing salon that uses clean products and wax. Waxing salons with unsanitary practices can cause the spread of bacterial infections.

, When you have sex with a partner, you're opening yourself up to bacteria and other microscopic substances that can end up irritating your vagina and causing an infection. The solution? Wash your vagina with hot water after sex. This will greatly minimize the chance that your encounter will have an unpleasant after effect.


Asking your partner to wash before sex is also a good idea, especially if you aren't using condoms.
Washing other body parts before sex can be helpful, too! If you're especially prone to getting infections, try taking a shower with your partner before having sex to minimize the risk that you'll end up with unhealthy bacteria in your body.
Use dental dams and gloves as an extra form of protection if you receive oral sex or are being fingered.

, At the very least, pee after sex, even if you intend on washing, too. When you have sex, unwanted bacteria can travel up the urethra, which is connected to your bladder. Peeing after sex can help flush the bacteria out of the vaginal area, promoting general health and helping you avoid those pesky UTIs., The pH of semen is basic, whereas the pH of the vagina is acidic. When semen is left in the vagina after sex, it upsets the balance in the vagina, leaving it prone to bacteria growth. Using condoms or another barrier method eliminates this problem. If you don't want to use condoms, wash the semen away right after sex so it doesn't have time to change the pH of your vagina.

, Yogurt has the same kind of ""good"" bacteria that your vagina needs to stay healthy.You can replenish your body's bacteria by making yogurt part of your daily diet. Eating yogurt is a great way to both prevent and treat yeast infections.


Other foods besides yogurt also help your body in this way. Kimchi, kombucha, and other fermented foods can be substituted for yogurt if you aren't a big fan.
Yogurt pills are also available if you'd prefer not to ingest yogurt on a daily basis.

, Cranberries, pineapples, strawberries, and other fruits help to freshen the smell of the liquids secreted by the vagina. Eating fruits won't exactly make your vagina smell fruity, but it can help you develop a more pleasant scent if that's something you're concerned about. Fruit also has a high water content, and staying hydrated helps flush the body of toxins that can lead to bad smells.

, Garlic has properties that kill yeast, making it an effective tool for preventing and treating yeast infections. Eating cooked or raw garlic a few times a week is a great way to keep your vagina healthy. It has also been said to help get rid of bad vaginal odor.

, Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and the pubococcygeus muscle. These muscles tend to get looser and weaker with age and after giving birth. Strengthening them can help you avoid issues like urinary incontinence and also increase sexual pleasure.To do kegel exercises, follow these steps:


Locate your pelvic floor muscles. To do this, pretend you are stopping urination in midstream. The muscles you use to stop are the ones you are targeting with kegels.
Tighten the muscles and hold for three seconds, then release. Repeat this 15 times.
Continue doing kegel exercises daily, holding for longer and adding more repetitions as you gain control.

, The vagina is also strengthened through sexual activity and pleasure, since sex keeps it toned and elastic. Having regular intercourse is a good way to keep yourself in shape. Focus on tightening and releasing the vagina during sex to exercise the vagina as much as possible.


Using a vibrator can help you achieve the same effect.
Jade eggs, vaginal cones, ben wa balls and vaginal barbells are also implements designed to exercise the vagina through ""weight-lifting"" techniques., Most women experience yeast infections now and then, and they can usually be combated with over-the-counter antifungal creams or suppositories. The treatments come in doses that are taken over a period of 1, 3, 5, or 7 days, depending on how severe your infection is. Most yeast infection treatments also come with anti-itch cream that can be used to help with itching and burning around the vulva area.If you aren't sure that what you have is a yeast infection, you should see a doctor to double check. Yeast infection symptoms include curd-like, yellowish discharge with a bad smell, itching and burning in the vaginal area, a rash on the vulva, and burning or soreness.
If your infection still won't go away after a week or so, make an appointment with your doctor to get prescription medication that will wipe out your infection.
You can also try doubling your daily intake of yogurt or other fermented foods to increase the levels of ""good"" bacteria in your body.

, Vaginitis can be caused by yeast infections, bacterial infections, parasites, and other causes. It's characterized by a discharge with a fish-like odor, burning and itching, and a rash around the vulva. You can buy over-the-counter creams to combat the uncomfortable symptoms, but you should go to the doctor to figure out the cause and receive a prescription as necessary., Sexually transmitted diseases such as HPV, chlamydia, genital warts, and others can cause long-term damage if left untreated. If you have unprotected sex and feel there's a possibility you could have contracted an STD, make an appointment with your doctor or go to a health clinic. In many cases you'll be able to get free testing.

, Many women aren't familiar with the way their vaginas look and feel, so they aren't aware when something changes. Every vagina is different, and it's important to know how your vagina normally looks, feels, and smells so that when something changes, you'll notice and seek medical attention if necessary. Go to the doctor if you notice a stark change in color, warts or other bumps, discharge that smells or looks different, or if you have pain in your vagina.

Perform breast exams yourself.",How to Have a Gynecological Exam," Routine appointments should be scheduled at a time between your periods. The doctor will not be able to complete the full exam if you are on your period the day of your appointment.If you are having an urgent problem, let the office know that. Schedule for the first available appointment. Proceed with seeking the medical care you need.
If this is your first gynecological exam, let the person scheduling the appointment know. The office may schedule the appointment differently to get started with your medical record, and accommodate any special needs for young women during their first exam. Note that routine gynaecological exams can be performed by family physicians (and generally are). There is no need to see a gynaecologist (a specialist) unless your family doctor suspects more severe concerns that require a higher level of medical training to be fully addressed.
It is recommended to have your first gynaecological exam in your early twenties, or within three years of the onset of sexual activity (whichever comes first). The recommendations vary depending on location as it is a loose guideline, so if in doubt ask your family doctor at what age you should be seen for your first full exam.
Be aware that any young woman or teen that is sexually active, having problems with their menstrual cycle, or has not started their cycle by the age of 16, should be seen for a routine gynaecological exam by their doctor.;
, Take your bath or shower within 24 hours of your appointment, and avoid using products you would not normally use.Avoid sexual intercourse for 24 hours before the exam. Irritation from sexual activity may cause some of the test results to be difficult to interpret.Avoid feminine products prior to the exam. Do not douche or use any feminine deodorants, sprays, or creams for 24 hours before the appointment.Dress appropriately. Remember you will be removing your clothes. Try to avoid wearing clothing that is hard to get in or out of.

, If it makes you feel more comfortable, bring a family member, such as your mother or older sister, or a friend with you.Your family member or friend can stay in the waiting area, or go through the entire exam with you.

, This is your chance to ask anything about your sexual and reproductive health. That includes questions about birth control, safe sex practices, sexually transmitted diseases, changes about your body, and what to expect in the future., Answer thoroughly and honestly. Your doctor needs to have as much information as possible in order to effectively treat any existing problems, and work with you to prevent future complications.Some medical offices will have you answer questions about your medical history by filling out forms, while others may do this in person.
Be prepared to discuss your sexual history. Your doctor will need to know if you are sexually active. He or she may ask about breast, abdominal, vaginal, or sexual problems, that you don’t think are normal. That includes being taken advantage of sexually, or sexual abuse.Your doctor will also ask about your current and past use of contraceptives.

, Be able to tell the nurse or doctor the first date of your most recent period, and the age when you had your first period. They may also ask the age that your breasts began to develop.They will ask if your periods are on a regular cycle, such as every 28 days, how long they usually last, and if you have any problems, like bad cramps, while you have your period.They will ask if you have episodes of spotting, or bleeding, between your periods. They will likely ask how heavy you bleed during your periods. You can usually answer this by telling them how many pads or tampons you need to use, especially for the first 48 hours of your cycle., This may include unusual vaginal discharge, bad odor, itching in your vaginal area, unusual pain or discomfort in your abdomen or vaginal area, pain during sex, and any changes, pain, or problems with your breasts.Your doctor has the option to order STI (sexually transmitted infection) testing for you if either you or your doctor has a concern. A urine test can be done for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea, and a blood test for HIV, herpes, and/or syphilis.
There is no harm in undergoing STI testing if you have any concern at all, as there are effective treatments available if you do have an infection, and treating it sooner rather than later can help to avoid long-term complications. For instance, treating chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea from the outset prevents the long-term development of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), which is when the infection has been around for a while and can lead to other complications like fertility issues down the road or the development of chronic pelvic pain.

, Urine or lab work will be done to confirm the pregnancy. If your pregnancy is confirmed, your appointment will include additional steps and your doctor will help to arrange for your obstetrical care all the way through delivery.

, Parts of the exam can feel awkward. Talking to your doctor during the exam can help you to feel more relaxed. Ask the doctor to explain what he or she is doing as they are doing it.If you are being examined by a male doctor, a female nurse will be with you at all times during the exam. If one is not present in the room, ask for a nurse to be with you.
The external areas will be examined, then an internal exam will be done. The external areas examined include the clitoris, labia, vaginal opening, and rectum.
The internal exam includes the use of a speculum to check the vaginal canal, cervix, perform the Pap smear, and take other tissue samples if needed. A digital exam is performed to feel the uterus and ovaries.The entire exam takes only a few minutes., After the routine tests and medical questions are completed, you will be given a gown and asked to undress. Remove everything, including your panties and your bra, unless the nurse tells you otherwise., Gowns used for gynecological exams have openings in the front. This allows your doctor to examine your breasts.Much of the time, the gowns used are made of paper. An additional paper cover may be provided that goes over your lap.

, The breast exam comes first. The doctor will touch your breasts and move his or her hands in a circular and linear motion.


The doctor will check the breast tissue that extends up into your armpit area. Your doctor will also check your nipples for any abnormalities.
The breast exam is done to check for any lumps or abnormalities. If you feel any discomfort during this procedure you should tell the doctor., You will need to position yourself so your feet can fit into holders, called stirrups.This allows your legs to be spread apart to aid in the next parts of the exam. Relax your legs and let them fall open., The external exams allows the doctor to examine the area for any signs of irritation, infection, or abnormalities in the tissues surrounding your vagina and urethra, which is the duct that allows you to pass urine from your bladder.The doctor will examine the area visibly, and may touch tissues in the area to examine them more closely. For example, if your labia is red or inflamed, the doctor may spread the labia to examine for any abnormalities.

, Next, the doctor will insert an instrument called a speculum. The speculum may be plastic or metal. A metal speculum may feel cold as it is inserted.


This will slide into your vagina, then will be gradually opened to allow the doctor to examine the vaginal canal and cervix.This causes a feeling of pressure but should not be painful. If you feel pain, tell the doctor. Speculums come in different sizes, so another one can be tried if the first one is causing you pain., After the doctor has examined your cervix and vaginal canal, he or she will insert a small swab or brush, through the opening in the speculum, to remove some of the cells from your cervix. This is called a Pap test and is not recommended before the age of 21.The sample taken will be sent to a lab and examined for any cells that look abnormal or cancerous. Most girls have perfectly normal Pap tests.Typically, you will be notified of the test results from your Pap smear within 10 to 14 days.
If you are having any problems, the doctor may take additional samples to be reviewed by a laboratory., The next part of the exam will involve the doctor sliding one or two fingers into your vagina, and applying pressure to your abdomen.This is done so the doctor can feel for any lumps or abnormalities around your ovaries and female organs including your cervix, fallopian tubes, and uterus., Once the exam is complete, you will remove the gown and get dressed. The nurse may escort you to the doctor’s office or a consultation area, or the doctor may review your exam with you in the room.


The doctor will review your exam results with you, and answer any remaining questions you may have. He or she will also provide you with any written prescriptions that are needed, such as a prescription for birth control pills.

, Tests such as the Pap smear are generally done once every two years; however, for women just starting out, it is recommended to undergo Pap testing yearly to establish a healthy baseline. Ask your doctor when you should return for your next routine exam.


Note that, if there are any abnormal results on your Pap test (or in other parts of the breast or reproductive exam), your doctor may ask you to return sooner for follow-up care or additional tests., Problems like abdominal pain, vaginal discharge or wetness, burning sensations, an unusual or strong odor, severe menstrual cramps, or spotting between periods, warrant making an appointment.You can also see your doctor sooner if you have other reproductive questions that come up, such as a desire to start birth control pills, questions around safe sex and/or sexually transmitted infections, or questions surrounding pregnancy.
Once you become sexually active, your doctor can guide you in selecting the best type of birth control for you. This may include prescription products that your doctor can prescribe for you. He or she will help monitor their use.Common forms of birth control include oral contraceptives, or birth control pills, patches, injections, condoms, vaginal devices like diaphragms, and intra-uterine devices, or IUDs.Remember that your doctor is trained to provide girls and women with the information they need to make the best choice for them in any area of reproductive health, so your doctor will always be willing to see you and offer you advice even if it is only around sexual health questions you may have and not for a routine exam.

, Your doctor will show you how to check your own breasts for lumps that may be cancerous, or otherwise of concern. Perform these exams regularly, and notify your doctor as soon as possible if you think you have felt a nodule or small bump inside your breast tissue."

Rest every hour.,
Use a soothing oil.,
Take an oatmeal bath.",How to Heal Vaginal Tears2," Cold compresses can help reduce pain and inflammation around the affected area. Don’t place ice or the cold compress directly on your skin. Instead, wrap it in a cloth to protect your skin from burn. Leave it on your skin for around 10 minutes.Place it on your perineal area every couple of hours.

, If the tear is causing you pain, try an over-the-counter pain reliever. Acetaminophen such as Tylenol, ibuprofen such as Advil, and NSAIDs like Aleve can help reduce your pain and discomfort.Make sure to read the label and take the medication only as directed.

, You should take it easy when you have a vaginal tear, especially after childbirth.

Notice any pain.,
Determine how deep the tear is.,
Leave simple tears alone.,
Wash your vagina daily.,
Avoid sex.,
Avoid placing objects on or near the vagina.",How to Heal Vaginal Tears3," Vaginal tears cause mild pain in your groin area. You may feel pain when you sit down, walk, or wear constricting clothing. Minor tears may also result in light bleeding. They may also itch or be uncomfortable., How bad the tear is determines how you treat it. If you are unsure how bad it is, take a mirror and look at the tear. If the tear is somewhere you cannot see, you may want to go to the doctor., Simple tears will heal on their own without any treatment. Simple tears are small and look like paper cuts or abrasions. Simple tears may bleed at first, and they may sting, be uncomfortable, and itch. Simple tears are caused by something you know you did, like having sex or putting in a tampon., If you have a vaginal tear or cut, wash the area each day with a gentle cleanser.

Avoid douching while you have a vaginal tear. This can mess up your natural pH that keeps you healthy.

, When you have a vaginal tear, you should not engage in any sexual activity, alone or with your partner. Any kind of sexual activity that leads to contact with the tear can cause it to reopen. Contact from any body part can also introduce bacteria to the tear.After your vaginal tear is healed, be very gentle the first few times you have sex to make sure you don’t tear the sensitive flesh again.

, While the tear heals, avoid irritating the vagina by using any objects on or in them. Don’t use tampons, condoms, diaphragms, or other vaginal objects. You should also avoid using any irritating lubricants or lotions.Wear loose cotton underwear that won’t constrict and press against your vagina.

The doctor will also determine if you have any underlying conditions that lead to the vaginal tear.

, If you have a vaginal tear, the doctor may prescribe medication to help with infection or healing. These medications may include ones for yeast infections, herpes, vaginitis, or dermatitis.They may be in the form of oral tablets, creams, or gels.

, Low estrogen may lead to atrophic vaginitis, which can cause a dry vagina that can tear easily. Other conditions, like cancers or hormonal imbalances, can also cause low estrogen. The doctor may prescribe estrogen creams to help. They may also suggest changing your diet to increase the estrogen you get from foods.Never try to increase your estrogen without consulting a doctor. This can mess with your body’s chemical balance.

, Some women develop vaginal tears because they are deficient in certain nutrients. This deficiency causes a breakdown of the skin and membranes in the vagina. Talk to your doctor about your diet if you have frequent vaginal tears that won’t heal. A nutritionist can help you identify which nutrients you are missing and how to increase them safely.Zinc deficiencies are a common reason for vaginal tears. Other deficiencies may include vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids, calcium, and vitamin C.

, Some tears are deep or violent. They may bleed a lot, have pus, have loose flesh, or give you severe pain. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should see your doctor immediately for treatment. These types of wounds often occur because of childbirth, trauma, or accidents during sex.These are serious wounds and should be treated as such.

, Many deep vaginal tears are treated with stitches. Stitches are used for tears that are longer than one inch. The doctor will stitch the skin together. This may occur at a clinic or hospital.

, As with a grandparent, the people who appear may shed light on your dream’s overall meaning. Oftentimes they represent themselves, but sometimes they also reflect facets of our mind. For instance, a little child who tugs at your coat could represent an inner sense of guilt.


Who appeared in your dream? Besides their relationship to the door, think of who they are and what relationship you have with them.
Oftentimes, the less direct personal relationship we have with someone in a dream means that it is more likely they are a part of our psyche – that is, your mind is trying to tell you something., Focus on how you felt during the dream, as emotion be the key to a dream’s interpretation. If you felt nervous, there is a good chance that the door has something to do with inner anxiety. If you felt exhilarated, perhaps the door represents something hopeful that you are looking forward to.When you record dreams in your log, make notes about how the dream made you feel. All you need are impressions – happy, depressed, fearful, angry, anxious, powerful, etc.

, The psychologist Carl Jung thought that some images in dreams are actually universal symbols. These tap into a “collective unconscious” that goes across cultures. If you’re serious about getting to the bottom of the doors that appear in your dreams, consider learning more about Jungian dream analysis.For example, dreaming about being chased might mean that you are running from a fear – something that you feel unprepared for.
Dreaming of death might signify transformation in your life; disease could mean an inner conflict., Doors mean a variety of things in dreams. In general, people interpret them as a symbol of transition. Dreaming about a door suggests you are in need of change, or that you are currently in a transition from one stage of life to another. Doors can lead to adventure, secrets, opportunities and new beginnings.The saying “when one door closes, another one opens,” is very relevant here. Your door might be leading you to a new phase.

, The door’s placement, condition, color, and kind are all important to the interpretation. A door in good condition, for example, might mean that your transition is a healthy or sound one. A dilapidated door might conversely mean you are uncertain or afraid of change.What is the door’s color? Some interpreters think a red door signifies that you are keeping anger or frustration bottled up. A black door symbolizes secrets, and opening it means that you are taking a risk.
What kind of door is it? Trapdoors can represent hidden opportunities or, sometimes, suppressed feelings in the subconscious. A revolving door can mean going around in circles – that perhaps you feel your life is going nowhere.
Are you outside or inside? Being inside might suggest you are in need of introspection and should take stock of your life, while being outside can represent freedom and opportunity.

, A closed door might mean closed opportunities. However, if your dream takes you through the door, what stands on the other side is also important. Pay attention to where the door leads, as this is closely connected to its possible interpretation.For example, if you come across a land of plenty the dream might indicate you will transition to a glorious new phase in life.
On the other hand, if the door leads somewhere depressing, dull, and sad, it could suggest you are afraid of change and holding back.
A door that takes you somewhere familiar and comforting is a sign that you are ready to transition, but that you will remain whole, just more experienced and wiser on the other side.

, Moving through the door is important, as are the emotions raised. If you awaken with a memory of stepping over the threshold, for instance, this means that you are ready to embark on your new phase in life., If you’re interested in learning more about the possible meaning of dreams and dream symbols, consider learning more about the field. Although we still know very little – including why we dream – new and interesting discoveries are being made.Humans have tried for centuries to interpret and understand dreams. However, the first modern attempts only came in the early 1900s with the theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, many of whose interpretive ideas are still popular today.
Currently scientists have a range of theories. Some argue that dreams don’t really mean anything but are the result of random electrical signals in the brain; others think that dreaming evolved as a defense tool; and still others link dreams help us to process the emotions and events of the day.

, Looking into dreams may give you insight into your own psychology. But we still know very little about dreams and their function. Dream symbols may not always be universal – that is, they might not apply for everyone – and you probably shouldn’t rely on them to make major life decisions., The internet has all sorts of website that purport to give the meaning of symbols like doors, water, fences, and other things. Many are even in handy, searchable “dictionaries.” If this sounds too good to be true, it is. Take these sites with a grain of salt.


Websites will often plug very specific meanings into symbols. Dream interpretation is actually a lot more messy than this. Given how little we know about the brain and dreams, you are better off relying on your own judgment or on the advice of a psychoanalyst.Dream interpretation is highly personal and varies widely. There may be some symbols that carry a shared cultural or even universal meaning, but these are exceptions to the rule. Don’t trust that a symbol really means what the “dream dictionary” says.

Don't spring out of bed.If you can remember more of your dream, you are better able to analyze it.,

Reflect upon whether the dream was positive or negative.The emotional impact of the dream is often more important than the visual symbols in your dream.,
Fill in other important details.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving Dolls," It makes sense that this association would cross over into the subconscious realm. If you're having any thoughts about your childhood during your waking life, you should become more mindful of what they are and how they might relate to the doll dreams you've been having.;
, Because of this connection, you should look for recurring ideas between the two. If you're able to connect the dream's symbols with real life experience, you'll have a much easier time of making sense of the rest of it.


Spend time examining things you've been thinking lately. For example, have you been thinking things like, ""My life is moving too slowly,"" or ""Things are too crazy right now""?
See if your dream is reflective of your recurring thoughts. For example, if you have a baby doll that grows up into an adult doll instantly, it may symbolize the feeling that your life is moving too quickly.
Reflect on what you think may have inspired the dream.A dream is the brain's way of processing information in the subconscious. If you have recalled enough of your dream, you may be able to tie some part of it to something that's been on your mind.

, The psychologist Carl Jung interpreted dolls in dreams as an expression of the Anima or Animus, the opposite sex within ourselves.If you subscribe to this idea, try to analyze how the dream might comment on your gender identity. Is there a part of the dream that relates to your role as a man or woman? Has anything of that nature been on your mind lately? Asking yourself these questions may bring you closer to a valid interpretation of your dream.

, Maybe you find dolls creepy, so a doll showing up in your dream may not be a good sign. On the other hand, maybe you loved playing with dolls as a child, and therefore, the symbol is a good one for you. In fact, many people associate dolls with fertility, so depending on how the doll appears, it could symbolize a desire to have children or fear of having children.For other people, dolls symbolize a desire to return to the innocence of childhood.
Think about whether the doll could be a symbolic stand in for your own person or something that is going wrong in your life.

, Like horoscopes, they're mainly useful as a vague psychological reference to kickstart your own observations. However, reading up on the symbols (like dolls) that have been appearing in your dream might lend you some perspective.

, The action of the doll is as important as the symbol of the doll. A passive doll that is being played with by someone you dislike is completely different from a doll that comes alive and walks around.The doll could represent you in the dream. For example, if it came alive, that may symbolize the fact that you want to ""wake up"" into a new life.
A doll being played with by someone you dislike could indicate you're feeling used or annoyed by that person.
If you're playing with the doll, that could show that you are having a conflict with yourself, as you are playing with the doll, while at the same time, the doll could represent your subconscious., The background to the doll can also help you decide what the doll symbolizes. For example, dollhouses may symbolize your desire to have a family or your focus on your family life.Alternatively, a dollhouse could symbolize that you want to be more in control of your life.

, If you wrote down the emotions you were feeling when you woke up, use that to guide your interpretation of the dream. If you woke up feeling ecstatic, for instance, that's very different from waking up feeling anxious or disappointed.For example, if you doll comes alive but you wake up feeling anxious, that could mean your life is going in a new direction that you feel anxious about.

, You can increase your chances of remembering your dream by taking a few extra minutes both to go to sleep and to wake up. If you allow yourself to wake up gradually, you're less likely to startle the dream out of your head.

, Dream memories are fleeting, and almost always dissipate unless you catch them early on. As soon as you awake, take a pen and jot down whatever you can remember, whether it's a colour, shape, or feeling. Every little detail will help you to make better sense of your dream., When you wake up, you won't have long to catch your dream memories before they fade away. Having a pen and paper at your bedside will give you the fastest way possible to get your thoughts onto paper., When you wake up, try to get the main symbols in your dream down on paper so they don't disappear from your mind. You can write them or draw them, whatever is easiest for you. Obviously, you dreamed about a doll, but think about what else you saw.What other symbols showed up? Were other people there?
Just try to get down the main ideas right now.

, As you write down the details of your dream, think about the emotions that accompanied it. Did you feel upset when you woke up? Did the dream make you happy or anxious? Try to identify what you're feeling upon waking, and write those thoughts down, too.

, Now that you've got the main ideas down, fill in the details. The details are any extra things you can think of that happened in the dream but weren't necessarily the main focus of the dream. The details can help put the symbols you see into context.For example, think about the setting. Was it night or day?
Did you notice anything else in the dream that you may have left out? Maybe a particular color stood out to you, or maybe you saw a recurring flower. Just try to fill in as much as you can.

Learn more about dream interpretation.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving Cats," The feeling you had about the cat in your dream may tell you more about what the cat meant than any dream dictionary. Were you happy to see the cat? Did the cat fill you with fear? Consider why this feeling might have come up for you.To better understand your feeling about the cat in your dream, think about other dream elements you might remember. For example, if you remember drowning, then being rescued by a cat, you might be filled with surprise and gratitude. This might mean that help comes from unexpected places or people.
Was the cat familiar to you, in the dream? Whether or not you recognize the cat from your waking life, you may experience a sense of familiarity to the cat in your dream. Perhaps the cat is a symbol of safety.
If the cat was causing you to feel afraid, perhaps there is something in your life that's causing you fear or worry. For example, if the cat was attacking you, this might suggest that you're feeling attacked by some circumstance of your life.;
, Think about the location of the cat in your dream. Was the cat outside, like a feral cat, or inside, like a domestic pet? What other elements surrounded the cat? For example, a cat outside on a moonlit night might also include the dream symbols of a full moon, a dark house, a rustle of dry leaves underfoot, an owl, a cold breeze, etc.Dreams are emotional, not rational. Perhaps your cat was swimming underwater, quite happily (and unrealistically!) Don't worry if your dream doesn't make sense.
As you write about every element, think about how you feel about it. The dream came from your subconscious, and you are the best interpreter of what your dream means.

, Because dreams are created from your subconscious mind, they are deeply personal to your nature and experience. A cat in your dream will not be the same as a cat in anyone else's dream. Many people believe that a cat in dream is a personal symbol, unique to you.Consider what cats mean to you, specifically. Are you allergic to cats? Did you have a cat in your childhood? If there is any unique meaning that you connect to cats, it's likely that this meaning will be part of your dream interpretation.
Remember that the goal of dream interpretation is to better understand yourself. Dreams are unlikely to be functional predictors of the future, to provide lucky lottery numbers, or to give you the answer to an algebra problem.

, Some dream interpreters feel that aspects of the dreamer are found within every element of the dream. The cat in the dream may symbolize you, or parts of you. Think about what characteristics you and the cat might share in common.Did the cat in your dream appear unique in any way? Did the circumstances in which the cat appeared feel familiar? Or was the situation novel or unlikely?
Dreaming makes the connection between the dreamer's conscious and unconscious mind. Feelings, thoughts, and ideas found in the dreamer's unconscious mind can surface through dream imagery and symbols.

, Cats are ancient dream images, symbolizing intuition, femininity, softness, an independent spirit, creativity, power, misfortune, vulnerability, bad luck, and deceitfulness. Whatever you can recall about the cat within your dream will also help you understand its meaning.


If the cat in your dream was playful, perhaps you may desire to be a little more light-hearted in your life.
If your dream cat was aggressive, perhaps you're experiencing some difficulty with the more feminine side of your nature.
If you've lost your cat in your dreams, it might be a sign that you're not as independent as you'd like to be.
The health of the cat in your dreams is also a clue to its meaning. For example, if the cat in your dreams is sickly, this might mean that you're not paying enough attention to your intuition. By being overly rational, you've allowed the intuitive part of your nature become weak.

, Dreaming about a wild, or feral, cat may mean that a neighbor could be dangerous to you (or that this is something that you fear). A cat who bites you in your dream might mean the loss of something important to you.While cats are generally a symbol of independence, a dream about a kitten often reflects vulnerability and the need to be taken care of.
Dream images can be simple, or they can be complex. When you're interpreting what the cat in your dream might mean, allow yourself to be open to a wide range of possible interpretations.

, Despite the black cat being a common symbol of bad luck, seeing a black cat in your dreams doesn't have any particular bad luck attached. More important to the interpretation of your dream are the way you feel about the cat, how you treat it, and how it treats you.In the past, any cat appearing in a dream was generally considered to be bad luck. This has changed, however, as cultures became more comfortable with mystical topics.
Cats often represent sexuality and women. When a woman dreams about a cat, she may be dreaming about her own sexual power. A man dreaming about a cat may be symbolizing sexual fulfillment, or his own intuitive nature.

, If the cat in your dreams carries a meaning for you, it doesn't matter what any dream dictionary says. As you can see, dream dictionaries carry a wide range of possible interpretation. As you become more skilled at remembering your dreams, and thinking deeply about each element within the dream, you will learn to interpret what your dreams mean for you.Notice if you see a pattern in your dreams. Do certain elements recur on a regular basis? Do you notice that you often dream about a certain cat, or different cats?
Your observations on your dreams should include who, what, when, where and why. Always ask yourself: how did I feel about this?


, Most dream experts recommend to keep a dream journal. A dream journal is a notebook kept beside your bed with a pen or pencil nearby. As soon as you wake up, immediately reach for pen and paper to write down everything you remember about your most recent dream.


Try to write down any dream you have, no matter how difficult it may be to remember clearly.
Include as many details as you can, no matter how strange or random. List colors, location, characters, sounds, emotions and objects. Each element has a possible meaning.
Don't worry about grammar or spelling. No one else is likely to read this - it's just for you.
If using an app on your phone or tablet is easier for you, consider keeping your dream journal here. The main thing is to have it very close to your bed, so that it's there as you wake up.

, The feelings that you experience in your dreams are not symbolic, but real feelings. Most people suppress negative emotions during the day, but these emotions will appear in dreams. Learn to notice your feelings about every element within your dream in order to better interpret its meaning.Feelings expressed in dreams can help you better deal with depression, guilt, and other difficult emotions in your waking life.
The most common emotions found in dreams are fear and anxiety, followed by anger and sadness.

, Over time you may start to notice similar themes and patterns emerging from otherwise dissimilar dreams. For example, if you keep finding yourself dreaming about stressful situations, even though the elements might be very different, it's important to look at the ways this stressful situation might be manifesting itself in your life.There are apps, such as Dream Professor, that provide instant analysis of your dream elements.
These apps focus on the pattern of images and words in a dream, rather than trying to read the plot or recognize individual symbols.

, When you've written down your dream, go back to sleep. Later, when you're fully awake, revisit your dream journal and read through your notes for meaning. Each dream is a mine of metaphorical meaning that you can interpret in multiple ways.Many experts suggest that the dreamer avoid thinking of a dream in literal terms. For example, a dream about skydiving doesn't usually mean that the person is likely to jump out of a plan.
Sometimes an element of a dream is not a metaphor, but simply a way that the person processes information. For example, people who spent most of their lives before color television also dream in black and white.

, Some analytical therapists incorporate dream analysis into their therapy practice. If this appeals to you, consider learning more about dream interpretation, or finding a therapist who uses this approach.There are many dream dictionaries available online or in bookstores. These are interesting and entertaining, but genuine dream analysis is more subtle and complex than these books may suggest.
Dream interpretation was a standard part of psychoanalytic models of both Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung.
Jung's understanding of archetypes found in dreams shaped generations of scholars and psychologists.

, Before going to sleep, tell yourself something like “I’m going to have some really interesting dreams tonight. I can’t wait to enter one and see where it takes me.”, Preliminary research suggests that vitamin B6 can increase the vividness and memorability of your dreams.Vitamin B6 supplements are readily available at pharmacies and other stores. Consider taking one before you sleep as an aid for lucid dreaming. You can also increase your intake of vitamin B6 by eating more of certain foods, including:Avocados
Bananas
Beans
Meat (beef, pork, and poultry)
Nuts
Whole grains
Fortified breads and cereals

, Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally in the body and synthetically in laboratories. It helps regulate sleep cycles, in addition to other uses.Research shows that melatonin can increase the vividness and bizarreness of dreams.This may increase the likelihood that you will be aware of your dreams as you have them, and so you may want to take melatonin before attempting to dream lucidly.


Melatonin is available in pill and other forms. Look for it at a pharmacy.
Taking melatonin can lead to side effects or negative interactions with other medications you may be taking. Talk with a doctor before taking melatonin.

, This substance (5-Hydroxotryptophan) is derived from another substance, L-Tryptophan, and is also produced from the seeds of an African plant (Griffonia simplicifolia).5-HTP is used to treat insomnia and other conditions, and some believe that it can help users achieve lucid dreams.


5-HTP is available in pill form from pharmacies (over-the-counter).
5-HTP can cause side effects such as nausea and muscle problems. In addition, it can have negative interactions with a variety of other medications, such as anti-depressants. Talk with a doctor before taking 5-HTP.

, Often prescribed to treat Alzheimer’s disease, galantamine helps produce substances that increase brain function and memory.Some research shows that it can cause vivid dreams, and so you may want to take galantamine in order to increase the likelihood that you will have lucid dreams.Galantamine is available in tablet, capsule, and liquid forms. Look for it at a pharmacy.
Taking galantamine can produce side effects such as an upset stomach. Talk with a doctor before taking galantamine.
Since it can increase the vividness of dreams, nightmares can also be a side effect of galantamine.

, During your dreams, try to continuously ask yourself “Am I dreaming?” or “Am I awake?”This is also known as “reality testing.” If you think you are dreaming, this will help you achieve the state of being aware of the dream while you are having it.

, When the alarm wakes you, instead of getting out of bed, focus on starting a new dream or re-entering the dream you woke up from.To make it easier to re-enter a dream, try not to think about being awake. Don’t get out of bed or do anything else. Instead, immediately start thinking about the dream you were having and imagine ways of acting within it.

, The alarm may not wake you fully from your dream, allowing you to achieve a lucid state. If you do wake up, use the WBTB technique to attempt to re-enter the dream.


Later dreams tend to be longer, so try setting alarms for 4.5, 6, or 7.5 hours after you go to sleep.

, In addition, being exhausted will make it more difficult to be aware of the fact that you are dreaming while it is happening. Try to experiment with lucid dreaming on a night when you feel rested and mentally alert.

, Don’t move from your position in bed, start talking about something else, or any other activity. Just start thinking about your dream, and any details you remember about it. Doing so will keep you from forgetting the dream.

, A dream journal is a basic notebook or other tool that you use to record your dreams in. Keep it right beside your bed, along with a pen or pencil, so that you can record your dreams as soon as you wake up. Research suggests that getting in the habit of this increases the likelihood of having lucid dreams. However, even telling yourself in one night that you plan on writing down your dreams can help you achieve a greater awareness of them.


Write down any dreams you recall, whether or not they seem interesting or coherent.
If you can’t remember a whole dream, write down whatever part you can remember—even if it is just a face, location, phrase, etc.
It is important to write down whatever you remember about your dreams as soon as you wake up. The longer you are awake without writing them down, the more likely you are to forget them.
Remaining in bed while writing down your dreams will increase the likelihood of remembering them.

Developing the habit of writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up is the best way to train your brain to remember the dream. Keep a notebook beside your bed to use as a dream journal.You can also use apps developed for your phone. Some apps even check for patterns, or help with dream interpretation.
You can also use a voice recorder on your phone, if writing is hard for you upon first waking up.;
, Your feelings about seeing the whale or dolphin provide useful information about its meaning. For instance, if you felt happy upon seeing a dolphin, or if you were swimming among dolphins with delight, this might mean that you want to be more carefree in your life. If you are scared of a dolphin, it might mean that you're going through a stressful time, and are afraid of losing control.Write down every feeling you have in association with your dream, even if it doesn't make sense. Don't allow your conscious (waking) mind to filter out the messages you're being given by your unconscious (dreaming) mind.
If you are the whale or dolphin in your dream, think about how it felt to take that shape. Did you feel more free, confident, happy? Or were you lonely, fearful, and uneasy?
Remember that all elements in the dream are potentially meaningful. It's a mistake to focus on only one element if your dream.

, Was the whale or dolphin in the water, or was it on land? If you dream about an animal out of its natural habitat, this might indicate that you're feeling uncertain about your place in the world. If it's underwater, be aware that often underwater dreams may symbolize the dark side of human nature, elements of our being that we may not want to look at.Dreaming about a dolphin indicates your willingness to listen to your subconscious, or your emotions.Dolphins are usually inspirational images in dreams, symbolizing optimism and social altruism.

, In a dream, every element is important. When you're trying to interpret your dream involving a whale or dolphin, think about everything you can remember from your dream. Even the most minor dream details have meaning.Some dream interpreters feel that the dreamer is every element within his dream. For example, if you dream about a school of dolphins playfully swimming in the surf until a fishing net captures them, one interpretation would be that you're trying to control your own playful nature.
If you dream about trying to save a whale or dolphin, this may mean that you're trying to salvage an important relationship, or some part of yourself that's in danger of dying.

, As mammals who live underwater, both whales and dolphins symbolize the merging of the conscious and the unconscious. When either appear in a dream, this may be a sign that it's time for you to act on something you've been holding inside, or speak your truth regarding an issue that's important to you.A whale often symbolizes awareness and intuition. Dreaming of a whale often means its time for you to listen to your inner voice.
Because a whale is the largest mammal in the world, dreaming of a whale may symbolize that you're feeling overwhelmed.Do
Think about anything specific you can recall about your animal. For example, was the dolphin in your dream swimming alone, or in a group? Did it appear healthy? Or was it sickly? If you dream about a whale or dolphin that is dying, this might mean that you are feeling disconnected from your inner self., When did you first see a dolphin? Are you fond of dolphins, or do they make you feel uneasy? Did you have a negative experience at the seaside or on the water, which you might associate with dolphins? If you went to the ocean following the death of a close friend, you may associate dolphins with grief.Because dreams are different for everyone, you are the best interpreter for your dreams.
Even though dolphins are often regarded as positive symbols, only you can know what they mean for you.

, Your dreams are unique to you, and your experiences in life. Therefore no two people will share the same dream interpretation. For example, whales might be associated with feelings of calm, independence, and strength for you. Or, you may think of whales as dangerous, ""killer whales,"" or unmanageable fears.A dreamer's life experiences shape the meaning of anything appearing in her dreams.
Your feelings will be the best guide to interpreting the meaning of a whale in your dreams.

, Have you recently watched documentaries involving ruthless animal slaughter? Or have you recently been talking to a friend about going to the ocean? If whales or dolphins have been a part of your waking life recently, they might well recur in your dreams.If your feelings when you see a whale or dolphin in your dream have recently changed, consider whether current events may have created this change.
Remember that whales and dolphins, like other dream elements, are not meant to be interpreted literally. Dream interpretation is based in emotions rather than rational thought.
If your feelings about whales change in every dream, look to other dream elements for more information.

, If you have recurring dreams about dolphins or whales, notice whether these dreams have anything in common. For example, are you usually happy to see these images appear in your dreams? Do you usually see them following an narrow escape from something scary? Or are they part of a larger landscape, seen only in the distance? If you have repeated similar experiences in your dreams, it might indicate a strong need to work out a situation in your life.
Notice recurring thoughts and feelings as well we recurring images in your dreams. For example, if you have repeated thoughts of, ""I'll die if that happens again,"" think about what you might mean by that.

, Research shows that most adults experience at least 4-6 dreams per night. Dreams occur during REM sleep, a period during which your sleeping brain is as active as it is when you are awake. The best way to remember your dreams is to keep a dream journal.As you become more aware of your dreaming life, you may start to better understand what dream symbols are important for you.
There is research that shows how dreams can help you better understand your waking personality. Dreams may even be valuable in diagnosing psychological issues regarding personality dynamics."

Avoid anyone who makes you feel worse.",How to Deal with an Eating Disorder During Pregnancy," People with bulimia find themselves stuck in a cycle of binging and purging – eating large amounts of food and then vomiting, taking laxatives, and/or exercising excessively to get rid of what they have consumed. Bulimia can have catastrophic health consequences, and it’s even more dangerous during pregnancy. If you are pregnant and you binge and purge, you need to seek medical treatment immediately.


Some women experience the symptoms of bulimia nervosa for the first time when they become pregnant. Others have long histories of the condition. Either way, you need to be honest with your doctor and get the help that you need.;
, People with anorexia restrict their food intake severely, resulting in excessive weight loss and malnutrition. The condition is extremely dangerous, and during pregnancy, it poses additional risks – to both you and your unborn baby. If you are pregnant and think you may have anorexia, talk to a doctor right away.


As with bulimia, you may experience the symptoms of anorexia for the first time during pregnancy (in the media, this condition has been termed “pregorexia,” but that’s not a recognized medical diagnosis), or you may have a long history of the condition. Either way, get medical help immediately.

, People with binge eating disorder (BED) experience episodes during which they consume very large amounts of food, without the purging associated with bulimia. If you have BED, you might feel “out of control” or powerless around food, and you may feel guilty or depressed about your binges. Though not as immediately dangerous as bulimia or anorexia, binge eating disorder does pose serious health risks, which may be exacerbated during pregnancy. See a doctor right away if you suspect you have BED.


As with other eating disorders, binge eating disorder sometimes occurs for the first time during pregnancy; it can also be a long-standing condition triggered or aggravated by pregnancy. Either way, report your symptoms to your doctor.

, If you are pregnant and have any of these eating disorders, you risk malnutrition, dehydration, heart problems, gestational diabetes, psychological issues, labor complications, and breastfeeding difficulties. In addition, your condition may affect your baby. Risks to your baby include:


premature birth (which can pose many dangerous health problems)
low birth weight
respiratory problems and/or respiratory distress at birth
feeding problems
developmental delays

, During pregnancy, your body changes very quickly. You gain weight, and your breasts and belly grow. Well-meaning people will comment on these changes, and you may feel upset, embarrassed, or self-conscious. For women prone to eating disorders, all of this can be triggering.

, Eating disorders can appear to be all about food, weight, and body image – and that can seem particularly true if your condition was triggered by healthy pregnancy weight gain. However, most people with eating disorders have underlying issues that are unrelated (or loosely connected) to their bodies, such as depression, anxiety, relationship problems, and a need for control. Therefore, though medical treatment for eating disorders is absolutely necessary, you will probably also need some kind of counseling to deal with the psychological backdrop.

, Many women feel embarrassed, guilty, or ashamed about their eating disorders, especially during pregnancy, when they become responsible not only for themselves for also for their unborn babies. Resist the urge to conceal your condition. Your obstetrician needs to know about your eating disorder. Provide a detailed description of your symptoms so that he or she can help you and your baby.

, Your obstetrician should be able to refer you to a nutritionist, who will help you develop an eating plan to ensure adequate nourishment for your and your baby. Check in with this person regularly, and do your best to follow his or her advice. Remember that a nutritious diet is one of the most important factors in ensuring a healthy pregnancy.


Your nutritionist is also a fantastic resource for dealing with the postpartum period. Plan to continue seeing this person after your baby is born.

, Your obstetrician may want to perform additional tests to make sure that you are staying as healthy as possible. He or she may want to check you for anemia, osteoporosis, and other complications that can result from poor nutrition and be exacerbated during pregnancy. In addition, if your condition is severe, he or she should monitor your cardiac health and overall wellness.

, Having an eating disorder places you in a higher risk category that most pregnant women, so it’s important that you work with your obstetrician to monitor your baby’s growth and development. Depending on your specific circumstances, you may need more frequent doctor’s appointments, additional ultrasound examinations and laboratory work, or referrals to specialists. Follow your doctor’s advice.

, If you started your pregnancy at a healthy weight, you probably need to gain between 25 and 35 pounds by the time you deliver; if you were underweight, you may need to gain more, and if you were overweight, you may be able to gain less. Talk to your doctor about your weight gain goals, and do your best to follow his or her recommendations. Remember: pregnancy is temporary, and gaining weight is necessary for your baby’s health.


You will probably have to weigh in at every doctor’s appointment. For women with eating disorders, this prospect can be stressful, but it’s crucial to monitoring the health of you and your baby during pregnancy. If you find this part of the appointment especially upsetting, talk to your doctor.

, If your condition is severe, your doctor may recommend hospitalization. You may need intravenous fluids and nutrition, and you may need to undergo additional testing. Hospitalization may be required if:


your vital signs concern your doctor
you are dehydrated
you show signs of malnutrition
you have cardiac symptoms, such as arrhythmia
you do not gain sufficient weight, even after seeing a therapist and nutritionist
you have signs of preterm labor or other complications

, Individual therapy is almost as important as specialized prenatal care. Your therapist can help you deal with your feelings about food, weight, pregnancy, and motherhood. He or she can also help you discover some of factors that are contributing to your condition, so that you can deal with them and move forward. If possible, choose someone with experience treating pregnant women with eating disorders.


Like your nutritionist, your therapist will continue to be an excellent resource for you even after your baby is born. Remember that the postpartum period will be challenging, too; if possible, plan to keep seeing your counselor during this time.

, There are probably support groups for people with eating disorders in your community. Find one and attend a meeting – you might be surprised by how helpful and comforting these groups can be.

, If you have a spouse or partner that you trust, tell this person about your condition. He or she can encourage you to eat healthfully, see your doctor regularly, and strive for healthy, moderate weight gain. Just as importantly, he or she can offer love, compassion, and emotional support.

, Close friends and relatives can also provide important emotional support. Tell the people you trust what you are going through; give them an opportunity to listen and help you.

, If you have friends or family members who judge you harshly, criticize your actions, or make you feel bad about yourself, avoid them. Continue to see your doctor, nutritionist, and therapist, and surround yourself with people who support you.

Learn how to remember your dreams.,
Don't create a plot where there isn't one.,
Avoid using dream interpretation aids.",How to Interpret Your Dreams1," Dream interpretation is more meaningful when you have a clear picture of your dreams, rather than a string of hazy images that you struggle to recall. Remembering your dreams clearly is much easier when you get a good night's sleep and take measures to remember as much as possible.



Keep a dream journal next to your bed and write down everything you remember of your dreams on waking. Make this a daily morning ritual before doing anything else.
Write down everything, even if it doesn't make sense. The things that don't make sense or seem out of place may end up being the most valuable insights.;
, It might be tempting to connect separate symbols in your dreams by overlaying them with a plot of sorts, in order to make more sense of it all. Avoid this temptation, since you could obscure the real meaning of your dream.

, Your dreams are reflections of yourself and belong to you. While dream dictionaries and dream interpretation aids can be of some assistance in a very general way, the real nitty gritty of understanding what your dream means will always come down to you, your personal circumstances and the context of the dream and your waking life.

"
"
Look for the obvious.,
Decide whether the dream reflects a real life situation.,
Decide what the dream means to you.",How to Interpret Your Dreams2," Before delving any deeper, always analyze a dream at its most basic level first, and that is done by looking for the most obvious meanings. Some questions to ask of your dream include:


What do you recognize from waking life? For example, you might have misplaced your car keys the night before and your dream shows you that you left them in a bowl on the umbrella stand instead of your usual hook on the wall. In this case, there is probably no need to wonder what keys and bowls symbolize!
Do you see things in your dream you've already experienced? Sometimes we dream about something we've done, a TV show, or something we've read online or in a book, and our subconscious is bringing it to life in technicolor (basically, a free show!). The meaning behind this is probably simple entertainment as your mind sorts through the daily chaff.

, Are there particular events going on in your daily life that have elements of concern, or that lack resolution for you? You may be having a dream that addresses these events in a straightforward way. If so, your interpretation job is simple.


If you had a fight with your mom, and you dream about fighting with her, you already have the answer to what that particular dream means.
If you have a big test or deadline coming up, and you dream about failing or missing it, you've had a straightforward anxiety dream, and there's probably no need to look for deeper symbolism.

, Dreams that are straightforward with recognizable objects and events are very useful. They are a means by which you can solve problems that have been dogging you throughout the day, week, or month, even where your worries are not conscious.


If you dream over and over about fighting with your mom, it's more than just a reflection of the day's events; it shows that this issue is bothering you so much that it stays with you all night, and it's something that should be addressed in waking life.
Dreams about real life issues you need to solve can help you figure out a solution. History is filled with the inventions begun in dreams, from scientists to fashionistas.
Dreams help you to learn as you process the day's experiences. They layer down the things you've learned during the day and smarten up your learning so that on awakening, you ought to be a little cleverer at whatever it was you learned the day before."
"
Analyze the emotions you felt in the dream.,
Look for key images that stand out in your dream.,
Be honest with yourself.",How to Interpret Your Dreams3," Dreams often come to us by way of metaphor, like a puzzle awaiting us to piece it together. It's a lot harder to figure out the meaning of a completely abstract dream than it is to interpret one with obvious connections to your waking life. But all your dreams, abstract or not, are coming from you, and they all have some kind of truth and meaning. Pay close attention to the emotions the dream elicits - that's the key to figuring out what it means. Ask yourself these questions:


How did this dream leave me feeling? What are the principal emotions arising out this dream?""
When have you recently felt that emotion in waking life? It is likely that your emotions in the dream are replaying emotions already impacting you during your waking hours, such as being angry with somebody, or feeling down about not meeting a deadline, or feeling happy that a good friend is coming to visit.

, There's no one way to interpret them; figure out what makes the most sense in terms of your current emotional state.


For example, if you dreamed about a red alligator swinging off your boss's lamp and leering at you, you might conclude that you are angry that your boss has taken the limelight and is crowing about your work as his own. Or, you might see this as your boss being angry with you for not throwing light on something ugly that has reared its head at the workplace. Or, you might have a morbid fear of the red alligator figurine on your boss' desk because the only time you're ever in your boss' office is when you're in trouble, staring at that darned thing to avoid his gaze! While the ""symbols"" of the dream can be fairly broadly interpreted from the nature or type of those symbols, you still need to fill in the details.

, Not only do you need to be willing to put in the effort to try to interpret your dreams, but you also need to be honest about your feelings and emotions. In reality, your dreams will hardly ever tell you something that you don't already know on some level – it's just more likely that you have been repressing or pushing something aside.

"
"
Practice interpreting your dreams often.,
Recognize patterns.,
Know when your dream interpretation is correct.",How to Interpret Your Dreams4," Dream interpretation definitely gets better with practice, since with each interpretation you gain a better understanding of your own subconscious. While dream interpretation is fairly intuitive and self-directed in nature, it can be helpful to have some generalized examples to guide you in ways that people choose to interpret their dreams. Here are some examples to give you an idea are provided next:


Let's say you're stranded on a desert island in your dream. If you've recently broken up with your partner, this could easily make sense. Maybe you feel guilty about the break-up and think it's partly your fault. Or maybe you're still angry about it. Sometimes the feelings you have as you're drifting off to sleep spill over into your dreams.
You dream you're back at school again trying to pass exams that in real life, you passed ages ago. And no matter how hard you try to pass them, the pencil keeps snapping, or the exam paper flies out the window, or you're just stumped for answers. Swing back to everyday life and you're doing really well, successful at all you have undertaken. A dream like this can simply be telling you that you don't need to worry about something that's worrying you right now because you got over that hurdle in the past; alternatively, it could be warning you that you're skating on thin ice and can't rely on winging it this time, and that you need to stick your head in the books and learn something new - and fast!

, Over time, you'll start seeing the same things pop up in your dreams. Take note of them in your dream journal, and pay attention to what emotions surround them. In the future, these dreams will be easy to interpret. For example, if you dream of a bluebird, you may not know at first what it symbolizes for you. Eventually you might come to realize it's associated with times of extreme change in your life. When you dream of a bluebird again in the future, you'll already have the groundwork laid for interpretation.

, The key thing to remember is that there are no rules to dream interpretation and so there are no rights or wrongs to the interpretation process. It's all down to your self-honesty, self-knowledge and willingness to apply your dream knowledge to your waking life situations. A successful dream interpretation really comes down to the following elements:


Your interpretation resonates with you and the path you're following in life.
Interpreting your dreams adds something positive to your personal growth and emotional or spiritual fulfillment.
Acting upon your dreams is not only becoming second nature, but is giving you good, positive results.
If it's not working for you, are you allowing yourself to get over the initial hurdles of confusion or skepticism before finally tossing in the towel on using dream interpretation as a means of self awareness?
Keep in mind, dreams are a subjective thing; murky at best, but always entertaining.

Relax your mind and thoughts


Relaxing your mind clears out your thoughts, negative energy, and stress.,
Lay down on your stomach in a comfortable position.,
You will need a helper at this point.,
With the ice cube on your neck, have your helper put on some soothing music, and try to fall asleep with the intention of gazing into the future.,
Once you wake up, write what you saw in your dream in the notebook.,
Signs of the dreams.",How to Gaze Into the Future," Once you do this, your brain will start focusing only on the thalamus (a part of your brain) which will help you think about only what the future might hold.;
, Tighten, then loosen your legs, then your arms.This helps relax your biceps femoris and triceps which is very important for looking into the future. Having relaxed muscles will help your brain focus more on the future and less on tense muscles.

, Have your helper bring over an ice cube, and the helper place it on the base of the back of your neck, known as the Feng Fu pressure point. This will help improve your sleep quality (which you need to gaze into the future) and it will relieve you from headaches from when you wake up.

, Instruct your helper to wake you up after the first sleep cycle (90 minutes) so you can vividly remember your dream. Make sure your helper has a notebook and pen ready for you when you wake up.

, Afterwards see if any of your dream correlates with our list of signs for the gazing into the future. It's important to write your dream right away or else you might forget.

, These are just some of the more common ones. If yours is not on here, then you may search it on the internet.


If you were lost in your dream, it means soon in your life you will feel abandoned or alone.
If you fell from a high place in your dream, it means that in the future, you will feel like you are losing control of your life or something important in your life.
If you were chased by something, it means you will feel cornered or pressured into a situation soon in your life.
If someone died in your dream it means that you will have a big change in your life in the distant future
If there was money in your dream it symbolizes your self worth. So if you were gaining money, it could mean that you will be more confident about yourself soon.
If you climbed over a mountain in your dream, or a big obstacle, it means you will have a great achievement in your future.

Keep a dream journal.,
Write down as many details as you can remember.,
Give your dream a title or synopsis.,
Observe how your dreams evolve.,
Recall how you felt in the dream.,
Identify prominent themes and symbols.,
Pay attention to recurring dreams.,
Explore the relations between dreams and waking life.,
Focus on your feelings.,
Tell someone else about the dream.,
Consider what might be causing the dream.,
Interpret dreams based on your own experience.",How to Figure out the Meanings of Dreams," Write down your dreams in a dream journal. Do this first thing in the morning after you wake up, when the action of the dream and your emotional state are still the freshest in your mind. The dream may not make sense to you right away, but recording it allows you to come back to it later so that you fill it in with new inferences and make important discoveries.Get in the habit of using your dream journal daily, even if the dream you’re trying to recall isn’t fully formed or remembered.Don’t worry if you can’t remember your dreams at first. Simply write “no dream to record” or “can’t remember” to fill out an entry. Eventually, you will become more attentive to your dreams, and you’ll awake with a head full of interesting images to flesh out.;
, Write out everything that stuck with you about the dream. No detail is too small. Don’t just document the basic physical events that took place in the dream. Think about where you were, what you were doing, who you were with, what time of day it was, etc. Even images that seem unimportant can be meaningful if you examine them in the right way.It may be helpful to draw out the situational details of your dreams using the questions commonly asked by investigative journalists: who, what, where, when, why and how., Invent a title to sum up the experience of the dream, or scribble a brief summary beneath your description of the dream’s events. Again, this should not just contain the most obvious features of the dream, but the emotional impact it had on you. A good title, something like “Failing a Difficult Test,” will remind you exactly what your dream was about while also capturing its tone. Your written description might read “sad dream about eating Jello in prison,” or “swore off civilization to live with the Inuits, very liberating!” Reliving how the action of the dream made you feel is the most important aspect of dream analysis.Writing a short synopsis of the dream allows you to categorize your dreams into different types, and to quickly reconnect with the emotional state you experienced during the dream.

, After you’ve been writing in your dream journal for a few weeks or months, go back and reread your entries. You may be surprised at the number of times you’ve had the same dream, or a slightly different dream with common elements. Likewise, your dreams may begin to take different forms as the circumstances of your life unfold. Dreams are an abstract reflection of how we react to our subjective realities.If you have the same dream over and over, think about what’s going on in the dream. If your dreams are different each night, or variations of past dreams, make a note of what’s changed.
For example, dreams where you're being chased are usually thought to mean that you're running from a unresolved issues in your life. You may discover that dreams like this stop once you've confronted the problem.

, Once you record what happened in the dream, stop and think about your role in it. In particular, try to remember how you felt about what was going on around you. One function of dreams is to serve as a safe environment for our subconscious minds to work through lingering emotional puzzles, so isolating your emotional state is critical to finding the meaning of a dream.The memory of a dream will be strongest when you first wake up. This is when you should write down and begin picking apart your dreams.Sometimes, your feelings may be the only part of a dream that makes sense. They are the key to understanding bizarre images.

, Take note of images, characters, events or circumstances that appear frequently in your dreams. Give some thought to the part they play in the dream in relation to your own, and acknowledge how they made you feel. Common themes can act like coded messages, with unique significance. Learning to recognize them can give you a place to start unraveling the dream.Some of the most common dreams involve losing your teeth and showing up to school or the workplace naked. Experts claim these dreams revolve around a lack of confidence and concern about the way people see you.View each object and symbol subjectively, not by how it’s perceived. For instance, a dream that involves wandering in the woods at night might be scary for most people, but may be peaceful and calming for you. Let your intuition guide you., If you’ve had the same dream multiple times, it may take on a certain urgency with you. It is believed that the purpose of recurring dreams is to point out something to us about our own minds that we have been missing. Having dreams where you're falling, for instance, may mean that you're worried about something in your life that you feel you have no control over.If you've had the same or a very similar dream more than once, it can be considered recurring.
Recurring dreams should take precedence for exploration and analysis, as working them out can often help you reach a new level of understanding and acceptance about a situation in your life.

, Isolate the elements of your dreams that are taken from everyday life and consider their meaning. Determine your emotional attitude toward them. Fixtures from waking life often appear in dreams to fulfill the behaviors that we secretly associate them with. A melancholy dream where you’re together with your parents, for example, may be upsetting because it acts as a reminder of one parent’s absence. Be honest with yourself about the way you feel toward the symbols that populate your dreams. It can help you uncover issues that you may have not even known existed.Dreams are often just imaginative conglomerates of the experiences we’ve had on a given day. If you’ve been feeling anxious, stressed or uncertain about something going on in your life, however, it may be worth looking deeper into dream imagery.

, As has been mentioned, your emotional state during a dream is key to making sense of it. This should be the aspect of the dream that you pay the most attention to. If a dream makes you worried or anxious, think about whether those feelings stem from a certain character, object or event in the dream. Why do they make you feel that way? Have you recently been confronted with that person or scenario in day-to-day life? Treat pleasant dreams the same way. Flying, luxuriating in paradise or having control over your environment are common dreams that can clue you in to what you most desire, or some joy that’s missing from your life.Dreams serve as arenas for us to enact our unresolved and unfulfilled emotions. Even seemingly nonsensical dreams will leave you feeling a certain way, and these feelings are like maps of your mental state., Describing your dream to another person might give you some insight into its underlying message. It can also be helpful to hear yourself recount the details of the dream out loud, leading you to stumble upon previously unseen revelations. The person you share your dream with might have had a similar dream in the past, and may be able to share their views on what it could mean.Encourage the other person to ask questions about your dream. They may be things that it didn’t occur to you to ask yourself. Between the two of you, you can dig a little deeper and coax out the core ideas of an elusive dream.

, Instead of only looking at the features of a given dream and trying to figure out their meaning, take the opposite approach—reflect on recent events in your life and work backwards to discover how they might have found their way into your dreams. This type of reverse construction can be especially helpful if you’re totally stumped about what’s been causing a certain dream.The images that appear in dreams are often taken from personal life and converted into symbols. That means they can potentially be understood from either perspective.Try to relate troublesome dreams to daily stressors that have been affecting you. Sex dreams frequently occur when you have unsatisfied desires of intimacy, while dreams about money might represent anxiety about being successful., Despite what dream guide texts and spiritualists may claim, there is no definitive system for interpreting dreams. Because your feelings and experiences differ from everyone else’s, you are the only one who can accurately conclude what your dreams mean. Make an effort to approach your dreams with honesty. Feel how they resonate with you and stick in your mind. With practice, you will get better at untying the knots that bind reality to the realm of your dreams.Be skeptical of reports insisting that dream symbols have concrete meanings. Just as no two people look at things in exactly the same way, their dreams also won’t have the same subjective significance.

Stay away from dream dictionaries.,
Talk to a therapist about disturbing recurrent dreams.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving Water," If you want to interpret a dream, you need to keep a dream diary. Dreams fade from memory fast. Recording your dreams each morning can help you remember important details.


Keep a notebook and pen by your bedside table so you have quick access to your dream diary first thing in the morning. People tend to forget details of their dreams quickly after waking up.Record as many details as possible. Do not just focus on the water but other aspects of the dream surrounding it. What happened in the dream? Who were you with? What the location like? How long did the dream go on for?;
, Oftentimes, dreams provide valuable insights into feelings you are consciously or unconsciously repressing. What recurring thoughts have you been having in day-to-day life? What matters take up the most of your attention? If you're thinking a lot about your job and career, the dream might be about that. If you're preoccupied with a romantic relationship, your dream may be telling you something about your relationship., The feelings you have during your dreams are just as important as the details you remember. How were you feeling during the dream? Were you happy, sad, excited, stressed? Did your feelings remain the same throughout the dream or did they change as the dream progressed?, As you consider your dream, go through and dissect all the images involved. Consider what feeling these images provoked and any personal meaning they hold for you.


Say you had a dream you were floating in the middle of a clear lake on a sofa. Did you recognize the lake in your dream? Was it any particular lake or just a random body of water? What was the color of the sofa? Did it have any personal meaning to you? Was it a sofa you recognized from somewhere or just a standard bit of furniture?, Water is one of the more common images found in dreams. When considering the meaning of your water dream, learn a bit about the various theories about the meaning of water in dreams.


Culturally, water is often associated with purification and transformation. From baths to baptism, water is seen as a cleansing substance. Oftentimes, people dream of water when experiencing great changes in life.Different types of water may signify different things. Floods, for example, have associations with disaster and loss. People sometime dream of floods when they feel overwhelmed. Unclean, murky water may indicate fear or confusion as there's a sense of foreboding and unknown in unclean water., Despite the fact water has a variety of wide-reaching associations, most psychiatrist and psychologists agree your personal connection with a symbol is more important than its universal value. What does water mean to you personally?


How do you feel about water? Are you a swimmer or a beach lover? Or do you fear water? Do you not know how to swim? Have you had bad experiences with water before?Did you recognize the body of water? Was it a particular lake or ocean? Do you have any personal connection to this body of water? Are they positive or negative?, Do not lean too heavily on outside opinion when it comes to dream interpretation. You are the best judge of your personal feelings as your own connections matter most when it comes to interpreting your dream. While you can talk to friends and family members if you're confused, remember that it's ultimately your opinion that matters., Once you've considered the various factors of your dreams, put it all together. Based on your personal thoughts and feelings as well as the nature of the dream, what do you think it means?Let's return to the example about the sofa floating in a body of water. In this example, imagine you are a married woman in her early 30's trying to get pregnant. You have some concerns about raising a child as you currently live across the country from your parents and wish they could have a bigger role in your child's life. The body of water in your dream is Lake Superior. You grew up in rural Michigan and have many fond memories of playing in Lake Superior as a child. You are often accompanied by your younger brother and mother in the dream. The sofa in question is similar to a floral pattern sofa your parents had when you were young. During the dream, you feel happy for the most part but have some anxiety about when you'll find shore.As is often the case of water dreams, the above dream could be seen as your response to going through a stressful transition. While you are excited about the prospect of motherhood, you have some reservations as well. The uncertainty in the dream, marked by the absence of a clear shore, reflects some of your stress about starting a family. You may be somewhat homesick as the dream brings in images of your own childhood. Your dream may be a sign that you need to work through your fears about motherhood and find a way to get closer to your family., While dream interpretation is popular, scientists have very limited knowledge of dreams and the biological purposes they serve. Most of Freud's theories have been discredited and a lot of research on dream interpretation is unverified. Keep in mind that while interpreting recurring dreams can be entertaining, take interpretations with a grain of salt., Dream dictionaries are not the best investment when it comes to interpreting dreams. While some symbols have shared cultural meaning, much of what appears in your dreams is deeply personal. You're better off interrogating your own thoughts and desires when considering a dream than consulting a dream dictionary., If you have frequent, disturbing dreams, this may be an indication of an underlying psychological condition. You should talk to a psychiatrist or therapist if a particular dream is disrupting your ability to function in day-to-day life."

Note the colors of objects in your dreams.,
Pay attention to animals.,
Look for significant numbers.,
Focus on objects of religious importance.,
Don't use a standard dream symbol dictionary.To analyze the importance of objects or symbols in your dreams, you should look how they relate to the scripture.,
Evaluate each symbol.,
Decide if the dream is literal or symbolic.,
Ask yourself what emotions you have experienced or issues you were processing the day before the dream.,
Pray about the dream.",How to Interpret Dreams from a Biblical Perspective," This may be difficult at first, but the more you practice remembering your dreams, the easier it will be to recall details. Any aspect that you remember about the place, people, or objects around might be important. If a particular detail is of importance, God will make it very noticeable to you.


Symbols such as numbers, direction, colors, and animals, may all be of importance. The symbols in a dream can be negative or positive.
You have to depend on the Holy spirit to reveal what the symbols reveal in your dream (negative or positive).;
, A dream may have been alarming, sad, or exciting, but usually there is an overall emotional response that you feel towards a remembered dream. Write down these emotional responses where they occurred in the sequence of the dream.


Write down your feeling towards objects and people. If a certain object made you afraid or if you felt drawn to a figure, make sure to mention it in your recounting of the dream.

, Dreams can consist of memories, current life events, or things that are yet to come. If you are younger and surrounded with people you used to know, the dream is probably in the past. If you are unsure where you are or who is around you, you may be dreaming about a time in the future.


God may give you a dream about an incident that happened in the past that’s hidden in your heart and that creates pain in your life so that you can then pray for healing.

, Pay attention to your perspective and interactions in the dream. If you did not speak or interact with those around you, maybe you were just observing or witnessing the events, and they do not directly involve you. It may be more of a vision to warn you of some possible occurrence. If you feel yourself as the central figure in the dream, then it is most likely the dream is meant to influence you or your life.

, Different colors represent different characteristics of symbols. Colors are commonly associated with their religious significance. For example, blue is the color associated with the Virgin Mary, as she is often depicted in a blue dress. It symbolizes grace and good health., Animal symbols can sometimes be tricky, as they can have positive and negative significance in the bible.


For example, the Lion of Judah can symbolize Jesus. However, the devil is depicted as prowling like a roaring lion in the bible as well.
Cats can symbolize evil spirits, or they can be seen as comforting.
Dogs can also have positive or negative meanings. They can be man's best friend, or symbolic of unbelievers., The numbers may appear in a written form, but very likely the numbers will appear as a particular number of objects. For example, the bible recounts the dream had by Pharaoh, which was interpreted by Joseph. In the dream, Pharaoh sees seven skinny cows eating seven large cows. Joseph interprets the dream as predicting seven years of plenty, followed by seven years of famine.


Try to understand the context. For example, if you see five golden rings it can be seen as 5 days, weeks, months or years if you see it in a context of time. Five can also be a representation of the five evil kings of Israel.If you have lost five family members that are close to you, it might be a symbol that they are in heaven. You have to look at the number in the context of the rest of the dream to uncover the true meaning.

, There are many items that may seem ordinary but can hold significance when interpreting your dreams. Most obvious among these might be objects like a cross, bread and wine, or a burning bush.


Other objects may be less obvious symbolic but still significant. Some examples could be as ordinary as an apple, coins, or candles. If you notice an ordinary object that seems important in the dream, it may be a symbol.

, For example, standard dream dictionaries may also interpret a goat as symbolic of prosperity, while from a religious perspective a goat is most often associated with oppressors and unrepentant sinners., Consider possible meanings of each symbol, particularly how they may relate to your situation in life. If you have a religious dream, it is likely that God has made the dream so that it will speak to you. If you examine the symbols enough you will likely find the hidden meaning that feels right and significant to you.

, If you dream that somebody is going to die, it may be a literal meaning, or it could be symbolic. If someone has died in a dream it could be symbolic of cutting ties with that person or situation.


Many common religious symbols have recurred in dreams for different people. Serpents or snakes representing an evil. Nakedness representing closeness with God. Houses and their state of disrepair or beauty can symbolize the state of your spirit. These symbols are all common among dreams with religious implications., Consider if there are any aspects of your life in which you feel the same emotions that you experienced in the dream.


If you are under a lot of stress or extremely busy, your dream may just be your mind's way of processing the day while you sleep. Sometimes you may even have a dream that seems religious, but doesn't feel like a divine message. If it doesn't seem significant or important, it may not be worth stressing out over the interpretation.

, If the dream seems like a very important message or warning, then look deeper and ask God what he is trying to teach you. Sometimes a religious dream may be a challenge from God to make you seek some important truth. Don't ignore a dream just because it seems difficult to understand. Seek out the answer from God and in the bible.


Ask yourself if this is an answer to a question that you have asked God. God can give you answers through a dream.

No one can tell the meaning of a dream, all the time.,
Look at the history of psyche and windows.,
See if it could be an analogy for your life.,
You can try being the people and symbols in your dream, but for many, doing this by oneself doesn't yield much richness, emotion, or insight.,
If you prefer a less committed approach to understand your dreams, then simply tell your dreams to a trusted friend or write them in a journal.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving Windows," Perhaps the first step to solving the mystery of a dream or series of dreams is the realization that no other person, no matter how schooled, practiced, or confident, can tell you this meaning. Many people, and some professions, profess to have this ability. But generally, you can uncover a deeper truth if you revisit the dream yourself, perhaps with the help of a trusted guide.;
, At the turn of the 20th century Sigmund Freud used dreams as a window into unconscious desires. Later, Carl Jung wrote about a ""collective unconscious"" and archetypal symbols, but emphasized the unique and personal significance of dream symbols. He found understanding dreams helpful to himself and others. But perhaps the most practical and helpful insight for contemporary seekers is in the work of Fritz Perls. Both writings and videos are available to further your exploration beyond these brief steps.


Fritz helped people to explore dreams by helping them act out or relive the components of their dream. They acted out the people and even the symbols in their dreams. The dreamer becomes ""the window"" itself. How does the window feel about what is happening in the dream? What is the window's part in this theater? What does the window say to the other dream people and objects? Although this may sound silly or strange, most people are surprised by the feeling and insight that arises in reliving a dream in this way.

, Look at all similarities, no matter how small

, You may need a trusted guide or group to go with you. It may take courage to journey into a dream. Trusted people are those who will not tell you what your dream means because they understand it is within you and is yours. Trusted people are those who can cry or laugh with you and who are as brave as yourself, if need be.


You may already know a trusted person or group. If you seek others to come with you on a dream journey, interview them first. They must be willing. And beware of those who seem to know the meanings you do not yet understand. Prefer those who are kind and more interested in the journey than the destination.

, Over time, and later, the significance may reveal itself to you. Enjoy your dreams, even the frightful ones, for the rich and complex tapestry they reveal about the person you really are.

Be wary of “one-size fits all” interpretations.",How to Predict the Future by Interpreting Your Dreams," The first step to predicting the future through dreams to is to remember them. Prophetic dreams, also called “precognitive dreams,” do not occur much, if at all, so you will have to be vigilant when it comes to remembering and reading your dreams. With effort, you can get better at holding onto the dreams, images, and symbols after waking.When you wake, hold the dream in your mind’s eye. This is when the dream is freshest and before your mind might unwittingly add to it.
Try to recall the whole dream, include places, colors, emotions, and images. Each detail of the dream matters.Try to figure what where you were, what you were doing, who else appeared in your dream, and what was the interaction between you and others.Focus on these images rather than a narrative. Dreams are often just a series of images and not connected in a coherent way, and our mind later orders them.;
, Putting down the dream in writing will help you to reinforce it in your memory. Start a notebook dedicated to your dreams, using it to record images and sequence whenever possible, improving your recall.Place the dream journal near your bed. That way, you can grab it immediately after waking up and record what you experienced.
Having your dreams in a notebook will also be useful when you start your analysis. You will be able to compare dreams with those in the past, contrast symbols, and also have a handy reference.

, In reading dreams, you’ll need to focus on several factors. One of these is context and setting. Pay attention to where dreams occur, what it is like, and whether or not the setting is familiar to you.


Did your dream occur somewhere that you have been before, for example? Or perhaps it was a strange location or even your mind’s invention? These details could point to meaning.
Be aware of the dream’s time-frame. For example, while some dreams take place at an indeterminate time, others are vaguely in the future or have a clear date.
Note any associations that you have with a dream’s context, as well. Were you at your late grandparents’ farm? Maybe you were at church. Write these details down, too.

, Note the people, animals, or other non-human beings that appear to you in dreams and consider your relationship to them. The figures who appear in our dreams can sometimes carry meaning or represent other parts of our psyche, that is, parts of the mind that might want to give you a message.


Record who these figures are and what they do in your dream, making sure to analyze how they interact with you. Be as specific as possible.
People in your dreams may not represent anything out of the ordinary. For instance, if you dream about an ex-boyfriend, he might simply represent your ex-boyfriend.
Sometimes, however, figures appear in dreams that carry messages. Figures with whom you have a less direct personal relationship can especially be these harbingers of news – or even of the future., Dreams often have an emotional overtone or feeling to them, recording and analyzing which may give you insight into its possible meaning for the future. Focus on how you felt during the dream.When you take down your impressions for each dream, pause on the emotions and try to puzzle them out. Did you feel anxious – why? Did you feel fearful or hopeful? Again, why?

, If you want to predict the future through your dreams, you’ll need to inform yourself about dreams as such and their meaning. For one thing, your daily life and emotions have a lot do to with what you dream. They can contain fragments of our activities and thoughts as well as anxieties, hopes, and fears. If you dream about flying or coming to class naked, for example, you are probably dreaming about suppressed fears rather than the future.


You might try reading up on dream symbology to help in your self-analysis. The idea that dreams reflect the subconscious and can “symbolize” things in our minds was pioneered by psychologists like Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, for example. Pick up a copy of Freud’s “The Interpretation of Dreams,” if you feel up to it.
Carl Jung even thought that some images in dreams access a “collective unconscious” that cuts across all places and times. You’ll need to bone up on these ideas if you want to identify precognitive dreams., Some people have extended the work of thinkers like Freud and Jung and put together “dictionaries” of dream symbols. You can find these on the internet, with a lot of detail for symbols like water, doors, fences, dogs, cats, and other things.


To use one of these resources, go back to your dream journal, find important images, and then search for them. Try to be exhaustive and specific for, as you will see, the dictionaries often give very specific meanings.
The idea behind a dream dictionary is that images or symbols have definite meanings, which you can then plug into your dream. For example, you may encounter future trouble with your sexuality if you had a foreboding dream about a mongoose.If you dream that you are trapped inside of a coffin with a mongoose, the dream might mean two things: you will have trouble with your sexuality, and that it is a situation you should address., Once you have a good record of your dreams, more knowledge about dream theories, and access to dictionaries of symbols, try hard to parse your dreams. Put together all of your resources – are there hidden messages in some?


By categorizing the things that you dream about the most, as well as people, figures, and places, you should start to have a fairly detailed map of your dreams.
Slowly start to work through your dream journal to see the possible meaning of symbols. Write these symbols down or keep charts, if it helps you to stay organized. Ask yourself: do any elements of your dreams have a possible reading for future events?
Some precognitive dreams might be easier to spot than others. For example, you may be aware during a dream that you are receiving a prophecy. Alternately, you may meet with a courier – this is a straightforward symbol that you are getting a message. , Dreams are highly personal and, in fact, scientists still don’t quite know why we dream. If you are seriously interested in dream interpretation, you’ll be happy to know that they may well have some meaning for your life. However, you probably won’t be able to use them to predict the future.


Some scientists think that dreams are a result of the brain firing at random. Some think that animals, humans included, evolved dreaming as a defense mechanism, while others believe that we dream in order to process information at the end of the day.Still, other people strongly believe that dreams can be something more. Perhaps they aren’t precognitive, but is it possible that a dream could be a message from someone or something? We really don’t know.

, Analyzing your dreams may well help you to better understand yourself and your subconscious. You may find fears, hopes, and aspirations that you weren’t aware of before. However, whether you can take a specific lesson from a dream is not so clear.


Dreams and symbols will vary from person to person. While some might be universal, as Jung thought, many more probably aren’t.
Given how unproven dream interpretation is, you should be careful about using it to guide your life or as the basis for major decisions., Many dream resources pretend to have all the answers. They will assign detailed, specific meanings for all sorts of symbols. Does dream interpretation really work like this? In fact, it is probably a lot more complex. Don’t trust everything that you read.


You know yourself best, and many times can identify the meaning or association of a symbol better than a dream dictionary. Trust your own judgement.
If you want to get to the meaning behind your dreams, you might also try seeing a psychoanalyst. She might not be able to tell your future, but perhaps she can shine some light onto your subconscious.

Keep them right beside your bed so you can grab them as soon as you wake up., Before you fully wake up or go to the bathroom, start writing down the details of your dream. Dreams can slip away easily if you don't take action as soon as you wake.If you aren't a big writer, consider drawing your dream instead. That can still help you get the main ideas down, as well as work through what the dream meant to you., When you're jotting down ideas, make sure to get the overall gist of the dream first. Think about what happened in the dream. Write down who you saw or talked to. Include the setting and any symbols that kept popping up. Try to get as much down about the big picture as you can.For instance, maybe your dream was connected to a certain event, like your grandfather's funeral. Maybe the whole scene was awash in black, and you talked to several of your cousins.
Alternatively, maybe the dream involved a black ocean, and you were the only person in the dream.

, After you get the major details, try filling in the smaller points. Stretch yourself to remember as many details as you possibly can. Think about the time of the day and the season. Note any other colors that pop up, as well. Think about the background, and try to remember if you forgot anyone who was in the dream.For instance, maybe in your ocean dream the sun was setting, and it was late summer.

, Emotions are a big part of interpreting your dream. They can guide how you think about your dream and what it means to you, as dreams are very personal. Note what you're feeling when you wake up.For instance, some people may find swimming alone in an ocean terrifying, while others might find it to be serene.

, To help remember your dreams better, you can take a few steps. For instance, try not to drink alcohol the night before. Also, tell yourself you will remember your dreams right before you sleep. While that may seem silly, it can actually help you set up your brain to remember better., In your dreams, an apple isn't always just an apple. It can mean something else. In other words, things in your dreams can be symbols for other things. Dreams are a glimpse into your subconscious mind, and your brain may use a variety of things to represent that subconscious to you. It's especially important to pay attention to things that keep showing up or that stick out for one reason or another.Maybe in your dream you are swimming in an ocean of black. You're alone in the water, and the sun is setting. Eventually, you reach an island that is all in color. You climb on the beach and then wake up.
In this dream, the ocean is obviously a major symbol, as is the island. However, it's also important that the dream switched from black to color.

, It's tempting to try to interpret dreams on some cosmic level. It's true that some things symbolize similar things for many people. However, your dream is your dream, so what a symbol means in another person's dream may not be what it means in yours. Try to think about how that symbol has had meaning in the past or what the object represents to you, personally.As an example, take the ocean in your dream. To some people, that ocean could symbolize something trying to swallow you up, especially if you have a fear of drowning. To other people, it could mean a way to get where you're going, especially if you love the water.

, Black can mean any number of things. It can represent emotional darkness or a diving into the subconscious.It can represent a bad situation for you or something dark going on in your life.It may also represent mystery or death, as well as feeling unloved.In your dream, the blackness could represent you trying to swim through your subconscious, or it could be a representation of death to an old life.

, For many people, black has a negative connotation, representing fears, for instance. However, that may not be the case with you. Maybe you like the color black, so it represents something different for you.If black has a positive connotation for you, for example, it could represent a pathway to something new.

, Think about your dream as a whole. Think about what you were feeling and thinking upon waking. Also, think about what's been going on in your life lately. How does the blackness play into the dream as a whole?Think about all the details. Was the ocean rough or smooth?Did you find the colorful island to be a welcome relief or just a part of the journey?

, Once you've thought about all the aspects of the dream, think about it applies to your life. After all, your dream is a dive into your subconscious, so what it means is going to be personal to your life.For instance, maybe this dream represents an awakening to a different path in your life. On the other hand, it could be symbolic of something that's happened recently, such as the birth of a new child. It could mean you feel like you're about to drown (emotionally speaking), and you need to take a break. Whatever it is, as long as the interpretation has meaning for you, that's all that matters.

This will help you look at the dream objectively to find meaning. As soon as you wake up, jot down as much as you can remember.Keep a journal by your bed. Many people find they forget details of dreams shortly after waking up.
Jot down everything you remember. Track specifics, like colors, shapes, sounds, words, and so on. The more detailed of a description you leave, the easier it will be to interpret the dream's meaning.;
, The biggest key to interpreting a dream is considering your own feelings. Dreams are highly personal. How you respond to the symbols in dreams says a lot about what those symbols mean for you on a personal level. If you're dreaming about seals, record your feelings in these dreams. How do the seals make you feel?Think about how you're feeling upon waking up. Do you feel peaceful and rested? Or do you feel anxious and unhappy?
If you're fixated on the seals, think about them specifically. How did you feel when the seals entered your dreams? Were they frightening and ominous or were they friendly? Did they put you at ease, or make you nervous?

, Try to get in touch with your dream self. As you remember and record the dream, try to remember any specific thoughts you had during the dream. These can be major clues when it comes to interpreting the dream.Do you remember having any thoughts in the dream? For example, say you were being chased by the seals. Did you think anything like, ""I'm not going to make it"" or ""They're gong to attack me""?
Try to connect these thoughts to thoughts you have throughout the day. Dreams are often a reflection of your current situation or struggles. Think about any moments during the day in which you had similar thoughts to those in your dream. You may realize the seals represent something from your actual life.

, Oftentimes, we are not ourselves in our dreams. You also may find that you're playing a role you would not normally play in life. For example, you may be aggressive in your dream while you tend to be non-confrontational in real life. Think about the role you play, and how it makes you feel.Think about how you felt about the role you played in your dream. This can potentially tell you something about the dream's meaning.
Say you were a hero in the dream. Think about how that felt. Maybe your dream was a form of wish fulfillment. Do you sometimes wish you could be more heroic in real life?

, Most symbolism in dreams is highly personal. However, no one is completely unaware of culture and the cultural meanings or associations that are often attached to images. Think about any potential meanings or metaphors regarding seals.There is a certain duality in seals that can be symbolic. While seals live in the ocean, they can also come up on land. A seal in a dream may suggest confusion regarding one's place in the world.
Seals are excellent swimmers and able to navigate water. A seal in a dream may have something to do with the ability to go with the flow of life. If you've felt overwhelmed recently, a seal in your dream can be representative of a longing for more control.
Seals are also sea animals. Water can represent many different things. Calm, still water can represent reflection and inner peace. Stormy water, however, can indicate personal conflict.

, If you want to know what a dream means, you have to look at your current life. When you dream about seals, they may be representative of something you are struggling with personally. Dreams can sometimes even direct answers to your personal struggles.Think about what's been on your mind lately. Have you been feeling overwhelmed by something at work or a personal relationship? Have you been struggling to make a big decision?
Your dream may be telling you something. If you're, say, torn between two career paths, your dream may be pointing you in a certain direction. If you've been feeling negative about yourself, your dream may be trying help you figure out how and where to change. Be open to letting your dream guide you as you identify any underlying concerns in your life.

, Whiles symbols in dreams can certainly be affected by culture, symbols are often highly personal. When it comes to your dream's meaning, you're the expert. If you've been dreaming of seals, think about your own personal feelings regarding seals. This can tell you a lot about what the dream may mean.Have seals ever had a large importance in your life? Do you have any particularly strong memories of seals?
For example, maybe seals were your favorite animal as a child. One of your earliest childhood memories is of your father taking you to see seals at the zoo. This could potentially be significant. The dream could be about your father, or your childhood.

, Dream dictionaries tend to give general answers that are not applicable to everyone. Answers also tend to vary greatly between dictionaries. Just because a seal is a good luck omen for some does not mean that will ring true for you. Even with universal elements, different people have different associations. You're better off considering your own specific associations with seals than thumbing through a dream dictionary., Once you've examined all elements, try to put it all together. As you do so, push yourself to scrutinize each aspect of your dream. This will help you meticulously consider the potential meanings.For example, you remember an image from the dream. You are swimming in the ocean with your best friend when a large herd of seals approach. The seals surround you, and your friend is nowhere to be found.
Start asking questions. What did the seals look like? What kind of seals were they? What do seals normally represent to you? What does the beach normally represent to you? How did you feel when the seals approached? Were you concerned about where your friend went?

, Try to figure out what the seals in your dream meant. After you've answered a variety of questions regarding the dream, think about what meaning these answers point towards.Again, think about what seals mean to you traditionally. For example, seals were your favorite animal as a child. Your father used to take you to the zoo to see seals when you were very young.
You can apply this meaning to the example above as you consider the other symbols in the scene. Your best friend is a friend from college, a time in life when you left your childhood behind. You rarely went to the beach as a child, as you lived in an urban area. You felt happy when the seals surrounded you, and were not particularly worried about where your friend was.
Childhood images in this scene made you feel at peace. This dream could potentially represent a longing to return to childhood. Maybe you miss something about your youth.

, You need to return to your personal feelings in the present to see what the dream was trying to tell you. Remember, dreams can sometimes be a reflections of your current emotions. Again, think about what you've been going through lately.Think about the feelings and thoughts you had in the dream. Have you had those same feelings and thoughts during real life recently? For example, maybe you felt the same sense of happiness earlier in the week when your brother called. The two of you reminisced about your childhood, and you left the conversation feeling relaxed.
What else has been going on lately? Maybe you've felt distant from your family. You have started a new job, and you have not had as much time to keep in touch. You've felt very stressed and disconnected from others lately.

, Is there any decision you're trying to make or obstacle you're trying to overcome? Your dream may be nudging you in a particular direction. Stop and think about what's been going on with you and what the dream may be trying to tell you.For example, maybe you're unsure if you want to remain in your current career path. You have a job lead closer to your family. The job pays less, but you've been considering pursuing the job anyway.
Maybe your dream is encouraging you to seek work closer to home. You are being reminded that you value family, and that being close to your parents and siblings is important to you.

However, it is very difficult to remember all these dreams. If a dream wakes you up, write that down immediately in a dream journal that you keep next to your bed. If you go back to sleep before writing it down, chances are that you will forget it ever happened. You can only interpret your dreams if you can remember them in as much detail as possible.Keep a journal, working pen, and soft lamp next to your bed to make it easier to write dreams down in the middle of the night.;
, Never skip a morning in your journal. Even when you do not remember your dreams, note that in your journal. You will soon train your brain to remember your dreams simply by reinforcing the journaling process.It is best for you to write your dreams down immediately after waking up to make sure that your conscious mind does not rewrite or alter the plot of the dream., Any dream you hope to interpret should be written down. This helps you recall your dreams in the short-term and the long-term.Be sure that you write down every detail you remember as well as your emotional state upon waking.Details to write down include:


People you met in the dream
How you felt at each stage in the dream
The setting of the dream
Your physical manifestation in the dream--what did you look like? What were you wearing?
The plot of the dream
Your mode of transportation in the dream
The origin and destination of your dream journey
The motivation for your dream journey

, If you dream about journeys often, you might begin to see common themes and patterns emerging over time. By recording your dreams, you will be able to determine these recurring patterns more clearly and accurately, allowing you to better understand your own dreams.Reread your dream journal to determine whether journeying is a common theme in your dreams, which could be significant.


Pay attention to subtle changes in your dreams over time. They might tell you whether you are growing and changing in important ways., Sometimes journey dreams involve you moving under your own power, such as when you walk, run, or fly. Other journey dreams involve you being moved by a vehicle such as a boat, car, or train. Take a few minutes to consider whether you were moving yourself or whether something else was moving you.Ask yourself whether you were the one in control or whether someone else was in charge of your journey. For example, many flying dreams involve a feeling of confidence, control, and freedom.On the other hand, a dream where you are in the caboose of a train might indicate that you feel behind in life.This can help you decide whether your journey is a positive adventure that you chose or an unpleasant decision that you are forced to make.


The state of your vehicle might make a difference to the interpretation of the dream as well. A decrepit vehicle might indicate uncertainty or low self-esteem, for example. Think about whether your mode of transit reminds you of yourself or of anything important in your life., If your pathway is rough and your destination blocked along the way, this is an indicator that something is obstructing your path in life. You may be anxious about not achieving goals in life and you may lack faith in your abilities to get you to your destination. After waking, if you find that the obstacle is still looming large in your memory, you may need to make a change to your life to enable you to move on.If your pathway is clear and smooth, you may feel optimistic about new possibilities ahead.If your path involves a fork or a crossroads, that can mean that you have to face a decision that has several facets. Each probably has good and bad aspects and only you can weigh the consequences to see where the decision might lead you., Ask yourself how you feel about your ultimate destination. Are you excited to get there? Scared? Uncertain? Are you confident in the location of the destination, or is your journey taking you to new and strange territory? Answering these questions can help you interpret how you feel about important decisions in your own life. Do you want to try something new and exciting, or would you prefer to have stability in your life?Some dreams end in dead-ends instead of arriving at your destination. This suggests that the path you chose is not leading you where you want to be. Consider whether any aspect of your life is unsatisfying.
Many dream journeys do not even have a destination, which indicates that you are more concerned with the process of the journey itself than your ultimate goals in life.

, What are you passing along your route to your destiny? A dreamer passing through a lush forest might be thinking about his or her wonder and personal growth.A dreamer traveling through a desert may be worried about loneliness, emptiness, and stagnation.If you do not recall the scenery or landscape around you, that may indicate that you are more concerned with the end goal than you are with the journey to get there.

, Getting lost, delayed, or distracted is a common theme in dreams involving travel. For example, you might dream that you lose your passport or that you took the wrong freeway exit.Being sidetracked demonstrates that something is sidetracking you from your real goals. Getting lost is a metaphor for being lost in life and not knowing your true direction. It can also mean that you are afraid of losing your identity. If you are frantically searching for a way back to the main road, it can be indicative of your need to find a map to life and to shore up your insecure feelings about your life.

, Many journey dreams will give you physical obstacles, burdens, and limitations that you do not experience in your waking life. If you are somehow limping or on crutches during a journey dream, this indicates that something is holding you back and impeding faster progress. If you are laden down by another person, this may mean that somebody in your life has become a burden and is holding you back.

, According to many theories of dream interpretation, certain major symbols have universal significance. These are recorded in dream dictionaries, which you can access online, in bookstores, and in libraries.If there are any major symbols you noticed in your dream, such as birds, snakes, teeth falling out, monsters, rainbows, or any other number of objects, look up their meaning in a dream dictionary. That might help you consider why they appeared to you while you were sleeping.

, Even though there may be some universal dream symbols and motifs, remember that your dreams are unique to your own personality, thoughts, and experiences.A road in your dream might mean something quite different to you than it would to another person. Do not let dream dictionaries obscure your own instincts or ideas.For example, flying dreams generally indicate freedom. However, if you felt anxious or claustrophobic during your flying dream, then pay more attention to your feelings than an entry in a dream dictionary., Where there any images or themes in your journey dream that are meaningful to you? For example, did you travel down a path that resembles where you grew up? Were you wearing your high school uniform? Think about any details that remind you of your childhood, career, or experiences.These might help you determine the meaning behind your dream.

, Were you happy to meet people during your journey, or did you feel like they were holding you back? Your thoughts and feelings about the people you met on your dream journey might help you figure out how you feel about the people you see in your waking life.For example, if you have to carry an annoying coworker on your back during your dream, that might indicate your frustration about how work tasks are being divided up.

, Dreams are important ways for people to solve major and minor problems in their lives. Simply dreaming about a topic can help you sort out how you want to proceed. Take a few minutes to list the major problems, dilemmas, or concerns you have in life. Your dream might have clues about your true thoughts and feelings about these problems, and might give you clues as to how to solve them., Sometimes dreams have major significance. Other times, objects appear in dreams simply because you have encountered these objects recently. This is known as ""day residue.""Feel free to ignore ""day residue"" in your dream interpretation, unless the residue evoked any significant emotions in you.


For example, your dream journey might take you past the restaurant where you ate lunch yesterday. This is likely day residue and not an important symbol to interpret.

, Dream journeys tend to indicate a concern about your general life path. Ask yourself whether you have recently experienced--or plan to experience soon--any major journeys. These could be physical journeys such as a cross-country move, vacation, or major work trip. These could also be metaphorical journeys such as getting married, changing careers, or finishing your degree.Take a few minutes to consider whether any of the feelings in your journey dream resemble feelings you have about your own life journeys.

, Dreams are often better at posing major life questions than they are at answering them.Do you feel like your dream is encouraging you to think more deeply about something in your life? Write down questions you have about your dream in your dream journal, and use them as a guide as you begin to make decisions about where your life will take you.


One way to help determine these questions is to think about other parts of your life that inspire the same emotions you felt in your dream. If you felt free and relaxed during your dream journey, think about other parts of your life that make you feel free and relaxed. Use this as a key to unlock the deeper meaning of your dream., If your dream journey was a difficult one, consider obstacles you face in your waking life. Ask yourself such questions as ""What obstacles are before me?"", ""Are my obstacles self-imposed?"", and ""What elements of my life need a good shake-up to let me move on?"". Look at your dream as an opportunity to solve your life problems.

, Dream interpretations are not neat and clean. Dreams are messy, confusing, and cannot always be understood. However, the process of interpreting dreams is valuable because they allow you to reflect deeply about your life.Even if you cannot come up with a simple explanation for your dream journey, congratulate yourself for pondering your life journey and reflecting on your life path.

Keep a dream diary.,
Identify your feelings.,
Ask questions.,
Pay attention to recurring thoughts in day-to-day life.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving the Color Red1," If you want to figure out what a particular dream means, you should keep a dream diary. Recording your dreams on a daily basis can help you remember details that are key to proper interpretation.


Try to write down your dreams first thing in the morning. People tend to forget dreams quickly as the day goes on. Have a pen and notebook near your bed so you can record your dreams as soon as possible in the morning.Write down as many details as possible. Where were in the dream? Were you yourself or a character or person? Where did red show up in your dream? What other colors were present besides red?;
, When it comes to dream interpretation, feelings are just as important as details. When you're recording your dreams, try to keep track of how you felt during the dream.


Many psychiatrists and psychologists who study dreams believe the feelings experienced during give clues to its meaning. Try to remember how you felt during the dream. If red played a particularly large role, pay close attention to how you felt in the presence of red.Were you sad in the dream? Happy? Remorseful? Frightened? Dreams can provoke a variety of feelings. You may even experience contradictory feelings during the course of a dream. Try to be as detailed as possible when transcribing your feelings during a dream., Even a mundane dream can give you insight into your personal life. When recording your dreams, question every detail.


Say you dream you were sitting in a red tent petting a cat. Were you otherwise alone in the tent? Was the cat just a random cat or a friend's cat, your cat, a cat you had in childhood? What associations do you have with cats? Do cats remind you of any friends or family members? Do tents and camping have any particular associations?Dream interpretation requires a lot of self-questioning. Push yourself to pause and ask questions about every detail of your dream., Dreams provide insight into your thoughts and feelings. Your dreams may be an expression of how you feel, unconsciously, about a certain aspect of your day-to-day life. If you've been having recurring thoughts about, say, your job, your dream may be a reflection of this."

Consider your relationship with the color red.,
Learn some common associations with the color red.,
Allow yourself to be the expert.,
Consider all factors of the dream.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving the Color Red2," When it comes to dream interpretation, you are the expert. While some people propose that certain images are universal, most psychiatrists feel your personal connection with a color is more important than what that color symbolizes on a winder scale. When you think of red, what do you think of?

, While your personal connection is the most important, it can help to at least familiarize yourself with some theory on color and dreams. In dreams, red has sometimes been said to symbolize intense feelings. People also tend to associate red with increased activity and intense emotions like anger, passion, determination, and general excitement. Physically, red has a stimulating effect on blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration., Learn to trust yourself. You are the expert in regards to your unconscious mind. As dreams are heavily based in personal associations, memories, and relationships, you're the best judge of what symbols in your dreams mean. Do not rely too heavily on outside opinions and research. Allow yourself to interpret the dream based on your own feelings and experiences., Once you've gone through and recorded the dream and your feelings, put it all together. Considering all factors, what do you think the dream means?


Let's return to the tent example. For the sake of this example, you're a middle-aged divorced man. Say, in this dream, you felt at peace. The cat you were petting was a cat you had in childhood that died. You used to camp in your backyard as a young boy, sometimes with other children and sometimes alone. Lately, you've been having recurring thoughts about aging. You just turned 40 and are becoming more aware of how quickly time passes. You associate red with your wedding day, as the bridesmaids wore red dresses.
Perhaps the red tent dream points to the fact you're missing better times. You may feel you're past your peak in life and long to return to a time of promise and potential. The red in the dream points to your wedding, a time of new beginnings and hope. The dream may be a sign you need to acknowledge and deal with your feelings of depression and regret."

Understand there is little science in dream interpretation.,
Avoid dream dictionaries.,
Talk to a therapist about troubling dreams.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving the Color Red3," While dream interpretation is a popular form of pop psychology, there is very little research behind it. Keep this in mind when interpreting your dreams.


Freud's theories on dreams have been widely discredited and most modern psychiatrists and therapists take dreams with a grain of salt.
While your dreams may point to inner desires and feelings, keep in mind there is much we do not know about dreams. Scientists are still unsure what purpose dreams serve.
Despite this, most psychiatrists and doctors agree dreams do hold some meaning. It might not be a bad idea to consider the meaning of strange and recurring dreams. However, be skeptical of any interpretations as the dream code has yet to be cracked., Dream dictionaries offer theories on universal meanings in dream symbolism. However, your personal connection to a color or symbol is vastly more important than externally prescribed meanings. Not to mention many dream dictionaries are based on shoddy research. You're better off considering your own thoughts and feelings than consulting a dream dictionary., If you have a recurring dream that's preventing you from getting quality sleep, talk to a therapist. Recurring disturbing dreams can be a symptom of many psychiatric disorders.

Don’t move.,
Keep your eyes closed.,
Breathe slowly and deeply.,
Recall the last impressions of the dream.",How to Continue a Dream from Where You Left Off1," If you wake up in the middle of a dream you wish to revisit, lie perfectly still. When you move around upon waking up, the sensory stimuli of your surroundings begins to interfere with the remnants of the dream lingering in your mind. This will quickly cause the remembered elements of the dream to dissipate., It is much easier to return to sleep if you keep your body in a sleep-ready state. This means you should remain still, your body should be relaxed and, most importantly, your eyes should be shut. Light has the effect of waking up the brain, which is the last thing you want: if you’re to have any chance of recreating a dream environment, it has to be done fast, before the impression left by the dream fades.Keeping your room as dark as possible while sleeping can minimize unwanted light stimulation.

, Keep your breathing under control. Try to take the same long, slow breaths you would when stretching after a workout. The sooner you can return your breathing to the cadence of rest, the better chance you have of falling back to sleep while the components of the dream are still buzzing in your unconscious mind.Regulated breathing techniques, like the 4-7-8 breathing method, might help you nod off faster if it tends to take you a while to get back to sleep.
To perform 4-7-8 breathing, all you have to do is inhale slowly to the count of 4, hold your breath for 7 seconds and then exhale forcefully and completely to the count of 8. As the brain is oxygenated, the body will naturally enter a relaxed state and become more receptive to the hormones that induce sleep.Many people claim that by regulating their breathing, they are able to fall asleep in as little as one minute.

, Try to remember as much as you can about the dream you were having when you were jolted awake. What was happening? Who were the players involved? What did the environment look like? How did you feel about what was going on? Let yourself lie in that unthinking, emotionally receptive state until you manage to get back to sleep.Dreams are essentially random combinations of sensory reactions, feelings and thoughts that are mined from waking life. If you remain focused on resuming an aborted dream while falling asleep, there’s a greater likelihood that your next string of dreams will contain the same images and events.
Many sleep researchers believe that the emotional response is the most influential factor in how much we remember of dreams.

Assemble your materials to properly prepare for journaling.,
Split the journal into 3 parts.,
Start journaling as soon as you know you're pregnant to capture a full record.,
Include your biography to set up a background for your journal.,
Set aside the time to write to make sure you journal regularly.,
Write for at least 15-20 minutes to give yourself enough time for detail.",How to Create a Pregnancy Journal1," To start your pregnancy journal, you will need to gather a variety of supplies. By getting everything you need in advance and making a firm decision to journal, you will be able to stick to your plan and create a beautiful journal. You will need some necessities, and may want to add some materials for fun. Some ideas are:


If you plan to keep a journal in written form, get a notebook with a hard cover, preferably with no lines.
Get wrapping paper to decorate the notebook, and scissors, glue, pencils, markers and anything else you plan to use to fill in the journal.
Get a camera to record images of important events during your pregnancy.
Get a computer if you plan to keep a diary in electronic format - in the form of a blog or video blog.;
, An easy way to structure you pregnancy journal is to split it into three parts, one part for each trimester. At the beginning of each trimester, mark your calendar and use it to keep track of important moments such as:


When you found out that you are pregnant
The first date you felt your baby move
When you told your parents
When you first saw a doctor

, To make sure that you are getting all the details of your pregnancy, start writing immediately. If you postpone your writing for later, you may find some of the details fade from your memory.


Write about how you found out that you are pregnant. Did you find out from the doctor, a pregnancy test, or your own intuition?
Take pictures of the test if you are able to. Were you planning to become pregnant or not? How did you feel when you found out? What was the reaction of your partner? How did your family react?

, Writing a bit about your biography will help set the stage in your mind for when you read your journal later in life. The background information will help bring you back in time, and allow you to remember how you viewed the world when you started your journal.


Refer to important landmarks and important decisions in your life, write about them and explain why you made them.
Finally, as the last important piece of your biography, specify your decision to have a child.

, Choosing a specific time to journal will allow you to stick to a schedule and consistently add to your journal. It can be hard to journal when your everyday life gets in the way, but you will grow to see your journaling time as a welcome respite from the pressures of the day.


If you have a lot of time and a lot of strong emotions, write in your journal every time you feel something noteworthy.
If you have a lot of obligations, mark important moments in the calendar at the top of each trimester, but take the time to write at least once a week or more often, when you are most motivated.

, Writing for more than 15 minutes will let you take note of things that you wouldn't think about in three minutes. Write about everything you can think of, from how you feel, what happened during your pregnancy to you and others, to any changes you noticed within yourself.


When you start writing, the words will flow.

Keep a journal by your bed.,
Write in it directly after waking up.,
Start with the big details.,
Write down your emotions.,
Note any other details.,
Make a drawing.,
Note what type of fruit tree it was.,
Know it could mean good things.,
Understand what the time of year could mean.,
Note the connotations.,
Consider what you were feeling.,
Cross-reference with other details of your dream.,
Understand what it could mean for your children.",How to Interpret a Dream Involving Fruit Trees," Have a pen and paper ready on your nightstand. That way, you have it available to write down details when you have a vivid dream., If you wait to write your dream down, even to go to the bathroom, you'll forget most of what you dreamed. Take the time to start writing as soon as you are coming out of the dream., As your writing about your dream, make note of the big details. What happened? Why were you looking at trees? Where were the trees? Who was with you? Make sure you capture the major points of the dream.For instance, maybe you dreamed of an apple tree that used to be in your Grandmother's backyard. Maybe you also saw a baby asleep in its branches.

, Dreams make you feel things just like real-life events. As you wake up, note what you're feeling. Are you scared? Happy? Excited? Sad? Jot down what you're feeling.For instance, maybe you had a feeling of contentment when you woke up from your dream.

, Now that you've got the main gist of the dream, include any extra details you can think of. What season was it? Was it night or day? What did the light look like? These little details can help you further interpret your dreams.Maybe your dream was at sunrise in the spring, and the sun was coming up behind the tree.

, Sometimes it's easier to make a drawing of what you saw, rather than write it. It doesn't have to be a perfect drawing. You're trying to get the feeling of the dream, not just render it in perfect detail., The type of fruit tree can make a difference to the interpretation. Different types of fruit represent different things.For instance, apple trees can mean joy and entertainment,while fruits that cluster together on the tree can mean togetherness and unity.
If you associated good memories with your grandmother's apple tree, it could be a sense of contentment about a decision you recently made to have children, symbolized by the baby. Remember, what you dream is related to your life, so you should always interpret in relation to your thoughts and memories.
Grapefruit could mean you've felt in high spirits lately while kiwi could mean you need to be revits., Often, dreaming of fruit trees can mean good is coming your way. Some people think it is a sign of wealth to come. In fact, if you own your own business, you could see an increase in sales after a dream like this one.In some cultures, dreams are believed to provide keys to the future. For instance, your apple tree dream could mean you'll have a baby on the way soon.
If you're employed by someone, it could mean you'll move up in the company., What time of year it is in your dream can affect the interpretation. For instance, full, blossoming trees may mean joy and happiness while bare winter trees or withering fruit might mean there is sorrow in your life.Similarly, if the fruit is not ripe enough, it may mean you need to put in more hard work to achieve your dreams.In your dream with the baby, the fact that it was spring could symbolize new life.

, Because fruit is associated with spring, it could mean you have new beginnings ahead. Spring represents re-awakenings or new starts, so it could mean now is the time to start something new.The flowers in your dream, along with the fact that it's associated with your family, could mean the blossoming of children in your life.

, If you saw withered fruit but were overjoyed at the sight, it could mean you are happy to see the end of a project, idea, or relationship. Similarly, if you see ripe fruit but it brings you sadness in your dream, it could have other meanings, such as you got your desired wealth but at a high cost.The sense of contentment you felt could mean you know your grandmother would be happy about the decision you made, even if she's not still alive.

, You likely didn't dream about just fruit trees. Use what else was in your dream to help interpret the meaning, as one small symbol can influence your dream one way or another.


In your dream, remember you dreamed about your grandmother's tree, the baby, and the sun. The sun could symbolize the rising of a different phase in your life.

, Another meaning could be good news for your children. In Chinese culture, seeing fruit on a tree means your children will have a good fortune."

Remember all you can.,
Solidify the ideas of the dream.,
Write out the details of the dream.,
Create sketches of the action.",How to Continue a Dream from Where You Left Off2," If you’ve been thrust back into consciousness and there’s no chance of immediately returning to sleep, gather the dream in your thoughts. Take inventory of the most important and memorable details of the dream, and especially our place within it: what you were doing, how you were perceiving the action, etc.It’s important to try to grasp as much of the dream as you can while it’s present in your short-term memory. The part of the brain that forms and stores memories is effectively dormant when dreaming, so the details will quickly evaporate, possibly for good.If you’re unsure whether you actually remember a certain detail or your imagination is just filling it in, zero in on it anyway. If nothing else, it will come in handy for helping you resume a dream that’s close to the original, with missing details supplied by your own creative touch.

, Turn each remembered impression into a real thing with physical qualities. Focus on how things looked and sounded, what the setting was like and any other sensory aspects you can recollect. This will give your mind images of substance to fix on while you attempt to redirect it back to the dream state.


A good method for coaxing out as much detailed memory as possible is to quiz your dream memory on the six basic questions that journalists attempt to answer when investigating a story: who, what, where, when, why and how., In as much detail as possible, write out what happened in the dream from the viewpoint from which it occurred. If you’re able to remember an entire scene, put it down from beginning to end. If you only retain fragments of the dream, try to order them with as much continuity as you can so that your brain can get back in the groove. Record the content of the dream accurately: it’s important that your mind be able to recall all the relevant details, like giving a description of a suspect to a police sketch artist.Don’t wait to jot down what you remember from a dream. It’s easy to fool yourself into thinking that you’ll be able to recall the dream later, but it’s never as simple as you think it will be.
Don't worry about spelling, grammar, or even writing in straight lines when scribbling an entry in your dream notebook. Just make sure you get it all out while it's on your mind!

, On a blank page next to your description, make a few quick drawings of the action that transpired in the dream. Give characters and happenings more of a visual foothold in your memory, as well as something to hold in your mind when you try to return to the dream. Think about the storybooks you read as a kid, and how they provided illustration for the major events of the narrative. Your dream notebook should contain as much as you can remember about each phase of the dream.If you wish, you can go so far as to color your dream sketches, or create a kind of progression of drawings like the storyboard for a film. The more detail you can record, the better.

"
"
Prepare to go to sleep.,
Conjure the experience of the dream.,
Play through the dream repeatedly.,
Try to fall asleep with the dream on your mind.",How to Continue a Dream from Where You Left Off3," In some instances, you may be trying to continue or revisit a dream that you had several nights or even weeks before. Start by getting your body ready for slumber, with eyes closed, body totally relaxed and breathing under control. Let your breath begin a natural rhythm. Shut out all thoughts unrelated to the dream you’re attempting to access.Make sure there are no unnecessary distractions in the room around you, like a television or radio that might make falling asleep difficult or wake you unexpectedly.
If you’ve been keeping a dream notebook, it can be helpful to review it prior to falling asleep so that the images remain firmly planted in your thoughts.

, Run your mind over the textures of the remembered dream, all of its sensory elements and the way it made you feel when you first experienced it. Put yourself back in that original emotional state. As you pass into sleep, think of your consciousness as in transit with the desired dream as your destination.

, Imagine that the dream you wish to relive is a scene from a movie being projected in your mind over and over again on repeat. Work through each individual section painstakingly, immersing yourself not only in the atmosphere of the dream but in the familiarity of the cycle.


The most clearly remembered details from dreams are usually taken from the end of REM sleep, right before you wake up. If you’re trying to carry on a particular dream, try to time the cycling of the remembered dream so that you fall asleep with the most vivid details fresh in your thoughts. Combine your dream visualization with calming regulated breathing techniques, and play through the most memorable parts of the dream slowly in your mind, like a film being played back at half speed., With any luck, you’ll pass successfully into sleep during the process of recollecting the details of your dream and consequently find yourself in a kind of variant of the original dream, complete with the same basic features but differing in the way that it plays out. With practice, you’ll gain further control over the structure of your dreams, revisiting the same type of dream multiple times, changing the action and outcome of your dreams and even choosing what to dream about.


If revisiting a certain dream doesn’t work on the first try, don’t get discouraged. It may take many attempts before you’re able to recreate a dream.
The practice of training oneself to moderate one’s dreams is known as “lucid dreaming”, thought by many to be a little-known way of exploiting the unconscious processes of the mind that take over when we’re asleep."

Write about your feelings to keep track of your mindset.,
Record the changes your body's changes.,
Think about the changes in your life.,
Jot down your fears.,
Contemplate your expectations in writing.,
Take note of your dreams.,
Write a letter to your child.,
Try to brainstorm your child's name.",How to Create a Pregnancy Journal2," Your feelings are a practically limitless source of inspiration for journal writing. During pregnancy, you may experience dramatic mood swings. You may become more sensitive and possibly more nervous than usual. Write about these feelings:


What made you happy?
Why are you crying?
What annoys you?

, Your body will definitely go through some changes during pregnancy. You might enjoy some of these changes, or you might be concerned about your body weight. Write about what is happening so you can reflect on it after your pregnancy is over.


Has your belly grown?
Do you have swollen feet, hands?
Does it seem that your nose is bigger?
What about your breasts?
Do you feel nauseous?

, Writing about changes in your life may help you process or prioritize your daily routine. Because getting pregnant directly forces you to alter your schedule for another human being, reflect on how you have accommodated the needs of the baby and your body.


How do you balance your work and pregnancy?
Have you changed your diet?
Have you given up cigarettes?
Are you more tired than usual?

, It's quite common to experience some fear when you become pregnant. Write about your fears and thoughts about childbirth, or your child's health. Processing these fears through writing can help you determine whether or not they are valid, or merely irrational thoughts.


Are you afraid of how your pregnancy will progress?
Are you afraid that your child will be born unhealthy?
Do you wonder whether or not you'll be a good parent?

, Writing about your expectations will allow you to realize whether or not they are worth holding. Many parents have unspoken expectations of their parenthood, ranging from the gender to the looks of the child.


If you do not know the sex of the child, do you expect that you will give birth to a boy or a girl?
Which parent will the child look like?
Do you expect to have a peaceful or wild child?

, Dreams can lend powerful insight into your subconscious. Many people believe that dreams accurately reflect the thoughts and feelings that are not readily accessible by your conscious thoughts during the waking hours of the day. Note your subconscious messages and try to interpret them.


See if any of your dreams come true or have real bearing on your life.

, Writing a letter to your child can be a great way to express your feelings about your impending motherhood. This exercise can help you anticipate and feel good about your future child.


Be open and honest.
Write to them about your thoughts and feelings.
Try talking about how much you look forward to their arrival, how much you are afraid, and more.

, If you haven't yet decided on a name for your baby, find inspiration for name ideas in your daily life, literature, art, or baby name books. Writing about your baby's name will help you decide on a good name, by letting your reason and feel through the different aspects of each name. If you have already chosen a name, write about that.


How did you choose the name? Who chose it?
Is the child named after someone and why?

Take pictures and include them in your journal to provide a visual element.,
Include some physical items to add variety and depth to your journal.,
Bring your family and friends into the journal to provide additional perspectives.,
Add an audio or video component.,
Note the birth details.,
Take pictures of the newborn baby.",How to Create a Pregnancy Journal3," Pictures speak a thousand words, and including many pictures in a pregnancy journal is a great way to capture special moments. It is a great idea for you to keep a camera with you throughout your pregnancy so that you can take pictures of yourself or have someone take pictures of you.


Many women include all sorts of pictures in their pregnancy journal, especially ultrasound pictures and pictures of their expanding abdomen as the baby grows inside them.
Take pictures of places you have visited while pregnant.
Note your progress on your stomach and photograph it once in a week.
Take pictures of your baby shower, and make a note of who is involved.
If your journal does not have space for physical items, pictures are a great way to add some mixed media to an otherwise text-based journal.

, Whether the journal is capable of holding physical items or not, there are some items that are definitely worth keeping. Certain items will have deep symbolic significance to you and your family, and are great things to preserve for years to come.


These items could include invitations to baby showers, congratulation cards, scraps of paper or napkins with scribbled down lists of possible baby names, and even the baby’s name card from the hospital bassinet after they are born.
As stated before, some pregnancy journals have spaces for these items and some do not. If your journal does not have space for physical items, the date and other information can still be written in the journal and a picture can be taken of the object. #*You can also have a keepsake box where you store all of the things that cannot be put in the journal.

, Add pictures of family members and create a family tree for your baby. Let family and friends leave messages for the baby. Put them in a special envelope and paste them in the journal.


This can be a great way for the baby to come into the world surrounded by loving, supporting people.

, Shoot video or record audio during your pregnancy to add a realistic element to your journal. Audio and video recordings can be a great way to transport yourself back in time, providing a set of detailed and personal images.


You can record them on CD or DVD and show them to the child when they grow up.
Record music you like to listen to, or music you ""play"" the baby while he or she is in your stomach. Put it in an envelope and stick in your diary.

, You spent all this time writing and logging the progress of your pregnancy, so don't forget to include the birth! The birth is the culmination of this process and often a life changing experience for a new mother. Include relevant details:


Where the child is born and when.
Under what circumstances did you feel your first contractions?
Who took you to the hospital?
How did you give birth, naturally or by cesarean section? With or without an epidural?
How long was the labor and what went through your head?
How did you feel when you first saw your child?

, Take pictures of the newborn and put them at the end of the pregnancy journal for a fulfilling endpoint. Saving all of these precious memories will be priceless when you look back at them later in life.


One day, you can show your child and remind yourself what he or she looked like.

Bond with your baby.,
Schedule regular pick-me-up moments.,
Keep a pregnancy diary.,
Educate yourself about having and caring for a baby.,
Identify what factors you can and cannot control.",How to Cope With Negative Feelings During Pregnancy1," It is possible to forge a deep connection with your baby before they are even born. Gently pat or rub your belly, making soothing sounds for your baby. Listen to classical music and watch to see if your belly moves in response. Study your ultrasound photos and imagine what your baby will look like. Try to feel connected instead of isolated from your growing baby.Talk or sing to your baby as you go about your day. Describe to them what you are seeing and your thoughts and feelings. You might say, “I just went to the store and looked at some toys to buy for you. I wonder what you’ll like.” And, If you feel lonely, this will provide some comfort for both of you.;
, Plan pampering activities that you enjoyed prior to being pregnant. Go see a movie, hit the mall, or get a prenatal massage. Make yourself the focus for a few hours at a time. This will also help to break the monotony that comes from a stream of never-ending baby related medical appointments.


If the idea of making yet another appointment is just too much, find activities that do not require pre-planning, such as wandering the bookstore.

, Write down your everyday thoughts and emotions in a journal for your eyes only. You may keep another journal that discusses the baby’s movements, etc., but this diary is intended to be an honest outlet for all of your feelings, be they positive or negative.Try to keep balance in your diary by keeping a one-to-one ratio of positive and negative observations. For example, if you write about your sore feet, balance that out with a line or two about how you’ve discovered that your hair is fuller than ever.

, Look online for pregnancy blogs, buy or borrow pregnancy and baby books, subscribe to related magazines, etc. You’ve been given a nine-month window to gather as much information as you can about this major change in your life. Knowledge is power and it will combat fear of the unknown, which can be real problem in pregnancy.


Doing your research will also show that you do not have to, and will not be, the exact same as your parents. No matter how you feel about how you were raised, you are experiencing pregnancy in a way that is unique solely to you.

, When faced with negative feelings, ask yourself if your feelings are focused on something that is actually within your control. If it is within your control, then try to figure out how to address the main problem. If it is not within your control, then you have to push it to the back of your mind and leave it alone.


This is an especially important process for women who are pregnant with complicated medical histories, such as suffering from miscarriages. Fear for the ultimate safety of your baby can be crippling if you do not address it. Focus on what you can do to improve your baby’s health, such as taking prenatal vitamins.Feelings of fear and anxiety when pregnant are not always a bad thing either. In fact, they help to activate a woman’s protective impulse toward her baby, leading to a good standard of care in the long term."

Go outside and get some fresh air.,
Eat a balanced and pregnancy-appropriate diet.,
Exercise and stay active.,
Get enough rest.,
Take quick action to resolve any pain that you are experiencing.,
Dress to flatter your changing body.",How to Cope With Negative Feelings During Pregnancy2," Find a park bench and sit on it for awhile. Lay a blanket on the grass and take a quick, sunny nap. Lounge on a tree-shaded chair. You may feel compelled to stay inside due to your nesting instinct, etc., but push yourself to head outdoors for at least 30 minutes every day.

, Make sure that you consume consistent meals and healthy snacks throughout the day. For example, eat at least four servings of veggies every day and between two to four servings of fruit as well. Try to include a protein, dairy, and grain product in every major meal as well. Limit your consumption of processed foods and sugars. Eating well will make you more able to cope with the physical and emotional challenges you’ll face during pregnancy.Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water will also help to alleviate pregnancy headaches, which will provide a boost to your spirits as well.
If you struggle to eat properly while pregnant, you may want to see a nutritionist. They can provide you with easy-to-follow meal plans and also give you positive support during and after your pregnancy.

, Do at least three 30-minute sessions of some sort of exercise each week. This could mean walking or even taking a prenatal yoga class. The point is not to prove that you can run a marathon, this is about you recognizing the strength and beauty of your body. Do activities that make you feel exhilarated, not exhausted.Watching how well your body continues to respond to exercise, even late in pregnancy, will also help to diminish some of the concerns that you might have about the birth process itself. Trusting your body is something that takes time to develop.
Make sure to consult with your doctor regarding your exercise patterns. You may need to avoid certain activities, such as horseback riding, or tailor other activities to accommodate the changing health needs of you and your baby.

, Aim to get at least eight solid hours of uninterrupted sleep a night. And, try to fit in at least one 30-minute nap each day, add additional and longer naps if you can. Getting enough rest is important because lack of sleep can increase negative emotions and aggravate other physical symptoms that you may be experiencing, such as nausea.


Exhaustion is the most common complaint made by women in the first trimester of pregnancy. Just know that your quality of sleep should improve as you head out of this initial period. The second trimester is generally a much more tranquil period., Pregnancy can be an uncomfortable time for many women, however, you should not suffer through pain needlessly. Listen to your body and seek out medical help if you feel as if something is “just not right.” Be persistent until you have the answers that you require.


Don’t be ashamed or feel weak about talking with someone about the pain that you are experiencing. Pain in pregnancy is often a sign of serious medical concerns. For example, it is normal to have some abdomen twinges during the first trimester, however, serious cramping could indicate a host of life-threatening conditions, including an ectopic pregnancy.
Be very careful about the pain medications that you use during pregnancy. Before you take anything, call your doctor or your doctor’s nurse to get the okay.

, Shop at maternity stores for the latest fashions, or browse re-sale shops for similar clothes at a substantial discount. Pick clothes out that flatter your changing shape and do not be afraid to wear clothes that are fitted. Spending a bit of time on your appearance will boost your self-confidence, leading to more positive emotions.


Don’t believe the stereotype that maternity clothes must be baggy and unflattering. Now you can purchase items that will make you look great at every stage of your pregnancy. You can still buy the type of clothes that you enjoy with a few modifications for comfort.

Join a support group.,
Enroll in pregnancy and childbirth classes.,
Strengthen your bond with your partner.",How to Cope With Negative Feelings During Pregnancy3," Your doctor may be able to suggest groups that meet via the hospital or you can search online for gatherings in your area. Look for groups composed of pregnant women who may be experiencing similar emotions as you. If you don’t feel comfortable meeting in person, you can always find online support and chat groups as well.


When you attend, listen actively but also jump in with questions and share your thoughts. Talking with others will show that your struggles with negative emotions are important, but not necessarily unusual.
To find support groups online, you might search for ""prenatal support"" ""pregnancy support group"" or ""prenatal depression discussion (or support) group."" The PANDAS Foundation of the UK offers both online and telephone support for pregnant women and new mothers. The BabyCenter community pages are another good option as well.
Prenatal depression is also called ""antenatal"" depression, so look for resources using that term as well.
Check out the Antenatal Depression Forum at Netmums., Your hospital or another health agency in your area will likely offer a wide variety of classes designed for new parents. These classes will teach you practical matters, such as how to change a diaper, which will make you feel even more competent moving forward. They also give you the chance to spend time with a group of people who are working through the stages of pregnancy., If you have a partner, spend time doing something that you both enjoy, such as going to a movie. This may help to counter any loneliness that you might feel. It also reinforces the fact that you should approach pregnancy as a team.


Ask your partner for help and tell them that you appreciate what they do. They will likely reciprocate in kind, leading to positive, open communication patterns. You might say, “Thank you for hanging those pictures in the nursery, they look really great.”
If you do not have a partner, you can find a great support network in other single mothers. Reach out to them via online networks and use your pregnancy to develop strong friendships.

Look for the symptoms of prenatal depression.,
Understand the role of hormones.,
Talk to your doctor or OBGYN.,
See a therapist.,
Take antidepressants in a safe way.,
Act quickly to protect both you and your baby.",How to Cope With Negative Feelings During Pregnancy4," If your negative feelings intensify and begin to alter your everyday choices and activities, you may have prenatal depression. Watch for drastic changes to your eating patterns (beyond what you might consider ‘standard’ pregnancy cravings or nausea). Poor memory retention, feelings of worthlessness, continual crying, lack of interest in previous hobbies, pulling away from family/friends, and feelings of deep sadness or anxiety are all possible signs of depression during pregnancy.If you have prenatal depression, know that you are not alone. Between 13-30% of pregnant women and new moms are diagnosed each year.Your prenatal depression is not caused by anything that you have done or have not done. And it offers no indication as to the type of parent you will be in the future. The key is to recognize the degree of your feelings and to take action.

, When you are pregnant there are real physical reasons behind some of your negative emotions. Almost immediately after you become pregnant your hormone levels begin to change, especially progesterone and estrogen. These hormonal fluctuations can also escalate your negative feelings into the category of prenatal depression.


Take some control back by watching for your emotional triggers and avoiding them. For example, if sad movies turn you in a sobbing mess, watch comedies instead. However, if you find yourself crying all the time for no reason, seek out professional assistance.
Your hormonal fluctuations will be the most aggressive in the first and third trimesters. The impact can be seen via spontaneous emotional highs and lows.If you suffered from PMS then you are more likely to experience negative feelings during pregnancy. If you’ve taken medications for mood disorders or for any hormonal causes (including birth control), you are also at a heightened risk for developing negative emotions and possibly prenatal depression., You should feel comfortable talking to your doctor about anything and everything related to your pregnancy. Tell your doctor, as specifically as possible, about your negative feelings and your concerns about prenatal depression. Ask for suggestions and advice that you can implement immediately.


This may be a difficult topic to discuss, but your doctor is a professional and has worked through these issues before with other patients. It is important to be as blunt and candid as you can be when describing your symptoms. For example, you might say, “I cry for an average of 6 hours every day.”
Don’t be shocked if they request a blood test. A blood draw can give a doctor a better picture regarding the levels of your hormones. For example, a thyroid imbalance can lead to intense negative feelings during pregnancy., If the negative feelings persist or if they escalate, you may want to consider making an appointment with a therapist. They will talk over your concerns with you, providing an outlet for some of your negative energy. They will also help to identify whether or not you are suffering from prenatal depression. With proper treatment, most people with prenatal depression see significant improvements in their life.Your therapy will likely consist of a combination of talk therapy (expressing your feelings in a safe space) and medication.
If you don’t think that you can afford a therapist, you may want to investigate what your health insurance will cover. You can also contact the therapist directly, discuss your financial concerns, and ask about other options, often including discounted rates or payment plans. If at all possible, don’t let money prevent you from getting the help that you may need for you and your child.

, Taking any medication during pregnancy is a matter of balancing out risk versus reward. If your doctor or therapist prescribes you antidepressant medication then they have weighed the various options and decided that this is the best course of action for you. Some antidepressants currently considered for use during pregnancy include Celexa, Prozac, and Zoloft, among others., One of the keys to treating depression while pregnant is to seek out help as soon as you become concerned. Untreated and unchecked depression poses a variety of risks to both you and your baby. If you stop taking the best care of yourself (using vitamins, eating right, sleeping well, etc.), then your baby can be born early or have a low weight or struggle with other potential health problems.Untreated depression is also a risk factor for you long-term as it can carry over into your postpartum period, making it even more difficult to cope with the challenges of being a new mother.

Understand that some cravings are the body’s way of indicating a deficiency in nutrients.,
Try to incorporate the nutrient into your diet in a healthier way.,
Remember everything in moderation.",How to Cope With Food Cravings During Pregnancy1," For example, while a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread may not be the healthiest sandwich choice, a craving for one may indicate a need for more protein in the diet, as peanut butter is high in protein. Try to recognize what nutrient your body may be lacking, before giving into your craving. Learn the important nutrients, such as protein, carbohydrates, iron, etc. so that you can isolate the healthy nutrients in the cravings you are experiencing.


Cravings for cheesy foods and milk products could be the body’s way of indicating there is a need for more calcium.
A sudden desire for a meal of chicken or beef may be an indication that the body is in need of more protein.;
, For instance, instead of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, make yourself a peanut butter, honey and banana smoothie.


If you are craving something salty, try reaching for a few salted nuts rather than reaching for that bag of potato chips.
Replacing your craving for a glazed fruit-filled pastry with some fresh fruit is a healthy option that still allows you to get the sugar you desire without consuming all those extra calories.
Perhaps that craving for ice-cream can be satisfied with a lower calorie helping of yogurt.
Try adding a little extra cheese on your turkey sandwich before ordering the cheesy fries you are craving.
This technique may not always eliminate your cravings for unhealthy foods, but chances are that at least some of the time, it will. There’s also a good chance that you’ll fill up more on the healthy foods, and have less room for indulgences.

, If you have a craving for something like cheesecake (or another sweet, for instance) that cannot be replaced by a healthier alternative, it is okay to have it once in a while.


A good rule of thumb is that having your treat of choice (for instance, that delicious piece of cheesecake) once a week is okay. What we are trying to avoid is having it in excess, such as every day.

Don't let food cravings get in the way of a well-balanced diet.,
Have healthy snacks available at all times.,
Be aware of your weight gain and the impact food cravings may have on this.In today's society, with rising rates of overweight and obese women, excessive weight gain during pregnancy can be a concern.,
Know which cravings are okay and which are dangerous.",How to Cope With Food Cravings During Pregnancy2," During pregnancy, obtaining the proper nutrients in your diet is key, not just for your own health but for the health of the growing baby inside of you. While indulging your food cravings in moderation from time to time is okay, don't let it come at the expense of an overall healthy diet.Healthy recommendations for pregnancy are (serving breakdown) a diet comprised of 20% protein, 30% fat, and 50% carbohydrates.To break it down based on the food pyramid, an example of a healthy diet during pregnancy would look as follows: 6-11 servings of grains, 3-5 servings of vegetables, 2-4 servings of fruit, 3-4 servings of dairy, and 2-3 servings of meats, beans, or nuts.Note that whole grains (and non-refined sources of carbohydrates) are a better choice, especially when it comes to keeping your blood sugars in a healthy range.

, This way, if you are having a craving, before you reach for a slice of cake or a piece of candy, you can see if you can satisfy your hunger with one of your pre-made healthier snacks.

, If weight gain is a concern for you, avoid cravings for desserts and high-fat foods (such as processed foods) or high-calorie foods (such as excessive carbohydrates).


On average, you need to consume only 300 more calories per day during pregnancy than you did prior to pregnancy.Although you are ""eating for two,"" the second is a very small baby so the calorie requirements during pregnancy are not much different than prior to pregnancy.
The average woman should gain between 20 to 35lbs during pregnancy.However, it depends on your weight prior to pregnancy, so speak to your doctor if you want specific recommendations for your own weight gain during pregnancy.

, Although most cravings during pregnancy are okay in moderation, some women actually get cravings for non-food items such as dirt, clay, or laundry starch, among others.This condition (of cravings for non-food items) is called ""pica.""


While incompletely understood, it is hypothesized that pica may be due to low iron or other nutrient deficiencies (shortages of vitamins or minerals) in the body.If you experience cravings for non-food items on any consistent basis, it is best to see your doctor for further advice.

Accept the changes by understanding why they happen.,
Appreciate the importance of developing a positive body image.,
Maintain a positive attitude.,
Celebrate your pregnant body.,
Ask for support.",How to Cope With Your Changing Body Image During Pregnancy," As soon as an egg is fertilized and implanted in your uterus, your body starts to function differently. It develops a fetal life support system, consisting of the placenta, umbilical cord and amniotic sac. One of the most important functions of the placenta is to produce hormones that support the pregnancy and ensure the baby stays healthy, and it is these hormones which kick-start the visible changes in your body.


One of the first changes you might notice is swollen breasts, as the hormones prepare them for lactation. Many women find they go up several bra sizes during pregnancy, an increase which is sustained after the birth if you choose to breastfeed.
Your metabolism also increases during these first few weeks, so you may find you have an urge to eat more, or a craving for a particular kind of food. At the same time, your blood flow increases, creating the famed ‘pregnancy glow.’
The uterus, where the fetus is slowly growing, will start to expand and the amniotic sac will fill with fluid, forming a protective cushion around the baby. Though many women will not start to ‘show’ until their second trimester – this is particularly true of those with well-defined abdominal muscles – the gradual expansion soon becomes obvious.
You might also experience swollen hands or feet, varicose veins, stretch marks and pigmentation or acne outbreaks.;
, Those with a negative attitude towards their body image are usually more prone to eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Long-term sufferers may find that they have problems conceiving, but even if they do, an eating disorder can affect the entire reproductive process and the health of the baby. According to womenshealth.gov, the following complications are associated with eating disorders during pregnancy:


Premature labor
Low birth weight
Stillbirth or fetal death
Intrauterine growth issues, possibly leading to disability

Likelihood of cesarean delivery
Delayed fetal growth
Respiratory problems
Gestational diabetes
Low amniotic fluid
Preeclampsia
It is important to ensure that any body image issues are dealt with before or during the early stages of pregnancy.

, There are a number of things you can do to ensure you handle your changing body image in the best possible way throughout your pregnancy.


Start out the right way. Being positive about your body image before pregnancy usually makes it easier to cope with the physical and emotional changes that are about to take place. If you know you suffer from low self-esteem because of your appearance, you might find it even harder to accept your newly pregnant shape. Unfortunately, the fact that your body goes through such major changes in such a short space of time makes it even harder to adjust. But finding ways to come to terms with your new figure will help you enjoy your pregnancy much more overall.
Focus on the purpose of the changes. Rather than worry about the fact that you’re losing your figure, think instead about the miracle of life that is taking place inside you. Remind yourself that your body is changing to help your baby grow and develop. It’s a natural process, and one that you are lucky enough to experience.
Read as much as you can. Educating yourself about the minute processes of pregnancy will help you understand and appreciate the wonder of new life. Consider investing in a book that tracks the development of the fetus inside you, or a calendar that details each new stage through the forty weeks of pregnancy. Educating yourself about your experiences will help you embrace them in a positive light.

Stay active. Most doctors recommend some form of light exercise during healthy, uncomplicated pregnancies, like going for regular walks. Swimming is also good exercise, and is often preferred by women in advanced stages of pregnancy because of the feeling of weightlessness produced by the water. Yoga is another popular option, for its low-intensity benefits.
Learn to be flexible. Women sometimes feel scared by the lack of control inherent in pregnancy. Sometimes this signifies ‘letting go’ after a lifetime of controlling your diet and weighing or measuring yourself. Exercising regularly can help to alleviate those feelings of helplessness, and allow you to still feel healthy and fit even while your baby grows.

, Feeling positive about yourself will be easier if you understand that this is a time to pamper your body, celebrate it, and enjoy it. Treat yourself to regular pedicures or massages. Taking up self-massage is also a good way to become familiar with your changing shape and be more accepting of it.


If you find yourself dressing to conceal your bump even after the first trimester, it could be a sign of trying to deny your new curves. Instead, feel proud of your pregnancy and don’t be afraid to show it off. The days of women hiding themselves away when expecting are long gone; today it’s acceptable, expected even, that you will celebrate the changes you are going through as you bring new life into the world. Invest in some well-fitting maternity clothes that accentuate your bump and enhanced cleavage and wear them with confidence. You’ll feel more comfortable and more positive about your new image.

, Having a good support network around you is essential during this time and immediately after the birth. Draw on your partner, family members and close friends, and be open about how you feel. Bottling up your fears or negative feelings will only make you feel worse. You might find that the encouragement and reassurance you receive from those around you is enough to make you feel better about the changes you are going through.


If you find that you are still feeling low and depressed after sharing your concerns with friends or family, it’s advisable to seek mental health counseling. Depression in pregnancy is not as common as post-partum depression, but does still occur in many women as a result of hormonal fluctuations. Getting professional help can make the difference between a very negative pregnancy experience and a much more balanced, positive one.

You’ll want to gather a few documents before you start, including:Last year’s tax documents and a paystub from this year. Most people who buy insurance through the Marketplace get subsidized coverage or Medicaid, and there are income requirements to qualify for either. These documents help you estimate your income. Any individual who makes less than 400% of the poverty level qualifies for a subsidy (about $47,000 for an individual), and anyone who makes less than 138% of the poverty level qualifies for Medicaid.

, Once you’ve completed your application, you’ll be able to browse the different types of plans available in your state. There are two basic ways in which the plans differ: the amount they cost and the variety of providers you can visit and still get coverage.


The cost of a plan is based on two factors—the size of the deductible and the amount of the premium. The premium is your monthly bill, and the deductible is the amount of money you must pay before your insurer starts to pay.
There are four levels of cost in the marketplace plans, bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. In a Bronze plan, your insurer pays 60% of the cost of treatment, while you pay 40%; the Silver plan pays 70% while you pay 30%, and so on with the Gold and Platinum plans.The size of the coverage network is indicated by the type of plan it is—EPO, HMO, POS, and PPO. An EPO, or Exclusive Provider Organization, only allows you to go to doctors within their network. An HMO, or Health Maintenance Organization, is less restrictive, but usually won’t pay for out of network care. A POS, or Point of Service plan, charges you less for in-network care and requires referrals to see specialists. Finally, PPOs, or Preferred Provider Organizations, are the most generous. While you may have to pay a little extra for out of network care under a PPO, you can go anywhere., Once you’ve chosen a plan you like, pay your first premium directly to your insurer, who should have contacted you after you enrolled in the marketplace. Once you’ve paid the premium, your coverage starts.


If you miss a payment, you have 90 days to make it up before the insurance company can cancel your plan. If your plan is terminated and you don’t have a special qualifying condition like pregnancy or loss of a job, you won’t be able to get another plan until the next year’s open enrollment., Once you’ve enrolled and paid your first premium, find a general practitioner you feel comfortable with and designate them as your primary care provider; they can direct you to a qualified OB-GYN.

You can go to healthcare.gov, where they will screen you and then refer you to your state’s Medicaid office, or you can go directly to your state’s Medicaid office and apply. Since the states set eligibility requirements for Medicaid themselves, they must make the final determination.In states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, everyone who makes 138% of the poverty level qualifies for Medicaid. States which haven’t expanded Medicaid are much more restrictive in who they cover, but low income pregnant women are covered everywhere—and don’t have to pay deductibles or copays for pregnancy related services.

, Your Medicaid application will ask you information about your gender, household size, income, and expenses for items like rent. While you will generally be asked to provide proof of income, you might be able to sign an affidavit affirming you lack of income; a person with no income isn’t getting a paystub, after all.


In some states, you’ll get a decision immediately. In other states, they may call to verify information, but pregnant women usually get quicker service. In any case, once you’re approved, you’re approved. You’ll get a card, but you’ll be covered before it arrives.

, Your state’s Medicaid office will have a listing of doctors who accept Medicaid, and some services, like ZocDoc.com, may have their own lists. The states’ list will be the most complete, however. Find a doctor who’s close to you and make an appointment.

Avoid making any sudden movements.,
Wear loose, comfortable clothes.,
Don’t overeat.,
Avoid any intense physical activity.,
Keep your legs elevated as much as possible.,
Drink a sufficient amount of fluids.,
Have a healthy, balanced diet.,
Eat some fiber rich foods.",How to Control Cramps During Pregnancy1," Try to avoid making sudden movements, particularly during the last two trimesters of your pregnancy. Keeping your movements slow will help you to avoid stretching the round ligaments of your uterus, minimizing the risk of cramps.For example, take your time getting out of bed.;
, Try to wear loose clothing rather than tight clothing. Tight clothes can compress your distended abdomen, which can cause your to start having cramps. Instead, wear light, loose clothing that will keep you comfortable and cramp-free.

, Be careful with your meals; too much food can cause abdominal cramps to kick in. Instead, try to eat small meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals. This will keep you from eating too much.


Try eating three small meals with one snack in between each meal. Try to eat roughly the same amount of food each time you eat.

, Too much physical activity can lead to contractions of the uterus or stretching of the round ligament, which in turn can cause cramps. If you do some physical activity and begin to feel cramps, stop immediately.


If you think your physical effort may be causing the cramps, call your gynecologist to discuss whether or not you should do any physical activity during your pregnancy.

, Your legs should be elevated frequently throughout the day to improve circulation. Whenever you sit down, try to elevate your legs to avoid leg cramps. When you are standing, remember to keep moving around so that blood doesn’t pool in your lower extremities.


When sleeping, two or three pillows should be placed under your legs to keep them elevated while you sleep.

, Cramping can also be caused by dehydration. Try to drink liquids throughout the day to avoid becoming dehydrated. You do not have to drink just water; you can try other liquids like sports drinks and coconut water. Sports drinks like Gatorade are packed with electrolytes that can help to control cramps.Avoid caffeinated and carbonated drinks because these contain diuretic properties which can make you dehydrated.

, Make sure that your diet is composed of food that is rich in calcium, magnesium, and potassium. These are all essential nutrients that are needed for optimal nerve and muscle functioning.Foods that are rich in calcium include milk, poultry, meat, and other dairy products like cheese and yogurt.
Magnesium rich foods often come from green and leafy vegetables like broccoli and spinach. Squash, beans, and fish are also good sources of magnesium.
Foods that are rich in potassium include bananas, salmon, avocados, and white mushrooms.

, Include in your diet more fiber-rich foods because these foods can help to regulate your digestive system and keep you from getting constipated. When you get constipated, you might experience abdominal cramps. Fiber-rich foods include:


Bran flakes, brown rice, spaghetti or vegetables like boiled broccoli, cooked sweet corn, raw carrots, Brussels sprouts, cooked artichoke and fruits such as raspberries, pears, apples, oranges, strawberries and raisins.

Sit down and rest for a moment.,
Stretch the affected area.,
Take pain medications that are safe for use during pregnancy.,
Apply a warm compress to the area with the cramps.",How to Control Cramps During Pregnancy2," First of all, you must stop whatever are you doing in that moment and sit down; after a few minutes of rest, the cramps should decrease in intensity or even disappear.


If the pain lasts longer or they are really intense, call your doctor and tell him or her about your symptoms because it might be a more serious problem.
Sometimes it helps to lean a little bit to the side that hurts; this way, you can relax the muscles in that area and reduce the pain you feel.

, To relieve a cramp in your leg, lie on your back momentarily and then extend the affected leg while keeping the knee straight. Try to position yourself so that the foot is bent backwards until the pain is gone.


Another means of stretching the legs is by riding a stationary bike for 30 minutes daily.
Brisk walking is also a way of improving circulation in the lower extremities.

, You might be tempted to use some medication for treating the pain; it is very important to know that many of the drugs used today, unfortunately, may have severe adverse or teratogenic effects (they can lead to congenital malformations or other abnormalities). Because of this, it is important to check with your doctor before using any over-the-counter medications.


Consider taking acetaminophen (the brand name is Tylenol) because it is considered a safe drug to take during pregnancy. The recommended dosage is 325 to 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours (unless stated otherwise by your physician).Another frequently used drug for pain relief is ibuprofen (Nurofen and other trademarks); this must be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the last trimester because it promotes premature closure of a fetal structure called ductus arteriosus (DA).

, You might try to reduce the pain by applying a warm compress to the area where you are experiencing cramps. However, be careful not to keep it against your skin for too long as it may cause nerve damage to your skin. Once you begin to feel relief, remove the warm compress.You can apply the warm compress to the area again if the cramps come back.
You can also consider taking a warm bath rather than using a warm compress. The heat will have a soothing effect on your muscles, which can help to calm cramps that you have.

Understand what constitutes a cramp.,
Learn about the main causes of cramps during pregnancy.,
Know when to call your doctor.",How to Control Cramps During Pregnancy3," Cramps are defined as acute pain for a short period of time; they might appear in both normal and pathological situations. They do not appear in all pregnancies but many of pregnant women experience them.

, Cramps that occur in pregnancy are often linked with:


Nutrient deficiency, specifically calcium, potassium and magnesium. These essential minerals help your muscles, bones, and nerves to function properly. If you do not have enough of these nutrients, your muscles may cramp up.
Prolonged standing. When you stand still for a long time, blood can pool in your lower extremities, causing cramps.
Dehydration can also cause cramps. Insufficient amounts of water in the body will result in muscle tightening and painful spasms in order to compensate for the amount of fluid loss.

, It is very important to keep in mind that any abdominal cramp during pregnancy must be discussed with your obstetrician or gynecologist , especially if it appears in the late stages of the pregnancy.


If you experience an acute, severe pain in your abdomen with possible extension to your groin area, accompanied by weakness, pale skin and a generally altered state you must immediately call the Emergency Services or go to the nearest Emergency Center because you might be having a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.
It is also important to seek immediate medical attention if the cramping is accompanied by any vaginal bleeding.

Clean your perineum often.,
Begin breastfeeding as soon as possible to increase your oxytocin levels.,
Avoid using scented soaps or douching.,
Do not ‘hold’ your urine—go to the bathroom frequently.,
Rest as much as possible to help your body recover.,
Stay hydrated.,
Wear loose, light underwear.",How to Control Discharge After Pregnancy1," The perineum is the area between your vagina and your anus. During childbirth, this area can suffer some injury, so it is important to make sure that it is clean and does not become infected. If it becomes infected, the infection may move up into your body and change the color of your discharge. Cleaning your perineum will also help to make passing your discharge as comfortable as possible. To clean:


Wash your perineum with unscented, gentle soap and warm water. Scented soaps can contain chemicals that can lead to infection. Use clean wipes, like baby wipes, to wash, rather than a washcloth (this is simply for cleaning purposes—if you don’t have baby wipes, you will just have to wash the washcloth after you use it).
Clean the labia first. Using separate wipes, wipe the area from least contaminated (pubis/vagina) to the most contaminated (anus). This is to prevent transmission of microorganisms from one area to the other.;
, If you plan on breastfeeding your child, start doing so as soon as possible. When you breastfeed your baby, your body is prompted to release oxytocin, a natural chemical that helps your uterus to contract fully.


Oxytocin is also used to control the intensity of your discharge. If you do not plan to breastfeed your child, you can get oxytocin supplements (this is covered in Step 1 of Method 4).

, As discussed in the step about cleaning your perineum, you should avoid scented soaps while you are still producing discharge. Scented soaps can contain chemicals that can alter the pH levels in your vagina, making you more susceptible to infection.The same goes for douching. It is best to avoid putting anything in your vagina, be it a douche or a tampon, while you are dealing with discharge. Putting anything foreign in your vagina can introduce bacteria that could lead to an infection.

, After you deliver your baby, your bladder becomes less sensitive for a period of time after childbirth. You might not notice that the bladder is full, which makes it harder for your bladder to contract. When you bladder is full, your uterus also has a harder time contracting, meaning that your discharge could be heavier than it should be.


To make sure that your bladder remains as empty as possible, go to the bathroom and urinate as frequently as you can.

, You have just given birth to a living, breathing human being—you should take some time to rest. Resting helps your body to recover and repair itself from the crazy thing it has just gone through. When you avoid overworking yourself, your uterus also has an easier time contracting, which will make your discharge lighter and easier to manage.

, Try to drink as much water as you need to stay hydrated; doctors generally recommend between 8 and 12 glasses a day. Water helps to flush out substances like discharge. Being hydrated also helps your body combat any infections that might be trying to take root in your body.


If you get tired of water, add some fruit juice to it to give it some flavor.

, When you wear tight underwear that does not let your skin breathe, you increase the chances that you will develop an infection. This is particularly true when you are dealing with discharge. Because of this, it is important to wear loose underwear that let’s your skin breathe.


Cotton is a good fabric to go with when looking for breathable underwear. The fabric is light and does not stick to your skin. It also absorbs sweat, which reduces the chances that you will develop a fungal infection.

This is especially true if you have complicating factors with your pregnancy, which may mean that you need to take special care.


Ask your doctor about cleaning products and cleaning techniques you should use. Your doctor may not know the answer to all of your questions off their top of their head; however, they should be able to do a little bit of research and get back to you with an educated answer.
Keep in mind that most studies that suggest a link to pregnancy complications and environmental factors are inconclusive. While it is good to be cautious and err on the side of safety, anxiety over minor exposure to cleaning products is going to cause you unnecessary stress. Just be smart and safe about cleaning and talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.;
, Most cleaners are perfectly safe for you to use during pregnancy so long as you use them properly. This means making sure you are cleaning in a well-ventilated area (windows and doors propped open to allow air flow), wearing rubber gloves, and never mixing products. There are, however, a few products that you should make a point to avoid.These include:Oven cleaning products: For one thing, the oven is poorly ventilated and you are bound to inhale fumes. For another, it can be difficult to physically get in the oven to clean it when you are pregnant.
Pesticides: If you have bugs in your house, do not use spray to kill them. Instead, use bait and traps. It you live on a farm that uses pesticides, speak with your doctor. It is still okay to use most insect repellant you spray on your body: DEET bug sprays in concentrations up to 20% are considered safe and can be used to avoid mosquito-borne illnesses like Zika.
Home dry cleaning products: It is very unlikely exposure to the chemicals in these products will cause any harm unless you work in a dry cleaning facility. Further, it is fine to have your clothes dry cleaned (though you may want to air them out first, as you may be sensitive to the smell of the products). If you want to use dry or spot cleaning products at home, just make sure the area is well-ventilated and you wear gloves and long sleeves.

, Cleaning products are chemicals and, unless you have a degree in chemistry, you may not be able to predict what the reaction may be. To be safe, just avoid mixing cleaning products together at all.


For example, never mix ammonia with bleach. This creates a chemical reaction that produces fumes that can be very dangerous and can kill you., It is important to note that there is no proof that being exposed to mold during pregnancy will endanger you or your child. It is unlikely that you would ever be exposed to enough mold to cause any problems with your pregnancy. If you have a mold allergy, or if there is mold in a room that is not very well-ventilated (such as in your shower), ask your partner to clean it using bleach diluted with water., As a general rule, you don’t want to try moving any heavy furniture when you are pregnant. Find someone else to do any heavy lifting that you need done.


This is not to say that you can't do anything while pregnant. It just means that you should avoid extreme physical exertion. If you have questions about the amount of physical activity you can do, discuss it with your physician.
A good rule of thumb is to avoid lifting anything heavier than 20 pounds.

, It's important to take it relatively easy when you are cleaning while pregnant. Don't over do it and over exert yourself. Having a sparkling clean home is not worth pain or exhaustion.


Give yourself permission to take as many breaks as you need to, which can be long or short.

, For example, always wear gloves when cleaning. Wear long-sleeves and maybe even an apron while you work to minimize exposure to your skin.

, While it is never great to deal with the strong smells of cleaners, the nausea associated with pregnancy can make even common cleaning smells overwhelming. To avoid this nausea, make sure the area you are working in is very well ventilated.


If you cannot work in a ventilated area, or if you are dealing with something toxic even in a ventilated area, you need to wear a respirator so that you do not inhale something toxic.

, The safest products you can use are those that contain only plant oils, such as Castile soaps, or other natural products, such as baking soda or vinegar. These products are often labeled as ""natural"" or ""environmentally friendly"" cleaning products, although you should always check the label to determine what exactly that means.Remember, however, that you should have no problem using most cleaning products that are not ""natural"" as long as you follow normal safety guidelines (like wearing gloves and keeping your windows open to allow air flow in the room).
Before using a cleaning product look on the label to make sure it contains only natural cleaning agents.

, You can find it either on the product's packaging or on the company’s website. If you can’t find this information, don’t use it.


For many products you can get a Material Safety Data Sheets, or MSDS sheets, that contains information on the potential health hazards of the product. Products are given a ranking on a scale from “0” (least hazardous) to “4” (most hazardous). Use only products with a “0” or a “1” rating. Find a product's MSDS online by searching for the product’s name and “MSDS”.
For example, the MSDS health ratings of bleach and Comet powder cleanser is 1. Heavy-duty oven cleaner, however, is rated at a 3., Mix ½ cup of water, ½ cup of vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. Then add 15 drops of tea tree oil. Mix well and pour out as needed.Use simple white vinegar. It’s cheaper than apple cider vinegar and cleans just as well.
You can also place this cleaner into a spray bottle and use (carefully) as a spray.
This can also be used to wash floors, unless they are ceramic or marble. Substitute a plant-oil soap for the vinegar for these floors.

, Pour ¼ cup of a plant-based oil soap into a bowl. Add ¾ cup of baking soda. Mix well. Then add ⅛ cup of white vinegar. Mix and use as a scrub. If you want. Add some lavender or citrus essential oil for scent (two to four drops).


Alternatively, you can mix 1 and ½ cup of baking soda and ½ cup of liquid soap. Mix. Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Mix and use to scrub away the stains., Sprinkle baking soda around the bowl as you would any other powder cleaner. Pour some white vinegar over the bowl brush and brush over the baking soda.Let that sit for 20 – 30 minutes.
Scrub again and flush.

, Mix 1 cup of olive oil and ½ cup of lemon juice in a bowl or a bottle. Stir or shake well before applying to furniture.


Wipe this furniture polish on with a soft, clean cloth.To make sure this polish is compatible with your furniture, try it first on a spot that is not visible, such as the bottom or inside of the piece.

, Mix equal amounts of white vinegar and water. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle and spray onto the glass or surface. Wipe with a soft cloth or paper towel.Depending on how often you clean your windows, you do not need to make much of this cleaner. A mixture of one cup of water and one cup of vinegar should last you quite awhile.

Avoid foods that commonly trigger heartburn.,
Eat smaller meals.,
Don't eat too close to bedtime.,
Avoid beverages that cause gastrointestinal distress.,
Sleep with your head or upper body slightly elevated.,
Avoid bending over at the waist.,
Wear loose clothing and avoid anything tight around your stomach.,
Chew gum after meals.,
Don't smoke.,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) antacid.,
Try OTC histamine-2 receptor antagonists.,
Use proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) instead.,
See your doctor if heartburn continues.",How to Cope With Heartburn During Pregnancy," Although there's nothing you can do about hormonal changes during pregnancy, you do have control over your diet. Avoid eating spicy, fatty and fried foods, which can cause acid reflux (heartburn).Cut back on processed snacks like chips and pretzels. Instead, eat whole-grain foods, fresh fruits and veggies, lean meats and low-fat dairy.


Chocolate, mustard, tomatoes (and sauces), onions, processed meats and citrus fruits can trigger heartburn in sensitive people.
Avoid seasoning your food with pepper, vinegar, ketchup, etc. In general, eat plain and natural during pregnancy.;
, Another strategy for coping with heartburn during pregnancy is to eat smaller, more frequent meals spread throughout the day.Eating large meals tends to overfill your stomach and increases the risk of digestive juices creeping up your esophagus, so stick to smaller portions. While pregnant, you don't want to go hungry and prevent your baby from getting essential nutrients, so eat every two to three hours.


In general, your portion shouldn't exceed the volume created when you cup both hands together.
You should also take your time eating and chew thoroughly in order to partially ""predigest"" your food. Chew your food for at least 20 seconds before swallowing.

, Eating close to bedtime promotes heartburn because lying flat makes it easier for stomach acid to escape into your esophagus and irritate it. As such, don't eat anything for between two to three hours prior to lying down in order to give yourself enough time to properly digest.In general, meat takes about twice as long to digest as fruits and most veggies.


If your bedtime is 10pm, then meats, fish and poultry should be eaten no later than 7pm. Salads, pastas and rice dishes can be eaten as late as 8pm or a little later.
If you're hungry as you head to bed, try drinking a little water or herbal tea to take the edge off your hunger.

, In addition to food, many beverages can trigger overproduction of acid in your stomach. Acidic drinks to avoid while pregnant include carbonated beverages (especially colas), alcohol beverages (especially red wine), hot chocolate, coffee and sweetened citrus juices (OJ, lemonade, etc.).Caffeine is a also a trigger for heartburn, so colas and coffee tend to be a ""double whammy"" as far as heartburn is concerned.
In addition to purified water, herbal tea, dairy milk and almond beverages are generally safe to drink if you're trying to cope with heartburn.
Don't drink large volumes of liquids during meals — you'll distend your stomach.

, Once you've given your body enough time to digest your dinner, you may still have to sleep with your upper body elevated to prevent the reflux of stomach acid into your esophagus.Sleep propped up in your bed with several pillows or a specially made foam wedge.


Plastic or wooden wedges are made to fit between your mattress and box spring to elevate your upper body. These are available online or at medical supply stores.
If you suffer from back pain during your pregnancy, don't forget to support your low back curve with a firm pillow.

, To help keep food and digestive acids in your stomach, it's best not to bend over an hour or two after meals/snacks. Bending over at the waist puts pressure on your stomach and can squeeze some acid out into your esophagus.Instead, use your knees to bend down to pick up things or ask for assistance.


You may also have to temporarily stop exercises that involve lots of bending over, such as yoga, aerobics or martial arts.
Keeping flexible during pregnancy is important, but avoid trying to touch your toes if you're experiencing heartburn flare ups.

, Finding the right clothes during pregnancy is difficult due to an expanding belly, but it's important not to wear shirts and pants too tight because they can push your growing baby into your stomach and trigger indigestion or heartburn.Instead, wear loose-fitting and comfortable clothing, especially during the last half of your pregnancy.


Consider wearing partially synthetic fabrics which have lots of stretch to them so your abdomen experiences less pressure.
Avoid belts and opt for elastic waistbands on pants and shorts.

, Another strategy for coping with chronic indigestion and heartburn during pregnancy is chewing gum after meals. Chewing gum stimulates the production of more saliva from glands, which can help to neutralize acid reflux in your esophagus when you swallow it.Compounds in saliva are much more alkaline than stomach acid, so it helps to neutralize it and stop the burning sensations.


Avoid peppermint or wintergreen-flavored gum because mint and menthol can trigger or aggravate heartburn symptoms.
Avoid gum sweetened with aspartame because it can bloat you and promote indigestion/heartburn. The sweetener xylitol is a better, safer choice.

, Most women know that cigarette smoking can harm developing babies, but most probably don't know that it also boosts stomach acid production. Smoking also decreases the esophageal sphincter's ability to open and close properly.Needless to say, stop smoking immediately if you're pregnant.


The lower esophageal sphincter is the valve between the tube that carries food (esophagus) and the stomach, where most of the digestion takes place.
Babies born to mothers who smoke are smaller in weight and tend to have many more health problems.

, When you're pregnant, you have to be especially careful what medications you take, although OTC antacids such as Tums or Axia3 are generally pretty safe. Some brands might contain aluminum or aspirin, or have lots of sodium, so clear it with your doctor before taking any just to be on the safe side.The calcium and/or magnesium in antacids are alkaline and neutralize stomach juices (hydrochloric acid) that splash up into the esophagus.
Too much sodium can increase blood pressure (hypertension) and lead to complications during pregnancy.

, Another helpful OTC heartburn medication that's generally safe to take during pregnancy is called histamine-2 receptor antagonists or H2RAs for short.H2RAs such as cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine are effective for reducing stomach acid and tend to provide longer relief, but they don't act as quickly as regular antacids.


Histamine-2-receptor antagonists are also called H2 blockers and are commonly used to treat stomach and duodenal ulcers.
H2 blockers actually reduce the production of stomach acid, which relieves heartburn symptoms and allows the esophagus to heal.

, Another type of OTC medicine helpful for heartburn are proton pump inhibitors, such as lansoprazole (Prevacid) and omeprazole (Prilosec), which also act by reducing the production of stomach acid.PPIs reduce the production of hydrochloric acid by blocking an enzyme in the wall of the stomach.


Short-term use of PPIs is well tolerated and safe for pregnant women, although long-term use can increase the risk of osteoporosis (brittle bones).
These are generally recommended only if H2 blockers don't work.

, If you can't seem to manage heartburn on your own, make an appointment with your family physician and discuss your options. Your doctor will give you an examination and possibly recommend prescription H2 blockers or PPIs, which are stronger.Signs that you should see your doctor include: frequent burning chest pain (more than twice per week), difficulty swallowing, persistent nausea or vomiting, difficulty eating, poor appetite and/or unwanted weight loss.Seek immediate medical help if you feel severe chest pain or pressure, especially it it's combined with arm pain, jaw pain and/or difficulty breathing — you may be having a heart attack instead of heartburn (though this is extremely rare during pregnancy).

Keep track of how much blood you are losing.,
Note the color and odor of the discharge.,
Know what infected discharge looks like.,
Keep track of what kind of pads you are using.,
Know the ‘normal’ amounts of discharge are and compare them to your own discharge.",How to Control Discharge After Pregnancy2," While it is normal to lose blood through your discharge, it is not normal to lose an excessive amount of it. Because of this, it is important to monitor your blood loss by looking at the the perineal pads your doctor will recommend that you wear. What to look for will be discussed in this section.You should use pads instead of tampons for a couple of reasons. The first is that pads will help you keep track of your blood loss much more easily than tampons will. The second is that tampons can introduce new bacteria into your vagina, making it more likely that you will get an infection.
Do not use scented pads because the chemicals that make them smell nice can increase your chances of infection.

, The color of your discharge will change as times passes after you have given birth. As discussed in the introduction, you should only really have to deal with discharge for six weeks after you give birth. There are three kinds of discharges (which are also called lochia) that should appear in the following order:



2 to 4 days after childbirth: Lochia Rubra is a bright red vaginal discharge with a fleshy smell. It is made up of blood, decidua, and other debris from the uterus.

4 to 10 days after childbirth: Lochia serosa appears to be brownish-pink because it consist old blood, leukocytes, and other tissue debris.

10 to 14 days after childbirth, lasting for 6 weeks: Lochia Alba is a creamy white vaginal discharge that consists of leukocytes, mucus, epithelial cells, and bacteria.

, We have just covered the normal stages of your discharge. If, at any point, your discharge becomes thick, yellow, and has a bad smell, it is an indication that you have an infection in your reproductive system. Go to the hospital right away so that you can get started on antibiotics.


The antibiotics used will be covered in Method Four.

, When monitoring your discharge after childbirth, it’s important to keep track of how long you can wear a pad before you have to change it (because this will give you an idea of how much you are bleeding). However, perineal pads vary in soaking time and appearance according to their brands.


It is a good idea to use the same pads every day so that you can get a better idea of how much discharge your body is creating each day. You should estimate the amount of blood you are losing each day (3 pads worth, etc.) and write down the amount.

, When looking at your pads, it may help to have a reference point from which to assess your own discharge. Scant, light, moderate, and heavy discharges are all normal. Excessive discharge means you need to get to the hospital immediately. These terms refer to the size of the discharge on your pad, and how long the pad took to be soaked. They are discussed below.Scant: Less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) on menstrual pad in 1 hour.
Light: Less than 10 cm (4 inches) on menstrual pad in 1 hour.
Moderate: Less than 15 cm (6 inches) on menstrual pad in 1 hour
Heavy: Saturated menstrual pad in 1 hour.
Excessive: Menstrual pad saturated in 15 minutes. Seek immediate medical help.

Understand that assessing the fundus is one of the most common ways to make sure that your uterus has contracted.,
Locate your fundus.,
Assess your fundus to figure out whether or not your uterus has contracted.,
Give yourself a fundal massage to help your uterus muscles to contract.",How to Control Discharge After Pregnancy3," One of the leading causes of excessive of bleeding is the failure of the uterus muscles to contract. Assessing the fundus is one way to detect if the uterus is contracting properly or not.


You can do this home (as described in the following steps) and should report any problems to your doctor if you notice them.

, First of all, go to the bathroom and get rid of all of your urine. A full bladder can change the position of your fundus, so get it all out before you try to locate your fundus. Your fundus is the top area of your uterus, and can be felt by pressing down on your navel or umbilicus. Your fundus should decrease in size each day after childbirth.Keep in mind that ‘palpate’ and ‘press on’ mean the same thing. If you talk to your doctor about this process, he or she may use the word palpate or palpitation. Keep in mind that they mean pressing down with your fingers on some part of your body.

, A normal fundus is firm and can be palpated on the midline. A ‘boggy’ uterus many indicate that your uterus has not fully contracted yet after childbirth. If you press on your uterus, you may find that if feels soft or soggy, rather than firm. This must be fixed right away (how to help your uterus contract is covered in the next step)., When your uterus have not contracted fully, you run the risk of losing a lot of blood through your discharge. Because of this, you need to help your uterus to contract, or seek medical help. To perform a fundal massage, gently press down on the fundus and give in a massage. You may feel it begin to firm up under your hands. This is your uterus contracting.


If you are still in the hospital, a nurse will do this for you. If you are at home and are concerned about doing this yourself, go to a hospital right away.

Get a prescription for oxytocin to balance out your hormone levels.,
Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for metronidazole if you have an infection in your reproductive system.,
Know the symptoms of Hypovolemic shock and that you should seek immediate medical help if you are experiencing them.,
Know that surgery will be considered if you suffer from a postpartum hemorrhage.,
Consider a hysterectomy as the very last option if the bleeding continues and puts you in danger.",How to Control Discharge After Pregnancy4," Oxytocin is a hormone that helps your uterus contract. When your uterus contracts, your blood vessels will close up and keep your discharge at a normal level. If you have low levels of oxytocin, your doctor may prescribe supplements for you to take to help keep you healthy., If you develop a vaginal infection after you give birth, doctor will most commonly prescribe an antibiotic called metronidazole. The common dosage is 200 mg taken three times a day for five to seven days.You should also talk to your doctor about discontinuing other antibiotics and over-the-counter medications. This is because these medications can interfere with the normal microbes found in your body. When the balance of microbes in your body is changed, you risk the chance of developing an infection.

, Hypovolemic shock occurs when you lose a massive amount of blood (about one-fifth of your total blood). If you experience this, or your partner is experiencing this, you should get to the hospital immediately. Symptoms of hypovolemic shock include:


The menstrual pad saturated in 15 minutes.
Fainting or lightheadedness.
Anxiety.
Skin turns to ashen or grayish.
Skin is cool and clammy.
The pulse has Increased rapidly.
Rapid breathing.

, A postpartum hemorrhage occurs when tissue is left behind in your uterus after you have delivered your child. This can cause heavy bleeding starting in the first 24 hours to 3 weeks after delivery.If you have this, you will most likely have a surgical procedure done that is call dilatation and curettage. During this procedure, the extra tissue will be removed.

, If every other option to contract your uterus has failed and you are losing too much blood, a hysterectomy may be considered. During this procedure, your uterus will be removed to stop the bleeding. This is only considered as the very last option.

When choosing a guided meditation, be sure to choose a video or recording with a voice and pace that you enjoy. It’s best to choose a video earlier in the day and save it for use later.;
, One particularly effective meditation technique involves practicing mindfulness. To do so, simply focus your attention entirely on one thing, such as your breath. For instance, think about how it feels as air enters and exits your body. It may also help to repeat the same thought with each breath. For instance, simply think the word “relax” each time your exhale.Mindfulness has consistently been proven to help increase both the quality and the duration of people’s sleep, and to decrease the number of disturbances people experience while sleeping. In fact, mindfulness has been proven equally as effective as some medications in treating sleep-related conditions.When thoughts arise that momentarily distract you, simply push them away.

Finally, after another deep inhalation, flex the muscles of your face. You will likely have to make a funny face to do so.
On the final inhalation of a complete cycle, tense all of the muscles in your body. After holding the tension for a count of four, release this tension as you slowly exhale.
Repeat the entire process three times through.

Second, maintain a slow and steady breathing rate.More specifically, start by closing your eyes and focusing your attention on your breath. Place one hand on your lower belly, and the other on your upper chest.
Inhale through your nose for five seconds, trying to bring your breath as deep into your body as possible. Your goal is making the hand on your belly rise, while the hand on your chest only moves a bit. While this may be challenging, you can quickly improve your ability to do so with practice.
After inhaling, hold your breath for five seconds, and exhale for five seconds. Repeat this breathing practice for five minutes.
Even better, do this breathing practice lying in bed as you wait to fall asleep. Not only will it help you do so, it will help your body and mind calm down as they drift off the sleep.
Find a free video online to help guide you through a few deep breathing exercises if you’re just learning. Many include visual reminders to help you keep a steady pace, for instance.

Sleep more.,
Repay your sleep debt.,
Visit your doctor.,
Improve your sleep hygiene.,
Keep a sleep diary.",How to Treat Sleep Deprivation1," The best and most obvious way to treat sleep deprivation is to get more sleep. Since sleep deprivation occurs if you don’t sleep enough, increasing your amount of sleep can get rid of the symptoms. Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep each night, so try to get an amount of sleep within that window each night.If the sleep deprivation is caused by an isolated incident, like one all-nighter, one good night’s sleep can help you recover.
If you are suffering from sleep deprivation due to lack of sleep over an extended time, you can sleep longer each night or take 20-minute naps throughout the day.;
, When you don’t get the sleep that you need each night, you end up with a sleep debt. Sleep debt is the amount of sleep you missed out on — so, if you only slept five hours when you should have slept eight, that's three hours of sleep debt. If you do this twice a week, you have a six hour sleep debt. Sleep deprivation can be treated by repaying your sleep debt by catching up on that much sleep.You should sleep the amount of hours you owe your body to help avoid and treat sleep deprivation. This might take days, weeks, or even longer.
There is disagreement on whether or not sleep debt can truly be repaid; however, one study found that a 20-minute nap could make up for one hour of missed sleep.The best course of action is usually to make changes to your sleep schedule so that you ensure you get adequate sleep going forward.You may end up with severe sleep debt from hundreds of hours of missed sleep, resulting in serious and irreversible health problems.

, If you are suffering sleep deprivation, you should go see your doctor. The sleep deprivation may be caused by an underlying condition, such as insomnia, depression, or sleep apnea. Your doctor may be able to diagnose the condition or refer you to a sleep clinic.Your doctor will ask you various questions about your sleeping habits to try to figure out the underlying condition.
The doctor may prescribe a sleeping pill to temporarily help you sleep better. Sleeping pills, prescribed or over-the-counter, should be a temporary fix. Sleeping pills can lead to worse sleep problems if used for a long time. Using sleeping pills daily can lead to dependence.
If you think you may be dependent on sleeping pills, do not stop abruptly. Gradually wean yourself off the pills over a period of days or weeks with the help of your physician. Be aware of side effects such as headaches and nausea., To get a better night’s sleep, you should improve your sleep hygiene, including adopting a consistent sleep routine. Start by going to sleep and getting up at the same time every night, even on weekends. Prioritize sleep by making sure you have seven to nine hours each night.Make sure your sleep environment is appropriate for sleep. The room should be dark, quiet, and cool. If you need some kind of noise to help you fall asleep, try a fan or white noise machine.
Don’t use electronics — including smartphones, tablets, laptops, televisions — at least a half hour before going to bed.
Start winding down for sleep 10 minutes to an hour before bedtime. It might help to have a nightly routine that includes relaxing activities, like a warm bath, laying out your clothes for the next day, or writing in a journal.

, To help figure out why or what is leading to the sleep deprivation, you can keep a sleep diary. A sleep diary can help you find reasons why you are losing sleep or habits that are causing you to have less sleep that you need. Make sure to keep your diary every day for a couple of weeks.Include information about your sleeping habits, such as when you lay down to sleep and finally fall asleep. Include when you wake up, how many hours you actually slept, how many times you woke up during the night, and how restful the sleep was.
Make a note of what you did if you couldn’t fall asleep, such as laying there, watching television, or got up for a few minutes.
List the food you ate and beverages consumed and when, especially those with caffeine.
Note your mood or stress level that day.
A sleep diary can be extremely helpful if you end up seeing a physician to discuss your sleep issues. It will be a great reference point for them.

Meanwhile, reduce your alcohol consumption, as drinking is another common cause of sleep tremors.

, Another likely type of twitching you may be experiencing is actually a condition called sleep myoclonus. These types of twitches can appear repeatedly or singularly.

Though these types of twitches are very common, it’s important to mention them to your doctor.Since the timing of your twitches matter, get in the habit of writing down the time whenever a twitch prevents you from falling asleep or wakes you up. Share this information with your doctor.
Twitching of this sort may indicate restless legs syndrome or other sleep issues that can prevent you from getting quality rest.

, You may also be experiencing convulsions. If involuntary spasms afflict one or two limbs in particular and last for a minute or two, it is likely a convulsion.

, Dystonia is a movement disorder in which your muscles contract uncontrollably. It requires medical treatment to control. Some early symptoms to watch for include:Speech problems
Uncontrollable blinking
Pulling sensation in your neck
Foot cramps
Dragging your leg

This occurs when your muscles have muscle spasms, reacting and twitching in an attempt to keep up with your dreams.If you find yourself waking in the middle of night, or a partner tells you you’ve been twitching heavily at night, talk to your doctor about REM behavior disorder.

Become active.,
Turn on a bright light.,
Sit up straighter.,
Increase your caffeine.",How to Treat Sleep Deprivation2," Being active can help you treat mild sleep deprivation. If you engage in a short activity a few times a day, it can help increase alertness. The feeling of being alert may fade fast, so you may have to be active again. If your sleep deprivation is severe, you may feel more tired instead of feeling energized.Try light activity, like a quick walk or other light cardio. Choose an activity that will get your blood pumping, not tire you out.

, Being exposed to light can help you feel more awake. Light causes your body to reduce its production of melatonin, which is the hormone that makes you feel sleepy. Light helps your body's circadian rhythm align with the day-cycle, when we feel awake and alert. Try turning on an overhead light, opening the windows, turning on multiple lights in a room, using a light box, or even going outside into the sunshine.Even if it is the middle of the day, increasing the brightness in your room or office may help you feel more alert and less sleepy.

, Adopting good posture may help you stay up when you have sleep deprivation. When you stand or sit up, it helps engage body functions that help you stay alert. If you are suffering from sleep deprivation, try sitting with as good posture as possible.If you can, stand to help stay awake.

, Caffeine is a common short-term treatment for sleep deprivation. Caffeine is a stimulant that helps increase alertness. You can drink caffeine in coffee, tea, or soda, and it can be found in some foods, like chocolate. Small amounts of caffeine throughout the day works best to help keep you awake and alert.Be aware that caffeine can cause side effects, such as headaches or shaking if you consume too much. Caffeine is not recommend for children and women who are nursing or pregnant.
Caffeine cannot help with severe sleep deprivation. Avoid caffeine at least four to five hours before bedtime.

You may feel groggy in the morning or throughout the day.You may find yourself dozing off at random times, especially during meetings, while watching television, or even when driving.

, Another symptom of sleep deprivation is a lack of mental alertness. This means you may have trouble concentrating, you may not think as clearly, your memory may be weaker than usual, or you may have decreased reaction time.Many accidents occur due to lack of mental alertness due to sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation can cause all of your thought processes to work slower and not as efficiently as when you are fully rested.

, Sleep deprivation can lead to a lowered immune system. This can cause you to get sick more often because your body is unable to fight off bacteria, viruses, and other diseases. Sleep deprivation can also cause you to get better more slowly that if you were rested.If you have been getting sick often, or if you are unable to kick a cold or other condition, you may be sleep deprived.

Get regular exercise.,
Take an early morning walk.,
Stay active throughout the day.,
Avoid driving your car if you are feeling drowsy or stressed.,
Limit your stress.,
Inform others about your narcolepsy.,
Practice tai chi.,
Quit smoking.",How to Treat Narcolepsy Naturally1," Exercise can help boost your energy levels and help you avoid stress that leads to drowsiness. Getting regular, moderate exercise, especially in the afternoon, can also help you get a better night’s sleep. A daily 30 to 45 minute workout with moderate intensity exercises such as brisk walking, jogging, and swimming, or 15 minutes of high-intensity exercises such as soccer, basketball, and strength training is recommended. Talk to your doctor or fitness instructor to help you come up with a fitness plan that can help manage your narcolepsy.


If you have cataplexy — a medical condition in which strong emotion or laughter causes a person to suffer sudden physical collapse though remaining conscious — or are worried about falling asleep during exercise, consider getting a personal fitness instructor or ask a friend to assist you when you workout.
Avoid exercise three to four hours before going to bed because it can keep you from getting enough sleep.;
, Sunlight helps tell your brain when it’s time to wake up and improves mental alertness. Going out for an early morning walk can make you more alert and also helps you get more vitamin D. Getting enough vitamin D each day can help to boost your energy levels. A fair-skinned person may need only about 45 minutes of sunlight a week to get enough vitamin D, while a person with dark skin may need up to three hours.


If you are at home, spend time outside each day doing things like walking your dog, gardening, or exercising. If you work from home, you could even go sit out on your front porch or lawn while you work to get much needed vitamin D. If you work in an office, talk to your boss about sitting near the window and opening the blinds to let light in.
Low to moderate intensity walking for 20 to 30 minutes can also help reduce your risk of heart and respiratory diseases while helping you manage any excess body weight that can also cause fatigue., Light exercises during the day can help to give you a boost of energy that may help to keep the sleep attacks at bay. Taking a five minute break after every 20 minutes to walk around can help ward off fatigue. Other simple exercises such as jumping or stretching are also effective.


Also try reading while standing up when you are at school or work. This may help you fight off sleep attacks by keeping your mind engaged., One of the most dangerous aspects of narcolepsy is having a sleep attack while you are driving. You may find that you are more likely to have a sleep attack when you are stressed, rushed, or feeling sad or angry. If this is the case, avoid driving if you experience any of these feelings. If you sense an oncoming sleep attack while driving, pull up to the side of the road to take a break.


Try to avoid getting stressed out about things like traffic, construction, being unable to find a parking spot, getting angry with other drivers, and road rage. Stress can lead to a sleep attack, which could be deadly when you are behind the wheel., Excessive stress can lead to anxiety, lack of sleep, and daytime drowsiness. As people age, achieving a relaxation response after a stressful event becomes more difficult. To avoid stress, practice meditation exercises like yoga and tai chi, make time for recreation, and be sure to get enough rest.


Other simpler ways to reduce stress are slow, deep breathing in a quiet environment, focusing on positive outcomes, restructuring priorities and eliminating unnecessary tasks, and listening to relaxing music.
You can also use humor throughout the day to relieve stress. Research has found humor to be an effective way to deal with acute stress., Talking about narcolepsy to teachers, professors, or employers can be a difficult decision. However, without disclosure and some understanding of narcolepsy, teachers or employers may misinterpret sleepiness as disinterest or poor motivation. As most people are unfamiliar with narcolepsy, be prepared to give a brief explanation of the disorder and any symptoms that may arise at school or work.


Consider getting a letter from your sleep specialist. This can be a helpful way to document your diagnosis and further explain your symptoms., Tai chi is a gentle exercise program derived from the martial arts, consisting of slow, deliberate movements, meditation, and deep breathing. People who practice tai chi on a regular basis are more mentally alert, tend to have good posture and flexibility, and sleep more soundly at night. Tai chi can also help enhance physical health and your emotional well being. Tai chi should be practiced for 15 to 20 minutes twice daily at home, and is safe for everyone regardless of age or athletic ability.


Tai chi is usually taught by an instructor with weekly sessions that can last for an hour. The main components of tai chi are slow, gentle movements that involve using all the major muscle groups and joints. Meditation is also a part of tai chi, an activity which soothes the mind, enhances concentration, reduces anxiety, and lowers blood pressure and heart rate. It also incorporates deep breathing, which involves exhaling stale air and toxins from the lungs while inhaling fresh air to increase lung capacity, stretch the muscles involved in breathing, and release tension.
Tai chi improves balance, agility, strength, flexibility, stamina, muscle tone, and coordination. This exercise also strengthens bones and can slow bone loss to help prevent the development of osteoporosis. It also enhances blood circulation to the brain, which boosts mental alertness. At the same time, the practice supplies the entire body with fresh oxygen and nutrients., Tobacco products such as cigarettes and cigars contain nicotine, which can stimulate your nervous system, causing disturbance in sleeping patterns, sleep apnea, daytime drowsiness, and sleep attacks during the day. Studies show that smokers also take longer to fall asleep and often have difficulty getting a good night’s rest.


Talk to your doctor about ways to quit smoking, such as patches, pills, support groups, shots, and prescription medication."

Find the cause or source of your insomnia.,
Establish a nightly routine.,
Make sure your bedroom is comfortable before going to sleep.,
Keep your bedroom as your bedroom and nothing else.",How to Treat Insomnia1," Try to find what is preventing you from falling asleep and, if possible, eliminate it. You may need to fix other problems and issues first in order to treat your insomnia. For example:


If anxiety or depression are keeping you awake at night, find what is making you feel anxious or depressed and try to manage that. This might involve speaking with your doctor and taking medication for anxiety or depression.
Your roommate might like to read or work late into the night, and the light he or she uses is keeping you awake. If your roommate is unable or refuses to work in another room, purchase a sleeping mask instead.;
, Try to perform the same activities every night before your bedtime. This means going to bed at the same time every evening and wake up at the same time every morning. You can also incorporate some relaxing activities into your bedtime routine, such as reading or listening to soft music.In this way, your mind will start associating such activities with bedtime and sleep.

, This means that the temperature is to your liking, and that the lighting is dark enough for you to fall asleep.


If your room is too warm, try to cool it down by opening a window, using fewer blankets, or turning a fan or air conditioning.
If your room is too cold, try to wear warmer clothing to sleep or using more blankets.
If you live in an area that is very bright at night, even if you turn off the lights, invest in a sleeping mask that covers your eyes.

, Use your bedroom only for sleeping and rest. This might involve removing distractions, such as computers and televisions, to ensure that you do not use them instead of sleeping. It might also mean that you have to complete your homework (or other work) in another room.


If you live in a studio apartment where everything is in a single room, or if it is not possible to work elsewhere, then do all of your work at your desk, in a library, or some other location. Do not work in your bed, as your subconscious will begin to associate your bed with working instead of sleeping.

Try to get a full night's sleep.,
Create a sleep schedule for yourself.,
Dim the lights and make your room dark and cozy.,
Avoid electronic gadgets before bed.,
Do not use your bed for other activities.,
Try relaxing once you get into bed.,
Sleep on your side.,
Stop hitting the snooze button.,
Arrange nap times.,
Manage sleepiness at work.",How to Treat Narcolepsy Naturally2," Getting a full night's sleep every night keeps you from feeling drowsy and being susceptible to sleep attacks. If you wake up during the night, try to fall back to sleep rather than getting up. If necessary, adjust your sleeping environment to make it easier for you to fall asleep. The amount of sleep you need each night depends on your age, lifestyle, and a variety of other factors. In general, school-aged children need nine to eleven hours of sleep, while adults over the age of 18 generally need seven or eight hours of sleep.


Avoid alcohol and sugary foods four to six hours before heading to bed. These can act as a stimulant to keep you awake., Set fixed times for when you wake up and when you go to bed at night. Try to stick to these times as closely as possible in order to help get your body into a regular sleep pattern. You do not have to go to bed early, but try to make it as regular as possible. By doing this, you may be able to train your body and brain to stick to your sleeping schedule so you do not fall asleep when you are supposed to be awake.


For example, plan to get up at 7:00 AM every morning, and go to bed at 11:30 PM every night. You can also go to bed at 1:00 AM and get up at 9:00 AM. Stick to those times every day of the week to help get your body acclimated to being awake at certain times and asleep at other times., Try to create an environment that will help you to fall asleep. Reduce the amount of light and noise that comes into your room as much as possible. Close your curtains or blinds to make your room dark. You can also wear an eye mask to block out light. Keep the temperature comfortably cool, which typically between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The room should also be well ventilated so it doesn't get stuffy.


When you are in a dark environment, your brain begins to produce melatonin, which is the hormone that regulates sleep., The backlight emitted from electronic devices can reduce the amount of melatonin that your brain secretes. Melatonin is the chemical that your brain produces to help you sleep. In turn, this lack of melatonin can make it difficult for your to fall asleep. Avoid gadgets such as cell phones, smart phones, televisions, and computers at least two hours before bed. , If you typically sit on your bed to do all kinds of activities, change your habits. When you use your bed for activities besides sleeping or sexual activity, your brain may begin to view your bed as a place for being awake, rather than for being asleep. When this happens, you may find that you have a harder time going to sleep and waking up at your scheduled times.


Do not work, eat, or watch TV in your bed if you can avoid it., If you have trouble falling asleep, relaxation techniques can help relieve physical and psychological stress. Physically and psychologically stressful activities can cause the body to secrete the stress hormone cortisol, which is associated with increasing alertness. Once you have found the things that help you relax, make them into a bedtime ritual.


To help yourself relax before bed, try reading a book, listening to calm music, or practicing breathing exercises. If you lie in bed for more than 20 minutes without falling asleep, go to a different part of your house or apartment without bright lights. Do something relaxing for a while until you begin to feel tired, then come back to bed and try to sleep again., If you suffer at night from any problems that limit your breathing, you may need to change the way you sleep. Sleeping on your side, especially if you have gastric reflux, sleep apnea, or even a mild cold, can help you breathe more comfortably. This leads to a better night’s sleep. Try propping your head on a pillow that supports the natural curve of your neck and back to improve airflow if you continue to have trouble breathing.


Avoid sleeping on your stomach because this can obstruct breathing, promote acid reflux, and cause unnecessary stress on your body., When your alarm goes off in the morning, try your hardest to get out of bed without hitting the snooze button. Even dozing for a few more minutes can throw off your sleep schedule and make you drowsier than if you had gotten out of bed with the first beep., Taking two to three naps throughout the day can improve daytime drowsiness. Make sure you schedule your naps around the time that you feel the sleepiest, or half an hour after meals. Taking a nap can help to refresh you and increase your alertness. Each of these naps should last for 15 to 20 minutes.


Avoid napping for more than an hour and in the evenings. This can mess up your sleep patterns and make it difficult to sleep at night time., With this condition, you may experience sleepiness at work, especially if you work in a low activity desk job. Think about accommodations that will help you do your job better, such as scheduled nap times during work hours or flexible start and end times for the workday. Consider discussing them with your employer to help work around your condition.


Keeping your office cool and well-lit can also help you stay awake. Try focusing on less exciting tasks at times when you are most alert."

, Rather than having three large meals, you can boost your alertness and body’s energy by having small meals throughout the day. Your brain needs a steady supply of nutrients to stay energized throughout the day. Large meals can also increase the production of tryptophan in your body, an essential amino acid that induces sleep. Studies show that eating smaller meals, especially during the afternoon, helps regulate blood sugar, which prevents you from feeling fatigued after eating.


Try to eat four or five small meals a day, consisting mostly of fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts to help boost your metabolism and prevent daytime drowsiness., Protein helps boost energy levels because it is required for many of the body’s metabolic processes. Eating a high-protein breakfast or lunch may help you to stay energized throughout the day. Avoid processed meats, red meat, and margarine because these can raise your cholesterol levels, slow down metabolism, and cause drowsiness.


Eat more healthy foods that are rich in protein, such as eggs, quail, chicken, turkey, salmon, tuna, trout, sardines, tofu, beans, pulses, natural cheese, and Greek yogurt., Eating a lot of carbohydrates make tryptophan more available to the brain, which can leave you feeling drowsy. However, this does not mean you should cut carbs out of your diet entirely. Try not to eat a large amount of carbs in the morning or middle of the day, and instead take a quick bedtime snack such as crackers, cereal with milk, or peanut butter on toast.

Studies show that candy bars and sports energy bars should especially be avoided because they are ineffective for providing sustained energy throughout the day and can contribute to obesity.


Check the amount of sugar on the label of foods and beverages before buying them. Make sure that sugar content doesn’t exceed 50 grams for one serving.
Another way to avoid sugar is by choosing fresh, non-concentrated juices and smoothies., Water is the main component of blood and is essential for carrying nutrients to the cells and taking away waste products.

Non-caffeinated, glucose-free sports drinks with electrolytes can help you stay hydrated as well.


To maintain your energy level while you exercise, drink an eight ounce glass of water before you start and another after you finish. If you’ll be exercising continuously for longer than 30 minutes, drink small amounts every 15 to 30 minutes.
The average adult should have around two liters of water every day. If you drink caffeinated beverages, increase your water intake to 1 liter of water for every cup of caffeine you have., Caffeinated beverages such as coffee and tea can be helpful for staying awake when you have narcolepsy. However, in combination with certain stimulant medications, it can cause jitteriness, diarrhea, anxiety, or a racing heart. In general, try limit your caffeine intake to two cups of tea or one cup of coffee before late afternoon.


If coffee is part of your daily routine, it is best to avoid drinking it after 4 p.m. Having caffeine that late in the day can make it harder to get enough sleep at night., It is widely believed that drinking alcoholic beverages before bedtime can help you get better sleep. While it may help you relax for a while, it can disrupt your sleeping pattern over the course of the night. It also keeps you from getting a proper night’s sleep, which causes daytime drowsiness. Try to reduce or quit drinking alcohol to prevent sleep attacks and narcolepsy.


The recommended daily intake for most people is two cups of alcohol for men and one cup for women.

See if you are at risk.,
Recognize the symptoms.,
Keep a sleep diary.,
Visit your doctor.,
Get a polysomnogram.,
Get a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).,
Ask your doctor about sleep apnea.,
Talk to your doctor about medication.",How to Treat Narcolepsy Naturally5," Narcolepsy may be caused by low levels of hypocretin, a chemical in the brain that helps promote wakefulness. Experts believe that certain factors may work together to cause hypocretin deficiency, such as heredity, brain injuries, autoimmune disorders, and low levels of histamine, as well as certain environmental toxins. Heredity alone doesn’t cause narcolepsy.


Other sleep disorders related to narcolepsy, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, hypersomnia, insomnia, sleep paralysis, and sleep apnea can put you at an increased risk of narcolepsy.
If you think you have narcolepsy, talk to your doctor for a proper medical diagnosis and possible treatment plans as soon as possible., Since narcolepsy is fairly rare, it can take 10 to 15 years after the first symptoms appear to be properly diagnosed. Some people with narcolepsy have episodes in which they fall asleep suddenly, experience loss of muscle movement, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Extreme daytime sleepiness is the most obvious symptom of narcolepsy, characterized by mental cloudiness, memory problems, lack of energy, and depression. Sleep episodes may occur during all kinds of activities, such as talking, eating, reading, watching TV, or sitting in a meeting. Each episode can last for 30 minutes or less.


A sleep disorder called hypersomnia can occur along with narcolepsy, characterized by recurrent episodes of daytime sleepiness. Strong emotions such as anger, fear, laughter, or excitement can also trigger sleepiness.
Cataplexy is another symptom of narcolepsy which is often induced by emotional or other stressful stimuli. During a cataleptic episode you lose muscle tone when you’re awake, making it harder to move your head or speak. Some people may also lose all muscle control, causing them to drop things or fall. Episodes often last a few seconds or minutes, and often occur weeks to years after first experiencing extreme daytime sleepiness. The person remains conscious during these episodes.
Hallucinations can occur when falling asleep, waking up, or dozing. They feel very real and you may feel like you can see, hear, smell, and taste things.
Children who have narcolepsy may experience severe sleepiness, trouble studying, and remembering things. They may fall asleep while talking, eating, or during social events and sporting activities. They may also seem hyperactive.
These symptoms can range from mild to severe episodes. Most people with narcolepsy have trouble falling and staying asleep, which can worsen daytime sleepiness., If you think you might have narcolepsy, start a sleep diary before seeing your doctor. Your doctor will want to know when you first had signs and symptoms and whether they bother your sleep or daily routine. He or she also will want to know about your sleep habits and how you feel and act during the day. Keep a sleep diary a few weeks prior to seeing your doctor to make a daily record of how easy it is to fall and stay asleep, how much sleep you get at night, and how alert you feel during the day.


Also note down any factors that increase your risk of narcolepsy such as history of narcolepsy in the family, any brain injuries or exposure to toxins you may have experienced, and any autoimmune disorders or other sleep disorders you may have., Your doctor will check you to see whether another condition is causing your symptoms. Infections, certain thyroid diseases, drug and alcohol use, and other medical or sleep disorders may cause symptoms similar to those of narcolepsy. Tell your doctor about any medications, herbs, or supplements you may be taking as some may cause excessive daytime sleepiness.


Your doctor may suggest getting a hypocretin test, which measures the level of hypocretin in the fluid that surrounds your spinal cord. To get a sample of spinal cord fluid, a spinal tap is done in which your doctor inserts a needle into your lower back area and then withdraws a sample of your spinal fluid., If your doctor thinks you have narcolepsy, he or she may likely suggest that you see a sleep specialist. This specialist may advise you to get a sleep study test called a polysomnogram (PSG). A PSG records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep.


You usually stay overnight at a sleep center for a PSG. A PSG can help find out whether you fall asleep quickly, go into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep soon after falling asleep, and if you wake up often during the night, A multiple sleep latency test is a daytime sleep study that measures how sleepy you are. It is often performed the day after a PSG. During the test, you're asked to nap for 20 minutes every 2 hours throughout the day. You will nap a total of four or five times, during which a technician checks your brain activity, notes how quickly you fall asleep, and how long it takes you to reach various stages of sleep.


An MSLT finds out how quickly you fall asleep during the day after a full night's sleep. It also shows whether you go into REM sleep soon after falling asleep. , If you suffer from frequently interrupted breathing during sleep, ask your doctor for treatment options. Interrupted breathing can make it harder to fall asleep, which can result in excessive daytime sleepiness, headaches, and attention problems. Your doctor may recommend surgery or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as treatment.


There are three types of sleep apnea: obstructive, central and complex.
CPAP is a common therapy for sleep apnea, which includes a small machine that supplies constant and steady air pressure, a hose, and a mask or nose piece. Some CPAP devices come with a heated humidifier for people who have chronic respiratory infections such as bronchitis or sinusitis., While there is no permanent medical cure for narcolepsy, certain medications prescribed by your doctor can help make it manageable. Your doctor may prescribe stimulants such as modafinil, which isn’t as addictive as other stimulants and doesn’t cause mood swings. Side effects of modafinil are uncommon, but may include headache, nausea, and dry mouth. Some people need treatment with various amphetamines, which are also effective but may cause side effects such as nervousness and heart palpitations, and may be addictive.


Serotonin inhibitors are also prescribed to suppress REM sleep through the day to help alleviate symptoms of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations. Side effects can include sexual dysfunction and digestive problems.
Tricyclic antidepressants are effective for people who have cataplexy, but have frequent side effects such as dry mouth and lightheadedness. Sodium oxybate can also be highly effective for people with cataplexy because it improves nighttime sleep and controls daytime sleepiness. However, it can have serious side effects such as bed-wetting, nausea, and worsening of sleepwalking. When taken with other sleeping medications, herbs, supplements, alcohol, or pain relievers, it can cause difficulty breathing, coma, and death.
Certain over the counter drugs, such as allergy and cold medications, can cause drowsiness. If you have narcolepsy, your doctor will likely recommend that you avoid these medications. "

Follow your doctor's recommendation.",How to Test for Sleep Apnea at Home," The American Sleep Apnea Association has a questionnaire you can complete to calculate your “snore score.” These questions gauge the severity of your snoring. Ultimately, they’ll give you an idea of whether you have healthy sleeping patterns or not.Access the questionnaire at: http://www.sleepapnea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snore-score.pdf
;
, Like the Snore Score, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale gauges your sleep health and sleep patterns. By answering questions based on a 0 to 3 ranking system, the scale will give you an idea of whether you have sleep apnea and its severity.Access the Epworth Sleepiness Scale at: http://www.sleepapnea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ESS-PDF-1990-97.pdf


, The Berlin Sleep Questionnaire is more like the Epworth Scale than the Snore Score. The questionnaire includes 10 questions with multiple choice answers. To determine your sleep health, you assign points based on question responses. In the end, your calculations will determine whether you are high risk or low risk for sleep apnea.Access the questionnaire at: http://www.sleepapnea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/berlin-questionnaire.pdf


, You’ll need to make an appointment with your doctor to arrange to take a sleep test at home. Your doctor will ask you questions about your sleep health and patterns. If your doctor believes you have sleep apnea, they will either issue you a sleep monitor or refer you to a doctor who can., After your doctor gets you the monitor, you’ll have to take it home and secure it to yourself. The monitor will come equipped with elastic straps and bands that you’ll need to secure around your abdomen and chest. These straps also come equipped with sensors that help monitor your breathing and the effort your body puts into respiration.In most cases, the apnea monitor should fit snuggly above your stomach and at the lower part of your breast bone.

, The finger monitor is a small device you’ll need to clip on the tip of your index finger. The monitor keeps track of your blood oxygen level during sleep. Without data from the finger monitor, you won’t have the information you need to determine if you have sleep apnea., Secure the nasal tubes to your nose. In many cases, you’ll have two tubes that you’ll need to insert slightly into your nostrils. These tubes will help gauge your air flow and breathing regularity. You’ll also have an elastic band you will need to secure around your neck or face.Take time to make sure nasal tubes are completely secured. This is the piece of equipment that is most likely to fall off while you sleep.

, When you’re ready to go to sleep, press the “on” button on your monitor. Depending on the model of the device, the button will look different or be positioned in a different location. However, your doctor should instruct you on which button to press., Before you go to sleep, and throughout the night when you wake up, check to see that the monitor, nasal tubes, and finger attachment are still attached properly. This is important, as some parts of the monitor could come loose from your body while you sleep., This includes caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, and cola. In addition, you should avoid products that contain nicotine like cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco. Consuming products with stimulants will undermine your ability to sleep.Consider avoiding sugary drinks.

, If you take medication at night, you should continue doing so when you take your sleep apnea test. This includes both prescription and over the counter medications. Some examples of medications you can continue to take include: anxiety medication, heart medication, and medication intended to help you sleep.Consult your doctor if you have any question about how a medication might influence your sleep study.

, Once you wake up in the morning, switch the monitor off (by pressing the same button you used to turn it on), and carefully remove each piece of equipment from your body. Return the monitor and the sensors to the container they came in., After you've concluded your sleep test, you need to return the monitor to your doctor in a timely manner. This might include dropping it off at their office, or mailing it in. It is important to return the monitor as soon as possible, so you can get results back quickly., Depending on your method of returning the monitor, it could take from several days to several weeks to get your results back. During this time, your doctor will download the data from the sleep apnea monitor, analyze the results, and formulate a diagnosis., Once you doctor has the results of your study, they'll either order more testing (like another sleep study), or they'll inform you that you have sleep apnea. Depending on whether you have mild, moderate, or severe sleep apnea, they'll recommend a specific course of treatment. They may:

Recommend you use a CPAP machine, which will continually blow oxygen through your nostrils and help keep your airways open while you sleep.
Suggest surgery. For some people, sleep apnea may be alleviated through surgery. Very often, this takes the form of nasal surgery to improve your ability to breath through your nose.
Ask you to lose weight. For some patients, weight loss can decrease the severity of sleep apnea."
"
Ask your doctor about sleep aid devices.,
Get to a healthy weight.,
Exercise most days of the week.,
Change your sleep position.,
Quit smoking.,
Skip alcohol and tranquilizers before bed.",How to Treat Sleep Apnea Naturally1," If you are diagnosed with sleep apnea, the most common treatment is to use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine to help regulate your breathing.A CPAP machine may take some getting used to, but it will allow you to get a full night’s rest.


Ask your doctor about other devices as well. There are a number of appliances and devices other than the CPAP that may help keep your nose and throat open and help prevent sleep apnea. These include tapes that help open the nose or head straps that keep your jaw forward.
Make sure that you talk to your physician and dentist before you try any devices. They will be able to give you recommendations on the best devices available.;
, If you are overweight, then losing weight may significantly improve or even cure your sleep apnea.To lose weight, you will need to burn more calories than you consume. Doing things like keeping a food diary to keep track of calories, eating more fruits and vegetables, and replacing high calorie beverages with water can all help.


Talk to your doctor for recommendations on a weight loss plan that will work for you.

, Exercise can help you lose weight and also help to maintain cardiovascular health, but it can also help ease the symptoms of sleep apnea.Start out easy and work your way up into more strenuous exercise.


Start by trying to get 30 minutes of moderate activity, such as a brisk walk, at least five days a week. You can also join a gym, do aerobics, strength training, yoga, tai chi or chi gong. Find something that you will enjoy so that you will stick with it.

, The way that you sleep can also aggravate sleep apnea. Avoid sleeping on your back because this can cause your throat muscles to tighten up and your tongue to drop back into your throat. This will increase the risk of sleep apnea.Try sleeping on your side with a pillow propped behind your back to keep you from rolling onto your back.

, Smoking can make sleep apnea worse, so it is important to quit smoking if you have sleep apnea.If you are a smoker, ask your doctor about smoking cessation programs in your area. Many communities offer low or no cost help to quit smoking.

, Alcohol and tranquilizers increase the risk of sleep apneas, so it is best to avoid these altogether if you have sleep apnea.If you have trouble falling a sleep at night, try drinking a cup of warm milk or herbal tea instead.

See your doctor and a mental health professional.,
Consider how the nightmares make you feel.,
Explain how long the nightmares have been occurring.,
Specify the frequency of your nightmares.",How to Treat Nightmare Disorder1," If you are suffering from ongoing nightmares that are affecting you during the day, then seeking help from a mental health professional is a good first step.You can start by seeing your doctor to discuss your nightmares and determine if the nightmares may be the result of medications or a physical condition.


To receive a diagnosis of nightmare disorder, your nightmares cannot be explained by drug or alcohol use, medications, or another physical or mental health condition.If you have any of these factors, then see your doctor to find a way to correct the problem.
For example, if you are taking a prescription drug that lists nightmares as a potential side effect, then your doctor may need to switch you to a different medication. If you have an existing mental health problem, then seeking treatment for that condition may help to alleviate your nightmares.;
, One of the criteria for nightmare disorder is that the dreams must be bad enough to cause you to wake up. The dreams may seem to threaten your life, safety, and self-esteem. For example, you might dream that you are being attacked by a person or a wild animal, or that you are being ridiculed by a group of your peers. After you wake up, you will feel alert and aware of your surroundings.You may feel quite distressed upon waking as well. This feeling may last all day and interfere with your ability to engage with work, friends, family, and/or hobbies., The length of time that you have been suffering from nightmares will affect how the clinician evaluating your condition will rate your disorder. The categories include:Acute. Nightmares have been ongoing for one month or less.

Subacute. Nightmares have been ongoing for one to six months.

Persistent. Nightmares have been ongoing for six months or longer.

, Your doctor or mental health practitioner will also assign a specifier to indicate the frequency of your nightmares. These specifiers include:Mild. This means that you have no more than one nightmare per week.

Moderate. This means that you have more than one nightmare per week, but that you do not have a nightmare every night.

Severe. This means that you have nightmares every night.

Note the presence of other medical, psychological, or sleep disorders.,
Keep a sleep journal for two weeks.,
Take notes on areas that need to be changed.,
Carefully write down your thoughts about sleep.,
Examine how your lifestyle might be affecting your sleep.,
Evaluate your stress level.",How to Treat Insomnia with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy1," If you are suffering from a major psychological problem like anxiety disorder, major depression, substance abuse, or post-traumatic stress disorder, it could be affecting your sleep. Likewise, medical issues like diabetes, chronic pain, and disorders of the thyroid can also impact sleep patterns. You should address these underlying issues with your doctor before beginning cognitive behavioral therapy., In order to learn more about your personal sleep pattern, you will need to journal about it for at least one, but preferably two, weeks. Take notes on the time you get into bed, the time you fall asleep, how many times you wake up during the night, how long you stay awake for during nighttime wake-up episodes, and the time you wake up in the morning.Be sure to take notes on if and when you use caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco.
Include times you eat meals and snacks.
Don’t forget to take notes on the time and duration of any naps you take during the day.

, Do you find you are waking up multiple times each night when you drink alcohol before bed? Do you have a harder time falling asleep after a day that included an afternoon nap? Does eating certain foods or drinking caffeine seem to affect your sleep pattern? Carefully examine your sleep journal and make notes on what you can change to positively affect your sleep.

, When you are lying in bed at night, while you are washing the dishes in the afternoon, or when you are at work, take careful notes on what these thoughts are. When they happen at night, they are called “excessive nocturnal mentation.” These thoughts can include musings such as, “I will never be able to get my work done tomorrow if I can’t fall asleep by ten o’clock!”
Such thoughts can upset and arouse you, preventing sleep and causing negative moods.

, For example, are you working out at 9pm and expecting to be asleep by 11pm? Do you stay up late watching television and then stress about falling asleep on time so you can make it to work the next morning? Take notes on behavioral patterns that might be affecting your sleep patterns.

, Stress is often a key factor in the development of insomnia. It can prevent you from falling asleep, staying asleep, and getting a truly restful night of sleep. Take notes on what factors in your life are causing you stress.Common stressors that affect sleep can include work, family obligations, finances, and social pressures.

Get more vitamin D. Vitamin D is often deficient in people with sleep apnea.However, be aware that vitamin D in high doses can be toxic, so talk to your physician about how much you should take.,
Increase your magnesium.,
Take vitamin C. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant.,
Consider taking 5HTP.",How to Treat Sleep Apnea Naturally2,"


Vitamin D taken as 2-5000 IU each day is generally considered safe.
You can also get your daily dose of vitamin D by sitting outside in the sun for 10-15 minutes each day.

, Magnesium may also be helpful for sleep apnea. Magnesium is necessary for muscle contraction and is believed to help the muscles of the respiratory tract respond to brain signals.Taking 100-200mg of Magnesium before going to sleep is considered safe. Higher doses may lead to diarrhea.

, It has been found to be beneficial in reducing the cell damage associated with sleep apnea.Try taking 500 mg of Vitamin C daily.

, 5HTP may also be helpful for sleep apnea. 5HTP is decreased in people with sleep apnea and it is a precursor for serotonin, a hormone that is involved with sleep and mood.Try taking 50 mg of 5HTP along with magnesium.

See a doctor to get a diagnosis.,
Request a sleep study.,
Learn about the different types of sleep apnea.,
Consider the possible causes of your sleep apnea.",How to Treat Sleep Apnea Naturally3," If you think that you have sleep apnea, see a doctor as soon as possible. There is no blood test to detect sleep apnea. It is diagnosed based on symptoms of fatigue, waking up feeling unrefreshed, family history, and sleep study results. Diagnosis will also include a physical examination to see if there is a blockage in your mouth, throat or nose. Symptoms of all sleep apneas include:Snoring
Episodes where you stop breathing
Abrupt waking with shortness of breath
Waking up with a dry mouth or sore throat
Difficulty staying asleep
Daytime sleepiness and waking up unrefreshed
Difficulty concentrating
Mood changes and irritability

, A sleep study, also known as a polysomnogram, may help determine if you have sleep apnea. A polysomnogram records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, snoring, and chest movement.


A sleep study can be done in a sleep study center or at home. During the sleep study, painless sensors are attached to your head, chest, face, arms, legs, and fingers. Then, you will go to sleep and you will be monitored while you sleep.

, There are three types of sleep apnea (SA). The three types are:Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is caused by a blockage of the breathing tubes during sleep. This is the most common form of sleep apnea.
Central sleep apnea (CSA). CSA is when the brain doesn’t send the correct signals to the muscles that control breathing.
Complex sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS). CSAS is a combination of OSA and CSA.

, Sleep apnea is due to a narrowing of the breathing tubes. This narrowing can be caused by:Being overweight
An over-relaxation of the throat and tongue
Swollen or over-large tonsils
A breathing tube that is narrower than normal
Aging

Use relaxation techniques to relieve stress.,
Avoid scary movies and TV shows.,
Stick to non-alcoholic beverages.,
Discuss your nightmares with a loved one.",How to Treat Nightmare Disorder2," Some people notice changes in their dreams when faced with overwhelming stress and/or anxiety. Think about whether the nightmares started around a particular time in your life, and whether your ability to handle stress is affecting your dream state. If so, learning some relaxation techniques to help you cope with stress and anxiety may help to reduce the frequency of your nightmares.Exercising regularly is a great way to cope with stress.Try to exercise for 30 minutes every day and do something that you enjoy. For example, you can try walking, swimming, biking, dancing, or playing a sport, such as basketball.
Use breathing techniques, meditation, or yoga to help you cope with stress.

Practice progressive muscle relaxation before bed. This is the process of tensing and releasing the muscles in your body moving from your toes to the top of your head Some participants who practiced progressive muscle relaxation saw a decrease in nightmares or an elimination of nightmares altogether., Watching a scary movie or TV show close to bedtime may also increase the chances that you will have a nightmare, so it is best to avoid these.Instead, try watching something funny or informative, such as a romantic comedy or a nature program.


Keep the time before bed as calm as possible. Try reading a funny or romantic book, or just dedicate your evening to relaxing and preparing for a good night’s sleep.

, To obtain a diagnosis of nightmare disorder, your dreams cannot be related to using alcohol or other substances.However, some people do have nightmares as a result of drinking alcohol or using other substances too close to bedtime. To eliminate this risk factor, avoid drinking any alcoholic beverages or using any other substances before you go to bed., Sometimes it may not be possible to prevent a nightmare, but talking about it can help. Upon waking, describe your nightmare to a parent, friend, or to your significant other. Explain what happened, who was in the dream, and what made it so scary.You may also consider rewriting the ending of your dream. Try to imagine a happy ending for the nightmare.
Journaling about your dream may also help you to understand it better and express the way that it made you feel.

"
"
Treat any underlying medical conditions.,
Use behavior approaches in therapy.,
Try Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT).,
Go to hypnosis.Hypnosis helps relax the mind and the body to focus on one particular thought, memory, or feeling.,
Consider medication.",How to Treat Nightmare Disorder3," To receive a diagnosis of nightmare disorder, your nightmares cannot be explained by another medical or mental health condition.However, an underlying condition may be responsible for your nightmares and treating it may eliminate the nightmares. Talk to your medical doctor about any medical conditions you may have that may underlie the nightmares. Your doctor may run some tests and rule out causes for your nightmares. If a medical cause is found, treat the underlying medical cause.Your doctor can also prescribe new medications, or adjust your current medications if he or she suspects that these medications may be causing your nightmares.Repeated nightmares may be an indication of a breathing disorder such as sleep apnea. Sleep apnea occurs when the body stops breathing while sleeping, then gasps for air. A telltale sign of sleep apnea is loud snoring, followed by a pause, then a snort or gasp. This pattern repeats throughout the night. You may wake up feeling unrefreshed or grumpy in the morning, feel drowsy throughout the day, or have untreatable headaches.Although it is not related to nightmare disorder, PTSD is a common cause of nightmares. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects some people after a stressful or traumatic event. 71 to 96% of people who experience trauma and resulting PTSD experience nightmares. The nightmares may recount major scenes of the trauma.Go to a therapist and get assessed for symptoms of PTSD and the resulting nightmares.

, Using therapy and behavior approaches can be effective in both children and adults. Effects of behavior therapy can have both short-term and long-term effects on nightmare disorders. Therapy can be brief, with just a few sessions in a group or individually.Many kinds of behavior therapy exists. You may practice Exposure, Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy (ERRT), Lucid Dreaming Therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).
You may learn ways to cope with nightmares, ways to help your mind and body relax before bed, and ways to handle stress better.

, IRT is a practice performed while the individual is awake. While engaged with the nightmare, the person changes the ending of the nightmare so that it no longer is upsetting. Once the ending has been changed, the person replays the nightmare and the resulting ending over and over in the mind. This type of treatment can reduce the frequency of the nightmares.For example, if you constantly dream about driving off a cliff, imagine yourself driving the same road, anticipating the cliff, and the car or bus driving past the location. Then, see the destination up ahead. You may imagine a nice forest or beach where you can have a picnic.

, It’s used to help change or reflect certain thoughts or behaviors. In some samples, many treated with hypnosis were symptom-free following treatment.You may experience a recurring scary dream from a natural disaster. Work with the dream while in a hypnotic state and notice how the recurring dream lessens or stops.
For more information, check out How to Find a Hypnotherapist.

, Medication is generally only used when treating nightmares associated with PTSD. Some medications can be helpful when treating symptoms of PTSD, particularly when nightmares are present. Some considerations in medication include trazodone, atypical antipsychotic medications, topiramate, low dose cortisol, fluvoxamine, triazolam and nitrazepam, phenelzine, gabapentin, cyproheptadine, and tricyclic antidepressants.Keep in mind that many medications have side effects and it may take a while to find one that works well for you.

Get a better alarm clock.,
Don’t “Snooze.” “Sleep Inertia” is caused by repeatedly waking and sleeping at short intervals.,
Open the curtains.,
Splash water on your face or take a warm shower.,
Fuel your body.,
Design your room for sleep.,
Go to bed at a reasonable time.,
Design your bed for sleep.,
Sleep in the dark.,
Sleep on your right side.,
Take melatonin.,
Embrace silence.,
Avoid long naps.,
Avoid stimulants.,
Keep a consistent sleep schedule.",How to Get up Easier in the Morning," Alarm clocks that wake us gradually have been shown more effective than traditional alarm clocks, which work by making a loud, shrill, or piercing noise, shocking us into wakefulness.Wakefulness is associated with activity in the forebrain, which picks up on light, sounds, and other stimuli in our immediate environment.
If we are woken from REM sleep suddenly, it is actually counter-productive to wakefulness because our forebrain has not had a chance to receive stimulation prior to waking.
An alarm that plays a low, soothing sound of increasing volume during the 10-15 minutes before waking stimulates the forebrain, gradually terminates sleep cycles, and allows us to accept wakefulness more easily.;
, This makes you groggy and makes getting out of bed difficult.To resist the temptation to snooze, set your alarm clock on a table or dresser away from the bed, forcing you to get up in order to turn it off.

, Circadian rhythms are a body’s internal clock that is tuned into daily patterns of light.


Although too much light in the evenings can keep us awake, studies have shown that morning sunlight encourages ""dim-light melatonin onset,"" which has offers anti-depression benefits., Increased circulation is also a good way of increasing wakefulness. Raising body in a warm shower increases circulation, help you wake up. If you are still groggy at the end of a shower, finish with a 30-second cold rinse. This opens up capillaries, increasing wakefulness, and has other benefits like boosting the immune system, reducing depression, and combats the effects of stress.

, Sleeping means that your body has been without food for 8-10 hours. Starting the day without breakfast is like starting a car with only fumes in the tank. You aren’t really sure how long it will run before it runs out of fuel.


Having breakfast ensures that you have plenty of energy to start the day and prevents midday sleepiness that can lead to naps, over consumption of caffeine, and impaired sleep at night.

, Is there an intersection outside your window with lots of noise? Does the bedroom side of your house face streetlights? Does your room feel stuffy at night? Combat this with the following accommodations:Purchase light blocking curtains. These are available through nearly any home furnishings retailer and can eliminate the intrusion of exterior light from synthetic sources.
Get a white-noise device. There are commercially available devices that have setting for different sound types (i.e. rainforest, thunderstorm, crickets, ocean waves, to name a few). You can also get a box fan or small personal fan and run it in your room while you sleep.
Install a ceiling fan. These circulate air and can cool the body, which assists the natural cooling associated with our sleep cycle.
Choose soothing colors. Stay away bright, saturated colors for walls, furniture, and linens. Instead, focus on soft, cool tones that promote relaxation.
Use ambient lighting. Overhead lighting can be harsh and counterproductive to sleep. Lamps are a good source for this, but recessed lighting inside wall molding is also an option.
Install a dimmer switch. This gives you greater control over the level of lighting, which can have a positive impact on preparing your body for sleep.
Avoid intense light. Don't install light bulbs exceeding 60 watts for a bedroom environment.
Purify the air. For allergy sufferers, an air purifier is relieves symptoms that impede breathing and results in vastly improved sleep quality.
Use a humidifier. In dry climates, a humidifier alleviates sinus conditions that prevent us from sleeping. They can also reduce occurrences of snoring.

, The first step to waking up easily in the morning if getting to bed the night before. Experts say to aim for between 6-8 hours nightly, so organize your evening activities around getting a full night sleep.Don't forget bedtime. Set a reminder for yourself when you want to begin winding down and heading for bed.
Power down electronics. Stop using your phone, computer, or game system at least an hour before bed. Give your brain a chance to adjust to the lack of stimulation, which can motivate relaxation and sleepiness.

, What you do in bed and the types of linens and blankets you use can have an impact on the amount and quality of sleep you get. Below are some things to consider:Remember that beds are for sleeping. Studies indicate that reading or watching movies in bed can prevent sleep and associate our bed with stimulation rather than rest.
Change bedding seasonally. Being too hot or too cold can have a negative impact on sleep. Be sure that your bedding is light enough to keep your body cool during warmer months and warm enough to keep you from shivering when it is cold.
Get the right pillow. Are you a side sleeper? A stomach sleeper? Do you have neck problems? There are pillows designed to support any kind of sleeper. Choose the type that is right for you and ensure a good night's sleep.
Get a foam mattress. Foam mattresses are quieter than traditional mattresses and great at muffling movement if you sleep with a companion.
Avoid synthetic fabrics. While they may be cheaper and equally as warm, synthetic fabrics like polyester or rayon are non-absorptive and breathe poorly, meaning that we can become clammy and sweaty while using them. Always use cotton, bamboo, linen, or other natural fabrics to ensure optimum comfort while sleeping.

, Sleeping or dreaming in mild to moderate light means that we rest less and wake more depressed than we normally would.Turn off disruptive light. Disruptive light includes sleeping in a room lit by TVs, computers, nightlights, and streetlights, all of which have been shown to negatively impact mood of sleepers.

, Research has suggested that sleeping on your right side has a positive influence on dreams, decreasing mood dysfunction during the day.Want to adjust your sleep posture to the right side? Purchase a body pillow and put it on your left side. This will cause your body to roll to the right.

, Sleeplessness or delayed sleep can result from disrupted circadian rhythms. Taking melatonin can help re-establish healthy, normal sleep patterns. Ask your doctor or a pharmacist if taking an over the counter melatonin supplement before bed is a safe option., Silence is usually needed to go to sleep initially; however, sleeping while music is playing in the background prevents our fore brain from resting and contributes to sleep deprivation.


Turn off music before bed. If there are other noises keeping you awake, consider earplugs.

, If, in spite of getting the required amount of sleep, you are still tired, take a power nap for 15-30 minutes.It is important not to nap longer as it increases tiredness and prevents meeting evening bedtime goals.

, Stimulants increase heart rate and brain activity, preventing our bodies from responding to natural sleep and wakefulness cycles. Below are some examples of how we consume stimulants.Avoid caffeine. Even small doses, caffeine can prevent the body from sleeping, especially when taken after morning hours. If you notice that caffeine seems to have a negative impact your sleep, cut it out of your diet, or only consume drinks that are ""caffeine-free.""
Watch what you eat and drink. Coffee (regular and decaf), chocolate, coffee-flavored ice creams, coffee liquors, many non-cola sodas (i.e. Mountain Dew, Sunkist, etc.), ""energy boosted"" foods, and energy drinks all contain quantities of caffeine and other stimulants.
Cut out nicotine. Not only is smoking bad for your health, nicotine can have a stimulating impact on the brain and should be avoided before bedtime.
Reduce alcohol consumption. Although alcohol can initially make us feel sleepy, it prevents the brain from shifting into REM sleep, which means we wake feeling groggy in the morning. Avoid alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime and imbibe no more than two drinks per day.

, Our bodies are habit driven, and this can be harnessed to ensure good sleep.


Go to bed at or near the same time daily. This ensures that your body will naturally respond to sleep and wakefulness, avoiding grogginess in the morning and enabling us to fall asleep at night.

Try stimulus control therapy.,
Experiment with sleep restriction.,
Improve your sleep hygiene.,
Sanitize your sleep environment.,
Practice paradoxical intention.,
Avoid watching the clock.,
Consider meditation.",How to Treat Insomnia with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy2," This cognitive behavioral therapy approach includes removing stimuli that might prevent you from sleeping. For example, you can try using the bed only for sex and sleep and removing stimuli such as television or reading books before bed. This approach also includes avoiding naps, and leaving the bedroom after 20 minutes of trying to fall asleep without success and returning to bed only when you are actually sleepy., Lying in bed awake is a bad habit that contributes to poor sleep. Sleep restriction is designed to eliminate extensive awakenings that occur in the middle of the night. Examine your sleep journal and determine how many hours per night you are actually sleeping. Begin by permitting yourself to be in bed only for the amount of hours you actually sleep each night. For example, if you are usually in bed for 8 hours but sleep only six hours, permit yourself to be in bed for only six hours each night.Extend the time spent in bed by 15 to 30 minutes each week.

, Examine the lifestyle issues you identified earlier, such as drinking too much caffeine late in the day, taking naps, drinking alcohol in the evenings, or not exercising regularly. Make an effort to modify or eliminate these behaviors, as they may be contributing to your insomnia., Creating an environment conducive to sleep can help treat, or even eliminate, insomnia. Making sure your room is dark, quiet, and distraction-free is a great place to start. Consider room-darkening window coverings, eliminating noise from radios or televisions, and keeping the temperature comfortable - not too warm, not too cold., Allowing yourself to remain passively awake, also referred to as paradoxical intention, means avoiding efforts to fall asleep. Go to bed and try to stay awake! This will decrease performance anxiety about having to fall asleep., Clock watching can cause stress and further exacerbate your insomnia. Try turning your clock around backwards to that you cannot see the time. This will still allow you to use the clock as an alarm., Meditation can help patients suffering from insomnia address their sleeplessness. Mindfulness meditation in particular has been shown to help alleviate insomnia in some patients.An alternative might be guided imagery. This is a form of meditation where directed thoughts and suggestions guide your imagination to a more focused, relaxed state. The guidance can come from scripts, tapes, or an instructor. This process can be especially helpful for people who have a lot of active thoughts disrupting their ability to sleep.

You may need a new mattress if your mattress is 5 to 7 years old, you wake up with pain or stiffness, your mattress sags or has lumps, or you find that you get better sleep when you are not in your bed.Your mattress should be comfortable, support your body, and keep your spine in the same shape as when you are standing.


If you cannot afford a new mattress, try a mattress topper or a thick mattress pad. There are many options including feather toppers, egg crate toppers, and memory foam toppers.
It is important to invest in a good mattress that will last because you spend about a third of your life sleeping, and this should be on a quality mattress that meets your comfort needs.
Always test a mattress before you buy it. Take off your shoes, lie down on the mattress, and try different sleeping positions. It is best to test the mattress for 20 minutes to get a good idea of how it would feel to sleep on the mattress.;
, Scent is very powerful and contributes to the ambiance of your room. Light some candles or use a room spray that you enjoy. Lavender is a scent that is calming, promotes sleep, and can help you feel calmer. Any scent that you like will help create a cozy environment.


Some stores have pillow sprays that come in scents like chamomile or lavender. Spray the desired amount lightly on your pillow and blankets; if you like the scent, this can actually help you be more comfortable.

, The amount of light in your bedroom affects how you feel. Natural light is best during the day, but dimmed lighting is best at night. Bedside lamps create softer lighting than overhead lights. Your blinds and curtains should also keep light from coming into your bedroom at night.


You can also replace your light switch with a dimmer to better control the lighting.
A low watt bulb (40 watt or lower) is also a good lighting option., Your sheets should be the right size for your mattress so that they do not tear or come off when you are in bed. Cotton sheets are the most popular and do well in the warmer months. Silk sheets are very soft and retain heat. They are useful for cooler nights. Flannel sheets are very warm and are best in colder climates. Synthetic fabrics (e.g. polyester) are less expensive, but can still be comfortable.


Change your sheets once a week.
Look for cotton sheets that are 100% pure or Egyptian cotton and that have a high thread count.
Flannel sheets are measured in ounces and heavier sheets are higher quality sheets.

, Everyone needs quality pillows. Some people prefer pillows that are shaped to support your neck or head, other people prefer them well stuffed, while others like them soft. At the end of the day, choose pillows that work for you after a little trial and error.


Load your bed with pillows of difference sizes and shapes. You may want a full body pillow if you sleep alone, or a wedge pillow to put behind your neck.Firm pillows are best if you sleep on your side. Medium pillows are best if you sleep on your back. Soft pillows are best if you sleep on your stomach.
Clean or air pillows regularly and replace once every one to two years for complete freshness.

, Having a nicely made bed will make you want to get in it. Start with a fitted sheet on your bed. Then tuck your top sheet and/or blanket in on the sides and foot of your bed. This will create a cocoon and keep your feet from getting cold.Nothing is worse than being all warm and toasty in your bed, but your feet are hanging out.

, Top your bed with a comforter, quilt, blanket, or duvet that is comfortable to you. You may need to change your bedding based on the climate and season. For example, a lightweight, cotton bedspread may be best in the summer, but a thick, down comforter may be best in the winter months.


Add a throw or blanket on top of your bedding. Cashmere, faux-fur, and knit blankets are especially cozy."

Many sleepers, especially night owls, may be tempted to sleep in longer on weekends. Try to keep the same wake-up time, even on weekends.
If you have been sleep deprived, you may need a little extra sleep for a few nights.
If you are sick, let yourself sleep extra.Reestablish your sleep routines as soon as you can.;
, If you have the freedom to determine your own sleep schedule, do so around the rhythms of your body. Your body has natural waking and sleeping moments. Notice the when you feel sleepy, and when you feel the most awake.


To establish a natural sleep rhythm, spend a week or two waking up without an alarm clock. Keep a log with all the times you wake up.
Keep a parallel account of the times at night you feel sleepy enough to put yourself to bed.
You may find that these numbers become more consistent after a few days without your alarm.
Formalize your bedtime. Once you have established your natural waking and falling asleep times, set a routine around them. Wake up and fall asleep on that schedule consistently.
If your natural sleep routine seems to be inconsistent, you may need to experiment with setting different bedtimes and seeing which ones feel best.
""Morning"" people tend to have an easier time setting their sleep schedules. If you tend to be more energetic in the evening, you may just need to set a sleep time.Make sure your formalized sleep schedule gives you the right amount of sleep. If it doesn't, your numbers may be off.

, Most adults need to sleep between seven and nine hours a night. Teenagers need eight to 10 hours of sleep, and school-aged children need at least 10 hours.Sleeping too little can expose you to higher risks of illness, anxiety, and disease.


Sleeping too much, however, may reduce the quality of your sleep and may actually leave you feeling groggy when you wake up.

, Do everything in your power to avoid waking up at night. This can be difficult if you are an evening person, if you have children, or if you are a light sleeper. Making arrangements in your bedroom and winding down properly can make a huge difference, but so can prioritizing staying asleep. Tell yourself and tell everyone you live with that you need to stay asleep all night.


Limit liquids in the hours before bed if you are someone who gets up to use the bathroom during the night.
Remove as many distractions as possible (as detailed in part two) to make a sleep-friendly environment. Lights, sounds, and anything else that might wake you up should be eliminated.
Older adults still need seven to eight hours of sleep, but may sleep more lightly and wake up frequently. If you are elderly, take naps and spend a little more time in bed than eight hours.
If you have a baby under a year old, sleep deprivation is part of the deal. You can help by maintaining a few boundaries. Establish a wakeup schedule with your partner or other adult sharing parenting duties with you. Your baby should sleep in their own crib, though you may bring your baby into bed for nighttime nursing.
Try waiting the baby out for the first few fusses or cries. Don't ignore the fussing, but give it a chance—a few minutes of noise might just mean your baby is settling down., Your bedtime routine should be consistent. Start brushing your teeth, washing your face, and doing your final shut-downs of the house at the same time and in the same order every night. Add steps that you find soothing so that your body knows it is time to relax.You might take a warm bath or shower every night, for instance.
Dim the lights to encourage your body to produce melatonin, a hormone that makes you feel sleepy.
Play soothing music rather than watching television or looking at a screen. Screen time before bed may keep you awake.

, Although you are best off getting in bed and falling asleep at the same time every night, some nights you can't fall asleep right away. If you haven't fallen asleep after 15 minutes, get up and do a brief, relaxing activity. Read a magazine, do some gentle stretches, or listen to a. Then put yourself to bed again as soon as you feel sleepy.Laying in bed and stressing about how you can't fall asleep can keep you awake and can create an association between your bed and feeling anxious. Getting up and doing something else can help ensure you only associate your bed with sleeping.
If this happens frequently, you may need to adjust your sleep schedule.

, Alarms interfere with your quality of sleep. Try training yourself to wake up at the same time every morning, but if you can't rely on your natural body clock, go ahead and set an alarm., It may be tempting to do work, read, watch TV, or play with your phone in bed, but this may make it hard for you to fall asleep when it's time to go to bed. Try to use your bed only for sleeping or sexual activity so that your body makes an association that when you hit the mattress, it's time for sleep., Get good curtains to block streetlight, and consider getting blackout curtains if you are really disturbed by light. Eliminate light sources in your bedroom — anything that emits light should be turned to face the wall, covered, or turned off. Nightlights are a bad idea.


In the hours before you sleep, dim the lights in your house and avoid screens.If you share a room with someone who needs lights on in the morning or after you have gone to bed, sleep with a soft cotton sleep mask.
Light inhibits the production of melatonin, a hormone that makes you feel tired. The light emitted from electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops is particularly stimulating, preventing your body from making melatonin and making it very difficult for you to fall asleep. Try to avoid using these devices before bed.

, Though some ambient noise may be comforting, you are less likely to sleep well in a house full of irregular noises. Consider earplugs if you live with other people. Set a noise policy with your housemates or family that will keep the house quiet at nighttime.The sound of a fan or white noise machine may help you fall asleep and stay asleep. White noise combines sounds of many different frequencies, which can mask other sounds that might disrupt your sleep or wake you up., Piling on blankets may make you feel sleepy, but being overheated can actually interfere with your sleep. Regulate your room's temperature and toss off blankets if you are hot. Sleep naked if you feel comfortable doing so, so your body can self-regulate its temperature.Lower the heat at night. Your core temperature goes down at night, so keeping your room cool will help you stay comfortable.Some people believe that taking a cool shower at night may help you fall asleep, as it lowers the body's temperature to the level it's at when you sleep.

Your mattress may need replacing every seven years, or earlier if it is sagging or uncomfortable.If you wake up with a sore neck or back, or if you sleep better in other places than you do at home, you may need a new mattress.


Make sure your bed is the right length and width. If you are sharing a bed, make sure there is space for both of you to move naturally.
Set limits with pets and children if sharing your bed wakes you up or crowds you.

, It's hard to relax in a cluttered room. Tidy up at night, and put away anything that reminds you of daily cares. Your work should be out of sight. Remove any unnecessary belongings from your room, and store them elsewhere.Keep a clear path between your bed and the door.

, Unless you are a baby or an elderly person, napping will lower the quality of your sleep. If you must nap, keep it under 30 minutes. Long naps will make you sleepy all day and wakeful at night. Take your naps in the mid afternoon. This is the time least likely to disturb your sleep schedule., During the day, get out your natural physical energy. Go for a run, a walk, or a long bike ride. Get at least 150 minutes of exercise a week if you are a healthy adult. Get a mix of aerobic activity and strength exercises, and break up all periods of sitting with breaks in which you move.Cease all vigorous exercise in the two hours before you sleep. Exercising too close to your bedtime may make it difficult for you to fall asleep.
Moderate stretching and walking in the evening will not interfere with sleep.

, Going to bed hungry or stuffed will disrupt your sleep. Try to finish your eating two to three hours before you go to bed. If you are prone to stomach acid, be especially vigilant about this.

, Caffeine may interfere with your sleep if ingested within the six hours before bedtime. Avoid coffee and tea in the evening, as well as caffeinated soda and dark chocolate.If you are having an alcoholic drink, have it at least an hour before bedtime. For every drink you have, add another hour for your body to process the alcohol.


For example, if you go to bed at 10 and you want to have two drinks, finish drinking them by 8.Although alcohol can help you feel tired and relaxed, it actually interferes with the quality of your sleep.Alcohol plunges you into deep sleep, pushing you past the REM stage and causing you to wake up early and unrested. It can also cause you to urinate, sweat, and snore, all of which can disturb your sleep.
If you like a warm drink at night, try herbal tea, warm milk, or just warm water.

, Sleep medication can interfere with the quality of your sleep and the consistency of your sleep routine, so it's best to avoid it if possible. If you practice good sleep hygiene and are still unable to fall asleep, you may want to talk to your doctor about short-term use of sleeping medications.Avoid smoking or doing drugs before bedtime., Stress and worry will keep you up at night. Establishing a consistent wind-down routine will help you communicate to yourself that it is time to sleep. If you are plagued by thoughts of things you need to do, keep a pad by your bed where you can jot them down before you go to sleep. After you write them down, remind yourself that you cannot worry about them right now.


Tell yourself ""Now is not the time to solve problems. I can do that in the morning. Now I just have to sleep.""

, The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute reports that certain medical conditions have been linked to poor quality sleep, such as heart failure, heart disease, obesity, stroke, depression and ADHD.

A warm cup of herbal tea such as lavender or chamomile will relax you and help you sleep.
A warm bath is not only relaxing, but the rise and fall in body temperature it causes will promote drowsiness., Go to bed close to the same time every night whether or not you’re tired. Sticking to this consistent sleep routine will help you get to sleep and stay asleep throughout the night.

Getting into a comfortable bed with the lights dimmed may help you get to sleep faster even if you don’t feel tired.

Implement a relaxing bedtime routine.,
Make your teenager’s bedroom a good place to sleep.,
Limit light exposure at night.,
Get your teenager out of their bedroom.,
Let them sleep as late as possible in the morning.",How to Get Teens to Establish Good Sleeping Habits1," Following a consistent routine every night before bed helps signal the brain that it is time to relax and get ready to sleep. Talk to your teenager about techniques they can use in the evening to calm down and relax every night. Give them some relaxation suggestions if they need some.Suggest to your teen to try reading for pleasure (not a school book), meditation, prayer, or taking a warm bath or shower.Create a calm home environment. Give your teenager plenty of time to eat dinner and get their homework done. Try not to be rushing around in the evenings to other commitments. If you want to have a serious conversation with them, don't do it at bedtime.;
, A good sleeping environment needs to be cool, dark, quiet, safe and comfortable. Get your teen’s input about what you could do to help improve sleeping conditions in their bedroom. You may wish to consider the following:Get blackout curtains to keep natural light out.
Buy a white noise machine or fan to block out distracting noises.
Invest in a new mattress. Have your teen help you pick out one they find comfortable.
Consider keeping all screens (TV, laptop, tablet, or phone) out of your teenager’s bedroom. If this is not possible due to the layout of your home or for other reasons, encourage your teen utilize electronic devices earlier in the evening, and not close to bedtime.

, Avoid bright overhead lights and use ambient, dimmer lighting instead in the evenings. Light exposure tricks the brain into believing it is daytime and triggering more wakefulness.Have your teen avoid all screen exposure at least an hour before bed. The blue light frequency of computer and television screens can make you feel more awake.If your teenager is using a computer to work on homework at night, you can find apps that automatically adjust a computer’s light as night falls. This altered light will not generate the same amount of wakefulness in the brain.

, Even though teens enjoy the personal space and privacy of their own room, bedrooms should be used for sleeping only. If a teen spends a lot of time playing video games in their room, for example, their brain may associate the room with wakefulness and excitement.You could consider enforcing a rule that all screen time needs to be in communal areas of the house. This is also a good strategy for internet safety.
Try to get your teenager outside and in the sunlight during the daytime. This can help ensure their circadian rhythm is functioning well and their body will know day from night.

, Help your teen come up with ways to maximize their sleep in the morning hours. Even just a few minutes can be beneficial. Let them try out a few techniques and check in after a few weeks to see if it's helping. Your teen may want to consider:Showering the night before
Laying out the next day’s clothes before bed
Taking something for breakfast “to go” and eating it on the way to school

You can choose whatever type feels best to you.Whatever material or level of firmness you choose, your mattress should feel supportive but comfortable so that you wake up feeling rested.


If you feel stiff or have aches upon waking, it can be a sign that a different mattress would help you sleep better.
Look for a mattress that provides adequate support for your back and neck in particular.Cover your mattress with whatever sheets and bedding you find comfortable. Change them in different seasons so that you stay warm or cool as needed.
Most mattresses last about eight years, so think about replacing yours if it is old and uncomfortable.
If your mattress is uncomfortable and you cannot replace it, you can make things better by using pillows properly.;
, Select a pillow that feels comfortable to you, no matter whether it is soft or firm.You can also use several pillows if you like, but make sure that they do not push your head up at a sharp angle. Whatever position you sleep in, your pillow(s) should keep your head held supported between your shoulders—in the same position it would be in if you were standing up., Make sure to wash your bedding as frequently as you are able to, and any time it becomes especially dirty.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for washing your sheets.
If you have a mattress cover, wash it in hot water.
You can dust your mattress with baking soda, then vacuum it up a day later. This will draw out moisture.
Pillows can be washed or put in your dryer at a high temperature to clean them and kill dust mites.

, Also, make sure your bedroom itself is as clean and orderly as possible. Some evidence shows that a clean and orderly bed and bedroom can help you sleep more comfortably, perhaps because of a psychological effect., A cool room (around 65 degrees Fahrenheit) is best for getting comfortable, sound sleep because it conforms to your body’s natural temperature fluctuations.Use a thermostat, fan, or window to help cool the air in your room if it is too hot/cool for comfortable sleep.

, Choose comfortable clothes to sleep in. Loose-fitting clothes that are cool in warm seasons and warm in cool seasons will feel best. If you are too warm, remove clothing or bedding. If you are too cold, add a layer of clothing or bedding.

, Most people sleep best when their environment is quiet and free from distractions.


Keep televisions, radios, and other devices turned off or at a low volume.
Keep windows closed if outside noise such as traffic disturbs you.
Some people find it helpful to use aids to lessen outside distractions, like ear plugs or the white noise of a small fan.

, If you are having trouble sleeping comfortably, you might benefit from trying a different position. Sleep positions normally fall into one of three categories: back, side or stomach.Sleeping on your side is most recommended for comfort and to reduce the chances of interrupting your sleep.


When sleeping on your side, bend your knees slightly toward your chest (similar to the “fetal position”).
If you have back trouble, consider placing a pillow between your knees. This alleviates pressure on your hips and lower back, making sleep more comfortable.

, However, sleeping on your back may increase your chances of lower back pain. Doing so may also cause cases of apnea, which can interrupt your sleep.If you do choose to sleep on your back, try placing a rolled up towel or pillow under your knees to encourage the natural curve of your spine.

, Some feel that sleeping on the stomach is most comfortable. However, doing so can cause pain in the lower back and neck. Sleeping on your stomach may also cause you to toss and turn in discomfort.If you sleep on your stomach, use a soft pillow or none at all to reduce the risk of causing neck pain.
If you have underlying sleep problems, it is generally recommended that you do not sleep on your stomach.

, If you trying to go to sleep soundly, avoid coffee and other caffeinated products, nicotine, and other stimulants. Their effects can last for hours, making it hard to go to sleep comfortably.And while depressants like alcohol can initially make you feel sleepy, they can actually disturb your sleep., The food and drink you consume, and when you have it, can impact your sleep.Large meals shortly before bedtime can cause indigestion.Your last meal should be no less than 2 or 3 hours before your bedtime.Small, healthy snacks make the best choices if you need something before sleep., Your body naturally responds to lighting conditions and will adjust sleep accordingly. This means that getting plenty of light in the morning and during the day, then keeping the lights dim at night will help you sleep soundly.Wearing sunglasses later in the day dims light, which can help you become sleepy.Avoid making television, computers, tablets, smartphones and similar devices part of your pre-sleep routine, as the light from electronic screens disrupts the body’s inclination to sleep.Moreover, some research suggests that the distractions of screen-time interaction have a similar effect., Getting regular physical activity is good for your health and may help you sleep at night. Exercise has a stimulating effect, however, so if you exercise too close to your bedtime, you may have trouble falling asleep or sleeping soundly.Exercise no later than two or three hours before your bedtime. However, light stretching can be helpful and relaxing right before you go to sleep.

, Naps can help if you are tired, but you should avoid long naps (longer than a half-hour), and naps near your bedtime. Otherwise, you may have trouble sleeping comfortably.For best results, if you are trying to sleep comfortably at night, avoid naps after 3 p.m., If you get yourself used to falling asleep and waking up on a regular schedule, you will sleep better overall.Be especially aware of when you're waking up and going to sleep during weekends and holidays. Try to stay within 1-2 hours of your normal bedtime. Fixing your sleep schedule can take some time and persistence, but you will sleep more comfortably once you do.

, Get your body and mind ready for sleep by doing the same things each night before you go to sleep.Do whatever relaxes you: read a book, take a bath or shower, listen to relaxing music, etc.


Your pre-sleep routine could incorporate a bath, reading a book, relaxing music, and other things that help you unwind.Many people find that warm drinks or tea can help them become comfortable and sleepy (just stay away from caffeinated beverages). Chamomile tea is a good choice because it has a calming effect.Meditation and/or breathing exercises are also recognized as calming techniques.A simple breathing exercise is to inhale for a count of 3 or 4, then exhale for a count of six or eight.A few repetitions of this can be very helpful when trying to calm down and prepare for a good night's sleep.

, If you don’t fall asleep after fifteen minutes, do something else. If you are trying to fall asleep and still haven’t after a quarter of an hour, get up and do something that relaxes you until you feel tired again.Tossing and turning while you’re not tired or have something on your mind will not get you to sleep.


Many busy people find they have a ""to do"" list that keeps them from falling asleep. To combat this, keep a notepad next to your bed and jot your thoughts or ideas down, so you no longer worry about them and can rest.

, If you have tried to make your sleep more comfortable and can’t, feel constantly fatigued, or have other concerns about your sleep, seek expert medical advice.If you have any of the following symptoms, you should also seek help:


Excessive or loud snoring
Feeling tired after 8 hours of sleep
Symptoms that occur only at night, such as a cough, sore throat, or heart burn

Be aware of the signs of sleep deprivation.,
Be patient with your teen’s changing sleep needs.,
Advocate for exercise.,
Encourage healthy food choices.,
Encourage your teen to skip caffeine in the afternoon and evenings.,
Keep their naps short.,
Maintain good sleep habits on the weekend.,
Seek medical advice.",How to Get Teens to Establish Good Sleeping Habits2," You teenager may need your help in developing better sleep habits if they are experiencing certain symptoms. Sleeping impacts many areas of growth and development, so their sleep deprivation is something you want to address right away. Look for these warning signs:


Sleeping in for more than 2 hours on weekends
Taking naps lasting longer than 45 minutes
Difficulty waking up and/or staying awake
Difficulty concentrating, When a child enters puberty, their body clock makes a switch and wants to stay up later. This is called the sleep phase delay. However, the amount of sleep the adolescent needs stays the same as it did pre-puberty —around nine hours.Teenagers then become sleep-deprived because they are still forced to get up early for school. Yet, they simply may not be tired earlier, at a time when they should go to bed to get the full nine hours of sleep they need.

, Encourage your teen to get some kind of exercise during the day to help them sleep better at night. If they exercise too close to bed, however, they may have trouble falling asleep.Your teenager may feel more wakeful in the morning if they can spend a few minutes exercising. Even walking to school or the bus stop may be beneficial.
Exercise may also benefit school performance., Healthy bodies equal healthy sleep. Better nutrition and lifestyle choices will help your teenager sleep better. Encourage whole, nutritious foods. Invite your teen to come grocery shopping and help you prepare meals so they know how to carry on these healthy habits into adulthood.


Don’t give them a big meal too close to bedtime. Growing teenagers are hungry all the time, but encourage a light snack in the evening instead of something heavy, which can affect sleep.Your teenager should not be smoking, drinking, or using drugs anyway, but remind your teenager that chemical substances can also make sleep worse., Caffeine can make it harder to fall asleep and make sleep lighter and less restful. Caution your teen against drinking something in the evening to wake up and focus better on their homework or after-school job.If your teenager is having a hard time concentrating on homework, for example, have them take a quick break or do some exercise as a natural pick-me-up.
If they insist on drinking caffeine, discuss appropriate amounts. Teens should have no more than 100 mg per day, which is about the amount in one cup of coffee or two to three sodas.Remind them that they may feel the effects of caffeine for up to six hours after ingesting it, so they should avoid it after lunchtime.
Remember chocolate contains caffeine as well, so eating this treat too close to bed, or eating chocolate in addition to drinking a caffeinated beverage, may keep them up at night.

, It may be best to avoid naps entirely, but if your teenager needs one, tell them to keep it under an hour. Sleeping longer may disrupt nighttime sleeping habits and keep your teen wide awake at bedtime.Tell your teen to try power napping, a short nap technique that can help them feel more alert and energetic.

, Teens will want to sleep in on weekends, but try not to let them sleep in more than two hours past their usual weekday wakeup. It may make it harder for them to fall asleep at a decent hour on Sunday night and feel well-rested on Monday., If your teenager’s sleep habits do not appear to improve through the implementation of sleep-friendly strategies or healthy lifestyle changes, you may wish to talk to your child’s doctor. Their doctor can perform an exam, ask your teenager about their habits, and recommend any further action.


For example, if your teenager is tired beyond what you would consider normal, their doctor may wish to examine them for signs of insomnia or sleep apnea

Signs of sleep deprivation also overlap with some signs of attention-deficit disorder (ADD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A doctor can rule out these conditions.
Your teenager could also discuss any other psychological concerns they may have with the doctor that may prevent them from sleeping. For example, they may be suffering from anxiety or depression, which can impact sleep. Their doctor could refer them to a mental health professional."
"
Talk about the benefits of good sleeping habits.,
Help them simplify their schedule.,
Set limits.,
Set a good example.",How to Get Teens to Establish Good Sleeping Habits3," Sleep has many benefits beyond rest and rejuvenation. Give your teen specific, concrete examples that they can relate to about how a good night’s sleep can benefit their everyday lives.


Some examples you may wish to share include better grades and behavior in school, driving alertness, increased risk of obesity, and increased stress.You could say, “Now that you have your driver’s license, it’s very important to me that you get as much sleep as you can. Tired drivers have slower reaction time than well-rested ones, and just a moment’s hesitation could get you into an accident.”

, Teenagers can be extremely busy, often in class from early in the morning to the middle of the afternoon. Then they may have extracurriculars, a part-time job, and/or a few hours of homework on top of it all. They may not be able to get to sleep until late at night. If this sounds like your teenager, help them reduce their commitment level to help them have more downtime and more sleep each night.Ask your teenager which activities they value the most. You could say, “I’m beginning to get concerned that you have too much on your plate. I’d like to talk to you about reducing your after-school activities. Are there any you’d feel comfortable giving up?”
If your teenager wants to keep all of their activities, you could help them find ways to help better manage their time. For example, see if they could squeeze in some homework while they are waiting for their after-school practice, or see if they can get off work an hour earlier in the evenings.
Another possibility is cutting back on your teen's activities and seeing how they manage their extracurriculars and school. If they show that they can responsibly balance their activities with doing well in school, then you can try introducing another activity back into their life.

, If you are the parent or guardian of the teenager, you can and need to set limits if you think your teenager is not able to manage their sleep schedule on their own. Teenagers do better when parents are helping them to manage their time.Decide on rules that you will be enforcing and talk to your teen about them. For example, you could say, “I will be making sure you are in bed with the lights out by 10:30 every night during the week. You will need to find a way to have all of your homework completed by that time. You will also not be allowed to have any electronic devices in your room during weeknights.”
Let your teenager know the consequences if they don’t follow the rules. For example, you may decide to take away their electronic devices for a few days.

, Model good sleeping habits as an adult. Children and teenagers learn by watching the adult role models in their lives.Keep your bedroom a screen-free zone. Don’t allow TVs or laptops in your bedroom.
Keep a consistent bedtime during the week.

Practice deep breathing exercises.,
Practice progressive relaxation.Progressive relaxation is a technique that asks you to focus on each of the major muscle groups in your body individually, relaxing them one by one.,
Do toe-tensing exercises.Though it may seem as though flexing muscles repeatedly might keep you awake, toe-tensing exercises actually relax the rest of the muscles in your body and prepare you for rest.,
Use a calming mantra to ease anxiety.A mantra is a sound that's repeated in an effort to focus attention away from distracting thoughts.,
Confront negative thoughts.,
Use positive affirmations.,
Lower the temperature.Your brain unconsciously regulates your body temperature at all times, but it tries to achieve different internal temperatures when you are awake versus when you’re asleep.,
Kick your pet out of the bed.,
Get up and do something after twenty minutes.If you get too used to laying in bed wide awake, your brain might start making an unwanted connection between your bed and wakefulness.",How to Fall Back Asleep1," By concentrating on your breath and controlling it, you can slow your heart rate and lower your blood pressure, thus prepping your body to get back to sleep.While lying down on your back, relax all the muscles in your body as much as you can.
Inhale slowly through your nose, concentrating on filling the bottom of your chest cavity with air. You should see your stomach rise instead of just your chest.
Do this in a slow, controlled manner, taking 8-10 seconds.
Hold your breath for 1-2 seconds.
Relax and let the air escape your chest at a natural rate.
Repeat this process until you feel yourself drifting back to sleep.;
, Even though we live in our bodies, most people actually find it very difficult to conceptualize the whole body at once. When we lie down and try to relax for sleep, we may be keeping certain parts of our body tensed up. Instead, try the following:


Lying on your back, close your eyes and focus on how your body is feeling in the present moment.
Focus on your feet, relaxing all the muscles in them and letting them sink into the mattress. Try to imagine the individual muscles in your feet, from your toes to your ankles, and unclench them.
Move up into your calves and knees. Working your way up from the ankles, relax any tension you might be holding in your muscles and simply let your legs lie there.
Move up into your thighs, doing the same.
Move on to your buttocks, then your lower back.
Spend some time on your chest and abdomen. Focus on your breathing — deepen your breaths and concentrate on the inhalation and exhalation processes.
Move on to your hands. As you did with your feet, imagine all the many small muscles in your hands and relax them one by tone. Begin with your fingers, then your palms, then your wrists.
Move on to your upper arms, then your shoulders.
Relax the muscles in your neck, where many people carry much of their tension.
Relax the muscles in your jaw, which you may be keeping clenched unconsciously.
Move on to your eyelids and cheeks. Let you whole skull sink back into your pillow.
Once you’ve done a relaxation inventory of your entire body, try to drift back to sleep.

,


Lying down in bed, close your eyes and concentrate on your toes.
Flex your toes backwards, toward your face. Hold that position for ten seconds.
Relax them for ten seconds.
Repeat the process ten times, then try to drift off to sleep again.

, The most common mantra is the sound ""Om,"" though you can use any sound that is relaxing and simple. Mantras draw your focus to 1) the action of producing the sound, 2) the tactile feeling of producing the sound with your mouth and throat, and 3) the soothing sound produced.


Lie down in bed and close your eyes.
Take a deep breath to fill slowly fill your lungs, drawing air into the bottom of your chest cavity. You should see your belly rise, not your chest.
Say ""Om,"" holding the ""o"" sound for as long as is comfortable.
Focus solely on the three dimensions of the mantra — action, feeling, and sound. Think about those three things until everything else falls away.
Rest for one second in silence.
Repeat until your anxiety has waned.

, If you wake up in the middle of the night paralyzed by anxiety or stress, you won't be able to get to sleep again until you deal with the negative thoughts that are taking over your mind.


Ask yourself, ""Are these thoughts productive? Will they help me reach my goals, or are they just useless, circular, obsessive thoughts?""If they are productive thoughts, let them work their way out. You may feel relaxed, having worked toward a solution to a problem you had during the day.
If they are negative thoughts, don't let yourself indulge them. Acknowledge that thinking these thoughts will have no positive effect on your life, and force yourself to stop thinking them.
This is very difficult, and will take a lot of practice and will power. You may not be successful at first, but over time, with effort, you can learn to control whether or not you let negative thoughts keep you awake at night.

, You'll have a lot of trouble falling back asleep if you stay in a negative headspace, so positive affirmations — the technique of repeating positive thoughts to yourself until you feel less anxious — can be useful in the middle of the night.


Begin with the more obvious, generic positive affirmations like ""I am a good person""; ""I believe in myself""; or ""I will have a good day tomorrow""
Repeat a handful of these affirmations to yourself until you feel slightly relaxed by the process of repetition.
Move on, then, to more specific affirmations that pinpoint the root of the anxiety that is keeping you awake. Examples might include:

""I will find the man/woman of my dreams.""
""I will find a better job soon.""
""I am happy with my body.""



, Reducing the external temperature slightly will help your body gear down for rest. If your room is warm, turn down the temperature to 65-68 degrees  fahrenheit.

, Though you may find it emotionally comforting to have your dog or cat snuggle with you at bedtime, studies show that 53% of pet owners who sleep with their pets say their furry friends interfere with their sleep patterns throughout the night.Your pet doesn't have the same sleep cycle as human beings, and won't feel compelled to keep still or quiet on your account. Keeping your pet out of the bedroom may be the key that allows you to sleep through the night.

, To jar your brain out of making such associations, get out of bed if you can’t get back to sleep after twenty minutes, and perform some kind of light activity until you feel ready for sleep again. Read a book or listen to relaxing music, but avoid the bright light of a television or computer screen, as those can stimulate your brain and keep you from falling back to sleep.

Sleep apnea is a disorder in which people stop breathing in their sleep, causing them to wake up throughout the night, never understanding what woke them up. The American Sleep Apnea Association estimates that of the 22 million Americans believed to suffer from sleep apnea, 80% of sleep-disruptive cases go undiagnosed — so get yourself checked!, Even if you don't have a sleep disorder, there are any number of underlying medical conditions which may be waking you up intermittently throughout the night. For example, people who suffer from acid reflux often suffer from insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless leg syndrome.Men who suffer from enlarged prostates will wake throughout the night with the urgent need to urinate.


Describe your sleep disruption to a medical professional and ask for their advice on what medical condition might be causing your problem.
This will likely involve a blood test, and if the doctor discovers a medical issue, their suggested treatment might range from a simple change in your diet to surgery.
To avoid acid reflux, skip foods like citrus, chocolate, fatty and fried food, garlic, onion, tomato, spicy foods, and drinks containing caffeine.
Over the counter medications for acid reflux or heartburn will not treat the underlying cause of the problem, but will spot-treat the symptoms if taken before bedtime.

, With time, you’ll be able to figure out which habits keep you from getting a good night’s sleep and which ones ensure it.


Use the National Sleep Foundation’s template for a sleep diary. Take a few minutes every day to fill it out, making sure to be thorough and to not skip any days.
Analyze the data from your sleep diary. Look for any patterns: do you sleep through the nights on the days you exercise? Does watching TV before bed result in interrupted sleep? Are particular medications causing sleep interruptions during the night?
Change your day-to-day habits based on the patterns you pick up to set yourself up for regular, uninterrupted sleep.

, Depending on your schedule, both personal and professional, you may have an erratic schedule that requires you to stay up late one night, then affords early retirement the next. However, to prevent unhealthy sleep patterns that result in frequent sleep interruptions throughout the night, set strict parameters for your sleep schedule. Make it a priority to get to sleep at the same night every night, even if that means you have to rejig your schedule throughout the day.

, Do the same things every single night in the hour leading up to sleep. An example might be:


Take a bath or shower.
Read a book or listen to relaxing music.
Meditate.

, Research suggests that the bright light from phone, computer, and television screens disrupts the body’s production of melatonin, which is a hormone used to regulate the body’s internal clock.Don’t look at any screens for one to two hours before you’re going to go to bed every night.

, If you’re particularly sensitive to caffeine, avoid drinking caffeinated beverages after lunch, just to be on the safe side and ensure that nothing remains in your system to interfere with your sleep at night.

, A cool temperature will help lower your body temperature and keep you asleep throughout the night. If you have street lights outside of your windows, get thick curtains (blackout curtains) to prevent any light from disturbing you throughout the night, and do your best to maintain a quiet environment free of background noise.


If background noise is unavoidable — for example, if you live in an apartment with thin walls and noisy neighbors — try sleeping with a soothing, regular background sound that will drown out the irregular noise. A whirring fan will do the trick, as will phone or computer apps that play soothing sounds like rain falling or the ocean’s waves breaking on the shore.

Seek out products containing valerian root.,
Look for products that contain numerous vitamins.,

, In addition to the other key ingredients that were mentioned, watch out for other components of a supplement that can help to promote better sleep overall. Magnesium can contribute in numerous ways to an individual’s overall health, from lowering their blood pressure to promoting a healthier nervous system. These factors can make an individual better able to get a good night’s rest. Potassium has been linked to the deepest of the sleep stages, so getting enough of this mineral can help ensure you are reaching this important sleep stage.

Do a “reality check.” The key to forcing yourself to wake up during a troubled dream is, in the first place, to realize that it is not real – that it is a dream.,
Look for “dream signs.” Another related way to become lucid is to look for and recognize “dream signs.” This term was coined by a psychophysiologist named Stephen LaBerge to refer to elements of dreams that hint that you are dreaming.Look around.,
Decide that, yes, you are dreaming.,
Try to wake up.,
Control the dream.,
Wait out the dream.,
Reduce your stress.,
Learn to have regular lucid dreams.,
See a sleep specialist or psychologist.,
“Script” your nightmares.",How to Wake Up from a Bad Dream," This is called becoming “lucid.” Lucid dreaming requires two things: dreaming and recognizing the fact that you are dreaming.The best technique to achieve this is to look, listen, and pay attention to details. Are you in a place or with people that you tend only to see in dreams? Does something not fit? Are you being chased by a monster or having a conversation with a long-dead relative? These are signs that you are dreaming.Always follow your reality check with the question, “Am I dreaming?” This will focus your mind squarely on apprehending if you are in a dream.;
, Do you see anything out of the ordinary?


Some dream signs will be obvious. Anything supernatural like flying or breathing underwater, seeing alien worlds, or being able to understand a foreign language that you do not know is a dead give-away.
However, some dreams are incredibly realistic. Pay particular attention to your environment and behavior.

, Sometimes people who are a “pre-lucid” state decide incorrectly that they are not, in fact, in a dream. For example, if you try a “reality check” and pinch yourself but dream that you feel the pinch, you may conclude you are not dreaming. It is only when you have answered positively that you are lucid and able to exert some control over the dream., Once you have achieved lucidity, it is possible to act within and sometimes to control your dream. Acknowledge that it is possible, and encourage yourself to succeed - dreams, after all, are purely psychological so waking up from them is too. First of all, throw your head back and try to open your eyes. Concentrate on waking up. Use as much willpower as you can muster. Don't worry if this fails – in a lucid state you have many options.


If you want to wake up, read something like a book or a sign. Many people find that they cannot read during dreams or that the text changes. Concentrate on the words and the letters. This usually activates a portion of your brain that is disabled in REM sleep., Lucid dreaming allows you to realize that you are in control and often lets you direct a dream. The possibilities are, quite literally, endless. Exert your will toward changing the dream or at least the scenario. You might turn the tables on your nightmare, for example, by shrinking the monster that is chasing you.You might also escape by flying away.


Try to blink. This will focus your mind on the act of waking. Close your eyes and wait a few seconds before reopening them. Try this several times.
You might also try to ignore the nightmare. Close your eyes, tightly and try to think about the real world or a different scenario. Think of your bedroom like what is it like when you wake up. Talk to yourself and then try to open your eyes.
If you can, escape the dream. You might try flying but also teleporting, willing yourself to a different location, running through a wall, or sinking down into the ground.
Find a lull in the action, close your eyes, and listen to the activity of the dream fade away. If you find yourself on the brink of consciousness, focus hard on the light at the end of the tunnel - the fuzzy shapes of your bedroom - and bring yourself to them. To avoid falling asleep back into the dream, sit up in your bed, blink a few times, and focus on a clock or object.

, If all else fails, wait until the dream ends. Human dreaming occurs during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep, and we typically dream for only about two hours per night, broken up into several REM cycles.Contrary to popular belief, moreover, time in dreams is not compressed. The activity in a dream takes about as long as if it were occurring in real time.All you need to do, then, is to wait anywhere from ten minutes to an hour and the dream will naturally end.

, It is fairly normal to have a bad dream once in a while. However, if you find that you are having recurrent nightmares, it may be a sign of an underlying problem in your life. You will have to treat this issue in order to thwart future troubled dreams. Are you very stressed, for example? Excessive anxiety can cause or exacerbate nightmares.Try to put your anxieties to rest before you go to bed and practice good sleep hygiene. For example, establish a relaxation routine for the evening. Have a regular sleep schedule. Play gentle music for a couple of hours before bed or take a soothing bath.
Don’t watch horror movies or read a disturbing book, as these may trigger bad dreams.You unfortunately cannot prevent your child from having nightmares. But you can be reassuring and set a similar routine for them. Put them to bed at the same time and make them feel safe, with a soothing bath beforehand, a hug, or a bedtime story. Make bed a comforting place, with their favorite stuffed animal or toy. Perhaps use a nightlight., It is possible to teach yourself to have habitual lucid dreams, and therefore to have more control whenever you have a bad one. One method is to envision yourself dreaming lucidly while awake. The idea is to increase your mindfulness and awareness so that, when you do dream, you are more likely to become lucid.Another method is called Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming or MILD. This is done in a waking state. When you wake up, do something active like reading or walking about the room, then lie down and go back to sleep. Then, make a clear intention to resume the dream lucidly, telling yourself that, the next time, you will remember you are dreaming., Sometimes recurrent nightmares are linked to serious disorders like Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, other mental illnesses, or to problems in the REM sleep cycle. These issues can be treated in a variety of ways depending on your situation, ranging from establishing better sleep routines to therapy or medication.


See a sleep specialist or psychologist if you think that your bad dreams are part of a pattern. You may have to undergo an in-patient sleep study or a psychological exam in order to get a diagnosis., Dream scripting or so-called “imagery rehearsal therapy” is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy. The idea is that a patient, while awake and working with a therapist, rewrites the ending to a remembered nightmare so that it is happy, or at least non-threatening. Then, they rehearse the ending in their minds so that the rescripted dream will supplant the original nightmare.Studies show that this type of treatment can significantly reduce the number of nightmares in patients, as well as symptoms of PTSD."

Adding Epsom salt to a bath before bed can greatly soothe any aches and pains you’re dealing with. Simply soaking in warm water can help relax muscle, loosen stiff joints, and even fight insomnia.When using Epsom salt:

Add 1 to 2 cups of Epsom salt while the water is running, the aid in dissolution.
Soak whatever part of your body hurts for at least 12 minutes. Enjoy the opportunity to relax.

, Reserve this step for when you have pain that keeps you awake at night. Talk to a health care provider about what medicine makes the most sense for someone your age. They will likely recommend acetaminophen or ibuprofen, though your age, weight, and level of development will dictate what the safest choice and dosage is for you., Gentle, restorative yoga or stretching can help with the discomfort associated with your teenage years.These types of exercise can also calm you down and prepare your body for rest.Signing up for a weekly yoga class, or watching yoga videos are good ways to learn some poses. Some of each are geared specifically towards teens. Poses where you fold forward, either upright or on the ground, can be particularly helpful in calming you down.Breathe with purpose. Whatever the pose, breathing is an important aspect of yoga. A 1:2 pattern is great for relaxation; exhale for twice the count of your inhale, in whatever increment feels most natural. For instance, if your natural inhale is three counts, exhale for six counts. Increase these numbers as you relax.

Exhale and bend back down, hands on the back of your legs all the while. Keep the knees slightly bent throughout the routine, and allow the head to hang loosely when you’re folded forward. After six folds, hold a downwards forward fold for ten breaths, using the 1:2 breathing method., This will help primarily with restlessness that is not recurring. Take note of these in particular:Melatonin is a hormone associated with sleepiness, and can be taken as a supplement. Do not take melatonin before puberty, or in the early stages of puberty. However, since melatonin production kicks in later in the day for teens (around 1AM, as opposed to 10PM for adults), this supplement may work especially well teenagers. Take the lowest dose that works for you, and do not consistently use melatonin to help you fall asleep. Keep in mind that melatonin works well for some people, but some people have negative experiences with it. If you don't like the way melatonin makes you feel, then don't take it.

Passionflower is a plant that is effective in fighting restlessness, anxiety, and over-active bedtime mindsets. Drink passionflower tea 30 minutes before bed if you’re dealing with any of these symptoms, or stress about relationships, school, or anything else.

There are professionals that have the specific knowledge and resources to help!They can also help identify the following potential reasons for nighttime discomfort:


Circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Common in teens, off-kilter body clocks can cause daytime sleepiness and nighttime alertness. You may want to talk to a professional if you experience several of the following:

Trouble getting to sleep until very late at night.
Trouble getting up in the morning.
Sleeping very late sometimes.
Falling asleep during the day. (1 out of 5 high school students fall asleep in class on their typical day.)Emotional problems. Emotional problems can increase your risk of sleep problems. Lots of teens experience emotional swings and rapid shifts in mood.

Make sure you leave yourself enough time to catch up on the sleep the next few nights.;
, If you find yourself with a busy schedule that makes it hard for you to get enough sleep, you need to start changing your schedule to include more sleep. Don't try to change it all at once. If you usually go to bed at midnight or 1 am, try going to bed 15 minutes earlier for a few nights. Continue doing this each night, going back an additional 15 minutes every few nights.


Eventually, you can move back your bedtime an hour or two, which will help you get more sleep each night.This will help you avoid sleep debts, since you will be getting more sleep each night.

, If you are working with a hectic schedule that is constantly filled with things you have to do, make time for sleep. If you schedule every part of your day, move things around in your schedule so you have time to sleep. This may mean letting go of some extra activities that aren't necessary or required.


Even if you have a busy schedule that has just a little room for change, make those changes to benefit your sleep schedule. The more sleep you have, the more productive you will be at the rest of your necessary activities.
This is really helpful if you are a student. Even if you have a ton of school related commitments and a ton of homework, you should always make it a priority to sleep. If not, your grades and overall productivity will fail.If these other methods don't work, improve your sleep routine, as described below, to help change your approach to sleep and increase your quality of sleep."

Write down everything you remember about your dream, because no matter how good your memory is, you're bound to forget details over time.,
Identify the exposition, hook, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.,
Stick to your dream, but you may need to ""help"" it make sense.,
Don't be afraid of creative license.,
Use a good vocabulary, proper grammar and the instructions above, and you're off to a good story!",How to Turn Your Dreams Into a Story," Take the time to write them down. Maybe you want to type because you have terrible handwriting or typing is easier. Maybe you want to write it down by hand because you aren't a very fast typist. You could even do both. Typing might somehow spark one memory of your dream and writing by hand might trigger another.;
, These are all important elements of the story.


Remember that you may not have a falling action or a resolution. The story might even end at the climax. The exposition is essentially the beginning of your story, the hook is what captures the reader's attention, the rising action is that amazing area in between the hook and the climax. Rising action is very important as it builds toward the climax. The more suspense, the better the climax!
The climax is the high point of your story. It is where everything you've been building up to collides. Protagonist beats antagonist (hero beats bad guy). It's the high point, the most memorable moment of your story. Often there is a lot of conflict in the climax. In The Hunger Games the climax occurs when Katniss and Peeta eat the berries. The story can end in the climax, but it doesn't have to. 
There is also falling action where the climax starts to fade away (when Katniss and Peeta are heading home).
Then there's the resolution. Things are resolved, more or less to everyone's satisfaction.
Sometimes these plot elements can be difficult to separate and identify. If you study other people's stories, you can practice identifying the elements, and that will help you develop them in your own work.

, Dreams are often a little weird. It's okay to change the dream a bit in order for your readers to appreciate the story more than they would your raw dream. If you're making a fairytale or children's book, you may not have to change much at all.


If you leave the dream unchanged, you may need to explain how a character is able to fly or possess super powers. Feel free to change the dream to serve your purposes. You may just want as entertaining a story as you can possibly evolve. Fiction is limited only by one's imagination, but if it's too unbelievable the story will suffer.
Be sure to describe any super powers early in the story so that they're not sprung on the reader at the last moment just to help a character get out of a tight spot.The reader will feel cheated if they don't know you can fly until you suddenly soar off to safety. The younger your audience is, the less this would be a problem.

, Adding is okay if it makes the story better! The more you add, the better, up to a point. Removing parts of the dream, replacing them with new ideas, shortening the story: they're all good ways to let your imagination run free! The perfect story is hiding inside your head. Let it loose!


Sometimes if you go to bed thinking about the story, you may dream it again with a few changes. Your dream might even pick up where it left off. Don't rely on this possibility, because it doesn't always happen. .
Ask your friends and family for ideas. They may be able to help you with a scene. They might say something that could trigger a great idea. In any case, the only limits on your story are those imposed by your own imagination.

, Have fun!

, Establishing a routine and set way of preparing to get to work or get stuff done will put you in the mindset to focus. Your routine might include a cup of coffee and breakfast in the morning, followed by a quick stretch. Or you might take your dog for a quick walk and have lunch. You may then have a designated area of your home or room where you do your work.Once you sit down at your desk or work area, organize any papers or materials you may need. Then, focus on getting to work.

, Turn your cellphone to vibrate, shut the door of your room, and let the people around you know that you are now getting to work. You may also want to turn off your wifi access if you do not need the internet to get things done.If you know you are easily distracted during a certain time of day, such are around lunch time or during the mid day, be sure to prepare for this. Set aside time in your daily routine or schedule for a quick snack during the day or a lunch so it becomes part of your routine, rather than a distraction.

, The first item on your list should be something you can go do right now. This could be as simple as cleaning the dishes from last night or calling a friend you have been meaning to get in touch with. The second item on the list should be something else you can get done in the next 2-5 minutes. And so on. This will cause you to act on the list of things you need to get done within an immediate window. Put more time consuming items further down on your list. By the time you get to them, you should be motivated enough to tackle them.If you don’t know how to do something, but need to get it done (such as “do my taxes” or “fix the broken door handle”), make a note to check for ways to learn how to do this activity. Put on your list: “Ask Mom about doing taxes” or “Check online forums for how to fix a broken door handle.”

, Organize your commitments and appointments on a physical calendar or on your phone using a calendar tool. Be detailed with the description of the appointment so you can remember what it is later. For example: “Hair Appointment at Bev’s Salon” or “Meeting with Kelsey at Original Joe’s Restaurant on 5th Street”.If you put the dates in your phone calendar, you should also set a reminder alarm 1 day or several hours before the appointment in case you forget about it.

, Next to your to-do list or the note in your calendar, write the date you will complete the task. If the task is ongoing, such as a fitness goal or long standing appointment, be specific about the time of day you will complete the goal on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.If possible, try to get items on your to do list or your calendar done 1-2 days ahead. That way, there is a buffer of time between when something is due, such as your science paper or your final report for your boss, and you won’t stress out when the deadline appears.

, According to a theory by Stanford psychologist B.J. Fogg, your motivation comes in waves. Sometimes, you feel like you are riding a high of motivation and productivity, and other times it might seem like you are caught in a low point of motivation and productivity, or a slump. Rather than try to get everything done during your peak motivation, you should outline all your tasks or projects so that when your motivation dips down, you can work on the tasks quickly based on all the pre-work or pre-planning you completed during your high motivation points.For example, you may be trying to work on a paper about colony collapse in honey bees for a class. During your peak motivation time, do some research on honey bees and the causes of colony collapse and create an outline for the paper, as well as your thesis. Then, when you are feeling less motivated or productive, you can use the pre-work you did to fill in the gaps and finish the paper.

, Per our most basic instincts, we are motivated to complete tasks in order to feel a sense of accomplishment, and have a reason to reward ourselves. Think of your favorite food, such as chocolate, or your favorite activity, such as watching a tv show or playing a video game. Then, tell yourself you can only indulge in a favorite pastime if you complete one item on your to do list first.Trade one item on your to do list, or several items, for time spent doing something you enjoy. But don’t go overboard and only reward yourself when you complete a task.

, Note your accomplishment by marking off an item or task on your list once it is done. This will also help you keep track of how many items you have yet to complete and motivate you to work your way to the end of the list., Hold yourself accountable to your to do list and your must do errands or tasks by talking to others about your plans for the day.Share your productive spirit and your fear of failing by telling close friends, partners, or family about your goals. This way, you will be motivated to accomplish them and have allies who are encouraging you to get stuff done, instead of daydream.

Alternate nights.,
Take it in shifts.,
Prepare your milk ahead of time.,
Go to bed when your baby does.,
Sleep with your baby.",How to Get More Sleep2," If you are a new parent, it may seem hard to get enough sleep while taking care of the baby. If you and your partner are having trouble getting enough sleep, split up the night shifts. Alternate nights with each other, so that you are responsible for waking up with the baby one night and then your partner is responsible the next night.


This can help you get a few nights of adequate sleep a week, which is better than none.
You can even have the person who is staying up with the baby sleep in a separate room so you get more undisturbed sleep., In order for you and your partner to get at least some solid hours of sleep per night, you can also try taking shifts. Split the night into two equal shifts, where you take one shift and your partner takes the other. This way, you will be responsible for your child while your partner sleeps soundly and vice versa., For those late night feeding sessions, pump your milk before you go to sleep. This way, you won't have to wake up each time your baby needs to feed and your partner can handle it some during the night., One way to get more sleep is to go to bed when your baby does. This way, you get more sleep before she wakes up for the first time. This may be hard with how much you have to do in a day, but if you find yourself with a serious sleep deficit, this can help you and your partner get some much needed sleep during those first hours when she is sleeping soundly., To help your baby sleep better at night, you may choose to sleep with him in the bed with you. This can help him feel more comfortable at night, wake up less when he is just fussy, and help him only wake up when he is hungry.There are some hazards to having your baby sleep with you, so make sure you ask your pediatrician if there are guidelines you need to follow before you do this.

Create a nightly routine.,
Make your bed comfortable.,
Wear comfortable sleep clothes.,
Relax before bed.",How to Get More Sleep3," You need to make a nightly routine that signals to your body that it is time to sleep. What goes on in your routine should vary depending on your needs, but once you have a routine, stick to it. You can drink a cup of herbal tea, read a book or magazine, wash your face, put on your sleep clothes, or get your clothes and food ready for the next day.


Make sure the activity you choose isn't too exciting or energizing, such as exercise or reading a stressful book. You want to calm yourself down, not keep yourself awake longer., In order for you to sleep more each night, you need to make sure that your bed is comfortable. If you are uncomfortable, you are more likely to wake up during the night. Get sheets that feel good against your skin in a fabric that is breathable. You don't want to get a material that is irritating to you or for you to get too hot at night. Your comforter should also be light or heavy enough depending on the time of year and the temperature in your bedroom.


Also make sure the temperature in your room is at a comfortable level for you to sleep.What is comfortable may change at different parts of the year. Make sure you figure out what is best for you.

, When you go to sleep, you need to make sure that you are wearing clothes that are comfortable and won't cause you to wake up during the night. The type of clothes will depend on your personal preference. You may not be able to wear anything but underwear and a t-shirt or you may feel more comfortable in full pajamas. Pick what is best with you.


The material that you wear should also be taken into consideration. Cotton breathes better than most fabric, so look into that for movable, breathable sleep clothes. , There are certain things you can do to help yourself relax before bed. You can perform breathing exercises to help relax your mind and calm your body. You can try progressive muscle relaxation, during which you tense and then relax every muscle in your body. These will help you be more calm overall, which will make it easier to go to sleep.

Avoid other activities in your bed.,
Drink less caffeine.,
Avoid heavy foods at night.,
Exercise earlier in the day.,
Try not to think about not being able to sleep.,
Reduce exposure to light.",How to Get More Sleep4," In order to get more sleep, you need to make sure your bed is associated only two things: sleep and sex. To ensure that, use your bed only for activities that should be done there.


Try not to watch TV, do work, read, or eat in bed. This will make you look at your bed as a place for activity, which may cause you to lose sleep., Caffeine is a stimulant, which can help you get through your day. However, if you drink caffeine late in the day, it can keep you awake. Try to avoid caffeine late in the day.


The specific time you should stop drinking caffeine depends on your sensitivity to it. For some, any caffeine after noon can cause sleeplessness. For others, caffeine can be consumed later in the day without sleep loss.Learn your limits and cut off caffeine early enough so that it won't affect your sleep. And remember that chocolate contains caffeine, so you should avoid it late at night as well!

, Eating large amounts of food or heavy foods late at night can make you lose sleep. The digestion can cause restlessness and your body will gain energy from the food you ate. Try to avoid eating at least two hours before bed.However, if you need to eat late in the day, try foods that can help induce sleep. These foods include milk, almonds, oats, eggs, and bananas.
Also try cherries or cherry juice. Cherries are one of the only foods that naturally contain melatonin, which is the hormone that encourages sleep. Drink a glass of cherry juice or eat a small bowl of cherries if you are hungry before bed., Exercise in the morning or early afternoon to work off your excess energy every day. However, make sure it is earlier in the day instead of late at night. If you exercise too late at night, the extra intensity and body activities will keep you up.


If you do have to work out later in the day, choose less strenuous activities such as walking, stretching, or weight training., If you are struggling to fall asleep, don't stay in bed. Instead, get up from your bed to avoid additional frustration. Try to redo part of your nightly routine to get you back into the sleeping mindset. If this doesn't work, try any relaxing activity, such as reading a book, drinking warm milk, or deep breathing exercises described later.


If these don't work, try stretching to help you relax. Just make sure it is calm and gentle stretching., Exposure to too much light at night can actually impede your sleep. This can be from outside lights on the street, from a TV, or from electronic devices. Getting too much light late at night reduces the production of melatonin, which is a hormone naturally produced by your body that induces sleepiness.


The more darkness you are exposed to, the more melatonin your body will produce."

Buy the right herbal supplement.,
Take melatonin.,

Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the bottle for dosage and frequency of use. These change based on the type of supplement you take. You should always speak with your doctor before starting any supplement — just like medications you get from the pharmacy, supplements can have negative interactions with other medications and can be harmful to some.


When buying a supplement, make sure it is of a good quality. Quality supplements can be organic, should be fresh, and should be verified with a seal of approval.

Do whatever it takes to clear your mind and calm you down.
, Breathe through your nose if possible, and empty your mind., Form a clear, detailed picture of the sort of dream you want to have. As an example, choose a flying dream. For this, picture what you are exactly. What you look like, how you fly, colours, and clothes. Then picture the landscape.

When you wake from a lucid dream, lie quietly in bed.,
Pay close attention to the position of your body, and return your body to the exact position it had upon waking from the lucid dream.,
Recall the end of the lucid dream clearly in your mind.,
Imaginatively focus on a particular event, or object or viewpoint from the end of the lucid dream, and allow yourself to doze off.,
Alternatively, you may find it easier to re-enter the lucid dream if you consciously imagine yourself viewing the lucid dream from some dream figure or dream item that you remember.",How to Re Enter a Lucid Dream," Do not move, or even open your eyes for more than a few seconds if you can manage it.;
, Move your arms, legs, hands, head and torso to mimic that position.

, See the details and the setting near the end of the lucid dream.

, Here, you may spontaneously re-enter the dream lucidly.

, See the earlier lucid dream from that new vantage point in the dream space. Imaginatively see the end of the lucid dream from its perspective, and then allow yourself to doze off. At this point, you may re-enter a very similar dream lucidly aware.

To start, you should be laying down in the dark, when you are exceptionally tired.,
Have you ever felt the feeling of slipping into sleep, or everything being so peaceful all you see is black while you know that you still are awake?,
Once you have the feeling that we mentioned in the last step, try to imagine you jumping on a trampoline.,
Keep doing one of those two methods, and whatever I said you may feel, the feeling will get stronger.,
After you have been doing this for 10-30 minutes, it will feel like you were thrown into the whole scenario of what you where imagining.,
It may be a little hard to move at first, because you are not used to being able to move yourself in your dreams.,
It may take a little practice, but it is very true to happen.",How to Lucid Dream Quickly," Lay down and relax your body. Let your thoughts go, and just relax. Have no worries. Forget the world, forget your body. Focus on your mind.;
, Well, stay laying down in your bed, and try to fall asleep. But, keep your mind conscious. It may take awhile, but be patient.

, You may feel a faint feeling of bouncing. Or, imagine that you are swimming in the ocean, a nice cool ocean, and the waves keep going over you. You may feel that when the waves come over you, you feel a wave of coolness. Use one of those two things.

, The visualization will get clearer. Make sure that you don't get too excited at this part, though. This will thrust you back into full-consciousness.

, If you chose the trampoline, you can control to jump so high into the sky that you can start flying. If you chose the ocean, you can dive underwater and explore the depths of the ocean with mermaids.

, Just move little by little. And don't get super excited either. That will wake you up. And finally when you can control you body, you can start to be able to add people into the dream, remove people, do things you aren't able to do in reality, and change the places that you are in.

, I've done it before many times using this method, and I think it is the most helpful. Good luck and have fun!

Visit your local bookstore.,
Look for proof.,
Recognize synchronicity.,
Play in the “twilight zone.” Begin your journey in Shamanic dream practice by playing the period between sleeping and wakefulness.,
Look for symbols.,
Track your dreams across the “three levels.” There are three levels of dreams, or three “dream worlds.” Begin tracking which “levels” you naturally dream within.",How to Learn Shamanic Dreaming1," Browse a book on Shamanic practices and beliefs. In ancient societies, Shamans would travel into the spirit world to bring back answers. While you visit the bookstore, keep your eyes and heart open. You have already started your Shamanistic journey. This is your first Shamanistic mission. What knowledge can you bring back?


Did you learn anything unexpected?
Did an interesting person speak to you?
Did you notice anything out of the ordinary?
If this bookstore appears in a upcoming dream, enter it.;
, The Shaman believes that the Universe is alive, conscious, and connected; that all objects, even inanimate ones, contain a spirit or soul. Begin to notice proof of these beliefs in your daily life. Does your coffee grinder seem to have a soul? Does the butterfly on your window remind you of someone? Do you feel connected to the plant that needs water in your office? Acknowledge these feelings and connections. This beings may begin to visit you in your dreams.


Each day, acknowledge the “beingness” of animals and objects by greeting them.
Say (silently or better yet, out loud) “Hello, Coffee Grinder. Thank you for making my morning a bit better today.""
As you become comfortable finding (and believing in) this proof during the day, it will be easier to continue this practice as you sleep.

, Almost nothing in life is “just a coincidence.” Attending to synchronicity in our waking lives opens us up to messages from the Universe. When you encounter synchronicity, that is the Universe's way of saying that you are on the right track.Synchronicities are often clues for what to look for or where to go during a dream. Examples of synchronicity include:


Seeing the same person as a variety of unrelated locations.
Speaking a word out loud at the exact same time as someone else.
When you experience a synchronistic moment, don't ignore it. Stop and notice it. Write it down.
Pay specific attention to synchronicities that cross the threshold between waking and dream. (Did you see a person in real life and then in a dream? Try to talk to them in your dream!)

, This space is called the “Twilight Zone.”As you lie in bed and prepare for sleep, direct your mind and imagination to fertile places for Shamanic activity. You've already been laying the groundwork for these messages!Think back to the bookstore. Who spoke to you? Call them to mind and imagine a scenario where they give you advice. Picture the outside of the store and imaging yourself entering. This bookstore may be a gateway to an Upper Level.
Recall any ""proof"" you recently encountered. Bring to mind the coffee grinder who seemed alive. Listen to the sound of its motor. Can you hear any messages through that hum? What could a coffee grinder want to tell you?
Recall a synchronicity that happened to you. Remember the details. What were the circumstances and how did you feel? Can you relive the experience as you drift into sleep?
Use the classic approach and imagine a staircase. Visualize it in as much detail as you can. As you drift into sleep, imagine yourself ascending it. This will enable you to enter the Upper Level as you drift into sleep.
Finally, think about what you want to know. As you pass through the threshold between waking and dream worlds, ask a question about yourself, your future, or your ancestors.

, In order glean wisdom from Shamanic dream journeys, you will need to learn the language of your dreams.Begin tracking common symbols. For now, simply take note of these symbols and notice patterns. There are two types of Shamanic Dream Symbols.Archetypical symbols are images that have transcended generations and cultures. Things like the elements (water, air, earth, fire), celestial bodies (the sun, the moon, the stars), and animals (tigers, bears, reptiles).
Personal symbols are symbols that are specific to you, your experience, and your family. Was your grandfather struck by lighting? Lighting will be a powerful symbol for you.
Sometimes symbols can be both. The divine will communicate using symbol systems you already know. Have you been educated in any forms of religious practice? These symbols may appear to you in your dreams.

, Do you favor one in particular? Do you notice a pattern for when you switch?


The Upper Level is linked to intellectual and spiritual knowledge. Upper Level dreams may feature libraries, sunlight, and open skies.
The Middle Level (or Mid-level) is where most dreaming takes place. The Middle World is very much like the waking world. This level will yield the least Shamanic insight.
The Lower Level (also called the Journey Level) is linked to primal knowledge. Lower Level dreams will be populated by nature and animals.
If you know when you’re prone to dream on a specific level, you can aim to gain specific knowledge when the conditions are right.

Be aware of the fact that your dreams have ceased to be fulfilling for you.,
See if there is anything about your dreams that has already been achieved.,
Hold a 'letting go' ceremony.,
Have the courage to say goodbye with a pat on your back.,
Create new dreams.,
Reinvent the dream.",How to Let Go of Your Dreams," Society, rafts of self-help books, great orators, colleagues, fellow students, parents, teachers, everyone it seems, is always telling us to ""pursue our dreams"". Nobody ever really stops, though, to explain that we should hold realistic dreams and that sometimes our dreams are not in sync with our abilities, needs, and interests as time moves on. Facing the fact that dreams have become stale is hard but can be very rewarding because it is the first step in allowing you to let go and to create new goals.;
, Sometimes if we behave in a 'perfectionist' way, we keep seeking more and more, even if some of our goals have already been realized. In this case, we think the grass is greener elsewhere and we keep on looking for what is more rather than what is better. Rejoice in that which you have already achieved and work from the successes you have already had.

, Dreams that have become stale need a momentous farewell; once they guided you, so even though now they drag you down, they do deserve a fitting send-off. Do something that marks the finality of these dreams and creates closure for you. Good ideas include a burial of dreams written on paper or burning the pieces of paper, dropping pieces of written dreams into the ocean, shouting them to the wind on a windy day, even involving trusted loved ones to attend your letting go ceremony, as witnesses to you moving on.

, Be kind to yourself for letting go and do nice things that you enjoy. This is a hard time of growth in your life but you should be proud of yourself for facing it.

, You are now at liberty to replace your old dreams with healthy new ones that will guide you into the future from here onwards. Hang in there; you're going to do just fine.

, Maybe you have placed limitations or expectations on how your dream is supposed to look. Maybe you don't need to completely let it go, but instead can open and allow a different version to materialize. One that will suit your circumstances better and may even fulfill more than you would have originally imagined.

Concentrate your focus actively on the specific area in the dream that you wish to move to.,
Intend yourself to be at that specific spot, by imagining yourself there, touching the spot, seeing it up close.

,
Maintain this focused intent, and now allow your awareness to move there freely.",How to Move Easily in a Lucid Dream,";
,, You should find yourself floating, flying or cruising to the specified point in seconds.

Practice daily reality checks.,
Learn to recognize dream signs.,
Use audio stimulation.,
Interpret Shamanic Symbols.,
Determine which level you are dreaming on.",How to Learn Shamanic Dreaming2," In order to engage with the Shamanic wisdom of your dreams, you must become “awake” (or “lucid”) while still dreaming. In other words, you must be aware that you are dreaming while you remain asleep. One simple way to induce lucid dreaming is to get into the practice of regularly asking yourself whether or not you are dreaming.


By routinely asking yourself whether or not you are dreaming while you are awake, you will naturally extend this practice while you are asleep.
When you ask yourself this question during a dream, it will be obvious that you are, in fact, dreaming, and your dream will become lucid.
Lucid dreaming is an essential step on path to Shamanic dreaming.

, There are some common signs that can indicate that you are dreaming. Several of these apply to most people, but in time, you will come to recognize those signals most relevant to you. These signals can encourage you to become lucid.


Clocks, phones, and other technological devices will often malfunction.
Your hands will often look bizarre.
Your reflection in a mirror may look strange and different.
Anytime you encounter one of these tip-offs, ask yourself, “Am I dreaming or awake?”

, Traditional Shamans would regularly use drumming to induce a trace, or dreamlike state. You can tap into this method by listening to binaural beats while you sleep.


Binaural beats are audio tracks, for use with headphones, that play different frequencies in each ear.
These beats induce an almost automatic meditative state, and have been shown to encourage lucid sleep., Once you become effective at “waking up” in your dreams, it is time to glean deeper messages. You have already been looking for and recognizing personal and archetypal symbols in your dreams. Now it is time to interpret them.


For example, if your grandfather was struck by lighting, lighting may be an important symbol to you. If your grandfather’s story inspires you, lighting may signify inspiration. If you are terrified of storms because of what happened, lighting may signify fear or caution.
Additionally, lighting can be an archetypal symbol. It is linked to Greek, Norse, and Hindu Gods. It can symbolize punishment from the Gods or loss of innocence.
How did you feel when you encountered lighting in the dream? This can guide your interpretation of the symbol.
Practice this interpretation after you wake from a dream. In time, you will be able to perform this analysis in the midst of the dream.

, Remember the “three levels”? When you become lucid in a dream, look around and determine which of the three levels you are functioning on.


If you are on the Middle Level, look for a door or passage way. Look for stairs. If you can find any kind of portal, go through it. It will likely lead to an Upper or Lower Level.
If you find yourself on an Upper Level, observe any messages about your connection to the divine, about your quest for knowledge, or about the after life. On this level, you will often be visited by ancestors.
If you find yourself on the Lower Level, observe messages about your primal being. This level can tell you about your deepest needs and desires. On this level, you may be spoken to by animals, or by your unborn children.

Get plenty of sleep.,
Keep a dream journal.,
Begin a meditation practice.,
Abstain from alcohol before bed.,
Use a positive affirmation.",How to Learn Shamanic Dreaming3," In order to glean the Shamanistic insights of dreams, you must practice remembering them. The first step is to spend an adequate number of hours sleeping. As the night goes on, your period of REM sleep (dreaming sleep) will grow longer, providing you with more substantial details to hold on to. Your first dream of the night will be the shortest, but after 8 hours of sleep, dream periods can last 45 minutes or more.
Dreams that happen later in the night may contain more Shamanic value.

, Have you ever remembered a dream upon waking, only to have it quickly slip away? Keep some paper and pen near your bed and write down your thoughts as soon as you wake up.This will serve you well in two ways:


Over time, this practice will help you to recall your dreams without needing to write them down.
When you have a record of your dreams, you can analyze them later to glean additional Shamanic wisdom.

, By engaging in a meditation practice during the day, you will strengthen your mind’s ability to relax into a successful dream-state, as well as your capacity to retain the messages of your dreams.Guided audio meditation with binaural beats can be a simple way to engage with a meditation practice.
If you do not like guided meditation, simply try sitting quietly for 5-10 minutes and taking deep breaths.
For best results, meditate every day to every other day.

, Consuming alcohol will reduce the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, thereby, reducing your number of vivid dreams.If you have time to sleep in the next morning, however, you might experience “REM rebound” where you can make up for the REM sleep you lost.

, Before you go to sleep each night, say “I always remember my dreams.” Repeat this every time you go to sleep. This will help you orient your mind toward lucid dreaming and Shamanic symbolism. In time, you will manifest the ability to remember your dreams."

Don't dwell on your nightmares.,
Don't take your worries to bed with you.,
Watch your thoughts closely.,
Practice visualizing a safe space.,
Examine your actions.,
Use imagery rehearsal therapy.",How to Get Rid of Bad Dreams1," Even though they may be truly terrifying and stick with you, try your best not to worry about them. Allowing them to cause your more stress and fear will only increase the likelihood of more nightmares in the future.Try to focus on positive life events instead of fear and worry. Thinking of a safe space or a loved one will help keep your mind in a positive space.
Think of how much better your sleep is becoming now that you are improving it.;
, As much as possible, leave any fears or concerns behind you as you lay down to sleep. Dwelling on these negative things as you fall asleep will only increase the likelihood of having a bad dream.As you fall asleep, focus your mind on the rhythm of your breath.
Gently and naturally, follow your inhalations and exhalations with your mind.
If your mind wanders, refocus on your breath.
Focusing on your breath will allow your thoughts to pass by without disturbing your sense of calm.
Try not to dwell on any thoughts as you fall asleep. Let your thoughts pass by without focusing on them or making judgements about them., Throughout the day, pay careful attention to your thoughts. If you find yourself starting to blow your fears and worries out of proportion, stop. Catch these thought patterns and instead focus on positive aspects as best you can.Keeping your problems in perspective will save you unneeded stress.
Don't exaggerate any causes of stress, be as objective as you can.

, If you feel too stressed or find yourself focusing on negativity, try imagining a safe space. By visualizing a safe space, you can find relief from the source of your anxiety for a time, allowing you to return relaxed and refocused.Find a real, physical space that you can get comfortable in.
Start to imagine your safe space. Your safe space can be any place at all, real or imagined, that makes your feel secure and relaxed.
Use all of your senses in your imagining of your safe space. See, hear, smell, feel, and maybe even taste your secure and safe space.
Be aware of your body and any tension you are carrying. Release and relax that tension as you enjoy your safe space.
Be in your space for for at least five to ten minutes. When you feel relaxed, slowly return by opening your eyes and calmly sitting for another minute.

, Negative emotions can lead to behaviors that will only cause further negative emotions. If you find yourself engaging in negative, risky, or impulsive actions, stop.Stop any risky, impulsive, or self-destructive behaviors immediately. Excessive alcohol consumption is a good example of a dangerous behavior to cut out of your life.
Replace these with healthy and beneficial outlets for your feelings. If you are under stress, try reacting with an activity such as physical exercise or peaceful meditation.

, If your nightmares have repetitive elements or happen frequently, you can use imagery rehearsal therapy to rewrite your bad dreams. Follow these steps to take control of your nightmare:If you have a recurring nightmare, write it down in detail.
Make any changes you want with your nightmare or write an entirely new dream that you want to have. For example, if you encounter a monster in your nightmare, try changing it into a kitten.
Before bed, and throughout the day, imagine your new dream with the changes you made. Visualize the new narrative and remind yourself that this is how the dream is now.
Be confident that this new dream is the one you will experience instead of the old nightmare.

Articulate your dream again.,
Create reminders.,
Express your dream frequently.,
Create deadlines and punishments.,
Keep your life.,
Do not overlook life's small joys while searching for the big ones.,
Brainstorm ideas for your dream.,
Be inspired.",How to Keep a Dream Alive," (If you have not already made a plan for it, read How to Make Your Dreams Come True). Forget about your plan, or how much effort has already been put into it. What exactly is it that you want? Is it a general idea, like knowledge, or is it something specific, such as making a candy shop? Understand what you want, otherwise you may realize you don't want this dream, or even worse, realize you don't want it after you've succeeded in making it true.;
, Think about your original motivation often. Besides obvious factors that will come along when your dream is realized, think about other reasons. Who are you doing this dream for? Remind yourself often of your plan. Physical symbols always help - posting up pictures of the end result, buying items that symbolize your goals.

, Whisper your dream through moonlight. Shout it on a busy highway. Write it on a balloon and set it free. Write it on paper boats and float them in the ocean. Write it as a message on a bottle and float that into the ocean. Explore and try different ways of different cultures of making wishes come true, small or big: paper cranes, shooting stars, 11:11. Tell your pet if you have one. Tell it to all the people you care about in your life.

, For every step along the way, think of a realistic deadline. If too small, eventually you will be crashed with all the work you need and possibly never do it. If too large, you will probably forget about it. Punishments are necessary. They can be keeping yourself away from your favorite activities: depriving yourself of sex is always a good option! Get a friend or family member to enforce this punishment.

, Do not forget about friends, family, work, and especially yourself! Keep contact with friends and family: over the internet, visit them, write to them. Try not start skipping work to work on your dream. Keep your brain, body, and soul in good shape at all times. Sleep often, read often, and enjoy life.

, Look at the sky often. Think about memories. Take some time off to travel, take a picnic, enjoy some hobbies. Help, give, care about other people. Eat delicious things, go to concerts, literally smell the roses. Always consider: are you happy?

, Mind mapping (essentially creative concept mapping) is the ideal way to brainstorm. Any creative outlet will do just fine to find some creative ideas for your dream, especially writing or drawing. Any sort of art, even singing, playing music, photography, wood-carving can work. Buy a journal or two. Find inspiration.

, Read, read, read about anything and everything about your dream. Aim to take a trip to your library every week. Go to events pertaining to your dream. Talk to people who have accomplished your dream. Watch thought-provoking shows or movies (Code Geass is highly recommended). Find new ways of looking at the world. If your dream is creating a place, go to existing places and note its positive and negative attributes.

Sleep face down.,
Try eating certain foods before bed.,
Scare yourself slightly before going to bed.,
Consider taking vitamin B6.,
Try taking melatonin.,
Take certain substances in moderation.",How to Induce Nightmares1," A study from Hong Kong Shue Yan University shows that people who sleep face down are more likely to have dreams about being tied up, smothered, and other nightmarish themes.Note that this may also increase the likelihood of erotic or sexual dreams, so you may not receive the desired effect.


If you cannot get to sleep on your stomach, the next most ""nightmarish"" sleeping position may be lying on your back, followed by lying on your left side.;
, While eating spicy, salty, or fatty foods are commonly believed to cause nightmares, scientists are divided over the exact effect of these substances. Some argue that the disruption of your sleep cycle may even slow down the onset of dreaming, potentially resulting in fewer dreams or nightmares. Others think they may increase dream intensity, at least in some people, and suggest that each person pay attention to his own body's response., Try watching a horror movie, playing a scary video game, or reading ghost stories before bed. If you have a specific fear or anxiety, look at images of it or simply lie in bed imagining a ""nightmare scenario."" Aim to make yourself only slightly scared or anxious. If you are terrified out of your wits, you are unlikely to fall asleep in the first place.

, While the effect of vitamin B6 on dreams is not thoroughly studied, many people swear by its ability to increase the vividness of dreams. One study suggests that it may be effective, either due to an effect on the dreaming process itself, or an enhancement of your ability to remember dreams.


Including vitamin B6 from both food and supplements, daily intake should not exceed 60 mg for children 9–13 years old; 80 mg for teenagers 14–18 years old; or 100 mg for adults 19 years or older., Some people report having more vivid or bizarre dreams when taking melatonin, which may give you a new dream experience even if they are not outright nightmares.At least one study supports this idea, suggesting that dreams involving transformations are especially likely to occur under melatonin.


Melatonin is typically taken in doses of 1–20mg, and rarely causes health problems. However, due to interactions with other medications, possible negative effects during pregnancy, and the chance of an allergic reaction, you may wish to consult a doctor before taking melatonin., Caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine can all disrupt your sleep cycle.This can potentially cause nightmares if taken in small quantities. However, ingesting any of these substances in too large a quantity can disrupt your sleep too much. Reduce your intake of these substances if you have difficulty falling asleep in the first place, if you wake up repeatedly in the night, or if you feel tired after waking up. These are all signs that you may be getting less restful sleep, which may reduce the amount you dream.


If you rarely or never consume these substances, the effect is likely to be more potent than you expect. It is not recommended that you begin taking these drugs solely to induce nightmares.

Choose calming music before going to bed.,
Use white noise.,
Use aromatherapy.Research shows that smells can impact a person’s mood, and so surrounding yourself with pleasing scents (such as lavender) can help you have good dreams, get over recurring bad dreams, and avoid insomnia.Fresh flowers and aromatic oils, for instance, can be used for this purpose.,
Get comfortable.To sleep well and have good dreams, you should be in a comfortable place and position.,
Avoid going to bed hungry.,
Try eating foods with tryptophan.,
Increase your intake of vitamin B6.,
Avoid stimulants and depressants.,
Avoid exercising near the time you want to sleep.,
Don’t work in bed or right before bed.If you attempt to do work when you should be trying to go to sleep, your brain will be too preoccupied.,
Destress.,
Use a dream journal.,
Try controlling the dreams you have.,
Reimagine bad dreams.",How to Have Good Dreams," Research shows that music can have an impact on dream content.For this reason, the music that you listen to several hours before bed can either improve or worsen your dreams. Choosing music that is calm, quiet, and repetitive may help you have good dreams.;
, Studies show that white noise can help induce sleep.If you sleep soundly, you may have better dreams. You can take advantage of white noise in several ways:


Small electric white noise generators are now available at many retailers. These produce sounds like static, ocean waves crashing, and forest noises, all at soothing volumes. Turn one on as you go to sleep to see if it helps you have good dreams.
You can also purchase or stream sound recordings of white noise.You can play these on a stereo set, computer, smart phone, etc. when you are trying to go to sleep, and reap the benefits of good dreams.
Some people also find that a fan turned on low provides a gentle level of white noise.

, In addition, you can light incense and/or scented candles as you are approaching your bedtime. However, you should be absolutely sure that you extinguish these before going to bed to avoid accidentally causing a fire in your sleep.

,


Choose whatever mattress, bedding, and pillows feel most comfortable to you personally.
Sleep on your side, if possible, rather than your back or stomach.
Control the temperature of the room so that it is cool (about 60 degrees Fahrenheit).If you do not have a way to set the temperature of the room, you can open a window or use a fan to cool it, or add another blanket to make your bed warmer.

, It is best not to eat a big meal right before bed.However, if you haven’t eaten enough, you might wake up hungry, creating a fitful sleep.If you need to, have a small snack before going to bed, such as a banana and a glass of milk.

, Numerous studies show that tryptophan (an amino acid) increases sleepiness and reduces the amount of time it takes a person to fall asleep.The human body uses tryptophan to help produce serotonin, which is believed to be important for healthy sleep. Thus, eating tryptophan-rich foods may lead to better, more lucid dreams. Such foods include:


Turkey
Chicken
Fish
Pumpkin seeds
Milk
Peanuts
Soy
Tofu

, This vitamin is important for a host of bodily functions. In addition, initial research shows that it is connected to the vividness of a person’s dreams.You can take a vitamin B6 supplement to make sure you get enough of it, or eat more foods that are high in this vitamin, including:Banana
Avocado
Beans
Beef
Pork
Nuts
Poultry
Corn
Whole grains
Fortified cereals and breads

, If you are trying to have good dreams, avoid coffee, caffeinated sodas, nicotine, and other stimulants. The effects of these stimulants can make it hard to sleep well.Similarly, you should avoid depressants like alcohol. While they may initially make you feel drowsy, they may disturb your sleep and prevent good dreams.

, Getting regular exercise is good for your overall health, may reduce your stress levels, and can help you sleep at night. However, exercise has a stimulating effect, so you should not engage in strenuous activity near your bedtime. Otherwise, you may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, which can ruin your chances of having good dreams.Exercise three hours or more before your bedtime, for best results.

, This can disrupt your sleep, and make it harder to have good dreams. For best results, keep separate places for sleeping and working.

, If your mood is off when you are trying to go to sleep, then more than likely your dreams will suffer. In general stress can disturb sleep and dreaming.Don’t argue before bed, go to bed angry, or work on stressful things like taxes or big work/school projects right before bedtime.If you have to deal with something stressful, try to do so well before your bedtime, so that you have time to relax and prepare your mind for good dreams. In addition, you can try any of the following methods to relieve stress before going to bed:


Yoga
Meditation
Breathing exercises

, Get into the practice of writing down your dreams within 5 minutes of waking up. Experts believe this is the length of time a person typically has before forgetting dreams.


Starting a dream journal may also improve your dream memory recall, making dreams more satisfying.If you get in the habit of recording your dreams, you are more likely to remember them.

, Some research shows that you can influence the dreams you have.This means that if you want to dream about something, you may be able to make this happen just by thinking about it as you drift off to sleep. When you wake up, immediately think about whether or not you dreamed of what you wanted to.


If you are just trying to have good dreams in general, start thinking about various places, activities, etc. that make you feel good. Keep these in mind as you fall asleep.
If you are trying to dream of a particular person or place, start to visualize the person or place as you fall asleep.
If you are trying to solve a problem or puzzle in your dreams, find a way to visualize it. For example, if you need to write something, try to image a blank piece of paper and pen, and yourself beginning to write, as you fall asleep. As you sleep, you might dream about how to write what you need to. When you wake up, immediately write down the thoughts you had in your dreams.

, If you have had a lot of nightmares or bad dreams, you can try rehearsing new dreams when you are awake. In other words, you should imagine a new ending where your bad dream becomes a good dream.This is a technique known as imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT).Over time, it can help reduce the anxiety the thought of bad dreams can cause, and make you more prepared to have good dreams.


For example, if you have a recurring dream in which you fall a great distance, imagine that you have wings and can fly. That way, the fall won't be a problem.
Likewise, if you have dreams about being chased down a dead-end alley by a herd of zombies, imagine that there is a door at the end of the alley so that you can escape.

Understand what Lucid Dreaming is.,
Set up the basics.,
Remember self-control.,
Get used to your song.,
Reach a 60 minutes playlist and your highest possible volume.,
Enjoy.,
Optional: Once your mind has gotten used to all the steps, you can experiment with replacing no more than 25-50% of your songs at a time and adding more energetic, aggressive or emotional songs (the ones you should avoid when setting up the basics).",How to Lucid Dream with a Personal Soundtrack," This means you should not only get used to the idea of full control of the reality in your dreams and the idea of dreams not being fixed state, but also getting excited about those ideas. This will increase the likelihood of success, as Lucid Dreaming becomes a highly desirable state your mind want to go to.


Learning how dreams themselves work will further increase your chances, by making your mind sensitive to spotting dream logic. This is done through Reality Checking, which should be practiced while awake.;
,


Choose a song you like. Make sure it's not too energetic or too relaxing, but find a balance between the 2, while sticking to songs with personal meaning, memories or generally something you'd instantly recognize.
Get a computer or smartphone to automatically play the song on a very low volume, starting the chosen song at either 4 1/2, 6, or 7 1/2 hours after falling asleep. Finding the right level of volume can be hard, but aim for something quiet enough to not wake you up, yet loud enough so you'll hear it.
This is a trial and error step, so while it might not work the first couple of time, don't give up. Writing down what might have gone wrong can help.
Use the song to wake you up in the morning, at a high volume. That way the song is automatically associated with wakefulness.

, The first couple of times, you're likely to get excited about having reached the state of Lucid Dreaming and while this is understandable, it'll most likely wake you up. To avoid this until your mind has gotten used to balance itself, without needed conscious self, try to:


Spin your body, rub your hands together or fall backwards. This is theorized to cause your mind to spend so much brainpower on recreating the physical sensations, that it's too busy to wake up.
Shout your name, the phrase, ""I want to keep dreaming"" or a personal mantra. Like the previous, brainpower is likely used to comprehend your language or if some theories are correct, it convinces your subconscious mind to stay asleep.
Fold your hand like you're praying, but keep pushing your fingers towards your wrist, causing your fingers to painlessly and seamlessly pass through your palms. This can be extremely freaky and might wake you up, but is by far the most effective method when it works, since the brain spends so much brainpower simulating and experiencing this completely new sensation, that it won't wake at all.

, Once you're used to it, start increasing the volume as your tolerance to music increases and start putting together a playlist.


Do this slowly over a few weeks so your mind won't be shocked awake, by only adding 2-5% of volume a week and one song every 5-7 days.
Don't despair if it wakes you up completely. Just try to fall asleep without turning off the music. This will help building tolerance, wakefulness association and can directly induce a lucid dream.

,


Don't exceed 60 minutes, as REM sleep won't last for more than 60 minutes.
Use it for a few weeks and then set the playlist to random to mix it up.

, Now you've got a movie soundtrack for your dreams, with a ~90% success rate of inducing Lucid Dreaming.

,


This will provide variety and allow you to plan the perfect soundtrack for the kind of experience you want.

Non-specific romantic music for romantic dreams, lively music for action, relaxing music for unwinding, jazz for 1920s time travel, electronic music for sci-fi, erotic music for sexual/adult dreams etc.
Movie soundtracks for reliving your favorite movie (and sequels) with you as the puppet master dictating how you want the dream to play out, you as the main character or whatever you'd like.

Talk about your dreams.",How to Get Vivid Dreams," Your ability to recall dreams vividly will improve considerably if you're falling asleep and waking up at the same times roughly each day. It can be tough to make a solid routine work against a busy life schedule, but it will help boost the potential of your REM cycles.Dreaming occurs during the REM cycle of sleeping.;
, Melatonin is widely recognized as an ingredient that promotes healthy sleep and vivid dreaming.Melatonin supplements are commonly recommended as a way for people to get better sleep if it's something they struggle with. It's recommended you take one half an hour before going to bed each night in order to ensure your best possible sleep.


Melatonin can be found naturally in certain foods. Cherries, sunflower seeds, flax seeds and almonds are a few of the go-to foods with a high melatonin supply.

, The act itself of contemplating dreaming may encourage dreams once you fall asleep. The simple act of reading this wikiHow article may set the stage for dreaming. Having thoughts of vivid and lucid dreaming can help you think about the consciousness and experience of dreaming. This is a big help if you're trying to dream lucidly.


As a general rule, the most vivid dreams you have will be lucid. This is not because lucid dreams are naturally more vivid, but because lucid dreams are more easily remembered.

, Throughout the day, you should take a minute to stop and ask yourself whether you're dreaming or not.This is called a reality check, and making a habit of this thought can help increase lucidity while you dream. Make a point of doing it at different times throughout a day before you intend on dreaming.

, There's a lot to suggest that the best sleeps for dreaming are the ones where there's little to no distraction in your surroundings. This includes making sure your sleeping space is relatively dark, and hopefully seeing to it that you won't be woken up by anything unexpected. Of course, it is difficult to ensure anything while you're asleep for several hours at a stretch, but doing what you can to make your sleeping space comfortable and clutter free can help you with dream recall.

, Although total quiet works best for some people while sleeping, vivid dreamers often report having the best dreams while listening to music. The music should be ambient. That way, your higher order brain functions won't be so distracted by what's happening in the music. There are certain musical works that are specifically intended for sleep and lucid dreaming. Robert Rich's six hour Somnium is a good piece of ambient music for dreaming.Max Richter's eight hour-long Sleep is another piece that may improve the vividness of the dreams you have while listening to it.

, Most sleep cycles are similar, and you may be able to predict at what point you'll be at this stage. Try setting your alarm clock to go off 4.5, 6, or 7.5 hours after you go to sleep. This will rouse you awake at a point where the dream is either happening or still fresh in your mind.


Some people find the annoying sound of an alarm distracts them from remembering. If you aren't having luck with an alarm, try waking up without an alarm.If you'll be sleeping around someone who will be awake during one of your REM stages (such as a roommate), you could ask that they wake you up instead of an alarm.
Light-based alarms will wake you up with light rather than sound. This is generally a gentler way to wake up, and may make it easier to recall your dreams., Without reining in on details, the memory of the dream becomes clouded, and large chunks of information are lost. If you're in a room with a clock for example, try to look in on the clock and check the time. Many people actually report specific times on a clock being jumbled and unclear. Even if this doesn't give you a clear bit of info, the experience of seeing something off-beat like this will help you to become more lucid.


Even if you aren't able to actively recall this step while you're dreaming, thinking about doing it a lot while you're awake should increase your chances of making it happen while you dream.

, The hunt for dream signs (repeatable signs that indicate you're dreaming) involves recording after you wake up as much as a keen eye during the dream. Although you won't identify these signs easily at first, the more you get into a habit of actively dreaming, the more often you'll be able to experience these dreams.


Dream signs include contorted mirror, and the experience of one's teeth falling out.

, Lucidity happens when the dreamer realizes he is dreaming. This happens because the dreamer has consciously reminded himself that he's in a dream. This can be a scary or pleasant realization depending on what you're feeling. If you're having a lucid dream, it's more likely that you'll remember the dream in greater detail. This will result in a more vivid memory of the dream.


Reminding yourself you're dreaming won't be easy unless you have experience and knowledge of your dream signs already.

, Dreams are a very personal experience, and a lot of the necessary research is going to have to be done by you alone. By recording a dream journal, you'll be able to look back in weeks and months of past dreams and remember them more clearly.More importantly, by getting into a regular habit of writing down your dreams, you're training your mind to better recall your dreaming.


Writing your dream interpretation can happen in the morning once you write down the dream, or later on once you've had some time to collect your thoughts.
It's important to do this as soon as possible after you wake up. The longer you go without it, the more likely you are to forget the dream. This is why it's recommended to keep a notepad next to your bed for this purpose.

, Although dreaming may not be the first thing that's normally on your mind when you first wake up in the morning, reminding yourself every morning to do this will eventually catch on.


Even if you're not able to catch all of the dream's events at once, getting the basic idea of it remembered at the start of your day will make it possible to remember smaller details throughout the rest of your day.

, Once you've made a log citing the details and memories of a given dream, it may help to analyze it and give an interpretation. Dreams often have some bearing on feelings you have toward you waking life. It can be very therapeutic to look at these dreams and try to determine what you felt and why you felt it.

, There are a lot of dream journals and similar outlets that offer concrete explanations for different images and icons in dreaming. Much of this is based in Freudian pseudoscience, and should be taken with a grain of salt. In matter of fact, you should try to decide what certain symbols mean to your own psyche. A cat, for example, may be seen as cute by one person, and terrifying to another. Look at dream dictionaries if you're curious, but don't take them for any absolute truth.Check out a few different dream journals if you're interested in broad interpretations and check if the interpretations match.

, Memories become more solid when they're shared with other people. If you've had a dream about something you're comfortable with sharing with someone close, it's recommended you let them in on it. Try to recount all of the things you still remember from it.


Don't feel guilty or judged for whatever you've dreamt. No one can help the things they dream about, and it's better to open up than to clam up about things that may be bothering you on a subconscious level.

Learn the main causes of nightmares.,
Discover other causes of nightmares.,
Examine your nightmares for repetition.,
Learn the differences between bad dreams, nightmares and sleep terrors.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Get Rid of Bad Dreams2," Nightmares occur in both adults and children. Despite being a dream, nightmares are a real symptom of something that needs addressing in your waking life. The two main causes of nightmares are:Stress.
Major life event, such as the loss of a loved one or trauma.

, Beyond the two main causes of nightmares, stress and trauma, there are a multitude of additional potential causes. Examine the following possible causes of your nightmares to see if any of them are applicable to your situation:


A new drug prescribed by your healthcare provider. Certain medications could cause nightmares as a side effect. Interactions with existing prescriptions and any new medications could also be responsible. Ask your doctor about any new prescriptions and if they may be responsible for your nightmares.
Drinking too much alcohol. Alcohol consumption can cause nightmares by interrupting deeper levels of sleep, when dreams often occur. Reduce alcohol consumption to improve sleep quality and reduce the frequency of nightmares caused by heavy alcohol usage.
Eating just before going to bed. When you eat before bed, your metabolism increases, keeping you awake and preventing you from having deep, restful sleep. Avoid any snacks before bed to sleep better and lower the chances of having a nightmare.
Illness with a fever. Being ill, especially with a fever, can interrupt sleep patterns and cause nightmares. After you recover from the fever or illness, your nightmares should reduce in frequency. If they do not, talk with your doctor and look for another possible cause together.
Stopping certain prescriptions. Ending your usage of a prescription, with a doctor's order, can be responsible for nightmares. If you are experiencing nightmares after ending a prescription, ask your doctor if this may be responsible and what to expect as you end the medication.

, Your nightmares may have common elements or will be exact repeats of previous nightmares. If you have the same nightmare consistently there may be unique causes behind this type of nightmare. The two main causes repeating nightmares are:


Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 71% to 96% of those with PTSD have been found to have may have nightmares.PTSD is caused by a terrifying event, either witnessed or undergone directly.Severe anxiety or depression. Suffering from either severe anxiety or depression can cause repetitive nightmares. Work with your doctor, therapist, or counselor to help reduce your anxiety or depression, which will in turn help to stop your nightmares.

, Bad dreams, nightmares, and sleep terrors are considered to be different events. They all have their own characteristics, and knowing which one you are experiencing, can help you to gauge what level your nightmares are at.Bad dreams are unpleasant dreams and they do not awaken you.
Nightmares have the images and sounds of a dream, and are so terrifying that you awaken.
Sleep terrors have no images or dreams, only an extreme feeling of terror and sometimes sleep paralysis.

, Your doctor may be able to provide a prescription, or recommend an over-the-counter sleep aid, to help you combat your nightmares. Medications for nightmares are not for everyone, and may only work in certain cases. Some of the more common over-the-counter sleep aids are:Melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone that is produced by your body and it controls your sleep-wake cycle. Effects may be mild but melatonin should increase the likely-hood that you will fall asleep easier. Melatonin may cause headaches and daytime sleepiness as side effects.
Doxylamine succinate (Unisom Sleep Tabs). Doxylamine is an antihistamine and has a sedating effect. You may notice side effects such as daytime drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and urinary retention.
Valerian. Valerian is a plant that is used as a sleep aid. Studies are divided as to its effectiveness. There are generally no side effects when using Valerian.
Diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Unisom SleepGels, others). Diphenhydramine is another antihistamine with a sedating effect. The drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine can help you to fall asleep. Pay attention to side effects such as daytime drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and urinary retention.
Sleep aids may leave you feeling tired and groggy during the day.
Medication interactions are possible with sleep aids. Side effects and safety are uncertain with many sleep aids. Ask your doctor if sleep medications are right for you.

Improve your sleep.,
Tense and relax your muscles as you fall asleep.,
Make your bedroom a place for sleep only.",How to Get Rid of Bad Dreams3," Take actions to make the quality of your sleep improve. Poor sleeping habits can make nightmares more likely to occur. Take some of the following steps to help get a good nights rest:Get regular exercise. Exercise helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply.
Limit caffeine and alcohol. Both can reduce the quality of your sleep.
Make time for activities that you enjoy.
Practice meditation or relaxation techniques.
Have a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday.

, Start with your head and shoulders, tense and release those muscles. Work your way down your body, tense and release each area. Doing this has been proven to reduce the occurrence of nightmares by up to eighty percent.By tensing your muscle first, you allow for a deeper relaxation of it.
You can do this many times a day, in addition to right before bed.

, Don't do any other activities in your bedroom that would be counted as “waking” activities. By mentally establishing that your bed is a place for sleep and rest alone, you will be able to fall asleep more quickly and more deeply.


Avoid any activities, even simple ones such as reading or watching TV, while in your bed.
Only go to bed when tired and ready for sleep.

Think of a topic to dream about.,
Sleep for eight hours or more each night.,
Lie in bed after waking up.,
Write down your dreams to increase the odds of remembering them.,
Try to cause lucid dreaming.",How to Induce Nightmares2," As you fall asleep, try to think of an image or concept that causes fear or anxiety. If you attempt this every night, you have a good chance of dreaming about the subject of your thoughts. You may be able to make your dreams or nightmares beneficial if you have a problem to solve that is causing you anxiety; your brain may continue to ""work on"" the problem while you sleep, possibly providing insight during a dream., While inducing a nightmare on a given night may be helped by moderate sleep disruption, repeating that day after day may greatly reduce the number of dreams you have. Stay well-rested, and you will spend more time in the deeper, restful REM period of sleep, in which most lengthy dreams occur.


REM is short for Rapid Eye Movement, which describes the behavior of people sleeping during this period of sleep.

, Instead of getting up immediately, lie awake and try to remember or ""replay"" your dreams. If nothing comes to mind, try to examine your own emotions.If you wake up anxious or exhilarated, focusing on those feelings may help you remember a nightmare.

, Every human dreams each time they fall asleep for an extended period of time, but many of these dreams go unremembered.Try to write your dreams in a notebook by your bed as soon as you wake up, before you forget them, to help them stick in your memory. Write down any dreams you remember, not just your nightmares, as the habit may help you remember later dreams.

, In a lucid dream, the dreamer is aware that she is dreaming. This often results in a more vivid or memorable dream, and sometimes, but not always, allows the dreamer to shape the course of events to some extent. While there are many ways to encourage lucid dreaming, you can start with two simple steps:


Focus on the concept of dreaming as you fall asleep, or about a particular topic to dream about. Choose the same topic each night for at least two weeks.
Look for ""reality checks"" during the dream and your waking hours. Many people find that clocks or text in dreams can't be read clearly, or will look different each time. Try checking the time or reading a sign throughout the day as a ""dream check,"" and you may notice yourself doing the same thing to identify that you are dreaming.

"
"
Remind yourself of your intentions.,
Continue to repeat your intention as you slowly drift back to sleep and you will be astonished by the results.

,
Direct your attention.,
Enter your lucid dream.,
Stay in the right state of mind.",How to Have a Visually Induced Lucid Dream (Vild)," After a long day, before you retire and go to bed, remind yourself of your intention to wake up during an early arousal period of REM sleep.


We all have these periods every night, whether we are aware that we’ve woken or not. This has been proved exclusively through EEG measures of the brains activity during sleep.
These moments actually served a purpose for our more primitive ancestors who had to awake momentarily in the face of danger multiple times a night.
Two alternatives to setting your intention are by fumbling with an early morning alarm or drinking an abundance of water prior to sleep. Both of these methods are not as effective as the first, since they may keep you awake for a longer period of time than is desired.
Also, if your body naturally wakes up, you will feel a lot less fatigued than you would with a forced awakening. The goal is to not be too aware that you won’t be able to relax, but aware enough to focus your attention one-sidedly on your thoughts.;
,, Once you have awoken, either naturally or forcefully, you must instantly direct your attention to your thoughts.


Depending on how early you have awoken, you will probably feel an intense desire to just return to sleep and continue on through the natural cycle of sleep. Avoiding this urge is completely necessary with any type of WILD attempt, as you may find yourself drifting off again just as easily as you’ve awaken.
The only way to combat this is by bringing your attention to your mind and simply observing its intrusive nature or monotonous dialogues. Simultaneously try to relax the muscles of your body by lightly tensing and feeling the heaviness of the discrete parts of the body.
As you are continuously watching your mind, you may notice that you become so absorbed with your thoughts that you have completely forgotten your intention of inducing a lucid dream. This is one of the most common hurdles with any Mind Awake- Body Asleep technique in the field of lucid dreaming.
When you reach this phase, the most crucial adjustment you will have to perform is to gently redirect your mind to your thoughts, so that you become the observer again instead of the participator.
Under no circumstances should you become upset for indulging so easily into your thoughts or else you will just cause the problem to inevitably worsen. This will maintain your alertness as you gradually enter a deep state of relaxation.

, Eventually, you will be able to intentionally direct your thoughts so that you will become a part of them and enter your first lucid dream. In simpler terms, you must change your perception of the thought by changing it from an image into a full-sound physical reality that you will often experience in real life.


This step is achieved by obsessively focusing on one particular thought and not allowing any contradictory ones to enter your mind. Begin to incorporate all your senses within the thought, but do not force the sensations to occur, let them linger for a while.
When you have just about fallen back asleep, your thought will take on a life of its own to the point where you don’t even need to imagine it anymore. You are not the creator of the thought, but the participator in a scene exactly connected to the one that you were just contemplating about.
It is challenging not to become too excited at this point since you will marvel at the bewildering works of the brain and how they can construct the precise reality that you have imagined.

, Since the experience is short lived, you must remain in the right state of mind instantly.


Make sure to perform a reality check, then feel free to run around the confines of your thought induced dream world. Once the short dream period has ended, don’t move as you are likely to enter another one in about thirty seconds time.
Replace yourself into the original thought and allow your senses to be naturally integrated into the scene again. You may continue to do this until you have gotten bored or have simply lost interest.
To influence the dream surroundings, just simply use the same facet of your mind that you took advantage of to enter the dream in the first place.
So, if feel compelled to fly, just imagine yourself doing so and believe it will happen, since it most likely will.

If you are struggling with dream control, it may be helpful to just put it aside or announce what you want to happen out loud. Start with something basic, such as colours, and then incrementally work your way up the ladder in your next VILDs until you have achieved full dream control. Once you’ve reached this stage, you are ready to move onto more advanced dreams, such as DILDs or full-blown WILDs. Hopefully, your control and confidence will transfer nicely in your more vivid types of dreams.

Use their name.,
Write a simple greeting.,
Tell them some basics about yourself.,
Mention how you found them.,
State a specific purpose you have for writing.,
Write a closing.",How to Write to a Pen Pal for the First Time1," You don’t need to repeat their name a bunch of times throughout the letter, but definitely use their name specifically in the greeting. You might also mention their name one other time later on in the letter.


You should also mention your own name early on in the letter, even though it may already be on the envelope. This way you complete the introduction and greeting.;
, Before you get into the main content of the letter, take a little bit of time to say hello, mention you are excited to be writing, and wish them well. You could write, “How are you doing today?” or “I hope this letter finds you well.” or “ It’s nice to meet you through letters!”A greeting helps the reader transition into the letter rather than immediately diving into all the details you plan to share with them. Think of the letter as a conversation, except that for now you are the only one talking. You wouldn’t start a conversation with immediately telling some a bunch of information without greeting them first.

, Age, sex, and location (not necessarily your address) are a good place to start because these give the person an idea of who you are. You can expand from this point by mentioning things like your grade or occupation, who is in your family, and a couple characteristics about you, like you enjoying laughing, you hate math homework, or your religious affiliation.Your first letter is an introduction, so treat it as such. What would you tell a person you just met? Tell your pen pal those same things.
Remember to be safe if you are young, or even a teenager. Talk to your parents before writing and especially before revealing personal information.

, You most likely used a pen pal service or forum of some sort, so it is always good to tell the person where you got their information from. You could also include at this point whether you have written to other people, how long you have been using this service or mention why you chose them to write to.If you saw specific information in their profile that made you want to write to them, you could mention that and tell why it sparked your interest. Tell them what your relationship to that thing is and ask them to tell you more about it.

, You may be seeking a pen pal for a specific reason, like learning a new language or learning about a new culture, so tell the person this. Maybe you are just looking for someone to talk to, or you are moving into a new stage in life and want some encouragement. It can be good to let the person know your intentions for your relationship.


Don’t come on too strong by telling them you are really lonely and just need someone to listen. Even if you feel that way, telling them will probably make them uncomfortable and they may not write back to you.

, You have tons of options for how to close a letter, but for pen pals it is good to thank the person for their time reading your letter. You don’t necessarily want to end the letter by saying, “Please write back,” or “I look forward to hearing from you,” as this may make them feel obligated. Simply thank them for taking the time to read your letter and tell them to have a nice day.Be sure to sign your name at the end.

"
"
Look for some common ground.,
Ask a couple of questions.,
Tell them what a typical day looks like for you.,
Include an interesting scrap of paper.",How to Write to a Pen Pal for the First Time2," In many cases, you want to have a pen pal that has some common interests, so share a few things that you really enjoy and ask if they also like those things. To keep it simple for the first letter, you could mention broad interests like, “I enjoy outdoor activities,” or “I like going to events like concerts and plays.”You can be specific as well by mentioning the bands you life, parks you visit, or telling of an event you visited, but have a mix of general likes and specific likes.

, For a first letter, it is great to give the reader a few specific points that you would be interested in learning about them. This gives them a little bit of a head start for their first letter back to you. Don’t get too personal for the first letter like, “What is the worst thing that has ever happened to you?” Stick with something simple like “What do you like to do on weekends?”A fun option can be including a small questionnaire that you’ve written up that has questions and blanks for the person to write their answers. This could have some questions like “What is a book you like?” or “What’s a favorite food you have?” They don’t have to be serious or meaningful, they could be silly questions like “What animal would you want to be?”

, When you choose a pen pal, there’s a good chance you will have somewhat different lives, especially if they are in another country. Giving them an idea of what you do most days reveals some of your experiences to them.This also gives them something to write back to you telling their own experiences.
If the person is in another country, you could tell them you have wondered if kids in their country do the same stuff that you do. It will build a feeling of companionship between you. It also gives them the chance to tell you about their day, which could surprise you by being really similar or really different.

, Something to add a little flavor to the letter is to include a magazine clipping, a picture that you drew, a scrap with a quote you like written on it, a copy of a poem, or a picture of something you like. You can get really creative with this step. Almost anything would add to the letter.You don’t even have to say anything in the letter about what you include. It could be something that adds a little mystery to the letter and makes the person want to write back to find out what it’s all about.

"
"
Share photos with each other.,
Become more personal.,
Send gifts.,
Talk about the big questions.",How to Write to a Pen Pal for the First Time3," After you have written a few letters back and forth, it can be a fun addition to share some photos of yourself and ask for photos of the other person. You could send a basic photo that you had professionally taken for school or something spontaneous, like a photo from a vacation you took.


You might also share a photo of your house, some places you enjoy going around your town, a picture of your school, or copies of pictures from places you have visited.
Besides pictures of yourself and places you go often, you could share pictures of favorite bands or movies, scenic shots of places you want to visit some day, or pictures of something you’ve created or drawn.

, Once you have gotten to know some basic information about each other and have been writing long enough to feel comfortable probing deeper, start to ask more personal questions. Find out what types of hardships the person faces in life. Ask them what some of their ultimate dreams and goals are. You can also begin to share more intimate details about your own life. Perhaps share some fears you have or tell them about trials you have faced.


One of the benefits of a pen pal relationship is that you are most likely not to meet in person, or at least not until you have been writing for a long time. Because of this, you can feel more comfortable sharing personal things than you might with someone you see often.

, Besides just writing letters to each other, you can begin to send gifts on occasion, like holidays or birthdays, or just any time. For pen pals in other countries, you could send a toy or trinket that is common to your country. You could share non-perishable foods with each other you both may not have experienced.


This might be something to talk about in your letters before you send anything. You want to make sure it is okay with the person to receive gifts from you.

, One way to build a strong relationship with a pen pal is to discuss some of the deep things you think about. You could ask the person what they think about destiny and tell them your beliefs. You could tell them about something in society that makes you really sad and tell them what you wish would change. Eventually your letters will probably progress beyond the mundane aspects of your life, and this is when you will grow a true friendship with your pen pal.

Look for friends in your neighborhood.,
Sign-up for an after school activity or community service.,
Sign up for a club.,
Sign up for camp.,
Work part-time.,
Try the internet.There are lots of ways to meet new friends online, including forums, interactive games, social media, etc.,
Introduce yourself.When you meet someone new, it’s important to start with a good introduction.,
Start a conversation with someone.Talking with people is the next step to forming friendships.,
Keep in touch.When a conversation with a person you just met is ending, and you’d like be friends, make sure to exchange some form of contact information.,
Be a good listener.,
Plan some pressure-free ways of hanging out.If you’re shy or have trouble forming friendships, plan activities that take up time without putting too much pressure on you to talk constantly.,
Get help if you need it.If you’re having real trouble figuring out how to make new friends or talk to people, don’t be afraid to ask your parents, current friends, or other trusted people for help.",How to Make Friends Outside of School," Sometimes new friends are just around the corner, so you can start by making friends from your neighborhood. If there are any people in your neighborhood that are around your age, introduce yourself to them. Invite them to play a game, hang out, etc.


You can even help set up a community group in your neighborhood.Parents and adults can help out, too. The neighborhood group can host block parties, start a community garden, volunteer for good causes, etc. It’s a great way to make new friends!;
, If you are looking for friends outside of school, then make good use of your afternoon and weekend time by picking up a new community activity, or volunteer for service. This is a way to meet people from outside of your school, who could become your friends. Examples of activities include:Sports (not based at school—try a local recreation center or YMCA)
Religious groups
Community organizations (animal shelters, community gardens, neighborhood watch, etc.)

, Many cities have clubs and interest groups that aren’t based in schools. Since these bring diverse people together, they can be great opportunities to make non-school friends. For example, you might be able to join:4-H
Scouts
A club based on a hobby (gardening, knitting, chess, programming, etc.)Music
A music group (a community orchestra, choral group, choir, or band)
An art club
A book club

, Summers between school years can be a little isolating if you don’t have a lot of friends outside of school. By taking part in a summer camp, however, you’ll have the opportunity to meet lots of new people, and make new friends.


There are lots of different kinds of camps, ranging from ones that feature on outdoor activities, to ones focused on religious groups, to ones that foster academic enrichment.
If you’re interested in signing up for a camp, ask your parents for permission and help.

, Getting a job is not just for making money—it’s also potentially a way to make friends. If you’re in school, you might not be able to get any job, and you will have to work part-time, but getting a job can still be an opportunity.Once you find one, connect with any coworkers of your age or that share your interests, and start forming friendships.

, However, it is important to find a balance between your online and offline time and friends. You should also be safe online. For instance:


Never give out personal information to someone you just met online.
Report any suspicious activity to your parents or a trusted adult.
If you feel uncomfortable, harassed, bullied, or endangered by what anyone says or does to you online, let your parents or a trusted adult know about it.

, Say “hello,” give your name, and ask the other person’s. If you repeat the person’s name when he or she tells you, you’ll be more likely to remember it.

, There are lots of ways to start conversations and small talk with other people, even if you don’t know of anything specific to talk about at first. Once things get started, just try to keep the conversation going naturally.


Offer a compliment, like “Hey, I really like that shirt!”
Ask lots of questions. This gives you and the other person something to say, and keeps the conversation moving. For instance, if you like a person’s shirt, you could follow up by asking “Where’d you get it?”
Listen carefully and respond to what the person says, so that you form connections. For instance, if someone tells you “I got this shirt at the mall—I shop there all the time” you could respond with something like “Me too! What are your favorite stores?”
It’s ok to keep initial conversations short so you don’t ramble, but if you seem to be hitting it off with a new person, let things flow.

, At that point, or later on, the two of you can suggest another time to meet up, hang out, talk, etc.


Regular, scheduled contact is the best way to form and maintain friendships. If you’re making friends with someone outside of school, make sure the two of you can spend some time together in the afternoons, evenings, or weekends.

, A friendship is a two-way street. While you might be looking to meet new people, once you make a friend, remember that you have a relationship. Your friend relies on you, too. Make sure to listen and respond to your friend, to show that you’re caring and supportive.


Take the time to hear about your friend’s interests, problems, etc. They might be different than your own, but learning from other people is part of building friendships!
If a friend wants to or needs to talk and you can’t, say that you will get in touch later—and follow up.
If you ever have to bail on a friend, apologize sincerely and take the initiative to set something else up.

, Anything that provides a topic or focused activity will give you and your friend something to talk about without causing pressure. Good options include:


Going to the movies
Watching a sporting event
Visiting the zoo, a museum, etc.
Playing a game

, You can even practice conversations with them until you feel more comfortable about making new friends.


Parents shouldn’t be in charge of your friendships, but they can help by connecting you to children of their friends."

Seek out people with the same interests as you and you are likely to get along.Do you love to draw? Register for an art class. Go to art shows. Look for people who are doodling during math class.
Do you love books? Join a book club. Go to public readings. Look for people carrying novels around with their text books.;
, You may be interested in befriending some of the most popular people in school, but if they are disrespectful to you, this is not a true friend. Finding someone who will treat you well and support you is more important than popularity.


You should feel comfortable acting like yourself around them.Being around the other person should make you feel good.You should feel like the other person supports and respects you., If you really get along with someone, set up a group event where they invite their friends. Your friend may have already done the work for you regarding finding people with similar interests and personalities.

, This totally contradicts the concept of making eye contact, but that comes later. Research shows that groups of people standing in a circle with their feet all pointing to the center are less likely to welcome a new member, but those who have their toes pointing out are more likely to welcome you to join them. It’s just wild enough to give it a try the next time you see groups of people chatting in the hall, at a party, or at a social event., You can find a club which matches your interests. If you really want to branch out and find new friends, consider stretching your current experience and trying something entirely new, like an intramural sport. Find out when they meet and attend the next event to inquire about joining.


You don’t have to be great at sports to play intramurals. These could be anything from soccer and flag football to frisbee ,golf and dodgeball. This is a great way to have a good time, get some exercise, and gain a whole new team of friends. Gather a group to make a team or join another team as a free agent.There are several clubs based on hobbies. These could encompass different electives at school, like theater or band. They can also span outside interests like knitting or gaming. Check in with your counseling office or student activities center to see what is available.
Academic clubs can bring together business-minded friends. These can include debate teams and different business-related organizations like public relations and entrepreneurs. Check with your instructor and ask them to point you in the right direction., Your school provides opportunities for you to gather and mingle with the rest of campus. Take advantage of these activities when they come up. The more often you cross paths with someone, the more likely you are to become friends with them simply due to constantly finding yourself in their company.Attend school dances, movie nights, and mixers.
Go see your school’s sports teams play and cheer them on with the group to make an instant bond.

, You may be completely unaware that you are creating a bubble around yourself. This can make it difficult for others to get to you. Break free from your own restrictions by making a few changes and putting yourself out there.


Take a different route to class. Your bubble can be blocking you in if you are always sticking to the same routine. Try taking a new hall to get to class and expose yourself to more people.
Sit with new people at lunch. This will give you a chance to engage with an entirely new group of people.

, Sometimes we are so involved with technology that we are not engaged with the people around us. Your new friends could be right in front of you.


Remove your headphones. If you are wearing headphones when you are walking around, no one is likely to engage you in conversation.
Put down your phone. While social media can seem like interaction, adding a virtual friend is not the same as a personal friendship. Get some actual face time with other people by simply putting down your phone and interacting with the world around you., Make eye contact with the other person, smile and try to seem warm and relaxed instead of nervous or anxious.Talk about whatever is going on around you.Keep your comments positive!


If there is music playing, try saying, “I love this song, don’t you?”
Choose something off your lunch plate that is tasty and mention how great of a job the cafeteria did today.

, This comes in handy in situations like sitting with a new group at lunch, or being surrounded by others at a sporting event. Interject when you hear something you can comment on, but avoid taking over the conversation. Consider asking a question of the entire group rather than just one person., Everyone likes to be appreciated. A great, friendly way to start a conversation is to let someone know that you like their style. Compliment them on a piece of clothing or the way they style their hair., Think of things that a lot of people like and use them as conversation starters. It is also useful to try open-ended questions to learn what interests they may have.


Ask about their favorite television shows. You may have one in common which will give you something to talk about.
Talk to the them about something that is trending on social media. If you keep seeing something pop up, they probably do too. Ask if they’ve seen it and what they think.

, Start moving from small talk to really getting to know them on a more personal level. Use open-ended question as opposed to “yes/no” questions. It may help to try using the 5 w’s: who, what, when, where and why.Ask who they know at a party.
Ask what books they are reading right now.
Ask when they have their lunch break.
Ask what they like to do on the weekends.
Ask why they decided to take this elective.

, While you can connect with them on social media, it is better to exchange phone numbers in order to connect in person. Offer your number before asking for theirs. Once they have your number, ask them to call or text you so that you have their number.


Text them when you want to invite them to do something or are checking in with them to see how they did on their test or if they won a game. Avoid texting too often, especially at the beginning of the friendship.
Call them sometimes. Making phone calls is becoming more rare now with texting, which makes a phone call that much more special.Texting is more casual, but a phone call is nice for a special occasion like a birthday, or checking in with them if they have missed several days of school.

, Once you have found some common interests, ask them if they would like to hang out after school sometime. Choose an activity you think you both would enjoy.


Ask for a recommendation of a restaurant in the area and see if they want to go for lunch or dinner with you.
If you are both into the arts, maybe there is a gallery, museum, play or band you could go see.
Invite them to a movie. If there is something you really want to see, ask if they would like to go with you. Plan to spend time together after the movie so you have a chance to talk about it. Coffee shops are a great place to sit and chat about the movie and anything else it made you think of.

, Smiling is an open invitation to other people. Respond to eye contact with a smile. We want to be around people who are happy. Simply smiling at someone can draw them to interact with you., Consider the way that you present yourself and whether it may be keeping some people at bay. Your clothing style and your posture can say a lot about whether you are open to meeting people.Pay attention to your body language. Looking down or away, or even crossing your arms and legs can make you appear closed off and deter people from talking to you.
Dress friendlier. If you wear a lot of dark clothes or dress particularly goth, you may be able to attract other goth friends. Others may see your dark clothing and make the assumption that you prefer to be left alone. Consider wearing brighter colored clothing. Not only will it make you seem more approachable, but it could actually effect your mood and make you happier., Friends should make us feel good. In order to really make a friend, you should be giving the same things that you would like to get. Practicing the golden rule is key to cultivating a compassionate, long-lasting friendship.Be available to them when they need you. Friendship should never be one-sided. Both people should be reaping the benefits. Make sure that you are giving as much to the other person as you are getting from them.Encourage the other person. Let them know that you believe in them and support their achievements in their school work and their life goals., Don’t be too clingy or expect too much of their time and attention. Be there for them when they need you and continue to extend invitations, but don’t be offended if they turn you down because they are busy or need some alone time.

, Other people likely have the same fears about approaching others and making friends. If someone else is new or seems shy, be the one to approach them and start a conversation or show them around.

, Some people are too busy to spend quality time with others. Schedule time with other people just like you schedule all of the other things on your to do list. Don’t rely on a last minute invitation. Make plans with in advance and stick to it.This will ensure that you are prioritizing friendship.

, One of the biggest obstacles to reaching out and making new friends is the fear that we will not be accepted. Try not to take it personally if someone does not accept your invitation. You will not want to be friends with everyone you meet either. Risk stepping out and being social and you will eventually find someone who is the right friend for you.Consider that the other person may be having a hard time right now and is not open to being friendly at the moment.Understand that the rejection may have more to do with who the other person is than it has to do with you., Low self-esteem often manifests as seeming withdrawn, anti-social and a poor communicator.If you believe that people don’t like you or you are awkward and weird, social situations may seem really scary. Challenge the negative voice inside your head and acknowledge that you may be being too hard on yourself.


Other people are just as concerned about themselves as you are. They probably aren’t thinking about you and judging you as much as you think, because they are preoccupied with themselves.Don’t focus on perfection. You don’t have to be perfect, you can just be good enough.Focus on your personal achievements instead of comparing yourself to others."
"
Get some confidence.,
Talk to someone and be friendly.,
Hang out with a random group of people.,
Just do it.,
You are you and don't let that change.,
Look the part.,
Be positive.,
Be clever, but not obviously.,
Be nice.,
Be neutral.,
Share a cookie or a loan and extra pencil.,
Be true to yourself.",How to Make Friends When It Doesn't Come Easily," You need to take a risk and just- put yourself out there. If you aren't that confident, just try put a smile on your face and be optimistic. Think that you can do anything- and that would show. Putting a smile on your face is an instant cure for depression and lack of self-confidence - after all, it is almost impossible to see a person smiling happily and feeling un-confident at the same time. Being optimistic improves your life all round, just think positively and try to always find a way to enjoy what you are doing. People like people who are confident and happy.;
, What's not to like about someone who likes you? Try making people happy - but stand up for yourself if you need to. Pretend you are a kind of story detective and that everyone you see has some kind of tragic and dramatic story. Start asking subtle questions and get interested in them. Saying a simple 'hi!' immediately gives people an impression of you being friendly.

, Just ask a random group of people (that you want to know better) whether you can hang out with them. You don't need to fear rejection, because if you think about it, even the meanest people can't reject you. You can do this anywhere and chances are, the people in that group will start to like you a lot. If you decide that you don't really like them after all, just select another group and do the same.

, If you can't open your mouth and talk, just force yourself. It will become easier after a while and shyness gets you nowhere. People can't read your mind; only talking with them gives them understanding of what you think.

, Be the best 'you' that you can be. Improve constantly whether in work, writing, good habits...Your friends are there to support you and make you even better and happier, not to change you.

, You don't have to be pretty, thin or the next Kate Moss, but you must be approachable. People will never want to be your friend if you shuffle around with a face like you've just eaten a lemon, with snot dripping down your nose, bags under your eyes, obscenely long fingernails that are black with dirt.


If you do have long fingernails and you refuse to cut them, wash them morning and night with soap and a nail brush. File them into a smooth shape, or they will look ugly and misshapen - and if there are rough edges, they will catch and either scratch someone (which stings like a paper cut), or catch on something solid and break. If you're particularly unlucky, both might happen.






Obviously, wash your face every day with warm water and a little facial wash.
Especially for girls, wash your hair at the very least twice a week. Washing it every day can remove it's natural oils though, so unless you splash out for special nourishing treatments, every other day should be sufficient.

, No-one wants to hang around you if you grumble and moan every minute of the day, muttering about doom and gloom, and how the whole world is ganging up on you. Even if the world is all after you, no-one will be interested. Everyone's favourite subject is themselves. Remember that: ask about things they know about, inquire as to their favourite books/films/colours, but don't talk about yourself all the time.

, You're probably in school if you're reading this article, so in class don't wave your hand for every question. People will call you a show off. If you get an A+, don't tell people unless they you ask, and don't go on about it. Just give them a modest smile, tell them your result and ask about theirs. Let them talk as much as they want, and nod. If they got a low grade, or seem disappointed, change the subject. If they need homework help and ask you, help them, but don't do it for them. That is another ""taking advantage of you"" sort of thing. Being intelligent will give you plenty to talk about.

, Most people are drawn to people who are pleasant because those people make them feel happy and good. Try not to criticize or judge anyone, be reassuring and most people would want to tell you things. Complement people if you think they do something well, because - if you have something nice to say, why not say it? This may seem obvious, but it really works. A smile, helping someone with homework, or letting them borrow something really puts you in their good books. Don't take rubbish though - if they take advantage of you, they are not a good choice for a friend. Don't be mean though, just turn your efforts to other, friendlier people.

, If you disagree with something, if it's something important - just voice it. Say it in a normal, cheerful way and don't make it personal. Don't attempt to argue, because that just ends two ways. The person feeling right and triumphant and the person feeling hurt and even more convinced that they're right. You lose in both ways, so just say your opinion and leave it. If the person argues, just say 'oh, okay' and move on to another subject.


Don't be very opinionated. If someone likes dogs, and you've just said something like: ""Dogs are so disgusting! I hate them - they're gross, lolloping pests that poo everywhere. People who like dogs are idiots!"" Especially if the person is popular, often their friends will side with them and ignore you. If you do make this mistake, apologise and explain if you've maybe had a bad memory with a dog attack (but DON'T lie!!!) or tell them you don't know much about dogs, and that's why you don't like them much. Change the subject ASAP.







, Ask to sit with someone nice at lunch. Be friendly and smile! Whatever you do, get out there and show the world that you're a nice person to be friends with!

, Don't make friends with popular people because they wear cool clothes and are popular. Do it because you like their character, and how they act toward everyone. Do they act mean towards others, but not towards you? People who are being picked on by these girls or boys could turn out to be really nice friends, so you may want to consider dropping out if they really aren't nice to anyone except for people in their club.

Experience new things together.",How to Make Friends With a Boy (Girls)," Ask mutual friends about the boy’s hobbies or favorite past times. Snoop on his social media to find out his favorite music, movies, and television shows. Pay attention to any sports he plays at school or when he is around friends.


For example, you may ask his mutual friends, “What is his favorite thing to do outside of school?” or “Can you tell me what his favorite television show is?”;
, Find him on social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Facebook. Follow him so you can get to know him better through social media. If he follows you back, this can help to build your friendship.You can also use social media to learn more about his interests as well as a direct line of communication. This may help you feel more comfortable with talking to him and help your friendship blossom.

, People are generally attracted to others with similar backgrounds and it will be easier for him to connect with you if he sees these similarities. Think about interests you have in common with the boy, such as a favorite television show or sport. Then, use these shared interests as icebreakers for your first conversations.For example, you may find out that you both like action movies. Or you may discover that you share a common interest in video games.
Do not pretend to like things the boy likes just to become friends with him. You will likely find at least one thing you have in common with him so you do not have to fake it.

, If you have not had a lot of interaction with him, you may feel more comfortable getting to know him within a group. If you have mutual friends, ask them to help facilitate an introduction when you’re all together.If you do not have mutual friends, you could consider becoming involved in a group or club that he attends. This will not only aid in increasing your interaction with him, but will also create an instant common ground that may feel more natural.

, When you are around the boy, try to project an open, friendly demeanor. Avoid aggressive body language such as clenching your fists and crossing your arms. Instead, maintain open body language by keeping your arms relaxed at your sides and smiling or nodding at him.When you chat with the boy, you should also maintain eye contact with him to show him you are engaged in what he has to say.

, Although it can be nerve-wracking, spending one-on-one time together is a great way to strengthen friendships. Decide on an activity that you will both enjoy and invite him to join. When you invite him, try to find a balance between being open and specific.For example, if you know he enjoys bowling, ask him if he would like to go bowling soon. Not providing an exact date allows for flexibility, while specifying the activity shows you have taken note of his interests and takes the pressure of planning off of him.

, Your brain associates positive experiences with good feelings, so try to keep your conversations and shared activities upbeat and fun. Soon, he’ll associate spending time with you with enjoyment and will want to spend more time with you., Do your best not to make promises you can’t keep. When making plans, try to choose a date and time that you know you can keep. Keep in touch and be communicate with him consistently. Failing to do so may make you seem “flaky” which, in turn, may make him feel that you don’t care about him., Once you are more comfortable, ask for his advice on a personal matter or consider disclosing personal experiences with him. Trusting him with personal matters can help bring an intimacy to your relationship that only the closest friends have.For example, you may have a one-on-one hang out with him where you tell him about issues you are struggling with at home or at school. You may tell him about how you find it hard to get along with your parents, for example, or that you are having trouble in a subject in school.

, Another way you can build a meaningful relationship with the boy is by being a good listener to him. Pay attention when he speaks to you and ask thoughtful questions to show him you are engaged. Maintain eye contact and nod when he speaks.


Try not to interrupt him when he speaks and encourage him to keep talking by saying, “Tell me more,” or ""I'm so interested in what you have to say.""
You can also ask thoughtful questions like, “How did that make you feel?” or “Why do you think you reacted in that way?”

, Show him that you can be a good friend by being trustworthy and upfront about what you think. If he tells you a secret or confides in you, tell him you will not tell anyone what he told you. Keep any personal information he tells you to yourself, unless he is okay with you sharing it with others. Trust can be difficult to earn and must be maintained, but it truly the foundation to all successful friendships. You should also try to be honest with him so he knows you are not pretending or lying to him. Tell him how you feel and what you think honestly and openly.

, Trying something new can be scary, but consider inviting him to participate. Not only will it help ease the anxiety associated with the unknown, but can also prevent your friendship from going stale.For example, if you’ve both never gone camping before, you may invite him to go with you so you can experience something new together.

Protect yourself before you begin chatting.,
Enter an interest on the title page.,
See if the stranger is using simulated or recorded webcam.,
Know when to leave the conversation.,
Do not ask for personal details like age and location at the beginning of the conversation.,
Have a long conversation before giving away any personal information.,
Verify their information before accepting friend requests.,
Continue the conversation with your new friend on other platforms.",How to Make Friends Through Omegle Video Chat," Update your antivirus software and firewalls so you don't have to worry about strangers sending virus or malicious software to you. Make sure you're dressed appropriately - err on the side of modesty if you're nervous - and make sure there is no personal information such as a phone number or full name visible in the background behind you, as this could be caught by your webcam while chatting.;
, Choose a genuine interest, but choose a fairly specific one like ""classical musicals"" or ""cross-country skiing."" Avoid general, ambiguous interests like ""movies,"" and never put anything even remotely sexual, as this will attract precisely the wrong kind of people.

, Omegle warns you if the stranger is using a simulated or recorded webcam, and most people who do this are some kind of troll or are otherwise untrustworthy. Instead, opt to chat with someone using an authentic, real-time webcam, as this will allow you to have an actual conversation and make friends.

, If the stranger swears or abuses you verbally, asks you to strip or perform a sexual action, offers to do so himself, or does so without asking, leave the conversation and report the user immediately. If anything they say makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, even if it's not explicitly abusive, leave the conversation immediately.

, If the person you're talking to is worth making friends with, chances are they'll also be worried about internet safety. Asking for (or giving) personal information like age and location can make you seem rash and suspicious. Instead, focus on getting to know them and having a casual conversation. If it goes well, you can trade contact information at the end of the conversation, so you don't need to ask for this information until then.

, Chat with them for a considerable amount of time - more than an hour - on Omegle Video Chat. Try to get to know them before becoming friends. Make sure there are no red flags during the conversation - make sure they seem like a normal, safe, reliable person. If at the end of the conversation you feel that you want to be friends with them, find another way to contact them. Give them your IM screen name, email address, or, if you really want to, your Facebook account. But be very careful before giving them your full name, and never give your address or phone number to someone you met online.

, If they want to connect on Facebook, take steps to make sure it's safe before accepting their friend request. Look through their pictures and recent statuses or other posts, and make sure everything looks safe and trustworthy. For example, they should have plenty of friends and pictures of them in various settings, with various other people. If you're trading screen names, do a quick Google search to see if anything suspicious pops up.

, Once you've determined that the other person is reasonably safe, take the conversation to another website, email, or chatting platform.

, Say: ""Hi, I'm ___. What's your name?"". That is simple enough. Pay attention and repeat back the name of the person you are meeting, and try to remember his or her name.

, Compliment what they're wearing, or comment on the weather. This sort of small talk is often good for getting people warmed up.

, Remember, you are just as strange to your new community as they are strange to you. A little self-expression and outward good humor can go a long way toward breaking down that barrier.

, Have a story or joke handy, or learn to make some simple gifts to hand around. Learn to make a cool paper airplane, a yarn doll, a friendship bracelet, or a friendship pin, or an interesting piece of origami. Bring in a favorite thing to share, such as a comic book. Food is also a good choice. Regardless of what you decide to share, it will help to open people up if you are willing to give something first.

, Listening to others is a good way to learn the community and start to understand the people in it. You may hear others talking about people who interest you. Ask if you can be introduced.


Jump into the conversation if you have something to add. Say, ""Hey, I notice you were talking about ___."" Then say what you have to say.







, These can be schools (your own or your children's), clubs, public classes, or events. You may need to ask around a little bit to find out where your new community posts local announcements.

, Ask around about sports teams, book clubs, volunteer organizations, and anything else that interests you. Having a common cause tends to unite people, and many organizations welcome new members.

, Find groups based on shared interests and form offline clubs in your local community.

, Probably people in your neighborhood are outdoors at some time during the day, perhaps in the afternoons when school is out. You won't meet new friends if you're just watching TV or at home in front of the computer, so get out there.

, Meet with one or two people at a time, or have a housewarming party or larger get-together.

, If you have children, that's another neat way to find other parents at your child's school or after-school activities. Very often schools send out e-mail directories of their students' contact information for playdates and birthday parties.

, If you have a dog, that's a wonderful ice-breaker. It is heart-warming to watch pet owners swapping stories while their dogs yap away at each other in their own lingo.

, Local friends can be found at your place of worship or work.

, Most libraries have book clubs, meditation classes and other fun activities for adults. Regular attendance at these events can definitely lead to some great friendships forming.

, Meet locals at the supermarket, box stores, etc. Go on to form friendships from there. Never underestimate the power of the Big Box Store to bring unexpected joy into your life, apart from savings and coupons!

, Volunteering is another way to meet people - ask your place of worship or your children's school if they need a pair of extra hands to help out events and they will gladly to take you aboard in these times of budget cutbacks. Area museums, hospitals, food banks, libraries, etc., also need volunteers and they provide orientation sessions for new volunteers. You might get free parking as a perk!

, Sometimes, that's all it takes to get people's attention or perhaps catch their interest, especially if you're from someplace distant or interesting.

, As soon as you start talking to somebody, be on the lookout for similar interests to yours. Does he like to listen to music? Who? Who's her favorite author? Do you play sports? It doesn't have to be an exact match, just common ground you can use to start a conversation.

, If you see someone who seems bored, lonely, or unhappy, ask what's up and whether you can help.


Be approachable. Others might just come to you.






Be positive. Even if you're not completely at home yet, try to be confident, outgoing, and reasonably cheerful. Remember, you can't score if you don't shoot.







, If you're new somewhere, you probably have every reason to ask people to help you find your way. Where are the restrooms? The parks? The good shops? What restaurants, schools, teachers, clubs, or programs should you check out? You'll not only get good, inside information, you'll start conversations. People love to share their opinions.

, Anything from, ""Cool shirt, where did you get it?"" to ""I've really enjoyed talking to you"" can be just the amount of encouragement someone needs to remember to talk to you again. Be casual, and don't go overboard. Just drop in a sincere compliment whenever it seems fitting.

, Buy a drink for the next person in line at the drink machine. Offer to help if you see someone working or struggling with something. It's amazing how quickly offering to help can break down barriers. Or, try volunteering some of your time with any community organization that needs it.

, If people see you having fun, they might be inclined to join you.

Join after school activities.,
Focus on one person at a time.,
Use social media.,
Try group activities.,
Make your own suggestions.,
Be yourself.,
Don’t pressure yourself.",How to Stop Being Shy and Make Friends in Middle School," After school activities give you a chance to meet a bunch of new people while focusing on something else. Doing something with other people gives you something in common to talk about, and makes it easier to start a conversation if you’re shy.Make sure the after school activity you pick is something you really like to do. If you're doing an activity you don't like, you probably won't feel comfortable enough to make friends.
Don't join an activity that has too many or too few people. Too many people will make it hard for you to talk to anyone and too few people can put a lot of focus on you. You'll know best how many people you're comfortable with, but you probably want a group with more than four but fewer than fifteen people in it. Keep the size of the group in mind when you're picking an activity.;
, When you’re trying to make friends when you’re shy, talking in the middle of a big group of people can feel really scary. Instead, look for someone who looks friendly, or who you kind of know already from school, and try to have a one-on-one conversation.


If you're in a larger group, like an after school activity, look for someone who smiles at you when you smile, or who starts a conversation with you. That person is probably a good option for making a first friend.
You can also look for someone else who looks shy. Maybe they keep to themselves or are sitting alone. Someone else who is shy and who has a hard time making friends will understand how you feel. That can make it a little easier to become friends.

, If you feel too shy to talk to people in person, try using social media to connect instead. It’s a great way to make friends without having to walk up to someone you don’t know very well and starting a conversation.


For example, if you've noticed someone at school that you think you might want to be friends with, message them on social media. You can use something like Facebook messenger or direct messages on Twitter to connect to people you might want to be friends with.
You can say something like, ""Hi Jessica! My name is Katie. I've seen you at school and I'm pretty shy, but I wanted to say hello."" This is a great way to start a conversation and to get to know someone a little better before you have to talk to them in person.

, Doing something with a group of people that you like lets you be part of the action without having to participate as much as you would in a smaller setting. You can be there with other people, and be seen, without having to talk to anyone directly. It’s an easy way to have fun but still get lost in the crowd!, If there’s a particular activity you feel really comfortable with, suggest your new friends join you. If you’re doing something you like, you’ll feel more comfortable and can feel more comfortable, even if you’re doing the activity with new people., It’s totally okay that you’re shy! You don’t need to change who you are to please other people and you can definitely still make friends. Don’t act outgoing if you’re not, and don’t agree to do things you really don’t like just to make friends. People will be able to tell if you’re not being yourself and it will probably turn them off from you., You don’t need a hundred friends to feel good about yourself, especially if being around lots of people make you nervous. Focus on making one or two really good friends and have fun with them!"
"
Focus on how you feel about yourself.,
Realize others won’t care if you embarrass yourself.,
Remember that you are your worst critic.,
Stop obsessing about things that have happened.,
Tell yourself it’s okay to make mistakes.",How to Overcome Fear of Making New Friends1," One of the things that makes people afraid to make friends is the thought that people are judging you and thinking bad thoughts about you. While some people may judge you from time to time, most people are too busy thinking about their own lives to think about you to the degree you fear.To overcome worries about people judging you, try to focus on how you feel about yourself.


Tell yourself when you are trying to make friends, “People are not judging me. People think about themselves more than me. They are probably just as worried about others judging them as I am.”
Identify your feelings about yourself. For example, if you make a daring fashion choice, then does that make you feel bold, insecure, quirky, or attractive?;
, Another thing that makes people nervous to make friends is that they are afraid they will embarrass themselves. If they do something stupid or wrong, it will cause deep humiliation, and everyone will laugh, judge, and not like them. However, this is not true. Most people won’t think about your “embarrassment” a minute after it occurs.Tell yourself, “If I embarrass myself, it will not be the end of the world. People won’t make as big of a deal about it as I will. They don’t care and may not even notice.”

, Sometimes people find it hard to be social and make friends because they constantly remind themselves of why other people wouldn’t like them. You may tell yourself that you are worthless, stupid, or unworthy of someone’s friendship. This is not true. You deserve friends just like everyone else.When you think these thoughts, tell yourself, “These negative thoughts are my own distorted thoughts because I am my worst critic. Other people are not nearly as harsh about me as I am. I am worthy of friendship and deserve to be liked by others.”

, Sometimes, our social fears lead us to obsess about things that we did while around other people. We dissect everything we said, focus on how stupid we are, and dwell on every mistakes. Other people don’t think this about you, so you should stop yourself when you do this.When you find yourself replaying a conversation or interaction, tell yourself, “Stop this. I am viewing this in a distorted way, making it worse than it was. I will not let myself do that.”
If you did experience something that didn’t go as planned, tell yourself, “It is okay that this did not go the way I wanted. I may have said something wrong and embarrassed myself, but I am still a worthy person. Everyone makes mistakes.”

, No one is perfect. No one expects you to be perfect. If you think you can’t make friends unless you are perfect all the time, you should understand this is not true. People make mistakes, and most people connect more to someone who is flawed and vulnerable than someone who acts like they are perfect all the time.Weaknesses, failures, and faults can be endearing. They make us relatable. Being open about these things can help you form connections with others because they also have faults and imperfections.

Your tube catches an egg released from your ovary and carries the sperm to that egg. After the egg and sperm join, this fertilized egg is carried it into the uterus where it implants and grows into a fetus.There are many ways to have your tubes “tied,” but none of these procedures actually ""tie"" them like a knot.Your doctor may have used tubal rings or clips to clamp them shut. Another method is to scar and block your tubes using either a burning tool or special insert.;
, The tubal reversal is performed in either a hospital or an outpatient center. The gynecologist will perform a laparoscopic procedure. This includes removing any foreign objects (clip, ring, insert), cutting away any scar tissue, and then reconnecting the tubes by sewing the healthy ends back together.Your gynecologist will be operating in your pelvis which is the lower portion of your abdomen. There is a risk of bleeding, infection, and injury to organs located near your tubes. Anesthesia is used to control your pain and to keep you asleep; you could develop a bad reaction these medications.Getting pregnant is the outcome you want. However, there is a 10% chance your pregnancy could be ectopic, in which the fertilized egg implants and grows outside your uterus. A majority of the time this happens in one of your tubes which is not large enough for a baby to grow. Your pregnancy would end early, your tube could be damaged, or you could have significant, even life-threatening, bleeding., Your OB/GYN will need to know about any health issues involving your uterus, ovaries, and vagina in order to figure out if you are a good candidate for a tubal reversal.The success of your tubal reversal is affected by how much scar tissue you have in and around your tubes. It is important to know if you had surgery in the past for endometriosis. This disease occurs when little pieces of the lining inside your uterus end up outside of your uterus stuck on organs like your ovaries or bladder. Your doctor will ask if you have a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID occurs when a serious infection spreads from your vagina up into your uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Scar tissue from previous surgery, endometriosis, and/or PID could make the reversal harder to do.The doctor is looking for anything which may affect your ability to get pregnant. Being pregnant in the past is a good sign it can happen again. Let her know if you were ever pregnant and if it was a healthy pregnancy.You are likely to be a good candidate for reversal if your tubes were closed with rings or clips or if you only had a small part of your tube removed. Procedures like Essure and Adiana that use inserts and sometimes burning are harder to reverse because of the amount of scarring. If you are younger than 40 and had your tubes tied immediately after delivery, some surgeons consider you to be the best candidate for reversal., This exam and any studies your doctor orders are important to help keep you safe during the surgery. A safe procedure increases your chances of getting pregnant.An older woman, 40 years and up, usually has poorer egg quality and fewer healthy eggs remaining. You may find it harder to get pregnant. Your doctor may order a study where your follicles are counted to see how many eggs you have left. She also can order blood tests to check your follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) levels. If these hormone levels are abnormal, it may be a sign that your ovaries are not working well enough to get you pregnant.Your doctor may find it harder to perform your tubal reversal if you are overweight. Your procedure will take longer. You will be under anesthesia longer, increasing your risk of having a bad reaction. Your doctor will determine your body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness, by using your height and weight. Your extra weight should not affect your ability to get pregnant.Your doctor may order a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to check the length of your fallopian tubes. This procedure can be performed in two ways. The first way is to inject a dye into your uterus then use fluoroscopy, a special X-ray, to see your tubes. The second way is to put sterile fluid filled with small bubble into your uterus and see your tubes with ultrasound which uses sound waves. Ultrasound also can be used to see if your ovaries appear normal and healthy.Knowing about your general state of health, such as the presence of heart disease, lung disease, bleeding disorders, or any previous bad reactions to anesthesia, helps your doctor take better care you during the surgery.

, It is best for your partner to undergo semen analysis, including a sperm count. You want him to be able to get you pregnant once your tubes are untied. This test is fairly inexpensive.The gynecologist will send your partner to an urologist. This type of doctor can treat your partner if any problems are found.

, This is another option for becoming pregnant if you are not a good candidate for tubal reversal or it fails. IVF involves combining eggs and sperm outside the body in a laboratory and then placing the fertilized eggs inside your uterus.There are good and bad things about IVF. Trying to decide between IVF and tubal reversal is hard. Your doctor will talk to you and your partner about things like age, cost, how much time it may take to get pregnant, and how you still may not get pregnant., How well the tubal reversal turns out for you is based upon the skill of your doctor and the quality of the care given to you at the hospital or outpatient center. If you have family or friends who have had similar procedures done, ask them to recommend a provider.Ask your doctor how often her patients get pregnant after their tubes are untied. The number should be between 40 and 85% of the time.Make sure the hospital or outpatient center where your doctor operates is accredited. This means the hospital or center is checked regularly to make sure it will provide you with the best possible care. Check the hospital’s website. A hospital proudly advertises every accreditation it has. A center will brag about the low number of surgical complications it has. Be wary if this is lacking.

, Do not eat or drink anything, including gum, after 12 midnight the night before the surgery. You cannot eat or drink again until after the procedure., This is very specific to you and your medical conditions. You are not cheating on your fast if you take a medication with a small sip of water after midnight.Medications like aspirin, which may cause bleeding, must be stopped several days before the tubal reversal., Use an anti-bacterial soap like Lever or Dial. Repeat your bath or shower in the morning for the best results. Do not shave your abdomen or your pubic area.It does not matter what type of soap you use. Getting your skin clean is the most important part. It decreases the amount of bacteria on the skin and lowers the chances of you getting an infection after the tubal reversal. Pay special attention to your belly button.Nicks made in your skin while shaving could increase the risk of infection after your procedure. Let the trained professionals helping your doctor in the operating room take care of hair removal., You could be injured or interfere with the instruments meant to keep you safe in the operating room.Your doctor uses electrocautery to control bleeding during your procedure. Your skin could be burned, where the jewelry is touching it, when she uses this instrument because it produces a mild electrical current.A pulse oximeter is used to make sure the amount of oxygen in your blood stays in the normal range. This machine sends light waves through your nail to take these measurements; your nail polish interferes with this process., It makes a difference if you had the open or laparoscopic tubal reversal. The amount of pain and discomfort you are having will determine your ability to do things like returning to work, doing housework, or walking up stairs.You may go home the same day or the next day after the laparoscopic procedure because the incisions are small and there is less pain. You will have to stay in the hospital for several days after the open procedure. Your doctor will give you pain medicine when you go home.You should not lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds for 4 to 6 weeks. It takes this long for the tissues in the abdominal wall to heal. Expect to do everything sooner than later if you have undergone the laparoscopic procedure., These serious symptoms include heavy vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, persistent nausea and vomiting, excessive thirst or sweating, failure to pass gas or urine, severe bloating and/or constipation, and drainage, bleeding, or redness around the incision site.Heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than one pad per hour, combined with severe abdominal pain may be a sign of uncontrolled bleeding from the site of your tubal reversal. Excessive thirst and sweating can be a sign of bleeding, too. You want to drink liquids because your body needs to replace the fluids lost due to the bleeding. Sweating is your body’s response to the stress of losing a lot of blood. Remember that calling emergency services is always an option.Nausea and vomiting can be caused by anesthesia or your pain medication. Your body clears out the medications used during anesthesia in about 24 hours. Your doctor can give you a medication to help with the nausea and vomiting to get you through this period. If your doctor thinks the pain medication is the problem, she will prescribe a different one.An ileus occurs when your intestines stop pushing food and gas forward through the intestines. This happens after abdominal surgery, especially an open procedure. You will have nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and pass less gas. Anti-nausea medications should not be used. Time resolves the ileus. You can drink small amount of liquids until your intestines recover. Call your doctor if your symptoms get worse instead of getting better over time.Pain medications can cause severe constipation. Eat high fiber foods, vegetables or whole grain products, and take a stool softener. Call the doctor if you completely stop passing gas and stool., You want your wound to stay dry and clean so that it can heal well. Look at the wound to make sure there are no signs of an infection, such as drainage (including blood), fever (temperature greater than 101 degrees), and/or redness and warmth around the wound(s).


Increasing abdominal pain and fever could be a sign of a serious infection inside the abdomen. Call your doctor so that she can examine you, order the appropriate tests, and decide how to treat the infection.Your doctor will have specific instructions. The general rule is to wait 2 to 3 days before taking the dressing off the wound(s). It takes that long for the skin portion of the wound to seal and protect deeper tissue from infection. If you have a special waterproof dressing on the wound(s), you can shower immediately. Otherwise, stand at the sink and wash around your dressing until the 2 to 3 days have passed. You can shower after this time. Letting soapy water gently run over your wound(s) helps keep it clean. Just dry it off after you are done. Do not take a bath for about a month.

, Most doctors will want to see you around two weeks after the tubal reversal. Expect this to be the first of many as you heal and then try to get pregnant.The first visit is about making sure you are healing as expected. She will examine your wound and look for any signs of infection. She will press on your abdomen and make sure your pain is decreasing appropriately.
Most couples get pregnant in the first 6 months after the tubal reversal. If you do not get pregnant, she will schedule a hysterosalpingogram to make sure your tubes are open and functioning properly. A majority of the time, your tubes will be opened. You will try other methods to get pregnant. You will keep track of when you ovulate and plan to have sex around that time. The doctor can use drugs to make it more likely you will ovulate or she could have your partner give a sample of his semen so that she can put in inside your uterus. IVF will be discussed at some point if you continue to have difficulty getting pregnant."

Smile at people.,
Practice talking to others.,
Get out of your head.,
Don’t take things personally.",How to Overcome Fear of Making New Friends2," One way to start overcoming your fear of making new friends is to smile at people. This may seem simple, but making eye contact and smiling is a low-stakes form of interaction. You will probably find that most people smile back and even speak.You can add a “Hello” or “How are you?” to your smile to increase your social interaction.

, The more you talk to other people, the more you will feel comfortable interacting and making friends. Speak to people or compliment them on something. Ask someone a question when you are standing around, or start a conversation with someone at work, a cashier, or a classmate.For example, you may tell someone, “I like your jacket” or ask someone, “Have you eaten here before? What do you suggest?”
If the interaction isn’t a success, shake it off. This is low-stakes and doesn’t matter.

, Part of the fear of making new friends comes from being inside your head and dwelling on fears and unhealthy thoughts. Instead of obsessing over your thoughts, put your focus on the environment around you. Focus on the other people instead of yourself.This helps you not obsess about what you want to say, what you may have done wrong, or how you are acting. Focusing on the other person helps reduce your feelings of self-consciousness.

, If you have a bad social interaction or someone doesn’t seem like they want to be your friend, try not to let it bother you. There are many reasons a person may not respond positively. No matter what the reason, remember that it’s not the end of the world. You’ll just try again next time.A person may be having a bad day or be distracted, so their reaction to you may have nothing to do with you.

Plus, you meet people with similar interests.
You may decide take a sewing or gym class, go to a social meetup, or join a hiking organization.

, Socializing in large groups may make you too nervous to talk to anyone. Large groups may exacerbate your fears. Instead, get together in smaller groups, which can take some of the pressure off. It’s easier to interact when you are with a small group of people.You can go out with friends of friends, or get together with friends of family members or co-workers.

, Befriending people who have similar interests makes it more likely that you will make a friend and enjoy each other’s company. You may find people with similar interests at the local book club who loves reading or someone at a painting class who shares your passion for art.

Smile at others.,
Say ""hi"".,
Give a compliment.,
Ask people questions about themselves.,
Practice talking to lots of people.",How to Make Friends in School when You Are Extremely Shy1," Smiling is the most important thing you can do to look friendly and approachable. When you catch someone’s eye or someone talks to you, smile – it lets the person know that you’re glad to interact, even if you don’t know what to say.You don’t have to walk around wearing a grin all the time because that would be unnatural. Just practice keeping an open, pleasant expression on your face most of the time.;
, Go out of your way to greet people you’d like to be friends with. If you don’t know the person at all, introduce yourself and ask what the other person’s name is. Talking to someone you don’t know well might feel awkward if you’re not used to doing it, but most people will be happy to chat with you., Saying something nice is always a good way to break the ice with a person you want to befriend. If you don’t know what to say, consider complimenting someone on their contributions to class discussions, their handwriting, or their outfit.For instance, you could say to your neighbor in class, “I love your pencil case. Where did you get it?”

, One of the surest ways to make friends with someone is to be interested in them. Show that you’re interested by asking genuine (but not nosy) questions about your classmates’ hobbies, families, and favorite subjects at school. As an added benefit, you won’t have to talk so much when you encourage others to talk about themselves.For instance, you could ask a classmate, “What kind of books do you like to read?” or “Do you have any brothers or sisters?”

, Meeting new people might feel scary now, but the more you do it, the easier it will become. Set a goal to talk to one new person every week or every day. As you widen your social network and have more positive interactions with people, you’ll feel less nervous.Joining an extracurricular activity like a sports team or drama club will give you lots of opportunities to practice talking to people.

Make yourself approachable.,
Find somebody that you have something in common with.,
At recess join games.,
When you go to lunch sit down near the people you would like to be friends with.,
By now most people will know you well enough to talk with you so just remember to be polite, even after you have secured a friendship.

",How to Make Friends in Fifth Grade," Be polite and smile when you talk to others, if you are rude nobody will want to be around you. Much less your friend. Nod, and smile when you pass your classmates in the hall.;
, For instance a sport that you both play, or a hobby. While it can be scary just to walk up to somebody, it will be worth it. Begin to have small conversations with your classmates, chances are one of them will start talking to you more too.

, Play kickball, wall ball, soccer, tetherball, or another popular game, it's a great way to get to know names and peers.

, If they include you in their conversations great! If not, you might not even want to be friends with them. You could try to get into their conversation but you don't want to seem like an eavesdropper.

Consider how men operate.,
Decide on the purpose of the relationship.,
Imagine this scenario.,
Next, make a list of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences you want.,
Write down anything else you have a passion for, you find fascinating, you really wish you were involved in.

,
Look at the lists in front of you.,
Know that the uncompromising pursuit of the things that inspire you will show a man that you have interests beyond just him - that, in itself, will make you interesting.,
Understand that self development is key to finding the right man.,
Get a good balance.,
Exercise.,
Take some time to get to the point where you fully incorporate it, however.,
Commit to pursuing your passions.,
Continue to make time for yourself.,
Think about what you wish a man in your life were doing for you - how he was appreciating you.,
Prove to yourself that you don't need a man for these things.,
Remember, self-sacrifice is a high predictor for divorce.,
Look at the whole picture.,
As mentioned, it is extremely important to make a point of addressing issues when they arise.,
Don't be needy or dependent.,
Know that one difference between men and women is mental processing.,
Learn how to express your feelings.,
Never treat your partner like a child - don't talk down to him, don't give him unsolicited advice, don't cast judgement on him, don't give him curfews or try to control him.,
These important concepts are really about staying mature, respecting him, and expecting mutual respect.",How to Grow as a Relationship Partner (for Women)," The first thing to keep in mind as we begin to go over the concepts below is how men operate. (There are, of course, both feminine and masculine people of both genders.


For ease of use, we say ""men and women"" hereafter, but this can easily be applied to a ""male or female"" version of either sex, as typically, regardless of the sex, masculine energy is typically attracted to feminine. Here, we're referring to the masculine energy when we say ""men"".)
On the average, men love action. They love doing. When something interests them, they'll do it. That makes them interesting and revitalizes them when they're drained - so they don't feel guilty about it. They have full lives, fun friends, great gadgets - all these things make men interesting to women. (Even when women hate their man's friends, these friends are typically a source of carefree fun for men.);
, The second thing to keep in mind is the purpose of a relationship.


Relationships - whether friendship or romantic - are first and foremost about someone who you enjoy being around. It's really that simple.
When relationships deteriorate, it's because the people no longer enjoy each other.
It is not enjoyable to be around anyone who is not respectful or who you can't trust. Even people who you may feel chemistry with are not always people who can make you happy.

,


So to start the process - Begin by just clearing the room of distractions and sitting down to imagine this scenario.
Really sit back. Take a deep breath. Relax. Allow yourself to stop the resistance within you and just breathe. After taking just enough time to do this step, you can go back to your life and doubts.
Now - imagine the following without fear or doubt. Imagine - just for a moment - you had all the money in the world, no responsibilities at all, and anything you could want. The only work you have to do in this dream is work you choose to do because you enjoy it.
Now - imagine what you would do each day, every day. You can have any position you want (from secretary to construction to lawyer to charity work), any hobbies you want (from woodcutter to runner). You can travel (France, Italy, China, Japan). You can play any music instrument you like (guitar, piano, mandolin, drums), participate in any sport (soccer, kayaking, running, strength training), read anything (from science to literature), write anything (novels, poetry, music), do anything you want out in nature (hiking, studying herbs, birdwatching), have any type of spiritual experiences or just meditation, even just something as simple as gardening if you want. Make a list of all of the things you would do with your free time if you had the chance.

, Traveling somewhere, skydiving, white water rafting, anything at all. The things you want to do before you die.

,, Right now, you're probably thinking, ""Yeah, but I could never do that, because... (time, money, I'm scared, my mother, etc)."" And that's the exact thought process that people have who never really find themselves satisfied.


Instead, look at those things, go back over them, and circle 10 that bring an emotional response within you, that really strongly appeal to you regardless of how unattainable they are.
Now, instead of saying, ""I can't because..."" say, ""I will, and here's the plan!"" That exact attitude - known as the ""winner's attitude"" has been shown, again and again, to produce results.
Now perhaps select one or two that are really impossible - becoming President (change it to getting involved in politics or studying politics, whatever fulfills your desire), for example, or stopping time. Accept the possibility that you might not get them. But for all the others, NEVER accept the possibility that you will not try - because that is simply you giving up on yourself.
Those ten items you have written down - those are the keys. Those speak to you. Those things - as you begin to learn to do them, save money for them, study for them, work for them, whatever your plan may be, no matter how long you have to wait for them - those 10 things (AND the pursuit of them!) are what your passions are, what will make you interesting, vibrant, and full of youth - the very qualities you need to find a man.

,


Pursuing those passions is what we call ""having a life"" - an essential when you want a man to respect you.
Now, yes, you may not get all 10. And you certainly should not take financial risks you cannot afford to lose for them (although making some sacrifices in daily expenditure can help), but you will certainly find it very possible to commit to doing one or two as hobbies each week, even if the process of trying to learn them is embarrassing, even if your family won't support you, even if a guy asks you to schedule a date during that time. And especially, you will have one or two which you will work during your life to achieve, making a commitment to go skydiving or visit Italy no matter how many years it will take.
You can do what you are ""supposed to do"" at work, if you want. But those 10 things - of those, hold on strongly to pursuing 5 of them for your whole life, or until you find you are no longer passionate about them.
Because by making your dreams and passions a priority, you show a man that you believe your dreams matter. And because of that, he will respect you and believe your dreams matter, perhaps trying to help you achieve them.
If you're still wrestling with the feeling that you cannot do these things, there are experts in every possible field out there that have found a way to combat that excuse. Just go out and find a book to get you started. Here are some resources to help you.

If you think you don't have enough time (everyone's favorite excuse!) check out flylady.net.
If you think you do not have enough money, check out the books, ""The Automatic Millionaire,"" ""Miserly Moms,"" or ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"".
If you feel you are two shy, realize that it is not something you have to live with forever - that many people have overcome - and make a pledge to get rid of it.

Start by just getting into the habit breathing, of being relaxed, then waiting no longer than 3 seconds to just say ""hello"" to people.
Next, make a point of going to public places each week and saying ""hello"" to 10 strangers a week. Gradually increase that to 20.
Move on, when you're comfortable, to having simple conversations about things that do not involve either of you personally - usually a comment on the environment you're in. You'll learn overtime to deal with just about any personality type and learn not to care too much about what people think of you. Whatever else you find holding you back, face your fears, again and again, until you no longer fear them.





,


At this point, you might be saying - ""Hey, I'm here to find a man!"" Yup, you're right. But all of these steps are essential for combating one of the largest issues on the female side of relationships - the feeling of a void in your life that we incorrectly think is because of the lack of a man.
Well, guess what? Men can see that, too. And that internal void scares men away like nothing else.
Men pursue their dreams. Because of that, many men go through life fulfilled, not needing women, simply enjoying sex, until one day around age 25 or 30 they feel ready to settle down and find a wife.
On the other hand, very often women just pursue men instead of their dreams. That leaves a big gap.
That puts all the responsibility for satisfaction in your life on a man.
And that leads to the desperate, dramatic, and clingy behaviors that men run away from and that women hate when they see it in themselves.

,


One of the biggest issues in sustaining a healthy relationship is developing a balanced use of your own time and especially your energy. The habits necessary for a good relationship are essential to practice now, before you have a partner.
You must, each week of your life, throughout your life:

Take some time for work, whether it be furthering your career, bringing home the bacon, advancing your education, or taking care of the kids;
Have positive experiences with him, whether it be a weekly date night (without the kids) or, during exceptionally busy periods, checking in before he goes to sleep, giving him a kiss when he gets home, and asking him how his day went;
Time to regain your energy. Every single week. In order to truly be a good spouse and good mother, you owe it to your children to take the time to revitalize. Whether it means you need a babysitter once a week or whether your husband or friends take care of the kids, you need time, alone, each week relaxing. Cheap or expensive, whether it be by getting a massage (maybe from your sweetheart!), gardening, painting, going to Starbucks with a friend, whatever fills you with energy;
Pursuing your passions. Whether it's garden club, hiking club, scrap booking - whatever it is, you must make an unwavering commitment to it. Sure, a couple times a year, you'll miss a meeting; but you need to commit to it. Committing to it will, again, give you passion for your life and help the men in your life (especially your children) to respect you. There is no need to get emotional about this commitment. Just calmly explain that you get energy from this commit to allow yourself to be a better wife and mother.
Time with friends. This is something both you and your love need.

Some of this time can be spent as two couples together; but the most important time you can spend is with your ""girlfriends,"" connecting as women (in the same way as he needs to connect to men).
Do not expect your husband to bear the brunt of your emotions. Emotions are something that women tend to understand best. While it is important to be able to connect emotionally with your partner, it is far more important to have a safe, open group of friends that you can connect to as well, if not every week, every other week.
The excuse of time is simply not applicable here. People who properly revitalize themselves through ""alone"" time, relaxation, and time with friends have enough energy to accomplish all of this, each week, while still maintaining a healthy family life and job.
For help with this, check out the book, ""The Power of Full Engagement: Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal"". If you truly feel you cannot accomplish this in any given week, schedule it in so you accomplish it within every 2-week period.





, There is, however, one last step. The step you perhaps avoid.


The step you want to do, but somehow always find it hard to. Exercise, that source of agony - but also a source of energy.
Something you'll find, once you commit to it for a month, will be something you start looking forward to.
But don't look at exercise as a step to losing weight. Instead of a goal of, ""I want to lose 5 lbs this month,"" set a goal of ""I want to walk for 20 minutes, 2 times a week, every week this month. If I miss a day or two, that's ok, I'll just start right up again.""
You'll never need to do more than 20 minutes of cardio (if you want more challenge, try interval training) - and once you've been staying strong with your 20 minutes each week, perhaps get a personal trainer or very knowledgeable friend who can help you put together a 20-minute strength training routine.
Add 10 minutes of stretching, and you've got all the exercise you need, 2-3 times a week. Don't allow your friend or trainer to over-burden you, however.
Don't even think about weight loss.
Focus only on building a habit and making it consistent. Success will be looking back on your calendar and saying, ""I didn't miss one of my eight workouts this month!""
Yes, exercise will make you look better. But it will also make you healthier, more energetic, more vibrant, more mentally cued in, and happier! Plus you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you are doing a good thing for yourself. This step is extremely important for building a natural sense of self-discipline and confidence. If either of these is an issue for you, try getting involved in a challenge course.

, And once you do find a man, you will have to have the strength to say, ""I'm sorry; I can't do it tonight. I already scheduled something else. Perhaps next week?""

, Everything will take some time to develop. Even then, it is a lifelong process. You must develop the strength to do it, getting stronger and stronger over time.


When a man comes across a woman with a fulfilled, satisfied life, who stands by what she does and shows she puts herself first so that she has enough energy to love and respect those around her, shows that she values herself and doesn't need a man to fulfill her (only having a man in her life because she loves HIM specifically, not because she NEEDS any man), a man will be very, very hesitant to do anything that would let her leave. So commit to pursuing your passions and dreams. You are worth it.
And if you want a truly wonderful man, you owe it to him to discover how to energize and revitalize yourself, so instead of draining him, you are a constant source of energy in the relationship.
For yourself, and for your relationship, even if you are extremely poor and must find very cheap sources of passion and excitement, make a commitment today to take the next 60 days and focus, each day, on fulfilling each of the steps above, from pursuing your passions to taking time for yourself.

, So - it's been a month or two. You've worked each day on building a more fulfilling life. You find satisfaction in it. You realize that, the more satisfaction you're getting out of your life, the more consistently you exercise, the more energy you have to do well at work, at home, and in relationships. You're learning to take time for yourself and not feel guilty. You're beginning to see a difference in your life - you're more confident, you see people respecting you more, and perhaps you're even building a larger social network. There was some resistance from friends or family - but you recognized that they wished they were also doing what you were and kept going. Sure, time management was hard at first - but by renewing your energy and checking out a couple books, now you feel like you have more time than ever! You're a better partner, a better worker, and feel like a new woman. Congratulations!

What do you wish a man would do? Buy you flowers? Bring you chocolate? Perhaps cuddle up with a good movie? Enjoy chocolate-covered strawberries and champagne by candlelight? Take you out to a nice restaurant every month or so? Buy you a day at the spa? Make a nice list of how you wish you were treated and appreciated. A complete list!

, Now - without saying you don't deserve it, without saying you shouldn't spoil yourself, start appreciating yourself.


Obviously stay within your budget, but save on some weekends to splurge a little on others. Take your friends out to dinner. Buy yourself some chocolate and flowers. Light some candles and have a nice glass of wine, even if you're watching a movie at home, by yourself. Invite a friend over for fondue. Learn to truly love yourself.
Continue the tradition of really fulfilling yourself.
When a man sees how you treat yourself, he will see that you realize you are a treasure worthy of being treated well. He will accept no less of himself. He will hold you up as a treasure. A man who sees that an ordinary night alone for you includes candles, chocolate, and wine will never try to get away with calling watching the game with his friends a ""date"".
You may, if you find that fun, decide to do that once in a while; but he will also be sure that he treats you well.
Make sure, however, that you aren't just doing this for a man. You shouldn't burst into tears when a man appreciates you for the first time in your life. You should always be grateful and loving when he treats you well, but you should be kind to yourself even when no one will ever find out.

, Learning to take care of your own needs helps you to take the burden off of the man and give you more energy to invest in the relationship. The next step - now that you are prepared for a man - is learning how dating works, how men work, and where to find a man.

, So far, we've: created a very fulfilling life; learned to recharge our batteries and take care of ourselves so we have energy to put into our relationships; learned how men look at dating and marriage; looked at attracting men and the importance of sticking with what you're comfortable with, instead of trying to impress him; how to manage sex by respecting our intuition; and gotten a more realistic, research-centered perspective on what works and doesn't work in marriage. Now for the final step: techniques for keeping the man of your dreams at your side for life.

,


Blaming, being condescending, and other judgmental are not only useless, but highly predictive of failure.
Instead, often simply stating feelings is enough. Practice saying the works, ""I feel."" ""I feel sad... lonely... attacked... unhappy."" Men live to make their women happy.
That is one of the main reasons why they don't respond well to criticism - they feel inadequate. Men want to be their wife's hero.
Allowing them to respond to your feelings, find a solution themselves (instead of having one suggested), and working to make their wives happy (rewarded by her happiness and smiling face) makes him a modern-day hero.

, One of the keys to pursuing your own passions and having your own friendships is that you will not be needy and dependent on him. He will know that you have a lot going on.


He knows that if he doesn't schedule a date and calls you last minute, you're probably out with your friends - so he calls in advance to schedule dates (this doesn't mean disrespecting him by getting drunk and flirting with guys, but a night out with the ladies, dinner and a movie, is appropriate fun).
You also don't beg him for time alone. Just as it is important for you to have time with your friends, he must have time with his. That time he has, and the freedom you give him to have it, gives him time to miss you.
Since you are busy, too, and he's missing you on his boy's night, you'll certainly see enough of him other nights.
While it is important for a man to contribute to the household, it is also very important for you to watch for moments when your insecurity comes out.
Instead of setting a curfew like a mother would, at those times when you feel pangs of jealousy or insecurity, ask yourself, ""Have I sacrificed my dreams lately? When was the last time I pursued my hobbies or saw my friends?"" Don't make excuses for lack of time - take action.

Women tend to need a certain about of social time, often with other women, to help them process thoughts and feelings.
Men, on the other hand, tend to need time alone. Depriving a man of his ""alone time"" takes away his ability to recharge in the way he needs to.
Attempting to force a man to ""open up"" will only make the process take longer. When a man feels that he is being analyzed or judged, he is far less likely to open up.
Men need to feel safe, and have his thoughts and feelings validated and accepted, before he feels comfortable opening up to a woman.
However, he still needs time alone, and women need to learn to respect this in the same way that men must respect a woman's need to have social interaction with other women.
For a marriage to last, men must feel safe being able to express thoughts and feelings, particularly sadness.

,


The keys to dealing with your partner in relationship conflicts is expressing feelings and using the word ""Regardless"" - or withdrawing attention. ""Regardless"" is important, because no one can argue logic against emotion.
However, while you may feel very emotional, take it out with exercise, talking to friends, or in other ways. Your conversation with your partner, even while expressing emotion, should be extremely calm and without visible emotion. Here are some examples:

A man is calls you up at the last minute, asking for a late date. It will obviously lead to a late dinner, or more likely, a booty call. For whatever reason, you happen to be free that night - but of course, you were not waiting for his call as he hadn't scheduled a date. You simply had decided to stay in that night to pamper yourself. You ask him to drive over to your house. He insists you drive to his. You feel internal doubt... trust that instinct. Inside, you can tell he's trying to weasel from you what he can get at his convenience. Response? Withdraw attention. ""Will you drive over here?"" ""No, you come to my house,"" he says. ""It seems like tonight just won't be convenient for me. Perhaps we can get together next week."" By not allowing him to disrespect you, particularly for sex, you show him you will stand up for yourself. Seeing that you won't let him get away with a more minor jerky-thing, he's less likely to be more of a jerk to you in the future, and will certainly respect you much more. A true jerk will show his true colors here - but the average guy will say, ""Sorry, let's go on a real date next week."" Expect your man to treat you well and he will.
A man is not contributing around the home. Go to him and say, ""I feel sad."" ""Why?"" he'll ask. ""Because I feel overworked."" ""But I'm working hard, too,"" he says. ""Regardless, I feel overworked. I feel a sense of unfairness."" ""But I took out the garbage last week!"" ""I really appreciate that. Regardless, I feel overworked. I feel like I do more."" He can no longer argue. He sighs. ""What if I started doing the dishes every other night."" ""Oh! That would be great - but that feels overly complicated. Every other night. I would still feel burdened overall."" ""Ok, every night."" ""Oh, thank you so much! What a great idea! You're the best, sweetie!"" Sparkle. Smile. Hug him. Thank him. Practice well - research has shown that if you want to be a successful parent, you'll need to reward your kid's chores (yes, the ones they're supposed to do without encouragement!) with the same enthusiasm. And you should be enthusiastic. Becoming complacent and not showing appreciation is a very negative trait. Now - sit back, and let him do it. He may do it later than you want. He may do it differently than you want. But don't touch those dishes, and expect them to be done- they will be. Then kiss him and smile - that's all he wants, to be your hero. Notice, clearly you don't suggest the solution. He comes up with it himself. Most importantly, you have to allow him to do it HIS way, even if he loads the dishes in a less that optimal way, he still did it and is your hero! This is the only part that may seem artificial to some - but it shouldn't be. First, because researchers have shown how important support is for behavior modification. But mostly because you should appreciate what your partner does for you, and that appreciation is an important part in showing the type of support and affection research has shown to be so important in a marriage.

Note: if you are changing your strategy mid-relationship to a more mature manner of interacting, do not be surprised if you find conflict increasing before it settles down. You are changing the rules, which can be uncomfortable for him.





, Agree, if anything, to disagree about the way he does things. But accept the man as he is, appreciate him for who he is, don't try to change him. If you can't resist the urge, let him go for another girl who will appreciate him for him, not for what you consider to be his ""potential.""

, They have also been shown to be highly successful. By managing your own energy, time, and emotion, you will find the ability to be the stronger emotional force in the relationship leading to a lasting love and respect for the both of you.

Think about your good traits.,
Practice what you’re good at.,
Be who you are.,
Think positively.,
Rethink how you view rejection.",How to Make Friends in School when You Are Extremely Shy2," Ask yourself which of your personal qualities make you a great friend. Perhaps you’re funny, a good listener, or able to find something nice to say about everyone. Make a list of these traits and refer to it when you’re feeling shy or self-conscious., Work on developing your skills and interests in your free time. Whether you’re into sports, art, or animals, having hobbies will give you things to talk about with other people, which can help you feel less shy. Being good at something will also help you develop strong self-esteem.Hobbies can also give you a reason to get involved in clubs or groups, which is a good way to meet new friends.

, Even if you’re shy, you don’t need to turn into a different person to make friends. Embrace your real personality, whether you’re reserved, goofy, or caring. Being genuine will help you make friends who appreciate your true self, shyness and all.Being yourself doesn’t mean refusing to work on your negative traits. It just means owning and appreciating what makes you unique.

, Positive visualization and self-talk can help you feel less nervous about getting out and meeting new people. Imagine your encounters going well, and talk to yourself in an encouraging way, even if you mess up occasionally. For instance, before you introduce yourself to someone, tell yourself, “I bet this person is friendly,” instead of, “I’m always awkward when I introduce myself to someone new.”
Visualization helps you practice navigating different social scenarios before you actually encounter them.

, Everybody gets rejected now and then, no matter how comfortable they are talking to people. If someone doesn’t want to talk to you, it doesn’t necessarily mean you did anything wrong, so don’t let a few bad encounters discourage you from trying to make friends.For example, if someone isn’t open to talking to you, they might just be busy or worried about their home life. They could even be feeling shy, too.
If you find yourself stewing over a rejection, make yourself think about a positive encounter you had instead.

Be a good listener.,
Have a positive attitude.,
Take it slowly.",How to Make Friends in School when You Are Extremely Shy3," Let your new friends know that you care about them by listening actively when they talk to you. Give them your full attention, and try to understand their experiences by stepping into their shoes. If a friend is feeling down, do your best to cheer them up.Many shy people are great listeners, so if you have this skill, make the most of it.

, People want to spend time with others who are positive and uplifting. Get into the habit of looking for the good side of every situation and every person you come across. If you are prone to complaining, tone it down, especially in the early stages of a friendship.You don’t have to act fake or be happy all the time, but a positive mindset will help you attract and keep more friends.

, Let your friendships develop naturally over time. Don’t try to force closeness – you can’t become someone’s best friend in a week. Enjoy the time you spend with your new friends without becoming clingy or needy.For instance, don’t start talking about your deepest personal issues if you’ve only known someone for a week or two.
If you’re not sure how much to talk to your friends, try to mirror their level of involvement in the relationship. For instance, if they text you every day, it’s probably okay for you to text them every day, too.

Go to cultural activities.,
Find events through social media.,
Use online socializing sites.,
Volunteer your time for a cause you support.,
Take part in free local events.",How to Make Friends in a New Place2," Many cultural organizations will arrange festivals or celebrations that take place at the same time as their home-country's traditional celebration.

Nextdoor
Meetup

, Volunteering will make you feel more connected to your local community and more socially at ease.Choosing to volunteer for a cause you believe in can also put you in contact with like-minded individuals who can easily turn into new friends. Think about volunteering at:Community cleanups
The Humane Society

Calm yourself if you are anxious.,
Engage your conversation partner(s).,
Build relationships through small talk.,
Start small.,
Transform acquaintances into friendships.",How to Make Friends in a New Place3," It's normal to feel anxiety when you're on your own in a new place, but this can make it difficult for you to approach new people and make friends. Make sure you start your day with a protein filled breakfast, like eggs or yogurt, and avoid caffeine.When you start feeling anxious, take a few deep breaths and remind yourself:


It's normal to be nervous when new somewhere.
Everything is OK. There's nothing wrong with being new to a place.
People move other places all the time and are just fine. I can make new friends, too!, When you introduce yourself, don't stop at ""hello""! Ask your conversation partners a question after you give your name, or add some extra information about yourself. You can do this simply by offering a quick greeting, your name, and adding a question. Some examples of this might look like:


""Hi, I'm Tony, what brings you to this party?""
""Hi, I'm Sarah, how do you know the host of the party?""
""Good to meet you, Tom. I'm Sam and I just moved from New York. The host is my next door neighbor - how do you know him?"", Even if you hate making small talk, you can't expect to jump into deep or personal conversations with people you've just met. There's nothing wrong with starting with safe, simple topics like work, hobbies, favorite books, movies, and so on.


You might also talk about differences between where you are now and where you used to live, like differences in climate or geography., It can be daunting thinking you have to rebuild your social life in a few weeks or months, and these feelings might make it difficult for you to put yourself out there and meet new people. Reach out to people you already have some kind of connection with, like acquaintances, classmates, coworkers, or the friends of closer friends. See if they have free time and would like to do something, like play ultimate frisbee or see a local festival., Meeting people is the first step to making friends someplace new, now you need to turn these acquaintances into friends! Follow up with people you think you might enjoy spending time with and invite them over for dinner or out to do something fun. As you become more comfortable with your acquaintances, ask questions about their personal lives to show him you're interested in becoming closer friends.


Always try to show interest, even if your acquaintance is on a topic you're indifferent about. Asking questions and showing interest can help build a friendship quickly.
Keep eye contact while talking and use the other person's name to improve your connection and help you remember the new name."

Exercise.",How to Get Through PMS," In many people, PMS symptoms can be controlled by the use of natural progesterone supplementation, using products such as Pro-gest Cream, which doesn't require a prescription. The cream is applied during the symptomatic period (usually the 2 weeks before menses). Possible side effects are mild (drowsiness, lethargy; headaches rarely). Symptoms such as cramps, anxiety-depression, headaches, and mood swings can be greatly relieved in many (but not all) cases, and the effects can be felt within 1 hour of application.


Note: those with a history of migraines may require a higher, prescription-strength dose; if the progesterone seems to help a little but not enough (reducing frequency of migraines, for example, but not eliminating them), you should contact a doctor experienced in natural (or bio-identical) hormone replacement.;
, In some cases, birth control pills make the symptoms better, but in some cases they make them worse. If you're taking them, you might try a month without them while using another non-hormonal form of birth control to see if it helps. If not, remember that you still need to use alternate birth control methods in the first month of taking birth control pills again (or when switching from one BC pill to another).


Birth control pills or other synthetic progestins can interfere and/or block the effect of natural progesterone. Choose one or the other, not both.

, If you suffer from menstrual cramps or any other physical pain during PMS and prefer not to use progesterone, purchase Midol, Pamprin, or Ibuprofen. Hot tea, hot showers or baths can raise body temperature, relax you, & reduce cramps.

,, You may find that taking extra iron supplements can reduce chocolate cravings. You probably could use the extra iron anyway...you're losing a lot during menstruation.

, This helps with cramps and overall soreness.


Note: Calcium can block iron absorption. If you are taking iron supplements as well, be sure to take them at different times of day!

, There are studies that show that people release more stress chemicals through tears than men.

, Try to elevate positive moods; such as playing an online game like Perfect World as a Rogue, where you can feel free to let out your emotions as you see fit.

, The less you stress, the more of your own hormones will be available to help you, and less additional hormone will be needed. Try to externalize stress (exercise is a good method) rather than internalizing it.

, Sleep more, treat yourself...this is the perfect time to get a manicure, facial, or haircut. Let the dry cleaners do your laundry. Order in Chinese food. Watch comedies. Create your own mini-spa. Relax with a glass of wine, a candlelit bubble bath, and easy listening music. Play an online game and join a faction like Rogue, where you can let out your stress killing monsters and at the same time also have people you can vent to about anything for an alternative support system!

,, People will notice and give you more compliments, especially if you wear a color, material, or clothing cut that flatters your shape. No matter what you choose: whether it is cute shoes, a sparkly pair of earrings, or a new updo, make that one accessory special!

, Studies show that even faking a smile reduces stress and puts you in a slightly better mood.

, They'll understand.

,, It releases endorphins, which will make you feel happier.

Drink plenty of water.You need to ensure that you are drinking about 8 glasses of water daily.,
Limit your intake of salt.,
Include complex carbohydrates in your diet.,
Switch high-fat dairy products with low-fat options.,
Limit the amount of red meat you eat.A very important way to get rid of gout during pregnancy is to minimize your intake of red meat as much as possible, along with other rich sources of purines.,
Eat more berries.,
Eat foods that are rich in vitamin C.Vitamin C is a strong anti-oxidant, which helps to build up the connective tissue and collagen at the affected joints after they have become inflamed and irritated.,
Monitor the kind of fat you eat.During pregnancy, you should stick to unsaturated fat sources like low-fat dairy products such as skimmed milk and light yogurt.",How to Get Rid of Gout when Pregnant1," During pregnancy, there is an increased amount of water in circulation. Some of this water escapes into the tissues, where they accumulate causing edema.


This can cause dehydration in the pregnant woman, which can aggravate gout. The woman has to compensate for the wasted amount of water by increasing her intake of fresh water.
Water helps to support the kidneys’ normal function by flushing them out and diluting the increased amount of uric acid crystals. This helps to reduce the amount of uric acid crystals being deposited in the joints, thereby improving symptoms and decreasing the frequency of gout attacks.
You should always have a bottle of water close at hand during pregnancy. Also remember you will need to drink additional water after physical activity or in hot weather.;
, Stay away from any kind of meals or snacks that contain a lot of salt. Salt contains high quantities of sodium, and high sodium levels increase your body's tendency to trap more water and fluids inside, and to gather at the end at your inflamed joints, making gout inflammation worse.


This means that you should avoid adding too much salt to your cooked meals. You should also stay away from fast food, as it contains huge amounts of salt. All kinds of salty snacks like potato chips and pretzels are not advised either.
You also have to take care to avoid hidden salt sources, such as canned food, as salt is used as a preservative substance for many canned food products.

, Complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables may help to reduce your gout symptoms. Steer clear of processed and refined carbohydrates, such as white flour baked goods, candy, sugary beverages, and anything that contains corn syrup.Try to include a serving or two of vegetables with every meal and eat a couple of servings of fruit per day as snacks.
Switch white flour with whole wheat flour in baking to get more whole grains into your diet.
Try swapping your normal pasta and rice with whole wheat pasta and brown rice.

, It is best to avoid high-fat dairy and other high fat proteins if you have gout. To cut back on fat, switch to low-fat dairy products, such as:low fat yogurt
1% or skim milk
low-fat cheese
low fat ice cream or frozen yogurt

,


Purines release uric acid when metabolized; therefore, reducing your intake of purine-rich foods is essential in avoiding gout attacks during pregnancy.
Foods that are high in purines include red meat, beef, bacon, lamb, venison, turkey, ham, duck, chicken, and organ meat such as brain, liver or kidneys, in addition to seafood like anchovies, sardines, crab, lobster, salmon, tuna, shellfish, oysters. Other sources of purines include lentils, asparagus, cauliflower, kidney beans, lima beans, oatmeal, peas, spinach and mushrooms,
You do not have to cut these foods from your diet entirely, but try to limit your intake to around 150 mg per day. Discuss your options with your doctor before switching to a low-purine diet.

, Berries are considered a good fruit choice for gout sufferers, as they both contain high amounts of an antioxidant substance called Anthocyanins.


These antioxidants can fight free radicals that are released as a result of cell and tissue damage caused by uric acid crystals. They have a powerful anti-inflammatory effect that can relieve inflammation in the joints affected by gout.
This means that they have the ability to reduce pain and swelling naturally. There is also some evidence to suggest that these anti-oxidants have the ability to lower uric acid concentration in the blood.
Anthocyanins are found in high levels in all berries, including blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and cherries.

, Vitamin C also enhances the kidney's function by decreasing levels of uric acid in the blood. Both of these things help in the treatment of gout.


The recommended daily amount of vitamin C to lower uric acid concentrations is 500 mg. Another source of vitamin C is citrus fruits like orange and lemon - these are alkalizing fruits that counteract uric acid's effect inside the body and decrease crystal formation and deposits in the affected joints.
This results in a significant decrease in painful gout attacks by lowering inflammation and swelling at the affected joint.

, Avoid eating saturated fats, such as those found in processed and fast food, whole dairy products or fat residues found in red meat.


Saturated fats are harmful to your body and can trigger a gout attack as they trap uric acid inside and minimize your body’s chances of getting rid of it. This results in the increased formation of uric acid crystals. These crystals are then deposited around your joints, stimulating and triggering gout attacks and increasing the number of painful episodes.
Additionally, saturated fats can easily increase your body weight, putting you at higher risk for obesity. Obesity is another trigger factor for gout as it puts additional body weight on your affected joints, increasing the stress on the irritated joint, exacerbating the inflammation and edema, and generally worsening your condition.
Taking control of your fat intake and sticking with healthy unsaturated fats will make a big difference to your disorder and help in improving any further gout attacks."

Do not douche.,
Rinse your vagina during your shower or bath.,
Wear loose clothing and cotton underwear.,
Wipe front to back after going to the bathroom.,
Change your tampon or pad every four to six hours.",How to Get Rid of Vaginal Odor Fast1," Douching, which is when you force water or a cleaning agent in your vagina, can actually remove the healthy bacteria in your vagina and can push an infection (if one is present) into your uterus, making your condition worse.You should also avoid feminine sprays, which are another form of douching that can irritate your vagina or lead to an allergic reaction.
Remember that your vagina naturally cleans itself. As long as you practice good vaginal hygiene, you should not have to force clean it or interfere with its natural cleaning process.;
, Be sure to keep your vaginal area clean by using water and mild, unscented soap, like Cetaphil, to rinse your vagina, including your labia.Avoid using harsh soaps on your vagina, with scents, as they can irritate the delicate skin in this area.

, This will increase airflow to your groin, especially when you are working out or sweating and prevent moisture buildup, which can then reduce any odors due to sweating or bacteria.You should also change out of your workout clothing as soon as you are finished your workout. Do not keep wet, sweaty clothes on any longer than necessary, as this can lead to unpleasant odors.
Always wear clean underwear every day to prevent bacteria growth and odor.

, Prevent spreading bacteria from your bottom to your vagina by wiping from the front to the back after a bowel movement. This will ensure your vagina is free of bacteria that could cause odors and a possible infection., Practice good period hygiene by being diligent about changing your tampon or pad every four to six hours. This will prevent a buildup of odor and ensure your vagina does not get irritated during your menstrual cycle.Changing your tampon frequently will also ensure you do not forgot to remove your tampon, which can cause an unpleasant odor and possibly serious health issues.

Know if you're at risk.,
Recognize the potential symptoms.,
Realize the potential complications.,
Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Ask your doctor about the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT).,
Think about getting swabbed also.",How to Get Tested for Chlamydia," Not everyone should get tested for chlamydia, but those at higher risk for the infection should at least once per year. Factors that greatly increase your risk of contracting a chlamydia infection include: having multiple sex partners over the course of a year; not using condoms consistently during sexual encounters; having a history of other sexually transmitted diseases or infections; and being sexually active and younger than 25 years old.Gay and bisexual men have a much greater risk of chlamydia infection compared to heterosexual men.


If you're over 25, consult your doctor for how often you should be screened. Other reasons why you should consider getting tested include: if you have any unusual discomfort or symptoms with your genitalia; if you think a condom ripped during sex; if one of your previous sex partners develops an STI; or if you're planning on getting pregnant.You can get a chlamydia infection by having vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who is infected. Ejaculation and exchange of semen is not necessary to get infected.
Being in a long-term monogamous relationship with a partner who doesn't have an STI and always using latex condoms during sex are the main ways of reducing your risk (in addition to abstinence, of course).;
, The early-stages of chlamydia infections rarely cause signs or symptoms, so waiting for them to appear before you get tested is never a good idea. When symptoms do occur, they usually start between 1-3 weeks after the initial exposure to the chlamydia bacteria.The main signs and symptoms associated with chlamydia include: painful urination, lower abdominal cramps, inflamed mucous membranes within the genitalia, smelly discharge from the vagina/penis, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding and testicular pain. Not all symptoms occur together or at all. For men, too, you can experience, mucoid or watery urethral discharge and painful urination.


When signs and symptoms do occur, they're often mild and fade away quickly, which makes it easy to overlook them.
Even if you have no symptoms, you can still pass the infection on to your sex partners.
Although quite unusual, a chlamydia bacterial infection can also cause a low-grade fever.

, There are numerous health complications associated with a chlamydia infection, which is why it's important to get tested and treated right away if you test positive. The most serious complication for women is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which causes pain and scarring in the uterus, ovaries and Fallopian tubes.Severe PID can lead to infertility due to scarring and obstruction within the Fallopian tubes. For men, the most serious complications are painful infections within the scrotum (epididymitis) and prostate gland (prostatitis). Chlamydia can't make men infertile, only women.


People with chlamydia infections are more likely to get other STIs, such as gonorrhea and HIV.
Chlamydia infections in both genders increases the risk of Reiter's syndrome, an inflammatory disease that leads to arthritis and swelling in the eyes and urethra.
Pregnant women with chlamydia can pass the infection to their babies during the birth process, which can lead to pneumonia and/or serious eye infections in newborns.If you have chlamydia, your future pregnancies are at a higher risk for being ectopic (a dangerous condition where the fetus implants outside the uterus).
A chlamydia infection during pregnancy also makes prematurity more likely.
There is also an uncommon condition called Fitzhugh-Curtis Syndrome, where PID evolves into an inflammation of the liver.

, If you are at higher risk for chlamydia or experience symptoms, then schedule an appointment with your doctor or gynecologist. Your doctor will give you an exam and take urine / blood tests to see if you have an infection. Remember that the main symptoms of chlamydia (pain with urination, vaginal / penile discharge) are not specific to chlamydia — virtually all STIs and urinary tract infections cause similar symptoms. The correct diagnosis is important because different infections require different treatments (different antibiotic or anti-viral medications).


Many medical organizations recommend chlamydia screening for sexually active women younger that 25 years because the infection is often without symptoms.Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea is usually done simultaneously as the two infections cause very similar symptoms.Women should not douche or use vaginal medicines for 24 hours prior to having a chlamydia test.
Try not to urinate for about 2 hours prior to having urine collected for chlamydia testing.
Taking antibiotics prior to chlamydia testing may affect the results (hide a positive test).

, The NAAT is the preferred test for chlamydia because it's more sensitive and specific than other tests, can be performed on urine samples from both genders.The NAAT is sensitive to the genetic material (DNA) of chlamydia bacteria — the test is able to amplify the DNA from a urine sample, so it's very accurate with a low percentage of false-positive results. Results take 1-2 days to come back from the lab in most cases.


Some medical organizations recommend that all victims of sexual assault get NAAT testing for both chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.

, An older method of diagnosing STIs is by swabbing the vaginal / penile discharge and sending it to the lab to grow a culture.If a bacterial culture grows, the lab tech looks under the microscope to identify which bacteria it is. Viral infections don't grow cultures, but bacterial infections do. Females get their cervix swabbed (which is at the back of the vagina), whereas men get their urethra swabbed (a thin swab is inserted about an inch into the opening of the penis). Results take between 5-7 days to come back from the lab.


Women can get swabbed for chlamydia during a routine Pap test, which checks for cancerous changes in cells.
Some women prefer to swab their own vaginas in privacy, which is fine if they use the same technique the doctor uses — a lubricated speculum is typically needed to spread the vagina open.
For men or women who primarily have anal sex, the doctor may swab the anus instead of the genitalia.

Gain a healthy amount of weight during your pregnancy.,
Apply ice to the affected joint.Icing the affected joint is very beneficial in reducing the swelling and accumulated fluids around the affected joint, in addition to easing other inflammation signs, like redness, warmth of the skin and pain.,
Elevate your inflamed joint.A pregnant woman should also elevate her affected joint to above heart level.,
Wrap your affected joint in a cold cabbage leaf.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Exercise regularly.Aerobic exercise that elevates your heart rate (such as riding a stationary bike, walking, or swimming) at least three times a week can be helpful in improving gout.,
Try drinking dandelion tea.,
Sip coffee in moderation.",How to Get Rid of Gout when Pregnant2," Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may make your gout symptoms worse. However, you should not try to lose weight during your pregnancy. Focus on healthy eating and gaining an appropriate amount of weight during your pregnancy. Even if you are obese, you will still need to gain between 11 to 20 pounds during your pregnancy.Speak to your doctor for specific dietary and weight gain recommendations during your pregnancy.
If you are carrying twins, triplets, or more, then you will need to gain even more weight during your pregnancy. Talk to your doctor to find out what is healthy for you.

,


The cooling effect of ice will cause vasoconstriction of the capillaries around the affected joint, thereby limiting the amount of the leaked fluids and helping to treat the localized edema (swelling) at the inflamed joint.
You should never apply ice cubes directly onto your skin as this can easily cause tissue damage. Instead, wrap the ice or the ice pad in a cotton towel then place it on the affected joint.
If no ice is available, then you can also use a pack of frozen vegetables, such as corn or peas. Wrap the bag in a paper or cloth towel before using.
Ice the affected area for about twenty minutes, three or four times daily to decrease pain and inflammation.

, If the affected joint is part of her lower extremities, such as the big toe; she is advised to sit or lie down while supporting her ankle with a cushion beneath. The same goes for the ankles and knees.


If the affected joints include the elbows, wrists or fingers, support them with cushions raised to chest level using the aid of an armchair or desk.

, A natural solution that any woman can use to suppress the edema (swelling) around her injured joint is to use cold fresh cabbage leaves.


Cabbage leaves are a very traditional way to get rid of swollen joints. They contain very strong anti-inflammatory components, such as sinigrin, lactic acid and vitamin C, which are all known to have antioxidant and antibacterial agents. This gives the cabbage leaves their natural powers to fight swelling and decrease edema.
It's a good idea to put the cabbage leaves in the fridge so they are nice and cold before use. When you are ready to use them, take a leaf and wrap it around your big toe (for example) then wrap a bandage around it to keep it still. You may need to remove the harder, middle stem of the cabbage to make it easier to wrap.
Leave the cabbage wrap on overnight, as it can help to ease the gout attacks that tend to happen at nighttime. Alternatively, you can use the cabbage wraps during the day, for four to six hours at a time.

, If you are having any painful gout attacks that are affecting joints in your upper body like the wrists or fingers, make sure to avoid using tight accessories for a while, like bracelets or rings.


These closed accessories can form an additional source of pressure on the swollen, irritated joints and this can be a real annoyance, especially in the last trimester of pregnancy.
If you notice any signs of edema (swelling) at your wrists or fingers, remove your jewelry, and consult your doctor immediately, before any gout attacks begin.

, However, do not do exercise that causes pain to your affected joints; for instance, if your big toe is affected with gout and it hurts to walk, opt for a different exercise instead such as riding a stationary bike at the gym.

, Another safe, natural way to ease the swelling of joint inflammation caused by gout is by drinking dandelion tea. Dandelion is a natural herb that helps the kidneys by excreting all the extra unwanted fluids from the body.


Dandelion is a natural diuretic that is very helpful in easing and treating localized edema at the affected joints. This is explained by its high concentrations of potassium which works to decrease accumulated fluids in the body and balance the body's minerals.
The tea can be made by adding one teaspoon of dried dandelion leaves to one glass of water, which should then be boiled. The tea should be allowed to steep for five minutes before drinking.
Discuss the use of dandelion leaves with your doctor first, as he or she may advise against you drinking it if you have any gall bladder diseases, if you are taking any blood thinners, or are at risk for hyperkalemia (increase in potassium levels in blood) because you are taking a potassium sparing diuretic at the same time.

, A moderate amount of caffeinated coffee may help to ease gout symptoms as well.However, make sure that you do not drink more than one eight ounce serving of coffee per day while you are pregnant.

Ask your doctor about medications and other treatment options.,
Try a medication called Colchicine.This is a pill that can be prescribed by your doctor as one of the first-line treatments for an acute attack of gout.,
Opt for corticosteroids.Corticosteroids such as Prednisone are typically considered by your doctor as a secondary option after NSAIDs and/or Colchicine.,
Prevent a recurrence of gout with Allopurinol.Allopurinol works to directly lower your uric acid levels, hence treating and preventing further episodes of gout.",How to Get Rid of Gout when Pregnant3," Most of the medications used to treat gout are considered ""Category C"" by the FDA. What this means is that there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether they are safe or unsafe during pregnancy.Instead of medications, your doctor will usually recommend changes to your diet and lifestyle first.
However, if you have very severe gout (or alternatively, if your gout persists after you have given birth), your doctor may advise you to consider medications.
Note that you should NOT opt for medication use without first consulting your doctor.

, It is extremely effective; however, the evidence supporting its use in pregnant women is inconclusive so far.


Talk to your doctor about the potential risks of taking this drug versus its potential benefits.

, The corticosteroids can be taken in pill form, or injected directly into the affected joint to reduce inflammation - this is likely your best bet, especially while you are pregnant, as a local injection will pose less of a risk of harm to your fetus.

, As you recover from your acute gout attack, Allopurinol may be something to consider moving forwards to give the best chance that this does not happen again.


Your doctor may suggest Allopurinol after giving birth to prevent recurrences of gout.

If you have recurring yeast infections, eating yogurt every day is good, healthy option for eliminating vaginal odor caused by yeast infections.Check that the yogurt contains live and active cultures to ensure it will help your body produce more yeast.

, Eating certain foods and drinks can actually change your vaginal smell, as the foods you consume can cause your body to release certain odors. If you are concerned about your vaginal odor, avoid drinking coffee and alcohol. You should also avoid onions, food made with strong spices, red meat, or dairy.Keep in mind you would need to consume a high amount of these foods to change your vaginal secretions enough to cause a strong odor.

Your doctor can confirm you have BV during a check up.
Certain activities, like unprotected sex and frequent douching, can increase your risk of developing BV.

, You may also experience pain when you urinate. These are symptoms of trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by a parasite. Men who have trichomoniasis usually display no symptoms, so both partners should be treated for this STI once it is diagnosed.You should always practice safe sex and use condoms to reduce your risk of getting trichomoniasis.

, You may also experience itching, soreness, and a burning sensation when you urinate or have intercourse. These are all symptoms of a yeast infection. This infection occurs when there is an overgrowth of yeast in your vagina., These could be signs that the odor is due to hormonal changes during menstruation or between ovulation and your next period. You are susceptible to unpleasant vaginal odors during these stages of your cycle.Depending on your age and your medical history, you could also be experiencing another hormonal change: menopause. Women can experience a smelly, watery discharge during menopause.

, When your whole body sweats, your vagina can end up smelling sweaty and unpleasant. Your external genitals have a special gland called apocrine sweat glands, which are also found in your armpits, nipples, ear canals, eyelids, and the wings of your nostrils. These glands release an oily fluid that is metabolized by the bacteria on the surface of your skin, thereby letting off a noticeable smell.Wearing tight clothing and sweating in tight clothing can make the odor worse by trapping sweat and bacteria onto your skin. If you are overweight, it may be difficult for your body to release odors around your groin due to skin folds from excess weight.

, If you forget to remove your tampon, this can cause a buildup of menstrual blood and bacteria. This buildup can irritate your vagina, causing itching and a strong, unpleasant smell and discharge.If you realize you forgot to remove your tampon, you should see your gynecologist immediately. She can safely remove it for you and treat any infection due to the forgotten tampon.

Avoid drinking alcohol while on Metronidazole and Tinidazole and for at least one day after completing treatment with either drug.
Recurrence of BV symptoms within three to 12 months of treatment is common. If your symptoms recur, talk to your doctor about other treatment options.

, Your doctor will test a sample of your vaginal fluid to confirm you have this STI. She will then prescribe one megadose of either metronidazole or tinidazole. If you have a sexual partner, you and your partner should both be treated for trichomoniasis.Avoid sexual intercourse until one week after treatment, when the infection is cured. You should not drink alcohol 24 hours after taking metronidazole or 72 hours after taking tinidazole, as this can cause severe nausea and vomiting.

, Your doctor will perform a pelvic exam and take a sample of your vaginal secretions to confirm you have a yeast infection.If you have an uncomplicated yeast infection, with mild to moderate symptoms and infrequent episodes of yeast infections, your doctor will prescribe a one time application or one to three day application of an antifungal cream, an ointment, a tablet, or a suppository.

Do some exercise.,
Do yoga.,
Have an orgasm.",How to Get Rid of Period Cramps when Medicine Does Not Work1," For many, the thought of exercising while menstruating is laughable. However, being a little active helps to easy belly pain. It releases beta-endorphins that act as our body's natural painkiller.These painkillers burn the chemicals that cause uterine contractions much faster. Try anything that gets your heart pumping, like:


Brisk walking.
Jogging.
Swimming.
Biking.
Skating.
Regularly exercising before, during, and after your period will benefit your entire body, especially if you're prone to painful menstrual cramps.;
, Yoga helps to stretch out cramping muscles, as well as activates your body's natural painkilling endorphins. It is especially helpful in relieving back pain, sore legs, and abdominal pain due to your period. Yoga is also a great breathing exercise that helps to lessen stress levels which affects menstrual cramps, making you more relaxed. Try these poses:Head-To-Knee Forward Bend: Sit with your legs extended in front of you, with your toes facing upwards. Bend the right knee so that the sole of your foot presses against your inner thigh. If that is too far for your to bend, rest your foot on your inner calf instead. Exhale as you slowly bend forward while reaching from your groin to your extended left foot. Keep your gaze locked at your extended foot. Plant your bottom or ""sit bones"" firmly into the ground. Take deep breaths, in and out, and stay in this pose for 1 to 3 minutes. Do the same for your other leg.

Camel Pose: Kneel on the floor with your knees hip-width apart. Turn your thighs inward only slightly, while keeping your shins and the top of your feet planted on the ground. Let your hands hang behind your hips with your fingers to the ground. Inhale as you lift up your chest while pressing your shoulders down to your hips. Exhale as you push your hips forward and arch your back. Your fingers should graze the top of your calves or the heels of your feet. Use your hands to steady yourself and drop your head back. Taking deep breaths, in and out, do this post for 30 to 60 seconds.

Forward Bend: Stand with your feet together and arms at your side. Plant your feet into the ground and inhale while slowly reaching your arms towards the ceiling. Exhale while you bring your arms out and down as your start to bend forward until your hands touch the floor. Flatten your hand on the floor. If you can't reach the floor, bend your knees. Keep this pose for 1 minute while you breathe steadily in and out.

, In the same way that exercising works, having an orgasm releases endorphins to help with pain. The extra heat and increased blood flow also aids in relieving cramps. Orgasms also induce sleep, which is also a vital part of pain reduction.You don't have to have sex to achieve orgasm. Women who masturbate often report that it helps them relieve menstrual pains and symptoms.It is completely possible to have sex while on your period. Be sure your partner consents to having sex while you're menstruating. It can often get messy, but if you do it in a safe and healthy way, you can enjoy the benefits of sex even on your period.

Know what needs to happen to prevent it.,
So you have that horrible feeling of a UTI coming on, or perhaps you already have one.,
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add Neem leaves.,
Start drinking the Neem tea.,
Continue to drink the Neem tea and take the D-mannose capsules or powder frequently throughout the day.,
Your symptoms should subside within 4-6 hours.",How to Get Rid of a UTI Without Medication,"  UTIs are painful, inconvenient, expensive to treat, and taking loads of antibiotics frequently isn't good for your body.  It may even make future infections resistant to antibiotics and make women more susceptible to yeast infections.  For both men and women, I recommend three things that will make a profound difference.


Practice good hygiene.  A big cause of UTIs is e. coli, which can come from your digestive system.  Sexual activity, from the constant movement, can push this type of bacteria into the urethra. Always make sure your privates are clean from the front to back.  Washing the genitals with water (or an intimate cleanser) and washing your behind with warm soap and water in the shower will help immensely. Baby wipes after using the bathroom can be used too.
Always, ALWAYS pee after sex.  Many people claim this interferes with 'cuddle' time, but you can cuddle after going to the bathroom.  This is the single most overlooked and ignored step that prevent UTIs more than anything.  Peeing after sex can flush out any bacteria that may have been pushed into your urethra. Explaining this to your partner can ease any frustration, and they should be able to understand.
Of course, make sure you are hydrated enough so that you can go to the bathroom frequently.  Drink lots of water!;
,  There are only two things you will need. Yes, only two. AGAIN: If you are on any medication, have strong taste aversion, or are pregnant, please DO NOT attempt this.


Dried Neem leaves (can be found in an Indian grocery or online) WARNING: Do NOT use Neem Oil, this is the oil from the same plant and is toxic when ingested, not powder, ONLY the dried leaves.
D-Mannose powder (can be found online or at Whole Foods in capsule form)

,  This will brew a strong, bitter tea that is naturally anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.  It is also known as an abortifacient, which is why it is not recommended for pregnant women.


Put a few ice cubes in the pot to cool down the tea, since you will want to start drinking it immediately.

,  With the first glass, take your first dose of d-mannose powder.  You can't really overdose on d-mannose since it is a naturally derived from cranberries, so I recommend taking 3-4 capsules every hour or so.


The neem tea has a very bitter taste, and is highly unpleasant to drink because of its bad taste.  If you can, try to drink the rest of your tea in the pot throughout the day.  If needed, drink water in between if the taste is too strong.

,  You should be urinating quite a lot due to the high fluid intake, and both should flush bacteria out of the bladder and urethra.

,  If not, then I would highly recommend scheduling an appointment with your primary physician or OB/GYN as soon as possible. In serious cases, UTIs can lead to kidney infections, so it is imperative to treat the problem swiftly.  If all else fails, you can find your nearest Minute Clinic at a local drugstore and they should be able to prescribe you antibiotics.  Last resort: go to the hospital if none of these options are available.

Investigate ovarian reserve testing.,
Check if you meet the criteria.,
Understand the limitations of ovarian reserve testing.,
Make an appointment with a fertility clinic.",How to Get Ovarian Reserve Testing Done1," “Ovarian reserve testing” can involve a variety of different tests used to determine the approximate quantity (and in some cases, quality) of a person’s remaining eggs. This can be done to assess their levels of fertility and/or the viability of freezing their eggs. Available ovarian reserve tests include both biochemical markers (such as FSH, estradiol, antimüllerian hormone, and inhibin B) and ovarian ultrasonic imaging (to determine antral follicle count and ovarian volume).This test is often performed as part of the initial evaluation for infertility patients.
This test is also performed prior to egg freezing.
This test may also be performed on transmen who'd like to freeze eggs prior to transition.
Depending on which clinic you choose, these tests can run anywhere from $150 to $500.;
, Most often, ovarian reserve testing is performed on women 35 or older who have been attempting pregnancy for at least six months, or on women who have other risk factors. These risk factors include a history of cancer treated with gonadotoxic therapy, pelvic irradiation, or both; medical conditions treated with gonadotoxic therapy; or ovarian surgery for endometriomas.Additionally, this test may be important for individuals interested in freezing eggs.
This includes folks transitioning from female-to-male, who'd like to start a family later.

, Many people may feel compelled to determine the size of their ovarian reserve. However, it should be noted that these results can be quite ambiguous, imperfect, and difficult to interpret. This is why home fertility tests are not recommended. Prepare to take the results of an ovarian reserve test with a grain of salt, and discuss all options with a healthcare provider before jumping to conclusions., If you’d like to have your ovarian reserve tested, perform an internet search for fertility clinics in your area. (Alternatively, you may contact your insurance company for approved options.) Make an appointment with a local clinic to go in and discuss your options. You may try this with several clinics until you find the right one for you. When you find a fertility clinic and doctor that you trust, make an appointment to move forward with your test (or tests).


Not all fertility practices are LGBTQ friendly and/or knowledgeable.
Transmen and other LGBTQ families should get referrals from friends or other doctors whenever possible."

Review the abortion laws in your country.,
Use the National Health Service.,
Opt for services at a private clinic.",How to Get an Abortion in the United Kingdom1," Under the Abortion Act of 1967, abortions are legal and can be performed at or before 24 weeks of pregnancy in England, Wales, and Scotland. The laws in Northern Ireland are different than the rest of the U.K.Abortions after 24 weeks are only permitted when the pregnancy poses a substantial risk to the mother or if there is significant evidence of fatal fetal abnormalities.


Two doctors must agree that it is in the patient’s best interest to terminate the pregnancy.This usually includes your general practitioner and the doctor performing the procedure.;
, The U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) provides free medical care to citizens of England, Scotland, and Wales.Abortions are free at NHS clinics and hospitals. Your medical history and procedures are kept confidential. Your doctor or a professional at a sexual health service will refer you to a certified and licensed NHS clinic or hospital.

, If you wish to terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible, seeking care at a private clinic may be the best option for you. You will most likely have a consultation and the procedure within one week.Details concerning your health and the procedure are confidential. The cost of an abortion at a private clinic can range from £400 to £800 or more, while a later term procedure can cost around £2,000."

Consume an additional 500 calories per day.,
Consume more healthy fats.,
Eat more protein.,
Cook using oil or butter.,
Drink more calories.,
Increase your portion sizes.,
Eat frequently.,
Eat more snacks.,
Improve the taste of your food.,
Eat a little more quickly.,
Gain muscle mass.,
Quit smoking.,
Keep a food journal.,
Stay committed.,
Stay healthy.",How to Gain Weight (for Women)," An extra 500 calories per day is enough to help you gain weight, but should not leave you feeling sluggish, bloated or sick.


Just by gaining an extra 500 calories a day (which is pretty easy if you follow the instructions below) you can aim to gain between 1lb and 1.5 lbs per week.
However, it is important to be aware that these extra 500 calories should be gained in a healthy way, by eating more calorie-rich foods that are still packed with vitamins in nutrients.
Gaining weight by eating more junk food is not a good idea, as it will leave you feeling unwell and sapped of energy, and could lead to further health problems down the line.
You should always consult with your doctor or nutritionist before embarking on a weight gain plan.;
, Foods containing healthy fats are full of nutrients and also high in calories, making them a great option for weight gain.


Foods containing plant fats should be your first option - this includes items such as nuts, seeds, peanut butter, avocados and olive oil.
Spread peanut butter (or almond butter) on toast, eat half an avocado with every meals, eat handfuls of nuts or seeds as a snack and sprinkle olive oil over salads and veggies.
You can also gain some healthy fats from animal sources, however these foods also contain saturated fats (the unhealthy kind) so you should only eat in moderation.
Foods containing healthy animals fats include lean meats and full fat dairy products - although if you have high cholesterol, you should probably stick to low-fat options.

, Protein-rich foods are your best friend when you're trying to gain weight healthily. They help to build lean muscles, rather than adding much fat. Eating protein is particularly important if you plan on doing strength gaining exercises.


Good sources of protein include lean meat, fish and poultry, in addition to eggs, whole grains, dairy products and legumes. You should aim to eat about 5oz of protein per day, from a combination of these sources.
You can also increase your protein intake by drinking protein shakes, or adding a protein supplement to juices and smoothies.

, One easy way to increase your calorie intake with each meal without the necessity of actually eating more food is to cook using oil or butter.


Try stir frying your vegetables in a knob of butter, or drizzling a little olive oil over salads and cooked veggies. Simply by adding a tablespoon of these fats to each dish, you could be adding 100 calories!
However, it's important not to go overboard when cooking in fat, as too much can be unhealthy. When possible, gravitate to healthier fats like olive, canola or safflower oil and avoid using unhealthy ones like lard or margarine.

, Another good trick for increasing your calorie intake is to simply to consume more calorie-laden drinks. This will help you to gain weight without ruining your appetite or causing you to feel bloated.


Try drinking a large glass of orange juice in the mornings (along with your normal breakfast), it's high in calories and is tasty and refreshing too!
Consider drinking a glass or two of milk throughout the day - the full fat option is high in calories but will also provide lots of protein and calcium - which is ideal for thinner people who are more prone to lower bone densities.
Protein shakes will help you to gain muscle mass, particularly if you're working out, while tasty milkshakes are perfect for the occasional treat.

, Try eating just a little bit more with each meal than you normally would, even if you have to push yourself slightly past your comfort zone.


Over time, your stomach will adjust to the bigger portion size and you will no longer notice the difference.
One good trick to help you with this is to try serving your food on larger plates - this will trick your brain into thinking that you're eating less than you actually are.

, Try eating more often than you normally would, and never skip meals. In fact, most experts agree that eating six mini-meals a day is better than eating three large ones.


This can help you with your weight gain as you'll feel less bloated after each meal.
Try to get a balance of protein, starch, vegetables and fat with each meal.

, Try to incorporate more snacks into your daily routine, as these can be a great way of adding calories without having to eat too much.


Grab a handful of nuts while you're watching TV, eat a banana on your way to work, or spread some hummus on wholegrain crackers while you're waiting for dinner.

, People who are underweight often complain that food just doesn't appeal to them.


Therefore, it's a good idea to make your food more appealing by experimenting with herbs and spices and by making new dishes that you've never tried before.
You can also improve the flavor of food by adding tasty toppings - like a dollop of full-fat mayonnaise to a turkey sandwich, a sprinkling of cashew nuts over a stir-fry or salad, or a handful of cheese over homemade tacos or spaghetti bolognese.

, Dieters are often advised to eat more slowly, as this helps their brain to register that they are full before they can overeat. The opposite goes for those who are trying to gain weight.


Eating a little faster than normal can help you to consume more food before you start to feel full, thus increasing your calorie intake.
Don't go too fast though, as this can leave you feeling bloated and sick.

, It's a good idea to continue to exercise while you attempt to gain weight the healthy way. However, it's probably best to lay off the cardio (which burns those hard-earned calories) and focus on strength training instead (which builds muscle mass and helps you to gain weight).


Strength training includes working with weights and performing exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, bicep curls, crunches, chin-ups and leg curls.
If you've never done strength training before, it's a good idea to enlist the help of a personal trainer who can show you how to perform the exercises safely and correctly.
Just keep in mind that the more you exercise, the more calories you will need to consume to replace those you lost while working out. This is where protein shakes and bars really come in handy. Luckily, exercising should also increase your appetite.

, Smoking is a bad idea for those who are trying to gain weight as it suppresses the appetite.


Although it won't be easy, quitting is the healthiest option - not only will it increase your appetite but it will improve your overall appearance, not to mention the health of your lungs.
If quitting seems too extreme, at least avoid smoking for an hour or two before meals.

, Keeping a food journal will allow you to keep track of your weight gain and enable you to see which methods are working and which or not.


Make a note of every calorie you consumed that day and every calorie you burned (to the best of your knowledge). Also write down your weight after each weekly weigh in.
See the numbers written down in black and white will help you to figure out what your you're doing wrong or what you could improve on.
It will also help to keep you motivated once you begin to see progress.

, Gaining weight is not an easy process - in fact, gaining weight can be much harder than losing it. However, it is important that you stay committed and keep your eyes on the prize.


Set small, manageable goals for yourself - like aiming to gain 4 pounds in a month. This will give you something more tangible to work towards.
If you set your goals too high, it's easy to become overwhelmed and feel like giving up.

, The most important thing through the entire weight gain process is to stay healthy - eating a balanced diet and continuing to exercise throughout.


Bingeing on junk food many seem like the easier option, but your overall health will suffer and you will not be able to maintain the weight in the long run.
Remember than you're not just trying to gain weight - you're trying to overhaul your entire attitude towards food.

Take a hot bath or shower.,
Apply a heating pad or bottle to your abdomen.,
Drink hot beverages.",How to Get Rid of Period Cramps when Medicine Does Not Work2," Warmth or heat helps to relax the contracting muscles of your uterus and other sore places. Athletes usually take hot showers right after they exercise to help soothe their muscles and prevent soreness the days following.


For some people, being in water helps to slow the flow of their periods, making it possible to stay in the tub, blood-free. In a tub, the water acts to push against your vagina and slow down the flow. However, if you sit long enough, you'll most likely see blood flow out.

, Similar to a hot bath and shower, heat helps to relax muscles and encourage increased blood flow to reduce pain. Use a hot water bottle or heating pad on your stomach for about 15 minutes.

Ginger tea. It is an antispasmodic herb that helps relieve pain and reduce bloating. It also helps oxygenate your body which works to relieve stress. If you don't have powdered ginger, grate a tablespoon of real ginger, mix it with hot water, and let it steep for 5 minutes before drinking.

Chamomile tea. This tea helps reduce inflammation and has glycine which reduces muscle spasms and relaxes the nerves.Red raspberry tea. This herb is often hailed as a go-to tea to help with premenstrual symptoms. The tea contains fragarine that assists in helping tighten and tone the muscles in your pelvic region. It also contains tannins that treats cramps, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. However, in order to benefit from this tea, it should be taken regularly and best ingested before your period., Coffee can irritate the intestines and cause your blood vessels to restrict blood flow to your body. Try to drink decaffeinated coffees and teas.


Some teas do have caffeine in them so if you're particularly sensitive to caffeine, make sure to find out if your tea of choice has caffeine or offers a decaffeinated version of it.

, Alcohol stores up water in your body which can cause excess bloating and aggravate menstrual cramps. It can also lower magnesium levels in your body which is used to regulate muscle function and blood sugar levels.


Limit yourself to one glass of wine or bottle of beer if you have to drink alcohol.

Undergo a “Day 3 FSH Test.” Perhaps the most common way to assess your ovarian reserve is to determine your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).,
Opt for a “Clomid Challenge Test.” The Clomid Challenge Test is another way to assess your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and health of your ovarian reserve.,
Take an AMH test.,
Measure your levels of Inhibin B. Inhibin B is a protein hormone created by your ovaries, and secreted by small, developing follicles.",How to Get Ovarian Reserve Testing Done2," The “Day 3 FSH test” is a blood test that measures your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone on the third day of your cycle. It is done on the third day because this is when estrogen (estradiol) levels should be at their lowest.High estradiol levels can alter the appearance of FSH. As such, estradiol levels should always be tested in conjunction with FSH.
In women with irregular or infrequent menstruation, both FSH and estradiol levels can be taken at random. If estradiol levels are low, then the FSH levels can be counted.
FSH levels below 10 miu/ml are considered normal. Levels between 10-15 miu/ml are thought to be “borderline.”

, In this test, your FSH levels will also be checked on Day 3 of your cycle. Then, you’ll be given Clomid for days 5-9, and your FSH will be tested again on day 10. Clomid is a “selective estrogen receptor modulator.” The presence of this drug in your system should cause your FSH levels to rise. By day 10, your body should be able to bring this your FSH levels back down to normal. Higher FSH levels on day 10 can indicate a low ovarian reserve., The AMH test is a blood test that assesses your antimüllerian hormone levels. AMH is a substance produced only in small ovarian follicles. Levels of this hormone are thought to reflect a women’s remaining egg supply (or ovarian reserve). AMH levels can be tested on any day of a women’s cycle.Higher-than-usual levels of AMH may be present in women diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.
AMH levels are commonly used to determine how well women may respond to infertility drugs.

, Testing these levels (via blood test) on the third day of your cycle is thought to help determine both the quantity and quality of your remaining ovarian reserve.Unfortunately, this test may not be available at all fertility clinics.
This test may be especially helpful for women with unexplained fertility issues.

Assess your antral follicle count.,
Calculate your ovarian volume.,
Consider a “combined” ovarian reserve test.",How to Get Ovarian Reserve Testing Done3," Antral follicles are tiny structures that contain immature eggs. A transvaginal ultrasound can be performed to visually assess your antral follicle count (AFC). Determining this count can provide an estimate of the number of remaining eggs present in each of your ovaries.This test is considered more accurate than FSH testing for older women (greater than 44 years old).
Your FSH levels can vary from month to month, while your AFC will remain relatively stable.

, A transvaginal ultrasonic test can also be used to measure your ovarian volume. The size (volume) of your ovaries can also help indicate the number of remaining eggs in your reserve. By measuring your ovaries on three planes and using some calculation, your doctor should be able to determine your ovarian volume.This test alone is not the most accurate indicator of ovarian reserve or fertility.
This information can be useful, however, when placed in conjunction with other results.

, For some women, a combination of biochemical and imaging (ultrasound) techniques can provide the most accurate assessment of their ovarian reserve. Since no single fertility test can boast 100% accuracy, multiple methods are often combined.Discuss this carefully with your healthcare provider, and select the best 1-2 tests for you.
The combination of too many tests can actually cloud results and lead to confusion.

Look for an abortion provider in your area.,
Call the facility and ask about their services.,
Ask about pricing.,
Find a provider in states where it’s difficult.,
Familiarize yourself with state laws.,
Never try it yourself.,
Make an initial appointment with your chosen provider.,
Decide what type of abortion to have.,
Make plans for the day of the procedure.,
Follow instructions for aftercare.,
Talk with people you trust when you’re weighing your decision.,
Watch out for “Crisis Pregnancy Centers."",
Educate yourself on the political side of abortion.,
Get support after the abortion if you need it.",How to Get an Abortion (USA)," You may already know of a place where someone you know has had an abortion, like a local women's health clinic that provides abortion as well as birth control and other reproductive health services. If you don't know of a provider and don't feel comfortable asking around, look online at Planned Parenthood's website for a list of providers near you.Just enter your zip code and a list of options will come up.


If you trust your family doctor, you can ask for a referral. Your doctor may be able to give you contact information for a provider, either in a local hospital or at a health clinic. However, not all are willing to give referrals.
Be wary of advertisements for providers or clinics in the phonebook or online. Sometimes doctors who are not licensed to provide abortions advertise in these places. Stick with providers you've heard of before or those referred by someone you know and trust.;
, Ask up front if they actually perform abortions there, since some women's health centers just give referrals. It might help to write down a list of other questions you want to ask before making your appointment, like how many times you'll need to visit before you can get an abortion, whether you can bring a friend with you, and what information you'll need to provide.


You might want to check out the clinic to make sure you’re comfortable there. Licensed facilities are clean, well-maintained and professional, with friendly staff. If something makes you feel uncomfortable, see if there's a better option.
Never get an abortion in someone’s house or in an illegal clinic. If you're not sure whether the place is legitimate, ask for the abortion provider's name and confirm that he or she is a board-certified obstetrician.

, For a first trimester abortion, pricing usually ranges from $300 to $1,000. Prices vary depending on how long you've been pregnant. A late-term abortion can be more expensive, since it involves a different type of procedure. Hospitals generally charge more than women's health clinics. If you're worried about how to pay for an abortion, there are usually options available to help cover the cost.


Some clinics have a sliding scale or payment plans available so you don't have to pay the entire cost at once.
Sometimes health insurance can cover it, though in most cases insurance covers birth control but not abortion. Check with your insurance company to find out more.
If you're not insured, another option is to get help from an abortion fund. An abortion fund is a group of people who care about reproductive rights and help people who can't afford abortions to cover the cost of the procedure., Some states have passed so many strict laws regarding abortion that many clinics have shut down. This can make it hard to find a place to get an abortion, especially if you don't have a car to drive to the nearest city with a clinic. If you’re in a city without an abortion provider, you still have options.


Figure out where the closest clinic is. Check out major cities, even if they aren't in the same state you live in.
See if you can arrange transportation and stay with a friend or family member there. You'll have to do a little extra planning, since most providers require that you come in at least two times: once for the initial consultation and again for the abortion.
See if there’s a program designed to help people in your situation. Call the clinic where you want to have the procedure and tell them your situation. Nonprofit reproductive rights groups often provide transportation and housing to people who need to travel from out of town.

, Different states have different requirements regarding when, where and how an abortion can be performed. For example, some states have passed a law stating that abortions must be performed in a hospital, while others allow it to be performed in a separate medical facility. Learning about the status of abortion in your state will help you navigate the process more easily. If you have questions, call up a local abortion provider to discuss your situation and find out if there are any specific requirements you need to know about.


Each state has its own requirements regarding parental consent. If you're under 18, your state might require that you get your parents' permission to have an abortion. If you're uncomfortable with this, you can ask a judge to give you a ""judicial bypass,"" or waive the requirement so you can get an abortion without asking your parents.In some states you might be required to get pre-abortion counseling, get an ultrasound, or wait a certain amount of time between your first consultation and the abortion appointment.
In some states it is illegal to get an abortion after six months of pregnancy. After that point, you need to go to another state and possibly acquire an out-of-state judicial bypass.

, The process of getting an abortion, from finding a provider to discussing your options with a counselor to going through the procedure and paying for it, can be intimidating. Some people are tempted to try to end the pregnancy on their own so they don't have to tell anyone else they're pregnant. This is an extremely dangerous thing to do, and should not be considered under any circumstances.


Self-abortions often lead to severe injury and death. They are most common in places where abortion is illegal.Legal abortions are one of the most common procedures done in the US, and are extremely safe when performed in a clean facility by a licensed provider.More than one-third of adult women are estimated to have had at least one abortion., When you call the provider you've chosen, you'll schedule an appointment to take place in the next few days. On the day of the appointment, you'll talk with a counselor, take a pregnancy test and discuss the different options available to you.


You will be asked to fill out some paperwork regarding your medical history. Make sure to answer the questions honestly so that you'll receive the right kind of care.
Remember that you can change your mind at any time. If your discussion with the counselor leaves you feeling you'd rather not have an abortion, you can absolutely decide against it.

, The available options will be different depending on how long you've been pregnant. Your counselor will help you figure out which one is right for your situation. Each type of procedure is safe and effective.


Aspiration is the most common type of abortion procedure, and is usually available through the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. You'll receive an examination and light sedation that allows you to stay awake the whole time. A tube is inserted into the cervix, and a suction device is used to remove the fetus.It takes no more than 10 minutes.
Dilation and evacuation (D&E) is similar to aspiration, but it's performed after the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. Medication is administered to dilate the cervix, and a suction device is used to remove the fetus. The procedure takes 10 to 20 minutes, not counting the time it takes to prepare the cervix.The abortion pill is another option you can choose for a first trimester abortion. In a chemical abortion, you're giving two types of medication to take: one that encourages the lining of the uterus to break down, and one that causes it to empty (misoprostol).It causes cramps and bleeding, and a follow-up appointment is recommended.

, Plan to get there a few minutes early so the appointment doesn't run behind. The total time you'll spend at the facility can be anywhere from two to four hours, depending on how long you have to wait. In most cases you'll receive and ultrasound and an examination before the actual abortion takes place, and you'll spend an hour or so recovering before it's time to leave. You might want to bring a friend to stay with you at the facility and drive you home afterward.


Follow the instructions you were given at your first appointment regarding how to physically prepare for the abortion. You should not eat or drink during the two hours prior to the abortion, and you should not use alcohol after midnight the night before.You might feel low energy for the rest of the day after you have the abortion. Plan to take it easy on the day of your appointment and for the next few days. You might want to arrange to take a day off of work, or schedule the procedure for a weekend so you have time to rest.

, You'll be given a packet of instructions on how to care for yourself after the abortion. You'll experience light to moderate bleeding and light cramping, which should subside within a few hours.You'll be instructed to get medical attention immediately if bleeding persists.


Don’t have sex at first, but you can take a shower as soon as you want to.
Go in for follow-up appointment if you were instructed to do so.

, When you're deciding whether to have an abortion, it's important to get support as you weigh your options. Having people you trust to talk to about your feelings after the procedure is also really helpful. No matter what, realize you aren't alone in this.


Talk to friends or family members who have been through it before.
Seek support if you can’t talk to your family. Contact a counselor at your school or at a health facility staffed with people who understand. There are also hotlines you can call when there's no one in your life you want to discuss your situation with.

, These centers are often advertised in places where you find lists of abortion providers, but they're run by groups that don't believe that women should have abortions. They often offer free pregnancy tests or sonograms as a way to encourage people to come in. Counselors on staff then attempt to convince women not to have an abortion.


While it's a very good idea to speak with a counselor about all your options, including deciding not to have an abortion and to become a parent instead, it's important to be aware that there are people who might try to sway your decision.
Crisis pregnancy centers will spread myths about abortion. Check their website for myths such as Post Abortion Syndrome, increased cancer risk, and inability to start a family in the future.

, The topic of abortion is extremely controversial in the United States, so it's the subject of heated political and religious debates on a daily basis. Groups of people who are anti-abortion often hold protests and demonstrations outside of abortion clinics and the homes of abortion providers. The decision to have an abortion is a personal one, but you may encounter others who have an opinion on your choice.


Be ready to encounter protesters at the clinic. They may be holding graphic signs, and they may attempt to talk to you or dissuade you from going in. Many clinics have volunteer escorts who will walk with you from the parking lot to the reception area so you don't have to face the protesters on your own.
If a protester offers you food or water, decline it. If you eat or drink, you won't be able to get an abortion. The person isn't being kind; they're trying to stop your procedure against your will.
Be ready to deal with people in your life who disagree with the decision. You may have friends or family members who don't think you should have an abortion.

, Many women experience mixed feelings after having an abortion. You might feel relief, anger, guilt, or sadness. These emotions are normal, and after time they become less sharp. You might also feel fine, and ready to go back to normal life without discussing your experience.


If you feel the need to discuss your experience and work through your emotions, consider talking to a counselor. You can also call Exhale, an after-abortion talk line that offers emotional support free of judgment, at 1-866-4-EXHALE.
No matter what, realize it’s your right to have an abortion. It’s a medical decision concerning your health, so only you can make the choice. No matter how controversial abortion is, it’s legal and safe in the United States.

Understand how exercise can flatten your stomach.,
Engage in regular aerobic activity.,
Try strength training.,
Develop an exercise routine.,
Keep an exercise log.",How to Get a Flatter Stomach1," Many people think that abdominal exercises alone will give them a flat stomach. If you have belly fat, you will not be able to see your abdominal muscles and your stomach may look rounder. While abdominal exercises can strengthen and tone your abdominal muscles, you must do aerobic exercise and strength training to reduce overall body fat and the fat in your abdomen.There is no such thing as spot training. You must do exercises that decrease overall body fat to get rid of belly fat.;
, Aerobic exercise includes activities that engage large muscle groups for an extended period of time. You should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.Aerobic exercise helps reduce overall body and belly fat so that you can have a flat stomach.


Activity can be broken up throughout the day. Make sure you are exercising for at least 10 minutes each time.
Examples of moderate-intensity exercise are brisk walking (3 mph or faster), water aerobics, bicycling (slower than 10 mph), and ballroom dancing.Examples of vigorous-intensity exercise are jogging, running, swimming laps, jump roping, bicycling (10 mph or faster), and hiking uphill. , Strength training should be done at least twice a week and target all of the major muscle groups such as your legs, hips, back, shoulders, abdomen, and arms. Weight training, using resistance bands, and body weight exercises (e.g. push ups, squats, pull ups) can all be done to strengthen your muscles.A strength training session should include 8 to 10 exercises that target your major muscle groups. Rest at least one day between your strength training sessions.If you are a beginner, do one to three sets of each exercise and 8 to 12 repetitions in each set.
If you are more advanced, do two to six sets of each exercise and one to eight repetitions in each set., Having an exercise plan will keep you on track and help you set goals. Your routine should include both aerobic exercise and strength training. If you are just starting out, you may need to build up to 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week.Do activities that you enjoy. You are more likely to stick to a plan if you like what you are doing. If you do not like running, try exercise classes, biking, or hiking with a friend.
Switch up which exercises you do each day. Becoming bored with the exercises you do leads to a lack of motivation. Instead of running or walking all the time, try other activities like dancing or swimming.
Create an exercise playlist of songs that will pump you up and keep you motivated throughout your workout.

, Tracking your progress can help you make adjustments to your routine and helps you know if what you are doing is working. Write down the exercise that you complete each day. You may also want to take before and after picture so you can see how your body is changing. Exercise consistently for 4 to 6 weeks and then check your progress.


If you have not seen any changes once you have started your routine, you may need to make adjustments to your program such as increasing the amount of time you are exercising, doing more high intensity exercise, or trying different exercise.

Watch your caloric intake.,
Eat more vegetables and fruits.,
Eat lean protein.,
Switch to whole grains.,
Cook your own food.,
Pay attention to foods that cause bloating.,
Reduce your sugar intake.,
Eat more fiber.",How to Get a Flatter Stomach2," When we consume more calories than we burn each day, those extra calories are stored within our bodies. The amount of calories you need varies by your age, height, gender, and how active you are. Most women need between 1600 and 2400 calories per day. Most men need between 2,000 and 3,000 calories per day.If you are trying to lose weight, you will need to eat fewer calories.
The older you get, the fewer calories you need to consume.
If you are extremely active, you will need to eat more calories every day.
There are calorie counters available on the web that can help you determine how many calories you should eat per day., Fruits and vegetables provide necessary nutrients for your body and are low in calories.A diet heavy in fruits and vegetables can help you feel full and keep you from storing extra calories as fat. Eat a variety of vegetables that includes dark green vegetables (broccoli, spinach, lettuce), red and orange vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, red peppers, sweet potatoes), beans and peas (black beans, split peas, kidney beans), starchy vegetables (corn, green peas, white potatoes). Women should eat 2 to 2.5 cups per day, and men should eat 2.5 to 3 cups per day.If you participate in 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity exercise per day, you need to consume more vegetables.
Fresh and frozen vegetables are preferable to canned vegetables. If you buy canned vegetables, make sure the label says ""low sodium"" or ""no salt added"".
Keep fresh cut vegetables such as carrots, broccoli, cucumbers, or green, yellow, or red peppers in a container in your refrigerator. You are more likely to choose them for a snack if you see them when you open your refrigerator.Try adding pureed vegetables to your soups, casseroles, and gravies to increase your vegetable intake.

, The Recommended Daily Allowance for protein is between 46 to 56 grams per day, or 0.8 grams of protein per Kg of bodyweight (0.36 grams per pound). If you are active or if you are trying to build muscle, then you may need to consume more than this amount. Protein is found in meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, and dairy products. Some animal sources of protein can be high in fat. It's important that you eat lean sources of protein such as lean cuts of beef, beans, pork tenderloin, eggs, seafood, and skinless white meat poultry.Depending on weight and activity, women should eat 5 to 5.5 ounces of protein or meat per day, and men should eat 5.5 to 6 ounces of protein or meat per day.If you do not eat meat, poultry, or fish, 1/4 cup cooked beans, 1 egg, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter, or 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds is equivalent to 1 ounce of meat., Eating whole grain foods (brown rice, oatmeal, whole-wheat flour, and whole-wheat pasta) instead of refined grains (white rice, white flour, white bread) will help your body get rid of belly fat.Women should eat 5 to 6 ounces of grains per day, and men should aim for 6 to 8 ounces of grains per day.One ounce of grains is equivalent to 1 slice of bread, 1"" mini bagel, 1/2 a muffin, and 1/2 cup of cooked oatmeal.At least half of the grains you eat should be whole grains., Cooking at home can help you control what you eat and know exactly what you are putting in your body. Be aware of how much butter, margarine, and table sugar you use when preparing food. Also, trim the fat and remove the skin from meats before you cook them.Grilling, broiling, and roasting are cooking methods that do not add extra fat to foods.
Use vegetable oils such as olive oil, canola oil, corn oil, or safflower oil. However, keep in mind that butter is an acceptable fat to use as well. Just be sure to avoid trans fats in your diet and limit your intake of fats, since fats and fatty foods are high in calories. Try to keep your fat intake between 20 to 35% of your total calories.If you eat at a restaurant, share your meal with a friend or take half of your meal home.

, Certain foods can cause bloating for some people and will make your stomach appear rounder. You do not have to eliminate these foods from your diet, but be aware of how your body responds when you eat these foods. Common foods that cause bloating are beans, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, carbonated drinks, cauliflower, milk, onions, some fruits (apples, peaches, and pears), hard candy, and chewing gum.Reduce the amount of salt you consume. Eating too much salt can cause the body to retain water around the stomach, making you feel bloated., Sugar increases your belly fat. Many processed foods (e.g. cakes, candy, etc.) and sugary drinks (sodas, sports drinks, and fruit juices) have high sugar content. Taking some of the sugar out of your diet will help get a flatter stomach.Instead of drinking juice, eat the actual fruit instead (e.g. eat an orange instead of drinking orange juice)
Replace sugary drinks with water.

, Eating soluble fiber helps reduce belly fat.Fruits, vegetables, and beans are good sources of soluble fiber. Women should eat 21 to 25 grams of fiber per day, and men should eat 30 to 38 grams of fiber per day.Examples of high fiber foods include oats, carrots, apples, citrus fruits, cauliflower, and green beans.Make sure you are drinking plenty of water. Water helps the fiber go through your digestive system.

Try a plank exercise.,
Try a stomach crunch.,
Do a standing oblique crunch.,
Try a standing crunch.,
Be mindful of your posture.",How to Get a Flatter Stomach3," A plank exercise will target your back and core muscles, and it strengthens the muscles that hold your stomach in. Start by lying on your stomach and then prop yourself up using your forearms and your toes. Your elbow should be at a 90 degree angle. Straighten your legs and keep your abs tight. Hold for at least 5 to 10 seconds and repeat 8 to 10 times. Increase the amount of time you hold the position as your abs get stronger.Keep your back straight and look at the floor.
If this is too difficult for you, keep your knees on the floor.

, Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Your knees should be hip width apart. Put your hands on your thighs, behind your ears, or across your chest. Tighten your abs as you raise your head and shoulders off the floor. Hold for a few seconds and then slowly go back to your starting position..

, Standing ab exercises are helpful if being on the floor is uncomfortable for you. Stand with your feet a slightly wider than hip-width. Put your weight on your right leg, and then extend your left arm above your head like you are stretching. Crunch your torso to the left and bring your left elbow and knee together. Do 10 to 15 repetitions and then switch sides.You can hold a weight or a dumbbell on the same side that you are performing the crunch to make the exercise more challenging.
Anyone with sciatica or other low back pain should avoid this move.

, Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart with your toes facing forward. Put your hands on your hips, and contract your abs like you are trying to make your belly button touch your spine. Then, bring your chest and shoulders forward similar to how you would with a standard lying crunch. This movement will help strengthen the lower back muscles which will improve your posture and help prevent the pot-belly appearance. Return to the starting position. Repeat this 10 to 15 times and do 2 to 3 sets.Keep your abs tight as you do this.

, Don't slouch while walking or sitting. Keep your chin up and your stomach tight. Having good posture engages your muscular system and makes your stomach look flatter. Poor posture causes your abdominal muscles to weaken. Strong stomach muscles make your stomach look tighter."

It will keep you healthier overall, which will make it easier for you to get pregnant., Lean beef, skinless chicken, fish, and beans are all healthy, lean protein choices. Protein helps your body build muscle and tissue, and it also assists with repairing torn muscles and the like.Women between the ages of 19 and 30 need 5 1/2 ounce equivalents per day. Over 30, women need 5 ounce equivalents per day. A single ounce of meat counts as an ounce, but so does an egg, a tablespoon of peanut butter, and a 1/4 cup of cooked beans.It's important to include fish in your diet at least twice a week. Fish provides essential nutrients to help keep your body healthy;however, it's best to avoid fish that are high in mercury, as mercury accumulates in the body and can affect your baby. Therefore, you should skip shark, swordfish, tilefish, canned tuna fish, and king mackerel, and go for sardines, anchovies, herring, mackerel, rainbow trout, salmon, or whitefish instead., Try to make fruits and vegetables at least half your plate at every meal. They provide essential vitamins and minerals, and they also give you needed fiber. You need about 2 1/2 cups of veggies and 2 cups of fruit a day. Also, make sure you eat a variety; the more colors you eat, the better off you are as far as vitamins go., Whole grains provide more fiber and vitamins than processed grains. At least half of the grains you eat should be whole grains. Pick whole wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, and oatmeal over white bread and white pasta., Trans fats are usually considered the worst of the fats; these fats are made by hydrogenating healthier oils, making them solid at room temperature. You should mostly try to avoid trans fats. Saturated fats, such as those found in bacon, dairy products, and other meats, are a little better, but you should still limit these fats in your diet. One way you can limit them is by picking low-fat dairy products.Some studies have linked avoiding bad fats with higher fertility rates. Therefore, eating fewer of these fats will not only help you be healthier overall to get pregnant, they'll also increase your chances of getting pregnant more directly.However, other studies have suggested that dairy fats may not be as bad. In fact, including some dairy fat is linked to better fertility in some studies., Certain fats are better for you than others. Therefore, when you reach for fats in your diet, you should try to pick ones from the ""good fats"" category.Monounsaturated fats are found in vegetable oils, such as olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil. You'll also find them in nuts and avocados.In fact, studies have linked eating these fats in place of bad fats to better fertility rates.Polyunsaturated fats are found in other vegetable oils, such as corn oil and safflower oil. Omega-3 fatty acids, a type of polyunsaturated fats, are found in fatty fish such as sardines, mackerel, and salmon, as well as walnuts and flaxseeds., Sugar in foods like sodas, cakes, cookies, and even juices just adds empty calories to your diet; therefore, it's best to limit the sugar in your diet to foods like fruits., If you're trying to get pregnant, it's best to keep a healthy weight. If you're overweight, it can throw your hormones off balance, causing issues with ovulation; therefore, try to limit your calories to lose weight if you're overweight.If you're just a little overweight, you should stick to a 1,200 to 1,500 calorie diet to help lose weight. If you're more overweight, you should start out restricting yourself to 1,500 to 1,800 calories a day, then move down over time.It's important to lose the weight before you get pregnant, as it's not a good idea to be on a diet when you're pregnant., Being underweight can also cause problems once you get pregnant. It can lead to you having an underweight baby. Needing to gain weight doesn't give you a pass to binge on sugary snacks; you still need to eat healthy., When you decide to try conceiving, it's important to be on folic acid. That means that if you go off your birth control, you need to start a supplement.Most women take a folic acid supplement in the form of a prenatal vitamin for the duration of the pregnancy.

You need 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. If you take a multivitamin, check what it has in it before adding a supplement.You need to be prescribed an extra 4mg (far more than is found in over-the-counter supplements) if you have had a child with a neural tube defect. Talk to your doctor about additional folic acid if you (or your partner, or a relative) have celiac, sickle cell, or thalassaemia disease, or you are on anti-epileptic drugs., Choline can help reduce the chances of birth defects in your baby, so try to eat foods that are rich in it, such as egg yolks. Other good options include beef liver and cauliflower., Herbal teas and supplements may sound like a great idea; however, some can be harmful while you're pregnant or trying to get pregnant, such as St. John's Wort, ginseng, sassafras, and licorice. Ask your doctor about any supplement and tea you are taking., Though not definitive, it's possible that BPA can lower your fertility rates. Therefore, if you're trying to get pregnant, you should avoid this chemical. The best way to avoid it is to not consume foods out of hard plastics or cans labeled with number 3 or number 7.Do not microwave in plastic containers. Heat can cause BPA to leach out into food.
Purchase BPA-free plastic when available.
Discard scratched or warped plastic ware, which are more likely to leach BPA.
Choose frozen food over canned food when available. Can linings may be made with BPA.

, Heavy alcohol drinking is linked to lower fertility. In addition, if you consume alcohol while trying to get pregnant, you may be consuming alcohol after you get pregnant without realizing it, which is bad for the baby."

Wait until you truly need maternity pants.,
Ask friends and relatives if you can borrow their maternity clothing.,
Decide what you really need.,
Consider shopping at a second-hand clothing store.,
Understand how maternity pants are sized.,
Know that you don’t have to sacrifice style.,
Choose the model that suits you best.,
Look for pants that will last through your pregnancy.,
Avoid pants that are very narrow in the legs.,
Find pants made of natural materials, like cotton.,
Try on the clothing before you buy it.,
Adjust the clothing as necessary.",How to Choose Maternity Pants," You probably have some clothing in your closet that will see you through the first few months of your pregnancy. You may have loose-fitting dresses, for example, or pants with elastic waists. At a minimum, wait until the third month of your pregnancy – longer if possible. This will give you a better idea of how much weight you are gaining and how you are carrying the weight, increasing your odds of making smart clothing purchases.


Of course, you don’t want to wear clothing that is uncomfortably tight around your stomach. Once your regular clothes feel too restrictive, go ahead and purchase some maternity clothing.;
, Most women only need maternity clothing for six months or so, so it’s wise to avoid spending money on it. Besides, you may gain more than you think you will and need to go up to a larger size. Therefore, if you have close friends or relatives who have recently given birth, consider asking if you can borrow their maternity pants.

, Once you have outgrown your regular clothes and borrowed what you can from friends and family members, think about what you really need to get through the rest of your pregnancy comfortably. Most women can get by with two or three casual pairs of jeans or pants and one dressier option. If you choose carefully and find pants that will work in a variety of situations, there’s no need to purchase more than that.

, Many women sell their maternity pants to a second-hand clothing store after their children are born. In many cases, these garments were only worn once or twice (and sometimes never!). These stores will sell maternity pants for much better prices than standard department stores. And since you’ll need these items for such a short period of time, it makes sense to save as much as possible.

, In general, most maternity clothing is sized just as normal clothing is. In other words, if you usually purchased a “medium” or a size 8 before your pregnancy, you should look for maternity pants in those same sizes. This is even true for jeans and other pants that are sized in inches: if you wore a 28-inch waist before, you still do, even though your waist is now much bigger.

, There are a wide variety of maternity pants on the market now – you can choose sporty ones or elegant ones, narrow-legged versions or wide-legged versions, and styles in every length and color. Choose something you genuinely like.

, In general, maternity pants come in three basic models:


Some have an elastic belt, which is broad and flexible and can adapt easily to your growing belly. Since the waist sits in the same place as regular pants, though, these are best for early pregnancy. Once your belly strains against the belt, discard them.
Some have a belt that is meant to fall below your navel. These pants do not sit tightly across your stomach, and so they are good for the middle of pregnancy. The only major problem with this type of maternity pants is that they tend to sit very low, and when you sit or bend, they may drop even lower. Test them to make sure the fit is good.
Some have a belt that sits above your belly. These have a large elastic band and cover your whole stomach; they are easy to adapt for all stages of pregnancy.

, Pants with elasticated or adjustable waists and elastic side panels are likely to stretch best as your belly expands. Look for pants with a lot of spandex and elastane; these will adapt to your body and move with you as you grow.

, Don’t forget that your belly will not be the only part of you to expand – many pregnant women carry extra weight in their legs as well, and at the end of your pregnancy, you may have swollen calves and ankles. Keep this in mind when choosing maternity pants.

, These pants are more comfortable, especially in the summertime. They “breathe” better and prevent excess sweating.

, Before you purchase some maternity pants, try them on. Walk around a little, and sit down to make sure they stay comfortable and don’t constrict your stomach. Bend and stretch to make sure that they stay in place. If the pants seem tight, do not buy them – remember, you will only get bigger.


You should also check the elastic, to make sure that it seems sufficiently stretchy. If it does not expand well, the pants will not last through your third trimester.
If you are ordering clothing online and cannot try on the pants, take your measurements and compare them to the sizing chart. The most important measurement is the one for your hips: measure the widest part of your hips in a circle with a cloth tape measure. When in doubt, choose the larger size.

, Take special care not to pull the pants too tightly around your waist. Adjust the waist so that they fit properly, and spread the belt to make it less bulky under your other clothing.

Take hot sitz baths.,
Eat a high fiber diet.,
Increase your fluid intake.,
Exercise.",How to Care for Anal Fissures Postpartum1," A sitz bath is a warm water bath in which you sit upright in the bath in order to heal or clean the rectal area.Try to take a sitz bath after bowel movements. This cleans the anus without irritating it with toilet paper, allows spasms to relax, and increases blood flow to the anus.You can take a sitz bath by purchasing a special sitz bath seat. Your doctor may provide you with one if you tell her about the issues you're having with anal fissures. You can also purchase one at a medical supply store.Attach the sitz bath seat to your toilet and fill it with warm water. Make sure the water is not warm enough to cause pain by testing it with your finger or hand first.Most sitz baths have vents that allow water to drain out on occasion. If your bath does not have a vent, change the water periodically to keep it fresh and at a warm temperature.You should remain seated in your bath for 10 to 20 minutes. Try to sit still during that time, avoiding sudden movements that could prevent relaxation.;
, A high fiber diet can encourage regular bowel movements. A high-fiber diet results in softer stool that are passed faster.This can help anal fissures heal.


The National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine recommends women get 21 to 25 grams of fiber a day, depending on age. On average, most Americans only get 5 to 14.High fibers foods include fruits, such as berries, apples, oranges, raisins, figs, and pears. They also include whole wheat grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, and breakfast foods like oatmeal, bran muffins, and bran flakes. Broccoli, green peas, potatoes, and brussels sprouts are good vegetable options. Certain nuts and legumes are high fiber, such as black beans, lima beans, and baked beans, as well as a variety of seeds.However, make sure your fiber intake is not comprised of too many foods that could prove difficult to digest. Avoid nuts, popcorn, tortilla chips, and other hard foods with sharp edges., Soft stools can ease the pain of anal fissures and allow the rectum to heal. Increasing your fluid intake can help soften your stools.Aim to get the recommended 8 glasses of water a day. Only drink water with meals rather than juice, soda, or other beverages.Take a water bottle with you when you go out and sip on it when you get thirsty.

, Regular exercise can help reduce anal fissures as it prevents constipation, which can aggravate existing fissures. Strive for 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Talk to your doctor about what types of physical activity are safe for you after childbirth. It varies depending on your delivery. Your doctor should be able to provide you with a list of safe exercises."

Decide whether you want a nurse midwife, a licensed midwife, or a lay midwife.,
Locate and search your local directory of registered midwives.,
Make a list of candidates and call to request their availability for new patients.,
Schedule a phone call or a quick meeting with the available midwives remaining on the list.,
Ask a lot of questions according to your preferences and individual needs.,
Select a midwife based on your own criteria and comfort level.",How to Choose a Midwife,"


Most countries have different levels of midwifery practice that entail different levels of medical expertise. In the United States, for instance, women can choose from Certified Nurse Midwives, Certified Professional Midwives, Certified Midwives, Direct-Entry Midwives, and Lay Midwives, each requiring a different level of education or training.
Midwives with training as nurses or other medical professionals often maintain a certification granted by a national medical or professional board, while other registered midwives may not have general medical experience but should have extensive midwifery training. Lay midwives in most countries have learned by experience or apprenticeship, but are not necessarily licensed or certified.
Women expecting a high-risk pregnancy may wish to opt for a midwife with medical training and a license or certification or ready access to medical facilities. If a difficult pregnancy is not anticipated, an experienced lay midwife may meet your needs just as well as a licensed midwife could.
Educate yourself about your area’s options and consider what type of midwife will satisfy your needs.;
,


Take recommendations from friends and family into account but do not limit yourself to choosing someone simply because someone else thought that person was a good midwife.
Keep in mind your preferences for the involvement of a hospital or medical center; some midwives only deliver in medical facilities, while others only deliver at the client’s home, and this may be noted in the directory.
Most localities offer an online guide to area midwives who have registered in their directory. In some cases, regional websites that take an interest in the subject or the local telephone book may list midwives not on the official registry.

,


Your first choice may not always be available, so keep an open mind and be willing to work with other midwives if your desired midwife is too busy or is temporarily not available.
The more midwives you initially call, the better your chances of finding the perfect fit–just be sure to let the midwife know that you are just checking availability and not necessarily contracting his or her services at this time.

, You can meet at your home, a café, their office, or your own place of business to discuss a possible relationship with each of them. Let them know you are trying to find the right person and that you have a few questions to ask them before you choose a midwife.

, Examples of questions include:


What type of experience and training do you have?
What type of relationship do you like to have with your patients?
What is your availability for questions and emergencies?
Will you be able to deliver the baby at home/in the hospital/at a birthing center?
Do you have experience with vaginal deliveries for women with prior C-sections?
Do you have experience managing pregnancies of twins or pregnancies with high-risk health conditions?
What options are available to me if something goes wrong during the pregnancy or delivery that is beyond your expertise?
Do you have references you can provide from other women you have assisted?
What are the costs associated with each visit and with the delivery, and what services do you offer?
Do you accept health insurance?

, A midwife may come with numerous recommendations and credentials, but if you do not feel comfortable with him or her, your pregnancy may be more stressful than if you trust and get along with your midwife.


Weigh the midwife's expertise and reputation against the expectations you have of receiving high-quality, attentive care and genuine support after meeting him or her.
If you select a midwife and later discover that he or she is not a good match, do not feel obligated to continue with that midwife; you may switch midwives for any reason, and it can be harmful to remain in a relationship that makes you uncomfortable or leaves you disappointed.
The midwife you ultimately select should be friendly, experienced, caring, and eager to set you at ease throughout the entire experience.

Try topical anesthetics and steroids.,
Use stool softeners.,
Ask your doctor about nitroglycerin.",How to Care for Anal Fissures Postpartum2," Topical anesthetics, used in conjunction with steroid cream, can be used before a bowel movement to reduce pain caused by anal fissures.Xylocaine, lidocaine, tetracaine, and pramoxine are topical anesthetics. While some anesthetics are available over the counter, many require a prescription. Ask your doctor for a recommendation and, if needed, a prescription for an anesthetic to treat your anal fissures.Creams are applied gently on the rectal region before a bowel movement, with a clean paper towel or wipe. Some drug stores sell wipes specifically designed for applying such creams.
A small amount of a steroid is often combined with creams and ointments. This helps reduce inflammation and numb some of the pain associated with bowel movements.If using steroids alongside aesthetics, you should not use the medication for more than 2 weeks. Using steroids for a longer period can thin parts of the rectum, resulting in further trauma to the area., Your physician should be able to recommend a stool softener for you. This will help ease the pain and labor involved during bowel movements, giving fissures a chance to heal.


While stool softeners are generally available over the counter, you should ask your physician for a recommendation. If you are breastfeeding especially, you want to find a brand of softener that will not harm your baby.Take stool softeners as directed on the medication's label. Only take the suggested dosage and be aware of any possible side effects. Talk to your physician if you experience any side effects.
Combing stool softeners with home remedies, like drinking extra fluids and eating a high fiber diet, can help with anal fissures.

, Some ointments contain a muscle relaxant called nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin can relax the sphincter muscles and reduce contractions and spams during bowel movements, and also help increase blood flow to the anus. This reduces the trauma around the rectal region, giving anal fissures the chance to heal.Nitroglycerin should be applied using a q-tip. Apply a small amount of ointment to the q-tip and insert the cotton tip into the anus. Do not go farther than this, only inserting the cotton portion.The concentration of nitroglycerin in ointments is relatively low, usually only around 0.2%.Topical use of nitroglycerin for treating anal fissures is considered safe while breastfeeding.
Side effects do occasionally occur when using nitroglycerin. The most common side effect is a headache or lightheadedness."

Know why surgery might be needed.,
Prepare for your surgery.,
Recover from surgery.",How to Care for Anal Fissures Postpartum3," Most anal fissures heal on their own with 4 to 6 weeks.If your anal fissures does not heal within this timeframe, and does not seem to improve with use of medication, your doctor might recommend surgery.


The standard surgery to treat an anal fissures involves cutting a portion of the sphincter muscle. This helps relax the bowels, helping the fissure heal.Surgery has a high success rate, with over 90% of fissures clearing up after the procedure., Your doctor will talk to you about how to prepare for your surgery. Follow all her instructions and do not hesitate to ask any questions if something confuses you.


You will probably be asked not to eat or drink anything after midnight the day before your surgery.Your doctor will tell you what medications you should and should not take prior to the operation, including any herbal supplements or over the counter sleep aids.Bowel prep is common in anal fissure surgery. You may be given an enema or laxatives prior to the operation., Anal fissure surgery is a same day procedure. This means, assuming there are no complications, you will leave the hospital the same day you had the procedure done. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to recover from the operation.


Normal activity can be resumed shortly after surgery, but it should be gradual. Make sure you walk the night after surgery, as this lessens the risk of blood clots, which can be potentially life threatening.Depending on the type of surgery, you should not return to work for 1 to 4 weeks. Avoid driving until you're done taking pain medications.Your surgery will leave a wound in the rectal area that needs treatment. Keep the wound clean and dry and take sitz baths baths 3 times a day. Bloody drainage will occur for a few days following the surgery, so the wound should be sealed with gauze."

Choose fruit.,
Eat yogurt.,
Make smoothies.,
Eat nut butters.",How to Choose Healthy Pregnancy Snacks1," Fruits are great snacks. They can satiate a sweet craving while providing healthy fiber. Fruits like apples, pears, grapes, bananas, berries, and melon can be mixed with many other things to create a good snack.Pair apples or pears with nut butters. Eat fruit with low-fat cottage cheese or Greek yogurt.;
, Dairy is important when you are pregnant because it contains calcium that helps your baby as it grows. You should shoot for three servings of low-fat dairy per day. Yogurt is a tasty way to get your dairy each day.Greek yogurt contains around 15 g of protein per serving. You can put fruit in it to give it a sweeter flavor.
Regular yogurt is also good. If you buy flavored yogurt, make sure to check the sugar content. Try to stick with yogurt without large amounts of added sugar.

, Smoothies are a delicious snack that can give you a serving of fruit and dairy. Start with a dairy base, like milk or yogurt, then add fruit. You can also add greens for an extra nutritional boost, or some peanut butter for protein.Don’t use fruit juice as the base. It has a lot of added sugar and extra calories.
Try frozen berries and bananas. This makes a thicker smoothie that tastes like a frozen treat, like ice cream.

, Nut butters, like peanut, cashew, or almond, are good snacks when you’re pregnant because they provide protein and a healthy fat. Eating one to two tablespoons with another item can help keep you full and give you a tasty snack.Make sure to read the ingredients in the nut butters you buy, especially peanut butter. Many peanut butters are filled with unhealthy additives, like sugar, sodium, and hydrogenated oil.

, Use Lamaze’s online locator tool to find a certified instructor close to you: http://www.lamaze.org/FindALamazeChildbirthClass. Once you have your list of potential options and their contact information, speak with several teachers and ask them questions about themselves and the course. You want someone who makes you feel comfortable and open, as they’ll be helping you through an intimate and important process in your life.The locator tool will allow you to search by the name of a specific instructor who may have been recommended to you, or to enter your desired proximity up to 50 miles (80.47 km) away from your zipcode.

, Classes can be held in hospitals, birthing centers, healthcare providers’ offices, homes, or community centers. Lamaze’s online locator tool lists the locations of various courses along with the instructors. The website also provides a map showing the distances from the course locations to your home. If you’re taking a weekly class, you may want to prioritize convenience. Be sure, however, that the space you choose is one in which you can relax., Typical Lamaze classes include comprehensive, 12-hour coverage of labor, birth, early baby care, breastfeeding, and healthy lifestyle tips. These classes should also teach you relaxation, breathing, and massage techniques for pain management during labor and delivery. Check to make sure your instructor’s course plan adheres to these standards.Many expectant mothers appreciate Lamaze for its non-judgmental approach to medical intervention during labor. Lamaze classes will not encourage you to choose one birth plan over another. Lamaze instead fosters confidence and communication skills so that pregnant women can make safe and calm decisions during delivery., It’s important to ensure that you’re learning from a person who has the necessary training. Lamaze International offers the only internationally recognized childbirth education certification. If you found your instructor using the Lamaze website, you can rest assured that they’re fully certified. If you found your instructor on your own, ask the instructor to provide a record of their certification.If you’re taking your course at a hospital or healthcare provider’s office, you’ll likely receive instruction from a registered nurse (RN) who has also been certified to teach Lamaze.

, Most Lamaze classes include 12 hours of instruction spread over six weeks in two-hour class sessions. Some instructors may also offer an intensive weekend session of two classes lasting six hours per day.While some expectant mothers might appreciate quickly finishing the course, weekly sessions may be better first-time parents who need time to absorb all the new material., If you are looking to meet other women or couples who are also experiencing pregnancy, a group class may be right for you. These classes will offer less one-on-one instruction, but they will also usually be more affordable., This type of instruction is generally more flexible because the classes are arranged around your needs, and the course may even be held in your home. Private classes will be totally focused on you and your partner, and you can ask any personal questions that you might be afraid to introduce in a group setting. However, this option will almost certainly be more costly., Be sure that your instructor has a maximum class size. Smaller class sizes of no more than 24 students are best. If you’re able to find a course with 10-12 students, this will provide you with the optimal level of individual and group instruction., Various courses will differ in cost. Popular Lamaze instructors with a well established following may be able to charge more than newer instructors. Smaller classes may also be more expensive than those open to larger groups. Try to balance your needs with your budget., Your loved ones will be familiar with your personality and birthing needs. They’ll be able to provide targeted advice that combines their likes and dislikes of their past Lamaze classes and instructors with what they know about your preferences.Remember to put your desires first. Don’t allow advice from those who are close to you to drown out what you want from your classes.

, Since Lamaze classes don’t typically start until you’re about seven months pregnant, you shouldn’t worry about scheduling a course as soon as you get pregnant. Your doctor can suggest the appropriate timeline for reaching out to instructors, making your choice, and finalizing your reservation. Consider the course an exciting indicator that you’ve reached your last few months of pregnancy., It’s important to have a support network in place during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and after you give birth. Choose a partner, friend, or family member and make sure they’re fully prepared to invest their time and energy in these classes. You can work with them to make sure the classes don’t clash with their other obligations. Taking this class together will help you both build a relationship of trust you can rely on when it counts.Be sure to ask instructors whether they expect and allow partner participation.

, Your instructor will likely offer a variety of options to fit their students’ scheduling needs. Try to pick a time that doesn’t clash with other events on your schedule, as you don’t want your classes to feel like an obligation.Most instructors will expect that at least some of their students work during the weekdays, and they should be prepared with several options to fit into a full-time work schedule.

Talk with your doctor.,
Decide when to begin prenatal vitamins.,
Consider what type and size of prenatal you want.,
Read the dosing information for prenatal vitamins.,
Determine if you want a generic or brand name.,
Think about cost and availability.",How to Choose a Prenatal Vitamin1," Whether you're already pregnant or planning to conceive, it's important to talk with your doctor about taking a prenatal vitamin. Tell your doctor about any lifestyle or diet considerations you have so your doctor can recommend a prenatal that has all of the nutrients that you need.For example, if you're vegan or vegetarian, you may need more vitamin B12 in a supplement since you're not getting it from animal sources.;
, If you're planning to conceive, you may want to begin taking prenatal vitamins. This can ensure that your body is getting the nutrients it needs. If you're not taking a prenatal, you should at least take 400 mcg of folic acid every day to prevent birth defects.If you're having trouble conceiving, talk with your doctor about making diet or supplement adjustments.

, You've probably seen large prenatal vitamins that contain all the nutrients you need. You can certainly take these supplements if you're able to swallow them easily. But if you find that you're having trouble taking a large supplement, look for a different type of prenatal that may be smaller or easier to take. In addition to the traditional large tablet vitamins, you could choose:Smaller capsule prenatals
Gummy prenatals
Liquid prenatals
Chewable prenatals

, You'll need to decide if you want to take a prenatal vitamin once a day or several times throughout the day. Some smaller prenatal vitamins or chewables may need to be taken two or three times a day, so it's important to read the manufacturer's dosing instructions.


If you're worried you'll forget to take the prenatal vitamins, you may want to choose one that only requires one dose.

, Ask your doctor to recommend a prenatal vitamin. Keep in mind that while you may get a brand name recommendation, you could also look for a generic version. Regardless of what you choose, only purchase a prenatal vitamin from a reputable source since vitamins and supplements are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.


If you're still unsure about a prenatal vitamin, you could always take it to your doctor and ask for their opinion.

, You'll be buying prenatal vitamins through your entire pregnancy and even after the birth (if you plan on breastfeeding). You should choose a prenatal vitamin that works for your budget and is easy to purchase. For this reason, you may want to pick a prenatal that's available somewhere you frequently shop.


If you want to buy several bottles of prenatal vitamins at a time, remember that they do expire. Check the expiration dates before purchasing and storing them.

Go for healthy dips.,
Snack on a sweet potato.,
Make trail mix.,
Eat cheese.,
Pop some popcorn.,
Make a sandwich.,
Choose whole grains.,
Eat some protein.",How to Choose Healthy Pregnancy Snacks2," Dips can provide a tasty savory snack. Make sure you are eating healthy dips instead of ones full of unhealthy additives. For example, guacamole made with avocados and tomatoes is both healthy and delicious. Bean dips are full of protein.If possible, make the dips from scratch. Avocado, bean dip, or hummus can be made quickly and enjoyed for days.
When buying dips, make sure to read the label and check the nutritional information.

, Sweet potatoes are great for you when you’re pregnant. They contain a lot of beta carotene, which turns into vitamin A in your body. When pregnant, you need more vitamin A. Sweet potatoes also contain fiber.Bake a sweet potato, cut it open, and eat it.
Cover medallions in olive oil and bake them.

, Trail mix is an easy and healthy snack that will satisfy your sweet tooth and have a savory touch. When choosing ingredients, go for unsalted nuts, dried fruit without added sugars or candy coating, and dark chocolate.The best way to get nutritious trail mix is to make your own. Just buy the different nuts, dried fruit, and dark chocolate chips and mix together in a large bowl. Store in an airtight container.
If you want to buy trail mix, read the ingredients. Stay away from sugary mixes that contain milk chocolate pieces, marshmallows, yogurt covered fruit, or flavored candy pieces. Make sure the dried fruit has no added sugars. Some trail mixes claim to be healthy when they are full of sugar and sodium.

, Hard cheeses are good snacks during pregnancy. Cheese contains calcium, so you can eat it as one of your three servings each day. Hard cheeses include cheddar, Swiss, Parmesan, gouda, or Edam.


You can eat nuts along with your cheese for a protein boost. You may also try whole grain crackers or fruit with your cheese.
Don’t eat soft cheeses. They may contain bacteria that are harmful to your baby., Popcorn provides fiber, which many women need while pregnant. Plain popcorn can be a nutritious savory snack during your day. Make sure to get popcorn without added flavors or ingredients.Go for plain rather than salted, butter, or other flavors.

, Sandwiches can be filling snacks when you are hungry. Use whole wheat or whole grain bread instead of white bread or whole wheat pitas. Place low fat cheese, tuna salad, avocado, chicken salad, hummus, or natural sandwich meat inside.When buying sandwich meat, try to buy natural meats with no nitrates and lower sodium.

, When you need a snack, try a whole grain snack. Whole wheat chips can be paired with dips and cheeses for a snack. A bowl of brown rice, quinoa, or oatmeal can tide you over until your meal. You can even pair it with fruit or veggies.Try whole grain bread with a piece of lean meat or nut butter.

, Protein sources can make filling snacks when you’re pregnant. Try scrambling a few eggs or making an omelet with some cheese. Eat a piece of chicken or salmon, or try some tofu.Limit your consumption of red meat while you are pregnant.

"
"
Avoid snacking on junk food.,
Make snack combinations.,
Choose snacks that cover multiple food groups.",How to Choose Healthy Pregnancy Snacks3," When you’re pregnant, limit or eliminate the amount of junk food that you eat. This means limiting foods that have high amounts of saturated fat and sugars. Instead, eat healthy snacks full of protein, healthy fats, fiber, and other vitamins and nutrients.For example, try to get rid of candy, cookies, chips, milk chocolate, baked goods, and sugary cereals.

, Choose two or three things you enjoy, and add a serving of each together. This helps satiate your hunger and provide you with healthy calories.For example, pair apples with peanut butter, hummus with carrot sticks, cucumbers, and whole grain crackers, cheese, fruit and nuts, or Greek yogurt with frozen blueberries and walnuts. Each of these combinations has multiple food groups and enough calories to give you and your baby energy.

, When you are pregnant, your snacks should be as nutritious as your meals. Try to have each snack fit in at least two food groups: proteins, dairy, fruit, vegetables, and grains.For example, you should combine protein and healthy fats, or complex carbohydrates and protein, or healthy fats and fiber.

Choose a prenatal vitamin with folic acid.,
Look for a prenatal vitamin that has calcium and iron.,
Find a prenatal vitamin that has vitamin D. Most prenatal vitamins have about 400 IU (International Units) of vitamin D, which goes towards your daily recommendation of 600 IU.,
Consider a prenatal with DHA.",How to Choose a Prenatal Vitamin2," Folic acid is important for very early fetal development, so it's important to get at least 400 mcg from a prenatal vitamin every day. Since much of this development is done before women realize they're pregnant, you may want to just take a folic acid supplement until you get a positive pregnancy test result.It's fine if the prenatal vitamin you choose has more than 400 mcg of folic acid. Some recommend that you get up to 600 mcg a day, especially if you're at risk for early developmental birth defects.

, Most prenatals will only have small amounts of calcium (around 300 mg) since you'll also need to get calcium from your diet. You should get at least 1,000 mg of calcium from your diet and prenatal. You should also choose a prenatal vitamin that has 27 mg of iron or take a separate iron supplement if it's not in the prenatal.If you don't get at least three servings of dairy a day, talk with your doctor about taking an additional calcium supplement.

, Vitamin D plays an important role in helping developing bones absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from fortified dairy products, fatty seafood, and beef liver.You'll also get vitamin D from sun exposure, although you shouldn't plan on getting your daily recommended intake from sunlight alone.

, If you don't eat fatty fish (like salmon, tuna, or mackerel) at least a few times a week, talk with your doctor about taking a prenatal that has 200 mg of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that's important for fetal brain development.Some prenatals don't contain DHA, so you may need to take a separate DHA supplement. Remember to get your doctor's advice before taking any supplements.

Make a habit of taking the prenatal vitamins.,
Recognize prenatal vitamin side effects.,
Avoid combining vitamin supplements.,
Consider waiting to take prenatals.",How to Choose a Prenatal Vitamin3," While it's alright if you miss the occasional prenatal vitamin, it's important that you take your prenatal vitamin every day. To make it a habit, try to take the vitamin at the same time every day. If you need to take two smaller prenatal vitamins in one day, try to take them about 12 hours apart.For example, try to take your prenatal vitamin with a snack or meal every morning. If you're taking two small doses, take one around breakfast and one after dinner.

, Prenatal vitamins that contain iron are known to contribute to constipation. They may also cause diarrhea or gas. If you're having prenatal vitamin side effects, try a different type of prenatal or take the vitamin with food. You should also drink more water and increase your fiber intake.If you're still experiencing side effects, ask your doctor to recommend a different prenatal.

, Most prenatal vitamins are designed to fulfill your daily nutrient intake for a number of vitamins and minerals. If you take a prenatal vitamin as well as another supplement, you could be getting too much of a particular nutrient. Just take the prenatal unless you're instructed differently by your doctor.For example, if you take a prenatal vitamin as well as a folic acid supplement, you could be getting a daily dose of folic acid that's harmful.

, If you're experiencing severe nausea and vomiting during the first trimester, ask your doctor if you can wait to begin prenatal vitamins. The iron in prenatals can make these symptoms worse. Research studies suggest that it's safe to wait until these symptoms go away before starting a prenatal vitamin with iron.You should still take the recommended folic acid before beginning prenatal vitamins. Folic acid shouldn't make your nausea or vomiting worse.

Determine the date of your last menstrual period (LMP) before you found out you were pregnant.,
Add 40 weeks from that date to determine the due date.,
Alternately, remember Naegele's Rule.,
Choose other methods to calculate your due date if you cannot remember the date of your LMP or have irregular periods.",How to Calculate Your Due Date1," This method works best for women whose menstrual cycles last around 28 days.;
, Pregnancy usually takes 9 months, 40 weeks, or 280 days — give or take a few weeks — from the LMP.

, An easier way in figuring out due dates is to take the first day of your last period, count backward 3 months, add 7 days, and add an entire year. This is called Naegele's Rule. (Alternatively, to get the same result, you can take your LMP, add 1 week, and add 9 months.)

, In this case, it may be difficult to determine the due date without help. To get a more accurate measure, you may want to wait until you see the doctor and have an ultrasound to determine the baby's gestational age and your due date.


You may, however be able to hit upon a rough estimate. Most women ovulate 14 days before their period begins. So if your cycles are 40 days, then you probably ovulated on the 26th day. If you know the day(s) of ovulation, just add 266 days to that date to determine a very rough estimate.

Count the number of days until your expected period.,
Understand how tests determine pregnancy.,
Choose whether to purchase a digital or traditional test.,
Find a pregnancy test vendor.,
Compare prices.,
Decide how many tests to purchase.,
Check the test box’s expiration date before purchase.,
Buy the test.",How to Buy a Pregnancy Test," Determine where you are in your current menstrual cycle and how sensitive your test needs to be. Have you passed the expected date of your period or not?Some tests claim to detect pregnancy five days before your expected period but studies show that very few tests consistently detect pregnancy before the date of your expected period.False negatives are possible any time you test before your expected period date.Tests are up to ninety-nine percent accurate when you take one at least one week after the first day of your expected period.;
, Manufacturers label pregnancy tests based on how sensitive they are in detecting the hCG hormone. If you test early, look for a test that can detect low milli-international units per milliliter of urine for hCG. This will be labeled as mlU/ml. For example, a test detecting 20mlU/ml is more sensitive than a test detecting 50mlU/ml. Thus, if you test early, look for a test with a lower mIU/ml level., Digital tests are easier to read with words appearing that say “pregnant” or “not pregnant.” Some digital tests also estimate how many weeks you are into your pregnancy. These tests are more expensive than traditional tests. Traditional tests have a strip in which one or two dye-based lines appear. Typically, one line means you are not pregnant; two lines mean you are pregnant.Consider buying one digital test as a backup in case you cannot read the traditional test.

, Now that you know what type of test you want, determine where you can purchase or receive a test. Drugstores and pharmacies along with many grocery stores, supercenters, and even dollar stores have tests for purchase. If you are comfortable purchasing a test, you can buy one in your neighborhood. Otherwise, consider going to another neighborhood. Online retailers also can ship tests discreetly to your doorstep. Your doctor also can give you a test. If you cannot afford to purchase a test or feel awkward buying one, pregnancy support centers often offer pregnancy tests free of charge., If cost matters, visit nearby stores or look online to compare prices. Pregnancy test costs can vary considerably so if you have time, see what the prices are. Particularly, if you plan to buy multiple tests, it makes sense to check price differences. Additionally, many generic brand tests are produced by the same manufacturer as brand name tests so the quality should be the same., Based on your needs and budget, consider purchasing at least two tests at a time. Although your first test should work fine, sometimes tests have defects.Many early testers purchase multiple tests so they can verify results as their expected period approaches. Additionally, if you hope to be pregnant and want to test daily or weekly, purchase multi-packs at a discounted rate.

, Make sure the test is still valid. If the test is nearing its expiration date, purchase a different one. It is essential that your pregnancy test has not expired. If you end up purchasing a test and not using it before the expiration date, discard it., If you are comfortable purchasing the test at the counter, go for it. Self check-out is another great option at many mainstream drugstores today. You simply swipe your item and pay for it. No one needs to know what you are buying. Regardless, remember there is no shame in buying a pregnancy test no matter your age or relationship status.


If you feel uncomfortable or worry about people seeing you purchase a test, ask a friend to purchase it for you. If you are not with her, make sure to give her all the necessary information so she purchases the right one. You can also make an appointment with your doctor and have a test done then.

Search for a free online due date calculator.,
Provide date of conception or LMP.",How to Calculate Your Due Date2," Search in the term ""free due date calculator"" online and click on a reputable looking source.

, Since proving the date of conception is notoriously finicky, many online calculators suggest you stick with your LMP, which it then uses to calculate your due date.

"
"
Visit a doctor.,
Be prepared for a little uncertainty.",How to Calculate Your Due Date3," Estimating your due date on your own or using a website can give you a rough idea as to when you might deliver, but a doctor can confirm how far along you are. At your first prenatal appointment, your doctor may order a vaginal ultrasound to more accurately determine your due date.


Ultrasounds are more accurate in determining due dates when done early in the pregnancy. Later ultrasounds help in seeing if the fetus is growing well, but it doesn't help in determining fetal age.

, A due date is not set in stone, nor should it be: your baby will pop out whenever she is ready to, and hopefully not a day sooner or later. As such, a due date is always a work in progress. Some pregnant women even have their due dates changed mid-term.

Get the timing down.,
Know what to look for.,
Dress with confidence.,
If you're planning on nursing, buy ahead.,
Consider thrift stores, hiring or borrowing clothing from friends who aren't currently pregnant as an option if such options exist near you.

",How to Buy Maternity Clothes While Pregnant," If you're carrying a single pregnancy, you probably won't start to show until the second trimester. For the first three months, most of your clothes (except the tightest ones) will continue to fit. When you do start to need larger clothing, the best strategy overall is to buy what you need as you need it.


If your spouse or partner is larger than you are, consider borrowing a few of their pieces to bridge the time between fitting into your regular clothes and needing maternity pieces. Men's button-up shirts can be a comfortable option for expectant mothers.
Use a ""belly button."" This simple device, consisting of an elastic with buttons, enables you to widen pants and skirts to accommodate a growing bump. Just make sure to cover your waist with a long top.
Consider keeping a few maternity items on-hand in case you experience a sudden growth spurt about the second trimester (for a single-baby pregnancy). You will need to have enough clothing to at least get by until you can go shopping.;
, Most department stores have a maternity clothing section. You can also shop at specialty maternity stores, which are likely to have a larger selection of styles and sizes. Because a lot of women don't need to hang onto their maternity clothing, consignment stores can also have a wide selection of gently-used, still-trendy items.


Remember that most sizes are based on your pre-pregnancy size, but brands will vary. When in doubt, go larger.
Fabrics such as cotton jersey and Lycra are designed to stretch. Pieces in materials like this will last you through several stages of the pregnancy.
As awkward as it might be, attempt to try on anything you're considering for purchase. If it feels itchy, sticky or otherwise uncomfortable, put it back!
Consider buying layers. As your hormones fluctuate, your body temperature can go from too hot to too cold several times a day. Build your wardrobe so that you can peel off or add clothing with little hassle.
Select several different styles and fits to try on. Pants, in particular, come with many different types of stretch panels, and will often fit and feel different. Also, as you progress in your pregnancy, it may not be only your stomach that grows, but also your posterior and hips.
Ask if the store has a ""prosthetic tummy"" to check the fit of what you're trying on. If one isn't available, try using a shopping bag with one or two clothing items in it - it works surprisingly well!
Most women find themselves with larger feet when they're pregnant. Find a pair of comfortable, supportive shoes that you can slip on without bending over.
Don't forget about undergarments! Because most women experience an increase in breast size during pregnancy, you'll probably need a few new bras. Buy these as needed, since you won't be able to estimate the size ahead of time. Also, don't be afraid to ask for a professional fitting at a department or lingerie store - you'll want to make sure the fit is as comfortable as possible. For underpants, you can either purchase maternity briefs that will come up over the belly, or simply buy your usual cut and fit in a larger size and wear under the belly.

, There's no need to hide in the tent-like dresses and sweaters your mother and grandmother might have worn. Embrace styles that will flatter your new, glowing-with-life form.


Highlight your favorite features. Buy a cute skirt to show off trim legs, a cap-sleeved top to draw attention to toned arms, or a top with an eye-catching neckline to flatter a pretty throat and décolletage.
Seek out pieces that blend comfort with easy style, like a well-made sweater or detailed, flat-soled boots.
Buy a few accessories, such as scarves and jewelry, to complement your new maternity clothes. Select pieces you can see yourself wearing with your normal wardrobe after the pregnancy.

, Recovering from childbirth and nursing a newborn can be exhausting, and the last thing you'll want to do is make a time and energy consuming shopping expedition. Purchasing some nursing items ahead of time, in your second or third trimester, can save you some trouble.


Buy or make nursing bras. These are bras that allow you to uncover one breast at a time if you are planning on breastfeeding. They are convenient and easy to use in public places.
Nursing clothes (usually shirts, but also camisoles and dresses) have openings that make it easier to nurse, especially in public. Nursing sleepwear likewise makes for less disrobing at nighttime feedings.
Try to guess how your existing clothes might work before spending too much money on specialized nursing items. They may be able to accommodate breastfeeding discreetly.

Purchasing common household items such as diapers, wipes and even laundry detergent in bulk will save your family money and lessen the amount of trips you make to the store.
Consider purchasing food items in bulk, such as meats, canned goods, breakfast cereal and beverages. Buying large quantities of meat may be intimidating, but you can stock your freezer full.

, Not only is water the best thing you can drink for baby, but it won’t cost you a thing. In most homes, tap water is perfectly safe to consume.

, Once your friends, family and coworkers find out your expecting, they will likely shower you with offers to borrow their old pregnancy stuff. It’s not a bad idea to borrow maternity clothing such as pants and shirts or dresses. You never know how quickly your baby bump will blossom, so with a stockpile of various maternity sizes, you may never have to purchase a pregnancy wardrobe.

,


Friends and family may offer to lend you baby clothes or toys; it’s smart to take them up on the offer. The more items you stock up on, the less you will need to buy.

Don’t binge on sweets.,
Try eating protein before or with sugar.,
Eat fat along with your sweets.,
Swap out stand-alone sugary snacks for post-meal desserts.,
Avoid drinks that contain both sugar and caffeine.",How to Stop Feeling Tired After Eating Sugar1," It’s okay to eat a piece of cheesecake, but eating half of a cheesecake can cause you to feel sleepy in the minutes or hours that follow. Try reducing the amount of sugar you consume in a single setting. For example, if the serving size is ten gummy bears, try to stick to the serving size instead of going overboard., Eating a little protein before or while you consume sugar can help cancel out the sleepy side effects of sweets. Go for desserts that include some protein, like cheesecake or sweets that include peanut butter. Or try eating nuts or meat before sweets.This doesn't mean that eating protein powder along with a whole cake will help!

, Sometimes the sugar from fruit can make you feel tired. It can also create a surge of energy, followed by a crash. You can help your body process the sugar more efficiently, and prevent blood sugar spikes and plunges by including fat and protein with your fruit. For example, if you usually consume a fruit smoothie and feel sleepy afterward, try eating a handful of almonds right before you enjoy the smoothie., Try to avoid eating sugary snacks. Eating sugary foods on their own can cause the sleepiness that some people feel after they consume sweets. For example, if you snack on sugary foods in the middle of the afternoon, rather than after a meal, you are more likely to experience adverse symptoms, like lethargy or drowsiness. Instead, try eating sweets after a well-balanced meal to help your body better maintain appropriate blood sugar levels., While a sugary coffee drink may give you an initial jolt of energy, the combination of caffeine and sugar can cause your energy levels to crash. This can lead to feeling tired and even lethargic. Try to stay away from sugary coffee drinks, sodas, and energy drinks. Instead, try drinking flavored sparkling water, slightly sweetened tea, or black coffee if you need a caffeine fix."

Consider acupuncture.,
Try a warm drink.,
Cut down on stimulants.",How to Start Sleeping Without Prescription Sleep Pills1," Melatonin is an over-the-counter supplement that some claim can help tackle insomnia and sleeping difficulties. Melatonin is naturally produced by your body, and is released into your bloodstream in large amounts overnight. Taking the supplements increases the amount in your blood, and may help you get to sleep.


The scientific evidence proving the effectiveness of melatonin supplements in combating insomnia is, however, lacking.
It is thought that older people will experience more significant benefits.
Melatonin use is considered safe for a few weeks, but the safety of longer-term use is unclear.It is recommended that you take 0.1 - 0.3mg of melatonin for sleep, which has been proven to produce a physiological sleep inducing effect. If your melatonin supplement is 1 milligram you can cut it in quarters to get to get a .25 milligram dose.
Melatonin is a big player in the induction and maintenance of sleep. Natural Natural melatonin levels decrease with increasing age.;
, Valerian root is another dietary supplement available in health food stores and online which is marketed and sold as a sleeping aid. Valerian root has sedative and anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) effects, but there is a lack of in-depth scientific study of its usefulness in tackling sleep problems. You should talk to your doctor before trying valerian root.


In a recent study, it was demonstrated that valerian root might be a good replacement for medications like diazepam. Valerian root was shown to have an anxiolytic (calming) effect on the symptoms of anxiety.There may be a connection between long-term use of valerian root and liver damage.
If you have been using valerian root, you may experience withdrawal symptoms when you stop., There is some evidence that acupuncture can help people with insomnia and sleep disorders, but more research is required to prove its effectiveness. During a session, you will have many thin needles placed into your skin by an acupuncture practitioner. Talk to your doctor, and if you decide to try acupuncture, be sure to ask for a recommendation to help you find a qualified and well-regarded practitioner., There are also some more straightforward remedies you can try at home to help you sleep. Have a warm milky drink, or a cup of relaxing herbal tea before you plan to go to bed.A glass of warm milk can help your body to produce melatonin., You should be thinking of what not to consume as well as what remedies might help you to sleep. Stimulants like caffeine and sugar can make it much harder for you to get to sleep, so try to cut these out, especially before you plan to go to bed. Don’t have any tea or coffee for at least a few hours before bed.Cigarettes are a stimulant that will not help you get to sleep.
Alcohol will not give you a restful night’s sleep. It may make you dehydrated, and you may have to get up in the night to use the bathroom."

Reduce the amount of sugar you consume each day.,
Keep an eye on added sugars.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Stop Feeling Tired After Eating Sugar2," If you fall asleep often after eating sweets, it could be a sign you need to cut back on how often you consume sugar. Try to keep your daily sugar intake within respected dietary guidelines. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that only 10% of a person’s total daily calories come from sugar. For example, a 2000 calorie diet should contain no more than 200 calories from sugar each day.Try replacing sugary drinks with water.
You can also replace sweet snacks with low-sugar fruit, like berries.

, A lot of processed foods contain high amounts of sugar. Foods like salad dressing or yogurt can contain surprising amounts of added sugars, thwarting your best efforts to cut back on sugar. Read food labels carefully and be on the look out for added sugars like:Brown sugar
Corn sweetener
Corn syrup
Dextrose
Fructose
Glucose
High-fructose corn syrup
Honey
Lactose
Malt syrup
Maltose
Molasses
Raw sugar
Sucrose

, If you feel sleepy after eating sweets, it could be a sign of underlying medical issues. If you have consistent trouble staying awake after eating sugar, make an appointment to see your doctor. They can perform tests to see if your blood sugar is normal, and can help you figure out ways to cut back on sugar in your diet."

Get moving.,
Avoid consuming additional sugar.,
Let the sunshine in.",How to Stop Feeling Tired After Eating Sugar3," If you find yourself falling asleep after eating sweets, try exercising. A gentle walk or a full-blown workout can help energize you. Try going for a short walk around your office building if your afternoon treat leaves you feeling lethargic., If you find yourself crashing, it’s easy to reach for another cookie or energy drink for a quick boost. Avoid doing this, as you will only cause your blood sugar to peak and then crash again, possibly leaving you more tired., Another way to overcome the sleepiness brought about by consuming too much sugar is to step outside. Sunshine can warm and invigorate you. Spending time in the sun will give you an added boost of vitamin D, a nutrient that is essential to overall health and wellbeing."

Try meditating.,
Practice yoga.,
Use muscle relaxation techniques.,
Try breathing exercises.,
Tackle sources of stress.,
Create a peaceful sleeping environment.",How to Start Sleeping Without Prescription Sleep Pills2," There is increasing amounts of evidence that suggests that meditation can help you to tackle stress, which could in turn help you sleep. Research shows that practising twenty minutes of meditation a day can reduce stress and cortisol levels.Start slowly and just try to incorporate 3-5 minutes at a time. Meditation can seem strange or alien, so it’s important that you don’t put pressure on yourself.


If you don’t feel like sitting cross-legged and reciting a mantra, you could try walking meditation.
While walking, concentrate on the feeling of your body walking,
Then focus on the feeling of your breath, and then the air and wind on your skin., Yoga can help you to relax your body and mind before you go to bed. Keep the routine slow and controlled, and don’t over exert yourself. A simple routine of five to fifteen minutes, with only simple poses, is all you should do.Some of the basic poses to try include:


Standing bends. Standing up straight, raise your hands above your head. Feel the stretch in your spine, and then gently bend down. Keep your back straight.
Child’s pose. Sit on your heels, and place your arms out either side of you. Lower your body over your knees and as you do this gently bring your forehead down towards the floor., One good way to try to relax your body and help you get to sleep is to practice some progressive muscle relaxation techniques. Lie in bed and then tense a muscle, contracting and flexing it, for around ten seconds. Don’t put too much strain on the muscle, but feel the tension building up. Release the muscle and relax. Now move on to the next muscle and repeat the process all over your body.


You can start from your feet and work all the way up your body. Finish by tensing and relaxing your face.
Try visualising the muscle that you are tensing as you go., Doing some deep breathing exercises can help you to lower your heart rate and relax. If you are struggling to sleep and are becoming anxious, deep breathing can help. The effects of deep breathing are often more psychological than physiological, but it can help you to calm your heart and breathing rate in times of stress or anxiety.


Breathe in deeply for three or four seconds, with your hand on your belly and try to breathe in and out. Breathe in through your nose and exhale out through your mouth. Feel your diaphragm move up and down as your belly rises and falls.
Breathing this way will stimulate the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nervous system. By stimulating the PNS you will relax your body and lower your heart rate and anxiety.

, Sleeping problems are often associated with stress, anxiety and depression. If you are regularly having trouble sleeping, consider what other factors might be contributing to this.If you are particularly stressed out about an upcoming deadline, try to manage your workload and understand that’s normal to get stressed sometimes. Positive thinking can help you to be more relaxed and get a better night’s sleep.A stressful lifestyle can result in higher levels of cortisol in your body, which in turn can cause sleeplessness.If you have nightmares that disturb your sleep, these may also be connected to stress or emotional trauma., Ensuring that your bedroom is as calm and soothing as possible will help you get to sleep without any pills. Avoid bright colours on the walls, try not to have a TV or computer in your room, and make sure that it is dark. You can get some blackout curtains if there is light coming from outside your window, and if necessary, try wearing an eye mask.


The temperature of your room is also important. A temperature of between 60 and 65°F (16 and 18°C), is considered the ideal for peaceful sleep.
If it is noisy, try wearing ear plugs to block out the sound.
Having pictures of friends and family, or works of art, around your room may make you feel more relaxed and at ease."

Wear ear plugs.,
Buy a white noise machine.,
Tell the person they snore.,
Sleep in another room.",How to Sleep With a Snoring Partner1," The simplest and quickest way to sleep better next to someone who snores is to simply buy a pair of ear plugs. You will want to shop around for the type that fits your ears best.Ear plugs can be found in almost any store that has basic medical supplies.
You may need time to adjust to wearing the earplugs as you sleep.
Most ear plugs are made of soft foam, which is placed inside the ear canal.;
, White noise machines generate a continuous tone that helps cover-up other distracting noises. By using a white noise machine, you will be less likely to be disturbed by any snoring throughout the night.Some white noise machines produce only one sound, a gentle static that is considered pure white noise.
If you prefer, other white noise machines will produce relaxing natural sounds such as that of ocean waves.
White noise machines may have external speakers, however, most are used with earplug style headphones.
Adjust the level of volume until you find an appropriate setting. You want it to be loud enough to block out external noises but not so loud that it keeps you awake.
For a cheaper alternative, you may use a fan or other such device to create a low level of white noise in the room.

, Many times the person who snores is unaware of the fact that they do. Make sure that they are aware they snore and work together to find which solution works best for you both.As difficult as it may be to try and sleep next to a snoring person, don't take it personally. Remember that snoring is not a personal failure.
There are methods they can use to stop snoring as much. Learn more about these methods to try and restore restful sleep to you both.

, Although often times undesirable, if you are unable to sleep next to a snoring person, you may, want to sleep apart from one another. Sleeping apart from the snorer will help improve your sleep.Make sure your new room is far enough away, or quiet enough, to ensure that you are not still able to hear any snoring.
Although it may seem like it, sleeping separately doesn't reflect poorly on your relationship. Remember that you are simply trying to improve sleep quality.
It's not so unusual for couples to sleep separately. Current estimates show that around 25% of couples are sleeping apart from one another.Sleeping apart may not be desired, however, it can actually improve your relationship. Sleeping apart can improve sleep quality, which can actually increase appreciation for one another."
"
Have your partner try sleeping on their side or stomach.,
Lose weight.,
Try nasal strips.,
Avoid alcohol and smoking.,
Visit your doctor.,
Explore surgical options to end snoring.",How to Sleep With a Snoring Partner2," Encourage your partner to avoid sleeping on their back. This can make snoring worse by putting pressure on your partner's diaphragm.Some have recommended sleeping with something uncomfortable, like a tennis ball, sewn into the back of a shirt. This will make it awkward for your partner to sleep on their back and forces them to sleep in another way.

, Being overweight is a common cause of snoring. The extra weight affects the lungs and neck, making airflow blocked or strained during sleep.Being overweight is not always a cause of snoring, however, it does increase the probability that snoring will occur.Excess body fat will increase the chances of developing sleep apnea.Changing aspects of a lifestyle, such as losing weight, are usually recommended starting points to stop snoring.Have your partner ask your doctor for more information on how you can best lose weight.

, Nasal strips are an over-the-counter method of improving airflow through the nose. The nasal strip works by slightly pulling open, and keeping open, the nostrils. The improved airflow will help reduce snoring.Falling asleep with the nasal strip on may be unusual at first. Continued use will help your partner get used to the nasal strip.
These strips won't be helpful to anyone suffering from sleep apnea because sleep apnea is caused by collapsed soft tissues in the back of the throat., Alcohol consumption and smoking can affect the throat and respiratory systems. Have your partner reduce the use of either to help prevent snoring from occurring.Alcohol causes the neck and tongue to relax which can obstruct airflow.
Never drink alcohol right before sleep as this will make snoring worse.
Smoking damages the throat and respiratory system. By reducing the amount your partner smokes, the chances of snoring occurring will also be reduced.

, Remember that snoring is a symptom of some other issue. Have your partner visit your doctor to determine exactly what the cause of their snoring may be. Examine the following list of possibilities to get an idea of what to expect:Nasal blockages. This may be due to chronic congestion or the configuration of your nasal passages, such as a deviated septum.
Untreated allergies. Allergies can produce swelling of tissue in the nose and throat, as well as cause mucus production that can make breathing difficult.
Obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a potentially serious medical condition that your doctor will want to address. This occurs when your throat tissue blocks your airway and prevents breathing entirely.

, If other options have not put an end to the snoring, ask your doctor about surgical options. Depending on your partners situation, there are a few different surgeries that may be recommend by your doctor:If your partners palate is the cause of their snoring, their doctor may recommend palatal implants. These are strands of polyester filament that are placed within the soft palate the mouth, which stiffen and prevent snoring.
Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) may be recommended if your partner has excess or loose tissue in or around the throat. By removing and tightening this tissue, this cause of snoring is eliminated.
Laser and radio/sonic based treatments can also be used to shrink any excessive amounts of tissue in the throat. These are both outpatient procedures and are not as invasive as traditional surgery.

Engage in mediation.,
Zone out.,
Plan on resting intentionally.,
Stay passively awake.",How to Rest Without Completely Sleeping1," Mediation is defined as the art of doing nothing and the techniques that provide you with rest are deeper than your deepest sleep. When you get overworked or severely tired and have no time to sleep, take time to mediate.Meditation will give you a deep rest from concentration, contemplation, and all of the sensory activities such as seeing, listening, smelling, and tasting.
Meditation is a calming effect on the mind and provides it with deep rest.
Try to meditate for at least twenty minutes a day for optimal performance.;
, With modern technology it seems we never have time to give our brain a short break. Zoning out, or mind-wandering, is a good exercise to take a short rest without sleeping during a busy day.When you need a break, walk over to a window and mindlessly watch the cars or people pass by for a few minutes until your mind doesn’t think about anything.
Find a quiet place and sit down. Close your eyes and just listen to the background noises.
Instead of taking a smoke or coffee break for fifteen minutes, try going outside, closing your eyes, and just let the sun shine all over your body while you clear your mind.

, Intentional resting can take place anywhere and at anytime. If you are really tired and need to take a short break from a busy day intentional resting can restore your energy by making a statement such as “I am resting my body because I am tired.” This method works for many people because you consciously choose to rest without trying to resist it.This exercise takes your stressed state of being to stillness and ultimately restores and enlivens you. Many people claim to feel energized after resting.
Rest does matter and surrendering the need to reenergize, even without sleeping, can provide a much needed break during a busy day.

, This is also called paradoxical intention. The purpose is to reduce worry and anxiety for people with sleeping disorders to not fall asleep in a bed. Instead, you have to try to stay awake rather than expecting to fall asleep (hence paradoxical intention).Since obsessive thoughts tend to increase when you try to suppress them, it naturally becomes more difficult to sleep when you try so hard to do it. Therefore, by taking the opposite approach of increasing the problem will, in turn, reduce it.

Take a cat nap.,
Plan to nap.,
Take an emergency nap.",How to Rest Without Completely Sleeping2," A cat nap is a short power nap of about ten or twenty minutes that will refresh and rejuvenate you.Find a quiet place that is comfortable and away from distractions. If you can, make the space dark, as if you were going to bed and try to lie down.
Don’t oversleep or the exact opposite effect will happen – you will become more tired.

, Or, what the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) refers to as “planned napping.” Basically, this is where you schedule a time of the day to take a nap before you are tired. It is good to prepare for this type of nap if you know you will be making a long road trip or working late into the night.Similar to cat napping, try to limit planned napping to twenty or thirty minutes max.
Bring a clock or watch with you so that you can set your alarm accordingly.

, When you suddenly become so tired that you cannot function properly and could potentially cause harm to yourself or others, take an emergency nap. These types of naps are most common for people working double shifts or traveling great distances because of their job.This type of nap is used during times of fatigue or when using dangerous machinery and are taken out of necessity for safety reasons.
If you have to resort to emergency napping frequently, it can become dangerous to your life and health.

Make yourself uncomfortable.,
Consume caffeine.,
Eat a healthy snack.,
Exercise to increase energy.,
Visit a doctor.",How to Rest Without Completely Sleeping3," Sit in a hard chair, open the window in winter, blast loud music, slap yourself in the face, or whatever it takes to stay awake. Why would you do this? If you have an important meeting that you are preparing for or driving to a far away destination, you might have to stay awake for a long period of time.Go into the bathroom, run water until it is ice cold, and then splash it all over face.
Turn up the intensity of the light in the room to reduce sleepiness and increase alertness.
Pinch the end of your nose until your nostrils are completely closed and you feel discomfort.

, Caffeine has a dramatic impact on sleepiness. A single cup of coffee, for example, can give you a boost of alertness. About 100 to 200mg of caffeine will do the trick.Be strategic with your caffeine. Although helping you to stay awake, more than 500 mg of caffeine a day can cause headaches, restlessness, or anxiety.
If you have to stay awake for a long period of time, drink a 5-Hour Energy, which has lots of useful B complex vitamins. Red Bull and Monster, however, rely mostly on caffeine and sugar, and are not recommended.

, Be careful of eating too many sugary snacks. Although sugar will give you an immediate boost of energy it will quickly die down and give you a sugar low overall. Instead, try eating a healthier snack that will help you stay awake.Try spreading peanut butter on a whole wheat cracker or on celery sticks.
Sprinkle a handful of nuts or fresh fruit on top of your yogurt.
Dip your baby carrots into a low-fat cream cheese.

, Recent studies show that low intensity exercises significantly reduce daytime fatigue compared to medication or and other methods. Try to get at least thirty minutes of exercise a day. It will not only improve your daytime performance, but also it will help you sleep better at night.Make sure to refill your energy levels after exercise by eating a meal that contains both protein and carbohydrates.
Try not to exercise too late at night. Otherwise, your body will be too active to enjoy a good night sleep.
Low intensity exercises include light walking, stretching, yoga, and swimming. Also, consider household chores such as vacuuming, gardening, or washing your car as potential to get your light workout in every day.

, If all else fails then visit your doctor. If you find it impossible to either get adequate sleep or don’t have enough energy throughout the day, you might have a more serious condition that needs a professional diagnosis. When sleepiness begins to disrupt your personal and professional life go see a doctor.Insomnia, the inability to sleep, and narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleeping, are two of the more recognizable sleeping disorders, but cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations can all occur if you are sleep deprived.
Narcolepsy starts between the ages of ten and 25 and is believed to be caused by a chemical imbalance. There are no known cures so it is treated with medication.
Insomnia is a disorder caused by stress, anxiety, depression, medical conditions, and age. Reducing these symptoms will help as will changing your sleeping patterns. If neither works, a doctor will recommend therapy or medication to treat the condition.

Monitor your sleep.,
Consider the volume of your snoring.,
Consider how often you wake up during the night.,
Consider how you feel during the day.,
Consider how often you wake up with a dry mouth or sore throat.,
Consider how often you experience headaches upon waking up.,
Consider how often you suffer from insomnia.,
Consider how mentally well you feel during the day.,
Visit a doctor if you think you have sleep apnea.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Sleep Apnea1," If you suspect that you have sleep apnea, you will want to monitor your sleep for symptoms. A professional sleep study is the main method of determining if your have sleep apnea, but telling your doctor about the symptoms you have will also help your doctor make a diagnosis.


Ask your sleeping partner to provide feedback on your sleeping patterns, especially if your behavior is interrupting your partner's sleep.
If you sleep alone, record yourself sleeping with a video or audio recorder or keep a sleep diary so you can record the hours you spend in bed, any awakenings during the night, and how you feel in the morning.;
, Loud snoring is one of the main symptoms of sleep apnea, especially the obstructive kind (which occurs when the muscles in your throat relax too much). You have loud snoring if it disturbs the sleep of those who share a room or a home with you. Loud snoring will cause you to suffer from extreme fatigue and sleepiness during the day, whereas normal snoring won't affect your daytime health., People with sleep apnea often wake up suddenly due to shortness of breath. Upon waking, they may also choke, snort, or gasp. You may not even be aware of some of these symptoms while you sleep, but waking up feeling out of breath is a strong indicator that you have sleep apnea. , People with sleep apnea suffer from extreme lack of energy, drowsiness, or sleepiness during the day regardless of the time spent in bed. Sufferers of sleep apnea may even fall asleep while performing important tasks such as working or driving., It is common for sufferers of sleep apnea to wake up with a sore throat or dry mouth as a result of their snoring. If you frequently wake up with a dry mouth and/or sore throat, then that might be a sign of sleep apnea., Morning headaches are common in people who suffer from sleep apnea. If you notice that you often wake up with a headache, you might have sleep apnea., People who suffer from sleep apnea often have trouble staying asleep or sleeping at all. If you have a hard time getting to sleep or staying asleep, then this might be a sign of sleep apnea., It is common for sufferers of sleep apnea to experience forgetfulness, concentration problems, and moodiness. If you frequently experience one or more of these issues, then this might also be a symptom of sleep apnea., Sleep apnea can cause serious health problems, so it is important to get a diagnosis and begin treatment as soon as possible. If your doctor suspects that you have sleep apnea, she will order a sleep study or polysomnogram to make a final diagnosis.The sleep study may be done in a sleep lab for complicated cases or at home for simpler cases.
During a sleep study, you will be connected to monitoring devices that will record the activity of your muscles, brain, lungs, and heart while you sleep."

Consider your age and gender.,
Take your weight into account.,
Consider any medical conditions you have.,
Take note of smoking.,
Consider your child's risk.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Sleep Apnea2," Men are more likely to have sleep apnea than women. The risk for both sexes increases as you age.People over the age of 65 or women past menopause are more likely to have sleep apnea.Your risk of developing central sleep apnea, in which the brain fails to signal your breathing muscles to work, increases once you are in middle age.A family history of sleep apnea also increases your risk, especially of obstructive sleep apnea, the most common type.African American and Hispanic men may be more at risk of developing sleep apnea., Being overweight or obese can raise your risk of having sleep apnea. People who are obese are four times more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea -- about half of the people with obstructive sleep apnea are overweight.People with thicker necks are also at increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea. For men, having a neck circumference of 17 inches (43 cm) or more increases your risk. Risk increases for women with a neck circumference of 15 inches (38 cm) or more., The risk of sleep apnea is higher for people with certain other medical conditions. Risk of sleep apnea is linked to the following conditions:Diabetes
Metabolic syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Stroke or heart disease
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Congestive heart failure
Pregnancy
Chronic nasal congestion
Pulmonary fibrosis
Acromegaly (high levels of growth hormone)Hypothyroidism (low levels of thyroid hormone)Small lower jaw or narrow airways
Use of narcotic pain medications

, Smokers are three times more likely than non-smokers to develop obstructive sleep apnea.Smoking negatively affects your entire body's health, so talk to your doctor about quitting as soon as you can.


Smoking e-cigarettes increases airway resistance, which makes it harder to breathe. Using e-cigarettes, or ""vaping,"" will also increase your risk of sleep apnea., Children may also experience sleep apnea. Like adults, children who are overweight are at increased risk of sleep apnea.Children may also have enlarged tonsils, which raises the risk of children experiencing sleep apnea. Enlarged tonsils may result from infections. Tonsil enlargement may not produce any symptoms, or it may cause a sore throat, trouble breathing, snoring, or recurring ear or sinus infections."

Start with your GP.,
Get a referral or choose a specialist.,
Schedule an initial consultation once you've found a doctor.,
Make sure you do not miss your scheduled sleep study.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Sleep Apnea3," Your regular doctor will be able to get you started. First, they will probably want to look at your risk factors – blood pressure, weight, snoring, daytime sleepiness, and others. Your doctor can then initiate a sleep study.Your doctor may well have you do a home sleep study before referring you to a sleep specialist. This is done with special equipment at your home. Some insurance companies also require it as a first step.
Follow your doctor’s instruction if you do a home sleep test. This might include not napping, not consuming caffeine, and following your normal routine as much as possible.
If a home test is abnormal, then you’ll need to move to the next steps of seeing a specialist or getting a hospital sleep evaluation.

, It is important that you find the right kind of specialist, and because of the seriousness of this disorder, make it a priority. A certified pulmonologist is the best doctor to see to test for sleep apnea, confirm a diagnosis and be treated by if you are diagnosed.

Your GP should be able to refer you to a suitable specialist.
You might also search WebMD or the internet in general to find a local pulmonologist or Sleep Unit, and review their profile to verify credentials and whether they specialize in testing for and treating sleep apnea.

, In this first appointment, the doctor will ask specific questions that will help identify if you experience any of the major symptoms. Almost certainly, the doctor will then set you up for a sleep study test and explain in detail what the sleep study is, how it is performed, what it will specifically be testing, and how to prepare for the sleep study.

Try taking notes during your appointment if you wish, or ask if there are leaflets you can take away with you to make sure you are completely prepared.

, You will be spending the night in a specialized medical center that has several rooms designed for comfort and tailored to make you feel like you're at home. Normally, you will be scheduled to report to the center in the evening of the study near a certain time for paperwork and the study and will be woken around 6 A.M the next morning. These are the general hours, with the goal that you get at least 6 hours of sleep, and cycle through 3 - 6 REM periods. When you've been awakened, you'll be sent home with a follow-up appointment scheduled before you leave. At the follow-up appointment, the doctor will inform you if you have been diagnosed with sleep apnea or not, and go over the results of the tests performed during the sleep study. The staff will all be professional and respectful. You don't need to worry about doing anything embarrassing in your sleep. They want you to be as relaxed and comfortable as possible."

Start immediate treatment and plan for the future.,
Lose weight if you are overweight.,
Exercise every day for at least 30 minutes.,
Decrease alcohol, sleeping pills, and sedative intake.,
Quit smoking if you are a smoker.,
Sleep on your side or stomach instead of sleeping on your back.Sleeping on your side or stomach will lessen or eliminate the symptoms of sleep apnea.,
Talk to your doctor about nasal sprays and allergy medicines.",How to Recognize Symptoms of Sleep Apnea4," If the sleep study confirms you have sleep apnea, the doctor will document the diagnosis, and you will have your official record of a positive diagnosis of sleep apnea. Follow your doctor’s instructions for treating your sleep apnea. Your doctor may prescribe either a continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP), device to help regulate your breathing. You will need to wear this device every night to help regulate your breathing while you sleep. Your doctor may also make other recommendations about your lifestyle that may eliminate or at least lessen the symptoms of your sleep apnea.


It is very important that you follow the instructions and use the CPAP or BiPAP machine every night or at least five nights out of the week. The C-PAP is not only to help treat your diagnosis, but to ease the symptoms and suffering caused by this serious condition. It is vitally important not to ignore symptoms of sleep apnea and seek confirmation and treatment.
If left untreated, the symptoms become worse, and the risk of developing additional serious physical ailments increase, and the higher the chances of putting your physical health and well-being at risk. If left untreated long enough, it can be even be fatal.
Be assured that sleep apnea is easily treatable, and with proper diet and exercise in addition to the disciplined use of the CPAP machine, your symptoms and suffering will begin to lesson, more and more. Within a year, it is very possible you may be symptom-free and healed of the disorder.
Your doctor will re-test you at the end of the treatment period to determine if the disorder is still present, and the majority of cases where treatment was followed consistently, the test will confirm you no longer suffer from sleep apnea.

, Since excess weight may be the cause of your sleep apnea, losing even a little weight may help to treat your sleep apnea. Make sure that you seek your doctor’s advice before beginning a weight loss program and follow your doctor’s recommendations for healthy weight loss., Obstructive sleep apnea symptoms may improve by getting 30 minutes of moderate activity each day. Try walking at a comfortable pace for 30 minutes per day to start and slowly increase your activity level as tolerated., These chemicals interfere with your breathing patterns by relaxing your throat. By decreasing or eliminating your intake of these chemicals, you may see an improvement in your sleep apnea symptoms. Make sure that you talk to your doctor before stopping any prescription medications., Smoking increases fluid retention in your throat and upper airways and increases inflammation in the same areas. These effects can make obstructive sleep apnea much worse.Talk to your doctor to get help as well as information on smoking cessation programs in your area.

, When you sleep on your back, your tongue and soft palate are more likely to block your airway and cause sleep apneas. Try placing pillows behind you or sew a tennis ball into the back of your pajama top to prevent yourself from rolling over onto your back., For some people, using a nasal spray or allergy medicine can help keep your nasal passages open at night, allowing you breathe more easily. Talk with your doctor about whether this is a good option for you."

Maintain a healthy lifestyle such as eating well, drinking water regularly, avoiding stress and maintaining a healthy weight.,
Establish a regular schedule for sleep.,
Avoid taking naps throughout the day.,
Abstain from smoking, drinking alcohol or ingesting caffeine because they can keep you up at night.,
Exercise regularly so that your body will be tired, but do not exercise for 3 to 4 hours before you go to sleep, because it may energize you.

Get out of bed and engage in a non-stimulating activity, such as reading until you feel sleepy again.",How to Prevent Sleep Disorders," Frequently, individuals develop sleep disorders due to stress or obesity.;
, Wake up and go to bed at the same time everyday, including weekends. Establishing a regular sleep schedule will train your body to sleep soundly on a consistent basis.

, If you take a nap during the day, then you will be less tired at night, be more restless and may not sleep as deeply.

, Even though alcohol makes you sleepy, it obstructs the quality of your sleep.

,,,,, Having a routine will train your body to recognize that you are preparing for sleep, which will help you to fall asleep easier.

, Do not work or do any other tasks in your bedroom if possible. If your bedroom is used only for sleep, then you will associate the room with sleep, which will aid in falling asleep faster and sleeping deeply.

, Sometimes lying in bed when you are not able to sleep makes it more difficult to feel sleepy.

Talk to your doctor.,
Take a sleep study if recommended.,
Seek behavioral counseling.,
Try medications with promising results.,
Make sleep eating safer instead of trying to forcibly stop it.,
Don’t view it as an eating disorder.,
Recognize common triggers.,
Don’t suffer in silence or shame.,
Take action for your health and safety.",How to Stop Sleep Eating," It is hard to pin down just how many people suffer from sleep eating, because many people with the disorder don’t report it to their doctors. Some are too embarrassed to bring it up, and others simply refuse to accept that something so far-fetched — getting up, gorging on junk food, and returning to bed with no memory — can be real. Don’t live in shame, nor in denial — if you suspect sleep eating, tell you doctor.Only a doctor can properly diagnose and treat sleep eating. She will likely ask about your medical history, prior sleep disorders (if any), medication list, recent changes in habits or lifestyle, and other factors that may indicate SRED.
Remember: sleep eating is not an imaginary condition, nor is it a personal failure. It is also unlikely to go away on its own. If you suspect it, seek a proper diagnosis and treatment options.;
, If your doctor suspects that you have SRED, he will likely recommend that you undergo polysomnography — an overnight study at a sleep clinic. This is one of the best current methods to diagnose sleep eating.In a sleep study, numerous probes and monitors will be attached to you in order to track your vital signs and sleep patterns. Even if they do not catch you getting up to sleep eat during the study, this detailed information can indicate a range of sleep habits and conditions that are often present alongside SRED.

, While there is still much to be learned about the causes of SRED, many cases of sleep eating seem to be linked to excessive stress and/or depression. Before seeing medication alone as your only option, talk to your doctor about the possible benefits of behavioral counseling, possibly in combination with medication to deal with sleep eating.Especially if you have experienced life changes that have increased your stress levels or risk for depression — the end of a long relationship, a death in the family, taking on a new job, quitting smoking or drug abuse, etc. — consider professional counseling as a means to deal with possible triggers for your sleep eating.
Along with therapy for depression and stress management, assertiveness training may also benefit some people. Even though sleep eating is not a question of “mind over matter,” learning to become more decisive and in control of oneself does seem to help some people with SRED.

, Medication treatments for SRED are still relatively new, which means there are several options but not as much clear evidence of positive results. You may need to work with your doctor and try several options before you find what works best for you. Keep trying, because most people with SRED do benefit from taking medication.First-line treatment is usually is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The recommended dose is between 20–30 mg/day.
For some people, anti-convulsant medications such as topiramate (100–300 mg/day)and zonisamide seem to be of great benefit.For others, dopaminergic agents (often used to treat conditions like Parkinson’s disease) such as pramipexole may be used in combination with a low dose of benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam) and opiates.
Sleeping pills, however, most notably Ambien, seem to increase the likelihood of sleep eating episodes and should be avoided if you have the condition.

, While you seek out and try out treatment options for your sleep eating, you should also take some practical measures to help protect yourself and others from injury during your episodes. Many sleep eating injuries occur due to falls while traveling between the bedroom and the kitchen, so make sure there is a clear pathway free of trip hazards each evening.Don’t try to restrain yourself in bed, lock yourself in your room, or hide your food. People with SRED are often very resourceful and determined during a sleep eating episode, and will usually achieve their goal in creative and sometimes destructive (or even injurious) ways.
Do make sure you have functioning smoke detectors, though, because sleep eaters have been known to leave ovens and stovetops on all night. If you have someone else in the home who can wake up every so often and check for potential injuries or hazards, all the better.

, SRED is an eating disorder only in the sense that it involves consuming a large amount of (usually unhealthy) food in a short period of time. It doesn’t seem to have anything to do with hunger, cravings, willpower, or body image, although some people who have made significant dietary changes or who suffer from actual eating disorders like anorexia may also develop SRED.SRED is not linked to daytime eating disturbances such as bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or anorexia nervosa.


Put it this way: sleep eating is an eating disorder in the same way that sleepwalking is an exercise disorder. The activity is a result, not a cause. Sleep eating is a parasomnia, a sleep disorder like sleepwalking, sleep driving, sleep talking, and so on.
Sleep eating is not the same as the condition known as “night eating syndrome,” in which a person consumes most of his or her calories after 6 pm and through the night. That condition is caused by a disruption in circadian rhythms, and night eaters are fully aware of what they are doing., For the most part, sleep eating seems to be triggered by significant lifestyle changes (especially those that increase stress levels) or changes in health or medication status. People with other existing sleep disorders, like sleepwalking, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and sleep apnea are also more likely to develop SRED.Common triggers of SRED include: depression; quitting smoking, drinking, or drugs; starting or stopping a medication; rapid changes in diet; insomnia; and other sources of stress and anxiety.
Sleep eating can occur without any of these triggers being present, however, so don’t discount obvious signs of SRED — unexplained messes, missing food, mystery weight gain, etc. — due to their absence.
Women are more likely to suffer from SRED than men.

, Hard data on SRED is hard to come by, but some experts estimate that about one percent of the U.S. population lives with some form of sleep eating. (Roughly ten percent of the population lives with any type of parasomnia sleep disorder.) Young adults are most likely to have SRED, and perhaps up to 80% of sleep eaters are women. A young woman aged 22–29 is the most likely candidate for SRED, for unclear reasons.If you are a sleep eater, it is important to know that you are not alone, you are not to blame, and there is help available. You may benefit from seeking out support groups and interacting with others like you.

, Usually, the negative results of sleep eating include big messes in the kitchen, a depleted pantry, and the addition of unwanted pounds; however, sleep eaters sometimes fall on their way to the kitchen (or back), cause fires or cut themselves trying to prepare food, or break teeth trying to bite into frozen food. They usually prefer sweet or gooey foods (like peanut butter, syrup, or honey), but may also eat raw meat or even non-food items like soap, paper, scouring pads, or (in the worst case) potentially-poisonous household cleaners.Sleep eating is not a joke or just an annoyance, then. It can be potentially dangerous to you and to others in your home. Seek treatment if you suspect SRED.

But the best thing you can do is to try and relax. If you feel like you are being held down, don't try to push against the force — allow yourself to be pushed. This may help you wake up or slip into a dream.Try memorizing a statement like, “I am in sleep paralysis, a natural condition, and I am in no danger.” Repeat the affirmation if sleep paralysis occurs while going to sleep or waking up.;
, Understanding sleep paralysis may help you to relax when it occurs — if you know and understand what is happening, and that it is only temporary, it may be easier for you to relax when it happens. Sleep paralysis can be a sign of a rare condition called narcolepsy, but it is usually not indicative of a serious disorder. When you are asleep you experience something called ""atonia,"" which is your brain keeping your body still and relaxed (possibly so you don't act out what is happening in your dream and injure yourself or others.) Sleep paralysis is when you are aware of is state.Scientists believe sleep paralysis may occur when you do not smoothly transition out of REM sleep
You may experience hallucinations, including thinking someone is in the room with you or holding you down. Remind yourself that these are just hallucinations, and a normal part of sleep paralysis, and you are not in danger., Some people may be able to break the paralysis by moving an extremity. Try focusing all your attention on your toes or fingers and try to wiggle them or make a fist. Another method is to try scrunching up your face as though you just smelled something foul. Repeat these actions several times and you may be able to wake yourself up., If you share a bed with someone, talk to him about what you are experiencing. He may be able to help you wake up from an episode of sleep paralysis. If your partner notices you breathing heavily and irregularly, ask him to shake you awake. This may or may not work — your partner may end up just waking you from normal sleep, but it's worth a try.Most people cannot speak while experiencing sleep paralysis, but talk to your partner about signaling him when you are having an episode. If you focus on your throat you may be able to whisper ""Help"" or cough, which can signal your partner to wake you up."

Understand what may be causing your narcolepsy.,
Improve your sleeping habits.,
Nap.,
Create a comfortable sleeping environment.",How to Manage Narcolepsy Symptoms1," There are many things that can cause or trigger narcolepsy. If you can identify the underlying problem, you may be able to more effectively manage your symptoms.

For many people, narcolepsy is caused by a lack of hypocretin (orexin) in the body. This could be caused by a genetic problem or by an autoimmune response, wherein the body attacks the parts of the body where hypocretin is produced. You may be able to boost hypocretin/orexin in your body.
Narcolepsy is occasionally caused by an infection (such as swine flu), brain condition (such as brain cancer or encephalitis), or a head injury. In these cases, you will also need to treat the underlying condition.;
, As there is no exact cure for narcolepsy, doctors recommend patients ease symptoms of fatigue by better managing their sleep schedules. Try to develop solid sleeping habits to help minimize the excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden muscle collapse (cataplexy) associated with narcolepsy.


Stick to a regular sleep schedule. Try to get up and fall asleep around the same time each day, including weekends. Your body's circadian rhythm may start to adapt to the schedule you've set and you'll eventually start to feel tired naturally around the same time each night and may wake up with less fatigue in the morning.Practice some kind of relaxing bedtime ritual each night. Pick low key activities, like reading or taking a warm bath, that will calm your mind and body in preparation for sleep. Avoid activities like watching television or using electronics, however, as the blue light from screens has a stimulating effect that can keep you awake.You may benefit from wearing amber-colored glasses at night. These may be able to block out the disruptive blue light from screens.You can download an app on your phone that will help you track your sleep quality. Some may even provide exercises to help improve your sleep., While napping is generally not advised for coping with sleep problems, people with narcolepsy tend to benefit from daily naps. Scheduled, brief naps throughout the day can help manage the fatigue associated with narcolepsy.


Schedule 20 minute naps throughout the day, focusing on the times you're most likely to feel tired. If you tend to have flare ups mid-afternoon, for example, try to fit in a short nap around this time.While 20 minute naps work for most people, you may need to sleep more or less depending on your symptoms. You might have to experiment with sleeping in different intervals for awhile until you find a routine that works for you.Keep track of your naps in a journal or with a sleep-tracking app. Make sure to record when you fell asleep, how long you slept, the quality of the sleep, and how you felt before and after. This can help you create an effective nap schedule.

, Having a good environment in your bedroom can help promote restful sleep. Making certain alterations to your bedroom can help with your sleep.]


Make sure your mattress and pillows are supportive and comfortable. If you consistently wake up with a sore neck or sore back you may need to replace your pillow or mattress. Make sure linens, comforters, and other bed supplies are free of allergens that might disrupt sleep.Try to separate your waking life from your sleeping life. Laptops, televisions, and phones should be kept out of the bedroom area.If you live in a noisy area, consider putting a white noise machine in your room to drown out unwanted sounds.Make sure your room is cool. The ideal temperature for sleep is between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit. If your room is usually warmer than this, consider lowering the temperature in your room or turning on a fan. If you do not have an air conditioner, you may want to consider installing one.If too much light is coming in from outside your window, you may want to install blackout curtains. These are useful if there are street lights outside or if you live in a northern locale with long days in the summer.

Increase your sleep time.,
Go to bed at the same time every night.,
Create a bedtime routine and stick with it.,
Make sure that your bed and bedroom are comfortable.,
Use your bed for sleep and sexual activity only.,
Stop eating about two hours before bed.,
Exercise earlier in the day.,
Limit or avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening.,
Relax before you go to bed.",How to Stop Sleep Paralysis2," Getting more sleep may help to stop sleep paralysis, so try to increase the amount of time that you sleep each night. Adults should try to get between six to eight hours of sleep per night, but you may need more.For example, if you are currently getting around six hours of sleep per night and you are having sleep paralysis as a result, then try to go to bed about an hour earlier so that you are getting seven hours of sleep per night. Seven hours is the minimum amount of sleep adults should get every night — you should aim for seven to nine hours if possible.

, Going to bed at the same time each night and waking at the same time every morning can also improve your sleep quality and quantity. Make sure that you keep this bedtime and waking time even on the weekends.


For example, if you normally go to bed at 11:00pm on weeknights, and wake up at about 6:30am, then maintain this schedule during the weekend as well.

, Having a regular bedtime routine can help to make it easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep.If you do not have a sleep routine, then create one that will be easy to stick to.


For example, your routine might consist of brushing your teeth, washing your face, putting on pajamas, reading for 20 minutes, and then climbing into bed for the night. Choose a routine that works for you.
If you can’t fall asleep right away, don’t struggle. Just get out of bed and re-do part of your routine. For example, you could get out of bed, read for another 20 minutes, and then climb into bed again.

, A comfortable mattress, soft bedding and pillows, and a pleasant, uncluttered space can make falling and staying asleep much easier. Your bedroom should also be dark, cool, and quiet.If your bedroom is messy or if your bed is uncomfortable, then work on turning it into a more pleasant space. For example, you might buy some new sheets, de-clutter your bedroom, or invest in a new mattress.
If you live in a bright, noisy neighborhood, consider getting some light and noise blocking curtains to put up in your bedroom.

, Do not do anything else in your bed or it may disrupt your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep, which makes sleep paralysis more likely. Do not watch TV, use your laptop or other devices, or even read in your bed., Eating within two hours of going to bed can disrupt your sleep, which may increase your risk of sleep paralysis.If you usually have a bedtime snack, then schedule it for about two hours before you go to bed each night.

, Strenuous exercise done late in the day can make it harder to get to sleep, so try to schedule your workouts for earlier in the day, such as in the morning or afternoon.If you need to exercise in the evening, stick to low-impact exercises, such as walking, light weight training, and stretching exercises.

, Caffeine can keep you awake if you drink it too late in the day. Try to limit or even avoid caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and cola in the afternoon and evening.For example, if you normally have a cup of coffee at about 4:00pm, try drinking a cup of half decaf coffee or a cup of green tea instead.

, Taking time to relax before bed may also help to prevent sleep paralysis and promote better sleep. There are many different relaxations techniques that you can use. Some good options include:


progressive muscle relaxation
deep breathing
a bath
yoga or gentle stretching exercises
calm music

Talk to your doctor before trying herbal supplements.,
Take valerian root.,
Try passionflower.,
Sip some chamomile tea.,
Consider lemon balm.,
Massage lavender essential oil into your hands and wrists.",How to Stop Sleep Paralysis3," Many people equate ""natural"" with ""safe,"" but this is not always the case. It is important to check with your doctor or pharmacist before trying supplements, as they can interact with other medications you may be taking or can aggravate existing medical conditions. Your pharmacist can also recommend reputable brands for supplements — they are not regulated by the FDA, so the supplements may not actually contain what is advertised. Your pharmacist should know which brands are the best.

, Valerian root is a mild sedative that may help you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. You can find valerian root supplements in drug stores and health food stores, but make sure that you check with your doctor before using valerian root.


Valerian root can interact with some medications, such as fexofenadine, alprazolam, and lorazepam.
A common dosage is 400 to 900 mg taken about two hours before bedtime for up to 28 days.

, Passionflower may help to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. You can find passionflower in drug stores and health food stores, but check with your doctor before using.


Passionflower can lower blood pressure, so if you take blood pressure medications, talk to your physician first.
Do not use passionflower if you are pregnant because it may induce uterine contractions.
Try taking one 90 mg passionflower tablet per day.

, Chamomile reduces anxiety and it may even improve the quality and quantity of your sleep. Try drinking a cup or two of chamomile tea before you go to sleep each night. To brew a cup of chamomile tea, just pour about 8 ounces of boiling water over a chamomile teabag in a mug. Let the tea brew for about five minutes and then remove the teabag. Allow the tea to cool a bit before drinking.


Chamomile can interact with a number of prescription medications, so check with your doctor first if you are taking any medications. For example, chamomile may interact with sedatives, blood thinners, diabetes medications, and blood pressure medications., Lemon balm can also reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. Lemon balm is even more effective is taken with chamomile or valerian root, so you may consider combining these herbs.


Check with your doctor before using. Do not use lemon balm if you have an overactive thyroid or if you are pregnant.
You can take lemon balm as a 300 to 500 mg capsule up to three times per day., Even taking a few moments to massage some soothing lavender oil into your hands and wrists may calm you down and help you get a better night sleep.


Try combining a few drops of lavender essential oil with a tablespoon of carrier oil such as almond or coconut oil. Then, massage the mixture into your hands and wrists and inhale deeply as you do so.

Make an appointment to see your doctor if sleep paralysis continues.,
Discuss taking tricyclic antidepressants with your doctor.,
Talk to your doctor about taking melatonin.,
Ask about side effects of your other medications.",How to Stop Sleep Paralysis4," If getting more sleep and taking steps to improve the quality of your sleep does not help, then you may need to see your doctor for treatment. Keep in mind that sleep paralysis may be a symptom of a bigger problem, such as narcolepsy., Your doctor may prescribe a tricyclic antidepressant, such as clomipramine, to treat sleep paralysis. Tricyclic antidepressants can change your brain chemistry and prevent sleep paralysis by increasing your rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Ask your doctor about this option as well as the potential risks and side effects of taking tricyclic antidepressants. Side effects may include:


Dry mouth
Constipation
Problems urinating
Sweating
Blurry vision
Drowsiness
Signs of an overdose include sedation, seizures, hypotension, and arrhythmia, which can can be fatal

, Melatonin is a sleep hormone that our bodies make naturally, but some people do not produce enough. Melatonin is available without a prescription, but you should check with your doctor before taking this medicine.Start with very low doses of melatonin, especially if you are elderly. Only 0.1–0.3 mg per day should help you sleep. If you cannot find a dose this low, try cutting pills in half or quarters., If you are taking any medications, then check with your doctor to see if they might be responsible for your sleep paralysis. Some medications can cause sleep disturbances, so reducing your dosage or trying another medication option might also get rid of your sleep paralysis.

"
"
Take stimulants.,
Use SSRI's, SNRI's, or TCA's.,
Ask about sodium oxybate.,
Try L-Citrulline supplements.",How to Manage Narcolepsy Symptoms2," Central nervous stimulants are usually the first course of action to treat narcolepsy with drugs. About 60-85% of narcolepsy patients experience an improvement in their symptoms.


There are a variety of different kinds of stimulants doctors prescribe to treat narcolepsy. Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), modafinil (Provigil) or armodafinil (Nuvigil) are usually used first as they're less addictive than other varieties. Side effects are fairly rare but can include headache, nausea, and dry mouth.If the first round of treatment is ineffective or too expensive, methylphenidate (Aptensio XR, Concerta, Ritalin) and other amphetamines may be prescribed. While these medications are very effective, side effects can be more severe. Such meds are very addictive and they can cause nervousness and heart palpitations., Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are usually used to treat mental illnesses like depression. However, they have been used with some success to address symptoms of narcolepsy.


Such meds, such as Prozac and Effexor, typically work by suppressing REM sleep, which can temporarily paralyze muscle movement. As a symptom of narcolepsy, cataplexy, has this effect on the body such medications can help. Such meds can cause some side effects, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and digestive problems.Examples of TCA's include imipramine and clomipramine.If SSRI's and SNRI's do not work, older types of antidepressants may be prescribed instead. While these meds are generally effective at treating cataplexy, side effects like lightheadedness and dry mouth are common., Sodium oxybate is generally taken before bed. A second dose may be taken 2.5 to 4 hours after the first one. It treats cataplexy, as well as nighttime sleeplessness. It can also treat daytime sleepiness.


The biggest drawback to sodium oxybate is that side effects can be fairly severe. Bedwetting, sleepwalking, and nausea have been reported in patients. It can also be potentially fatal to take sodium oxybate with other sleeping medications, narcotic pain relievers, and alcohol., L-Citrulline is an amino acid that may be able to increase your energy. This can be found naturally in foods such as watermelon, liver, and salmon. You can also take it in supplement form."

Boost hypocretin/orexin.,
Change your eating habits.,
Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine.,
Exercise regularly.,
Manage stress.,
See doctors and therapist.",How to Manage Narcolepsy Symptoms3," A lack of orexin is thought to be the cause of narcolepsy for most cases. You may be able to naturally boost production in your body by exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and reducing inflammation in your body. Some easy ways to increase this chemical in your body include:

Buying bright lights for your home.
Eating fermented food and drinks such as Kombucha
Identifying food allergies that may be causing inflammation
Going outside, Diet can affect symptoms of narcolepsy. Eating a healthy diet, low in heavy foods, can result in symptoms improving. Keep a food diary to help you track how certain foods affect your symptoms.


Heavy meals should be avoided. Try to eat 5 to 6 small, light meals throughout the day instead of 3 heavier meals.Foods with a low glycemic index, such as white breads and processed foods, can cause a temporary spike in insulin that results in fatigue shortly after meals. These types of foods can make anyone drowsy, but the effect can be more intense if you suffer from narcolepsy. Try to focus on eating vegetables and sources of lean protein, such as eggs or meat.Large meals eaten 3 to 4 hours before bedtime can cause indigestion which can affect your ability to sleep. Try to keep late light meals light and healthy.An autoimmune diet, such as the paleo diet, may benefit people with narcolepsy since autoimmunity is thought to be a cause of narcolepsy.

, These substances can be very disruptive for sleep. Try to minimize use if you suffer from narcolepsy.


Smoking can be particularly dangerous if you suffer from narcolepsy. Not only is nicotine a stimulant, it can be very dangerous to fall asleep with a cigarette in hand. Many people with narcolepsy feel smoking helps them stay alert throughout the day, but cigarettes are best avoided if you have narcolepsy.Alcohol can help you fall asleep faster, but the sleep you get will be less restful. Less restful sleep can result in fatigue during the day. Even moderate alcohol consumption can be discouraged if you have narcolepsy.Caffeine is often used by narcoleptics to manage feelings of fatigue throughout the day. However, caffeine does not replace sleep. It merely alters brain waves to block sleep inducing chemicals from entering the brain. As caffeine stays in the body for about six hours, keep caffeine consumption light and only drink, coffee, soda or energy drinks early in the day., Exercising can help you to stay alert, awake and focused. Exercising 3 or 4 times a week for 30 to 40 minutes can help with your sleep schedule. However, as exercise produces adrenaline avoid working out 3 to 4 hours before bedtime.Try low intensity activities like yoga, Tai Chi, or Qi-gong at night. These can help calm down your central nervous system.

, Stress can exacerbate symptoms of narcolepsy. Trying to keep your stress levels under control can result in a lessening of symptoms. There are a variety of activities you can participate in that result in a reduction of stress.



Practicing breathing exercises. There are certain deep breathing exercises designed to slow heart rate and other physical symptoms of stress.

Meditate. Meditation can help reduce stress by placing your thoughts in the present moment. Meditating each day can help with symptoms of narcolepsy.

Try yoga. Practicing yoga gets all of the parts of your body to work together and can help clear your mind. Yoga has the added benefit of being a form of exercise, which can help regulate your sleep schedule.

, Narcolepsy is a chronic condition that can be difficult to manage. People suffering from narcolepsy often develop psychiatric problems, like depression and anxiety, as a result of their disorder. Seeing a therapist can help you manage the emotional toll of narcolepsy. You should also have a team of doctors to help you manage the physical aspects of your narcolepsy.


You may want to have a team of practitioners that includes a primary care provider, neurologist, nutritionist, and therapist.
Ask your regular doctor for a referral for a therapist if you're experiencing a chronic low or anxious mood as a result of your narcolepsy. If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling from your college or university.Look out for support groups, whether online or in person as well. As narcolepsy is not a well understood disorder, many people feel isolated or frustrated. Talking to others who've experienced similar issues can help.

, Verify that the mattress is lying in a flat position. Place yourself at the head of your bed and locate the mattress zipper between the pillow cover and base. Duvet-style beds will have two mattress zippers.If there are two mattress zippers, unzip only the bottom zipper, which is normally hidden under the edge of the mattress., Locate the gray tab on the side of the bed where the hose is attached to the bed’s air chamber. Push in the gray tab, then gently pull the hose out of the mattress cover through the opening in the cover. If your Sleep Number bed has two hose connections per air chamber, remove both hoses.Go to the other side of the bed, and repeat the above step to remove the remaining hose.

, This includes the air chambers, foam border walls, and corner locks. Once all these items have been removed you will reach the bottom of the mattress. Take photos of the inside of your mattress throughout disassembly so you can refer to them later on for correct placement when reassembling your Sleep Number bed., The Firmness Control System is the large white box unit to which the hoses are attached. Unplug it from the wall and place the system and its remote securely into a packing box and surround with packing material. This prevents the system from being exposed to excess shock and vibration, which could damage the it., Make sure the box is also surrounded with packing material so the chambers do not get punctured or damaged. This could result in needing replacement chambers., Place the foam comfort pads and mattress cover into a double bag. This helps prevent the pads and mattress cover from becoming stained during transport., The retainers are what’s holding the mattress in place.

Make sleep a priority.,
Stay out of your room during the day.,
Stay away from screens late at night.,
Understand the necessity of good sleep.",How to Fall Asleep Easily (for Teens)1," If you're a teen, you might not bother working on prioritizing your sleep schedule. However, it's important to work on making good sleeping habits a goal. Try to manage your schedule around sleep.


Your body has a natural circadian rhythm that adapts to your sleep/wake cycle. If you make a conscious effort to go to sleep and wake up around the same time each day your body will begin to naturally nod off at bed time and wake up in the morning.It can be tempting to crash on the weekends, but this effects your sleep cycle. Try to not sleep in too late on Saturdays and Sundays.Try to schedule around getting enough sleep. Social events and extracurriculars should not interfere with getting 8 to 9 hours of sleep a night.;
, Many teens like to hibernate in their rooms. However, if you spend your days in your bedroom you'll learn to associate that space with activity. When it's time to sleep, your brain won't be ramped for rest. Try to avoid your room during the day.Beds, in general, should only be used for sleep. Your body should associate your bed with rest time. Doing homework, playing video games, or spending time on your laptop in bed can confuse your mind and body.If you crave the privacy of your room, try to separate the sleeping area from the waking area. Have a desk placed in your room and use this to go online, do homework, talk on the phone, and any other activities you'd rather do in private. You can even consider putting up a curtain or some kind of divide between your bed and activity area. This way, your brain will associate a certain part of the room for sleep., Teenagers tend to spend a lot of time on their phones. However, the light produced from electronic screens produces a stimulating effect that makes sleep difficult. Strive to limit exposure to screens in the hours leading up to bedtime.


Stay off your laptop and phone for a couple of hours before bed. If you feel you'll be tempted, have a family member hide the items from you until morning.Try doing your homework before bed, as long as you're not too sleepy. This can prevent the temptation to play video games or watch television as there is a task that needs to be completed.If you really enjoy using your phone or computer to wind down, there are ways to block the lights from screens that cause a boost in energy. You can use sunglasses or download software for your laptop that blocks out the kinds of screen lights that effect sleep., Many teens simply do not understand the importance of a solid sleep schedule. Spend some time educating yourself on why getting enough sleep is important. This could motivate you to work on prioritizing good sleep habits.


Getting enough sleep promotes good memory and performance. If you want to succeed academically or at an extracurricular activity, working on your sleep can help.Poor sleep habits can cause irritability and a short temper. Not sleeping well for a long time can affect your relationship with others. If you don't want to alienate friends and significant others, sleeping better can help."

Seek out therapy and support.",How to Manage Narcolepsy," Developing good sleeping habits can help combat the daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. There are a variety of habits that can improve sleep/wake cycles that may be effective if you're suffering from narcolepsy.


Stick to a sleep schedule, even on weekends. Our bodies have an internal clock that signals roughly when we should wake up and go to bed. If our sleeping habits are erratic, this clock is disrupted. Go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each night, even on the weekends or on mornings when you do not need to be awake early.Establish a relaxing bedtime routine. This means engaging in calming behavior, like reading or a warm bath. Reduce exposure to bright lights or electronic screens, which are stimulating and can suppress melatonin production, a hormone that makes you sleepy. Your relaxing routine can help you separate sleep time from daytime activities that cause stress, excitement, and anxiety.Keep your bedroom comfortable. The ideal sleeping temperature is 60 to 67°F (15.6 to 19.4°C). If need be, invest in fans or air conditioners to keep things cool. Make sure your room is free from bright lights and loud noises; use blackout curtains to keep light out and use a sound machine or earplugs to block out loud noises. Keep the room free of any allergens that may disrupt sleep.While small naps during the day can cause sleep problems for many, they may actually be effective in fighting narcolepsy. Planning naps that last for 15 or 30 minutes throughout the day can prevent sudden bouts of sleep.Napping before an important event can make it less likely you will fall asleep.;
, These substances can dramatically affect sleep cycles. If you suffer from narcolepsy, they're best avoided.


Nicotine is a stimulant. Smoking, especially before bed, can cause undue restlessness. Also, as narcoleptics fall asleep unexpectedly, there's a risk of falling asleep with a cigarette in hand and causing a fire. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about quitting. Not only does smoking affect narcolepsy, it can lead to a host of other health problems.While alcohol can help you fall asleep faster, the sleep you have is of lower quality overall. When you fall asleep after drinking, brain patterns indicate restlessness and people often report fatigue after drinking even if they've had enough sleep.Alcohol consumption, even moderate consumption, is discouraged if you suffer from narcolepsy.Caffeine is often the go-to for narcoleptics as it's a powerful stimulant that can ward off sleepiness during the day; however, caffeine cannot replace sleep. It merely keeps us alert by blocking sleep-inducing chemicals in the brain and producing adrenaline. Caffeine stays in the body for a long time. It takes six hours for half of the caffeine consumed to be eliminated, so drink caffeine in moderation and avoid consuming caffeine in the afternoon and evening., Exercise can be a powerful natural stimulant. It increases alertness during the day and helps promote health and wellness overall.


During breaks at work, take a 30-minute walk or do simple exercises to stretch the muscles. This can wake you up and ward off unexpected bouts of sleep during work hours.Be careful about when you exercise. While daily exercise can help with your overall sleep schedule, you should not work out before bed. Physical activity has a stimulating effect on the brain. Aim to get exercise in four of five hours before bedtime., Certain foods and eating habits can promote sleepiness. If you have narcolepsy they're best reduced or eliminated altogether.


Large meals should be avoided three or four hours before bedtime, as such meals can disrupt sleep. Aim for lighter dinners, earlier dinners, or breakup dinner into two meals.
Your diet should consist of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy, and lean protein. Heavy sugar intake and processed carbs like white bread and rice increase blood sugar rates rapidly. When these rates drop, sleepiness follows. Try avoiding such products.
Meals should be scheduled and you should eat small meals throughout the day, especially if you have certain obligations. Large meals can cause sleepiness.

, Narcoleptic episodes can be triggered by intense emotions, so it's very important you keep stress levels in check.Exercise can help manage stress and emotions, particular long walks or runs. As previously stated, make sure to only exercise four or five hours before bedtime.

Deep breathing, meditation, yoga, tai chi, and art and music therapy have all been used to successfully manage stress. Look for classes, seek out therapists, or do research online or at the library to learn more about such techniques.Relaxation techniques that involve refocusing your attention on something calming can also be used throughout the day. Autogenic relaxation involves repeating words and suggestions in your mind. Progressive muscle relaxation involves slowly tensing and relaxing each muscle in the body. Visualization involves imagining a calming situation or scene to try escape a stressful situation mentally., In case you do fall asleep, it's imperative that you take safety precautions especially while undertaking activities that might be dangerous. You need to discuss your condition with those around you so they know how to keep you and themselves safe in the event of accidents.


Take stock of any situations in which you know you're at increased risk of falling asleep. Inform those around you of your risk, and let them know what kind of intervention, if any, you'll need.Avoid operating machinery or driving if you've been experiencing symptoms of narcolepsy that day or week. Talk to a doctor to get advice on how to handle driving and work-related machine operation with your condition.Cataplexy, a symptom of narcolepsy that results in sudden muscle malfunction and weakness, can occur spontaneously throughout the day. While injury during cataplexy is unlikely, make sure people who work and live with you are aware of the possibility of an episode. Let them know what precautions they may need to take to prevent an accident.A medical alert bracelet can be a good investment, as it will let others know what is going on if you fall asleep or experience cataplexy.If you're a swimmer, wear safety gear during all swimming activities. Never swim alone as an episode of sudden sleep or cataplexy can be fatal without a lifeguard or seasoned swimmer near by.

, Narcolepsy a challenging condition not only because of its physical effects, but it can also be isolating emotionally, as people misunderstand it as simple laziness or disorganization. Being open about your condition, even when it's difficult to share, can help combat these feelings and reduced outside judgment.


You may find that most people don't understand, and write your condition off as fatigue. Explaining narcolepsy and its causes to friends and loved ones may help. Seek out support groups, either in your area or online, and have them direct you to pamphlets and reading material you can share with those around you.

, Narcolepsy can be difficult to manage if you work or are enrolled in school full time. As the condition can occasionally affect performance, open communication between you and your boss, teacher, or professor is important.


Narcolepsy can affect attention span, concentration, and short term memory. The good news is that, with appropriate accommodations, most people can function normally with narcolepsy. Teachers, professors, and employers should be informed of the condition and establish an agreement with you that allows you to manage your condition at work or school.For young children, narcolepsy can be particularly hard to cope with at school. If your child has narcolepsy, make sure you talk to their teachers as children are sometimes punished or scolded for sleeping in class.Sometimes, you may have to record meetings during work in case of unexpected sleep. Approach your boss to discuss this and make sure it does not breach company policy. If a recording device is not allowed, you could see if your business could supply you with a note taker.Public awareness and understanding of narcolepsy is still very limited. Make sure you go in with a variety of resources and information ready, as your teacher or employer may be unfamiliar with the condition. If needed, bring a note from your doctor laying out your needs., Narcolepsy is fairly uncommon, and it is important to be evaluated by a doctor for a correct diagnosis. Your doctor will give you a physical exam to rule out any other issues that may be causing symptoms similar to narcolepsy and it will be necessary for you to undergo specialized tests in a sleep disorders clinic.Your doctor will also want a detailed medical history, and may ask you to keep a sleep journal.If your doctor suspects you have narcolepsy, you will likely have to undergo at least two sleep tests, the polysomnogram (PSG) and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).The PSG is an overnight test in which machines at a sleep disorders clinic will measure things like your heart and respiratory rates, electrical activity in the brain, and nerve activity.The MSLT measures your tendency to fall asleep during the day and determines if elements of REM sleep occur during waking hours.They will also test how long it takes you to fall asleep.Other tests, such as blood or spinal fluid tests, may also be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of narcolepsy., Stimulants affect the body's central nervous system. They are generally the primary treatment method prescribed for those with narcolepsy as they can help you stay awake throughout the day. Talk to your doctor about stimulants and decide, based on your medical history, what the best route of treatment is for you.


Modafinil and armodafinil are the most often prescribed medications for people with narcolepsy. They tend to be less addictive than other stimulants (like amphetamines) and produce less mood swings. Modafinil given in the morning prevents sleeping during the day, but should still allow you to fall asleep at night. Side effects tend to be rare, although some patients report dry mouth and nausea.Some people may not respond to modafinil or armodafinil. Other options include methylphenidate type drugs, such as Ritalin, but these have been known to produce nervousness in patients. They also tend to be more addictive.Your doctor should discuss with you the benefits and drawbacks of any stimulant. If you have any questions or concerns, discuss them with your doctor.

, If you suffer from symptoms like cataplexy, hallucinations, or sleep paralysis you might be prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI's).


Prozac, Sarafem, and Effexor are all types of SSRI's and SNRI's. They can be powerful in terms of combating the more severe effects of narcolepsy, but have some undue side effects.Side effects include weight gain, digestive problems, and sexual dysfunction. If you're prescribed SSRI's/SNRI's and experience any side effects, talk to your doctor about adjusting the dosage or switching meds., Sodium oxybate can be incredibly effective in combating cataplexy. It also helps with nighttime sleep and, in high dosage, can prevent daytime sleepiness as well.Sodium oxybate should be taken twice daily: one at nighttime, and one four hours later.Your doctor will want to know your medical history before prescribing sodium oxybate as it can cause serious side effects. While doctors only prescribe medication when they think the benefit outweighs the risk, you should be aware of potential drawbacks and discuss them with your doctor. Nausea and bed-wetting have been reported. If you are a sleepwalker, your sleepwalking may become worse. Talk to your doctor if you experience any side effects.Never take sodium oxybate with other sleeping medications, narcotic pain relievers, or alcohol. This can cause potentially fatal side effects, such as difficulty breathing and coma. If you're prescribed any other medications while taking sodium oxybate, ask your doctor about the possible interactions., Narcolepsy can be a difficult condition in that it can cause psychological effects. These are due to a combination of factors, such as the effects of the disorder on the brain, public stigma, frustration over the symptoms, and trauma caused by sleep paralysis or hallucinations.


Frustration and low mood are often reported in narcoleptic patients, and such symptoms tend to persist longer if not addressed.If you're experiencing a chronic low mood, find a therapist in your area. You can do this by checking with your insurance provider or searching online. If you are a college student, your university might provide free counseling.
Many people with narcolepsy feel frustrated by the lack of understanding. A sense of solidarity can be found by seeking out support groups. Ask your doctor or therapist about where to find support groups. If there are none in your area, many forums exist online where you can voice concerns and frustrations with others."

Incorporate daily activities that promote good sleep.,
Do not procrastinate.,
Stay active during the weekends.",How to Fall Asleep Easily (for Teens)2," Changing certain daily activities can promote better sleep. Making slight tweaks to your lifestyle can result in your sleeping easier and longer.


Do not binge eat before bedtime. Late night snacking can lead to indigestion and other stomach problems that keep you up at night.Exercise. Whether you join a school sport or simply start walking or jogging on your own, exercising in the early afternoon can help you fall asleep faster at night. Be careful, however. Exercising a few hours before bedtime can lead to difficulty sleeping later in the day.Cut back on caffeine. Many sodas and energy drinks popular with teens are loaded with caffeine. Caffeine stays in your system for up to 6 hours after consumption, so having soda or a latte after school can inhibit your ability to sleep at night.Avoid napping too close to bedtime. If you have to nap, nap for less than an hour and do so early in the afternoon., Oftentimes, teens end up staying up late due to homework. While doing homework in the early evening can actually help with sleep, putting off a math assignment until 9 or 10 o'clock can result in you staying up way too late. Try to make homework a priority earlier in the day.

, Sleeping in over the weekends can seriously damage your circadian rhythm. Many teens love to snooze well past noon on weekends, but doing so can result in difficulty getting to bed Sunday night. Find ways to avoid sleeping in on Saturdays and Sundays.


Make plans with friends early in the day. Suggest you all go out to breakfast or brunch. Plan a day hike. Decide to go shopping at 11 AM rather than 2 PM.
Pick activities you enjoy to do over the weekend. Plan to get up early to take the dog for a walk or read a good book.
Plan to do your homework early in the day. This way, you won't worry about having put it off and you'll have motivation to get out of bed early.

Aim for 7-8 hours sleep.,
Make the most out of your beauty sleep:


Sleep on your back to avoid wrinkles or puffiness on your face.,
Tire yourself out throughout the day so that you'll be nice and sleepy when it comes to bedtime:


Engage in some form of physical activity during the day, but not just before bedtime.,
Prepare your mind and body for sleep so that you won't be lying awake when you go to bed.,
Ensure that your bedroom is set up for sleeping in.",How to Ensure You Get Your Beauty Sleep," This is the guideline amount of sleep for the average adult, although everybody's body clock works slightly differently. This is enough time for your body to repair and look after itself, but not too much that you wake up feeling worse.


Get into a routine, if you always sleep at the same time, your body will get used to it, and you'll find it easier to wake up when you need to in the morning, and you'll find it easier to sleep in the evening.;
, It'll also cause less back and neck pain than sleeping on your front.

Wash your face thoroughly to give your skin the night to breath.
Enhance the repair/re-moisturizing that occurs overnight by using an overnight moisturizer suitable for your skin type. Include an eye-cream in your nighttime moisturizing routine to prevent puffiness under your eyes when you wake up.
Use a plump pillow. Two pillows cause a bad neck, but one plump pillow will keep your head slightly lifted which can avoid puffiness in the morning.
Use a replenishing overnight hair treatment every now and then, as long as you'll have time to rinse it out in the morning.

, As well as keeping you fit and healthy, exercise will also use up your energy, leaving you tired enough to sleep in the evening. Even if you just walk to the shops instead of getting the bus, or taking the dog out for a fast paced walk, it's better than sitting around all day. However you shouldn't do exercise for at least 2 hours before you plan on going to bed. This is because it boosts your endorphins and blood circulation, making it hard to doze off.
Refrain from taking mid day naps. Naps are never a deep enough sleep for your body to really benefit from it. In fact you probably often wake up from a mid day nap feeling more groggy than when you went to sleep. Napping in the middle of the day will make you go to bed later than you usually would, which means you're missing out on your proper sleep. If you're feeling tired then have a cup of tea and go for a walk in the fresh air outside to wake you up.

, There are several ways you can improve how quickly you can fall asleep:



Deal with stress well before bedtime. Get any work done and out of the way so that you don't worry about it when trying to sleep. If there's any unresolved issues that keep playing on your mind, try dealing with them, either by working out a solution to the issues, or by talking to someone else about it to help yourself to deal with it. Then, by the time you go to bed you'll have nothing on your mind to keep you awake.
Spend time relaxing for about an hour before you plan on going to bed. It'll make your sleep so much better if you do. Don't play any video games or watch TV in this time as it just keeps your brain active. You could have a bubble bath, listen to relaxing music, lie in bed with some candles lit and a good book to read, watch the stars, meditate or write in a diary. Make sure that you are ready for bed by a reasonable time, feeling well pampered and ready for the next day to come.
Have a glass of milk. Warm milk before bedtime can actually help you to sleep because it encourages the release of melatonin and serotonin, hormones which will help you get your sleep.
Your evening meal should be light and should be eaten ideally, 3-5 hours before retiring. Many people eat their largest meal in the evening, and their lightest meal at midday, but actually it would be better to have it the other way around. Going to bed straight after a large meal can cause stomach pains, discomfort, and bloating. Try to avoid carbs as they can cause you to wake up with a less defined complexion. And definitely avoid caffeinated drinks in the hours before bed as they are stimulants and will keep you awake. Try herbal teas as a supplement.

, Get rid of annoying flashing lights, ticking clocks and things that look scary in the dark. Make sure that you have curtains, and can close the door enough to be dark. Cracks of light are annoying and can keep you awake. Also, make sure that you can't hear noise, such as other family members watching TV, and if you can then try to ask for it to be turned down/off.Ensure that bedrooms are well-ventilated throughout the day and that room temperature upon retiring is about 60–70 °F (16–21 °C) as this is the best temperature for inducing sleep.


Invest in a comfortable bed. Ideally a mattress should be firm enough to support your back and soft enough to let you relax on it. The recommended time to keep a mattress before replacing it is seven years. If yours is old or uncomfortable then perhaps it's worth looking at buying a new one. As well as this, ensure that you keep your bed sheets nice and clean and fresh. It'll make bedtime so much better. Try using lavender scented fabric conditioner on your bed sheets to make it even more relaxing.
Use silk pillow cases. They're better for your skin, prevent wrinkles, prevent hair breakage, and don't give you messy hair while you sleep.

Use sleep routines.,
Find a sleep app you like.,
Try listening to audio books.,
Count backwards.",How to Fall Asleep at a Sleepover1," You can learn to use relaxing sleep routines at home before going to a friend's house for a sleepover. Any routine that helps your body relax will help you go to sleep. An example of a relaxation routine used before bed is progressive body relaxation. This means thinking about every individual part of your body, first tensing, and then relaxing it.Start at your toes, and work your way, one body part at a time, all the way to the top of your head and the tips of your fingers.
Don't feel like you have to complete the entire exercise. You may find yourself asleep before you finish.
Notice any sensations that appear in your body as you move through. This will help you stay focused and relaxed.;
, There are lots of good sleep apps that you can download to your phone or tablet. Some apps are guided meditations, while others just provide ""white noise"" to help block out the other sounds. Some are quiet ""environmental"" sounds like waterfalls, ocean surf, or crickets.If you're not sure what will help you get to sleep, try downloading some free apps first.
One of the most popular apps is called iSleepEasy. It contains a variety of short guided meditations to help you get to sleep.The disadvantage of using sleep apps at a sleepover is that you'll have to be comfortable falling asleep wearing headphones or ear buds.

, Listening to an audio book that you're not very interested in, or listening to poetry on your phone or tablet, can be a good way to fall asleep. A good choice for an audio book for sleeping might be a book you've already read. It will be interesting, but it won't keep you awake to see what happens because you already know what happens.Remember not to listen to scary stories when you're trying to fall asleep.
If you're too interested in the book, it might keep you awake. The best nighttime audio books might be a little dull. Maybe an academic subject, like science or history, would work best.

, This is one of the simplest methods to fall asleep. Start at 100, and mentally count backwards one number at a time: 100, 99, 98, 97...etc. If you get all the way back to 0, start the counting again. Or start at 300. Or 500. You can start at any number you like, as long as you stick to your counting method that you've begun.If you like, visualize the numbers being written, slowly, by a calligrapher.
You can try variations on this by counting backwards in other patterns. For example, count backwards by 2 (100, 98, 96, 94...) or by 3 (100, 97, 94, 91...)
Use your imagination to create other scenarios. For example, visualize each number descending an ornate staircase. Or falling from a tree, like autumn leaves. Use whatever visual image helps you relax and fall asleep.

Try using a pillow to trap your arm in this position to keep it from falling if you move at night.;
, Try sleeping on your back you’re your hand positioned near your shoulder, or with your arm all the way across your chest. This will elevate your hand while you sleep.Try placing some pillows next to your arm that help keep your arm in place and your hand elevated while you sleep.

, Lie on your back in bed and lift your arm up you’re your head, so that it rests on the pillows above your head. You may want to sleep with two pillows propping your head up, so that the elevation is more distinct.This can be a difficult pose to maintain while you are asleep, but it is one of the most effective at helping circulation and swelling.

, Lay on your side (the opposite side of the arm that needs to be elevated) and position several pillows on the bed next to you – kind of like you are going to hug the pillows. Place your hand palm down on top of the pillows and try to remain in this position while you sleep.Make sure that you position the pillows in such a way that it won’t be easy for your hand to roll off or change positions while you are sleeping.

Make sure you know how much sleep your child needs.,
Cut down on sugar.,
Watch out for food additives.,
Ensure that your child's sleep environment is comfortable.,
Organize everything your child needs before bed.,
Get your child into a routine.,
Be sure to include 'wind down time' just before bed.,
Plan ahead for how to manage your child's feelings.,
Help your child to feel safe.,
Get help if your child is having a lot of problems.",How to Develop Good Sleeping Habits in Children," How much sleep people need varies between individuals, as well as by age. Young children may need up to twelve hours, whereas older school-aged children may only need nine. If your child is having trouble sleeping, they may be overtired by the time they get to bed, or they're going to bed too early for their waking time. Adjust your child's sleep and wake times accordingly, and consider limiting naps in the day.;
, Sugar is a stimulant and children are very sensitive to it. Swapping their usual dessert for a low-sugar option such as a piece of fruit or yogurt can help. A pinch of sprinkles on an otherwise low-sugar option can help kids feel better about it. You could also consider allowing them a 'dessert' before dinner. This will help them sleep better and be less irritable at bedtime. Water is perfect for dinner and afterwards, so avoid juice or sugary drinks later in the afternoon and evening.

, Many children are sensitive to food colouring and additives. Allergies can also interfere with children's sleep time. Consider keeping a journal of what your child eats and how they behave; this can help you identify any problems and eliminate them.

, A clean room at a comfortable temperature with appropriate bedding can eliminate a lot of problems. A lot of children need a nightlight to feel safe and enjoy soft music. Talking to your child about what they like and getting them involved in organizing it can make their room feel more like their own safe place and therefore, help them sleep.

, Let them choose their blankets and a cuddly toy if they like, and have a glass or bottle of water ready by their bed. The idea is to ensure they don't need to get up and keep asking for things after they're tucked into bed.

, Routine is important for adults and children alike. It allows the body and mind to pick up on cues that it's soon time to sleep, as well as helping children feel safe. Plan your child's dinner time, bath time, wind-down time and bedtime well in advance, ensuring that it's the same time every day. Make sure they have time to do any homework or chores before their nighttime routine begins, and avoid the temptation to let them stay up late on the weekends.

, This can be in the form of a bedtime story, some cuddles, or a quiet chat. Often bedtime is the first chance kids get to have quiet, one-on-one time with their parent/s, so be sure to factor anything they need into your routine.


For example, if their 'true' bedtime is seven thirty but they want some cuddle time, tuck them in fifteen minutes early. Be sure not to let this stage go on for too long; it's important for children to associate their bed with sleeping rather than play. This will help them 'switch off' when they go to bed.

, Anxieties around monsters, nightmares and being alone are very common in children. Despite what some people say, your child isn't just being naughty or trying to press your buttons; their worries are very real to them and they deserve to have their feelings validated. Rather than telling your child that they're 'being ridiculous' and need to 'get over it', hug them and tell them you understand that they're upset, that everyone feels sad or worried sometimes, and that you're here for them. Taking the extra time to make them feel secure pays off in the long run. You can organize how to deal with specific fears ahead of time.


For example, if your child is afraid of monsters, make a 'monster repellant spray' out of water, lemon juice or whatever you like; just make sure it smells nice. Spray it under their bed, in their wardrobe, or wherever they think monsters may be hiding. Use this in conjunction with reminding them that monsters aren't real, and tell them this is 'just in case'.
If your child is afraid of a specific monster, find their weakness. For example, if your child is afraid of Medusa (the mythical Greek monster who turns people to stone) put a small mirror in your child's room and let them know that if Medusa were to appear, the mirror would turn her to stone.
If your child is afraid of burglars, give them a baby monitor or walkie-talkie so they can talk to you. Put up a fence, safety bars on the windows or whatever else will help to make your child feel safe.

, If your child is upset, they may need you to lie down with them for a little while or have some warm milk in the kitchen. Kids, like adults, can get 'stuck' in a certain way of thinking and feeling, making it difficult for them to calm down. It's okay to take them out of the environment or lie down with them to help them calm down if they need it. Remember that making your child feel safe is an investment in their well-being, as well as future bedtimes; children who feel safe and loved are more likely to be able to sleep.

, They may need to see a pediatrician. Problems such as anxiety disorders can affect sleep even in children. Remember as well to get support for yourself; child rearing is a huge job and can be overwhelming. Watching your child distressed, as well as having interrupted sleep yourself, can wear you down. Sharing parenting and home care tasks as well as networking with other parents can help. 


If you begin to get upset while looking after your child, it's okay to take a few minutes to sit down and collect yourself, even if they're crying. Just be sure you tell them what you're doing and how long you'll be gone for.

Be sure you're comfortable.,
Stay away from sodas before bed.,
Avoid eating too much sugar before bed.,
Try to stay away from scary movies at night.,
Don't get worried if you can't sleep.,
Plan your ride home.",How to Fall Asleep at a Sleepover2," If you're too hot, take off some blankets. Too cold? Make sure you're well covered. It can be hard to get used to sleeping in a new place, so make sure you bring your favorite pajamas. Bring some socks to keep your feet warm if you need to.Bringing your own pillow or stuffed animal will help you feel safe and comfortable.
Doing your normal nightly routines, like brushing your teeth, taking a bath or reading a favorite book before bed, will help you fall asleep at a sleepover.

, Many sodas contain caffeine, which is a stimulant and may keep you from going to sleep. Try not to drink too much liquid of any kind right before bed, but if you're thirsty, stick to water.Not only are many sodas full of sugar and caffeine, but most are diuretics, which means that they make you need to go to the bathroom.
If you're sensitive to caffeine, stay away from anything containing caffeine after 3:00 in the afternoon.

, Sugar can give you an unpredictable burst of energy that will easily keep you awake at a sleepover. Cookies, candy, cakes and ice cream are the main culprits, but remember that a lot of junk foods are loaded with sugar as well.Eating chocolate will combine sugar with caffeine, a double-dose of wakefulness.
Overeating before bedtime is also associated with nightmares, another cause for difficulty sleeping.

, Watching scary movies is fun to do unless it keeps you from falling asleep. If you've been telling scary stories or watching scary movies with your friends, turn your attention to something more calming when it's time to go to sleep.It can be helpful to remind yourself that the scary movies are always pretend. There might be some scary things in the world, but none can be solved by staying awake worrying!

, It's natural to have difficulty sleeping in a new place. If you're worried about not being able to sleep, you'll be even more stressed and tense. Those feelings make it even harder to sleep. Instead, practice relaxation strategies such as paying attention to your breath.Try using your sleep routines, such as listening to relaxation apps on your phone.
Practice thinking good thoughts as you try to fall asleep. Focusing on the things you're happy about will keep you from being worried.
If you can't sleep after a short time, don't force yourself. Go read a book, or enjoy listening to an audiobook. After a while, you may fall asleep on your own.

, It can feel terrible to feel like you're trapped at a sleepover. Make sure you have a phone number to call if you need to leave to go home, whether it's the middle of the night or the next morning. If you know you have a ride home whenever you need it, you might feel calmer and more able to sleep.If your parents are out of town, make sure you have the phone number of another adult or trusted family friend to call.
Always have a phone number to call in case of emergency.

Look into headaches.",How to Recognize Signs of a Sleep Disorder2," Many children occasionally have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. However, a child who routinely lies awake 20 or more minutes each night, or who wakes up many times in the night, may have a sleep disorderInfants who have passed the age of night feeding (6+ months) and still cannot sleep 11 hours at night may be showing early signs of a sleep disorder.
Toddlers 1-2 years of age need 11-14 hours of sleep each 24 hours. This is an age known for nighttime awakenings, sleep resistance, and nightmares. If your child is sleepy or misbehaves during the day, they may have a sleep disorder.
Children aged 3-5 should sleep 11-13 hours in a 24 hour period, with naps completely tapered off by age 5. Difficulty falling and staying asleep is common at this age, and this is a peak moment for night terrors, sleepwalking, and nightmares.
Children aged 6-13 need 9-11 hours of sleep. Screen time and school stress can cause sleep disorders, leading to moodiness, attention disorders, school issues, and misbehavior. If your child shows signs of mood disorders or ADHD like symptoms, be sure to check for a sleep disorder.

, Sleep disorders that manifest in sleepiness for adults often manifest as hyperactivity and inattentiveness in children. While ADHD can cause disordered sleep, a sleep disorder may be misdiagnosed as ADHD.If your child is disciplined in school for ""not paying attention,"" gets bad grades on class participation, and reports trouble concentrating, they may be suffering from a sleep disorder.

, Sleep disorders such as restless leg syndrome are strongly associated with depression and anxiety disorders.If your child is moody, and shows other symptoms of sleep deprivation, such as inattention, daytime sleepiness, or hyperactivity, consider that the root cause may be disordered sleep.

, All children have occasional nightmares and night terrors. However, if they occur regularly or disrupt your and your child's sleep, they may be considered a sleep disorder. They may also be a sign of injury, illness, or another serious sleep disorder such as sleepwalking or pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.


Take your child to the doctor if your child has frequent nightmares or night terrors that persist over time, if your child is afraid of sleeping, or if your child shows moodiness, exhaustion, and other signs of sleep deprivation.
Night terrors are distinct from nightmares in that children who suffer them tend not to remember them at all during the day.
Night terrors may lead to dangerous behavior or injury in children, who may leave bed and run around the house., Loud snoring in small children is a common sign of a serious condition called pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, a serious breathing disorder that can affect every facet of your child's wellbeing. Enlarged tonsils and adenoids are the most common sign of this condition.Shine a flashlight down your child's throat and ask them to say ""ah.""
Occasional snoring is not necessarily a sign of a sleep disorder. Loud snoring that takes place several nights a week, however, should not be ignored., Bedwetting is not considered unusual in the first years of a child's life. If bedwetting persists beyond age 6 or 7, consult a doctor. If your child wets the bed after sleeping ""dry"" for months or years, there may be something wrong. Stress can cause a child to regress, as can constipation or urinary tract obstruction., Disorders such as narcolepsy and pediatric obstructive sleep apnea may manifest as childhood obesity. Parents aren't always able to recognize the obesity of their own children, so be sure to weigh and measure your child regularly and ask your doctor about your child's Body Mass Index (BMI).Calculate your child's BMI with a BMI calculator: https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/calculator.aspx

If your child is obese and shows other signs of sleep deprivation, consider having them checked for a sleep disorder.

, Almost ¾ of children who report headaches are suffering from a sleep disorder.If your child suffers headaches, discuss possible vision and sleep issues with the pediatrician.

Consider the symptoms of abnormal sleep behavior.,
Learn about circadian rhythm sleep disorders.,
Practice good sleep hygiene.,
Look into comorbid conditions.",How to Recognize Signs of a Sleep Disorder3," You may have none of the common sleep disorders doctors test for, but still exhibit obviously strange behaviors in your sleep. If you thrash, have nightmares, talk to yourself in your sleep, or physically act out your dreams, you may have an abnormal sleep behavior disorder. Like narcolepsy, these indicate a poor boundary between the stages of sleeping and waking, and happen to adults and children alike.


Sleep terrors resemble nightmares, but are distinguished by arousal, physical movement (thrashing, screaming), large pupils, sweating, and increase blood pressure. They tend to take place early in the sleep cycle. Unlike nightmares, they take place during non-REM sleep. Children rarely remember the dream, while adults may recall fragments.REM Behavior Disorder causes you to act out your dream. If you sleep walk, sleep talk, jerk your arms and legs, or attempt to fight your sleep partner while dreaming, you may have RBD.

, If you cannot sleep during socially conventional hours, either for work-related, vision-related, or unknown reasons, you may have a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. Talk to your doctor if you think you may fall under one of the following categories.Delayed phase sleep disorder is common in teenagers in young adults. It is diagnosed when you are unable to fall asleep before 1am or so in the morning, and wake in the late morning or the afternoon.
Non-24 hour sleep wake disorder, or irregular sleep-wake rhythm, occurs when you can only sleep in naps throughout the day.
Shift work disorder occurs in people whose work hours are scheduled during ordinary sleep periods, such as nurses. It can also occur in people with sleep apnea or other disorders.

, Sleep hygiene refers to your bedtime habits and rituals which can set you up for a good night's sleep. This includes making sure your bedroom is a good environment for sleep, avoiding stimulation before bed, getting on a regular sleep schedule, and getting enough sleep every night.Go to sleep at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning (even on weekends). If you need more sleep, try going to bed earlier.
Adults need seven to nine hours of sleep a night, with as few interruptions as possible.Teenagers need nine to 11 hours.Eat two to three hours before bedtime, and don't consume caffeine in the six or more hours before you fall asleep (remember that chocolate contains caffeine). Avoid alcohol and smoking as well.
Avoid napping during the day.
Avoid vigorous exercise too close to bed — try to do it in the morning or early afternoon. A relaxing exercise, like yoga or gentle stretching, can be done before you go to bed.Do not go to bed emotionally upset. Try to resolve all conflicts before bedtime.Keep a journal on your nightstand to write down any troubling thoughts so you can tackle them in the morning.
Use your bed only for sleep or sexual activity. Do not work or do homework in bed, watch TV, or even read in bed if you can avoid it.This way you train your body to know that when you hit the pillow, it's time for sleep.
Make sure your room is dark, with no ambient light, and a cool temperature.
Do not look at screens before bed — this includes your smartphone, laptop, TV, or tablet. The blue light emitted from these devices make it difficult to fall asleep. One to two hours before bed, reduce your exposure to light and your devices.If you practice good sleep hygiene and are still experiencing symptoms of sleep deprivation, visit a sleep clinic or your family doctor.

, Many illnesses, allergies, medications, cognitive differences, and experiences can cause sleep disorders. Sometimes the cause and effect of illness/sleep disorder is unclear. If you have ADHD, Alzheimer's, dementia, or depression, you may experience sleep disorders.


Asthma, COPD, and difficulty breathing can also contribute to your risk, as can epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, pain from injury, and fibromyalgia.
Experiences of trauma can lead to disordered sleep. If you are suffering from PTSD, talk to your doctor about best sleep practices.

Rearrange the furniture in your room.,
Install acoustic tiles.,
Soundproof your windows.,
Insulate the floor.,
Move the location of your bedroom.",How to Block out Noise at Night1," Sometimes moving the furniture around in your current room can significantly reduce noise pollution at night. You want to make sure that there are large, thick objects blocking or separating you from whatever is causing the most noise. For example:Put a thick bookshelf against a wall you share with a noisy neighbor to help muffle the noise. The more books you place on these shelves the more noise it will muffle!
If your bedroom shares a wall with a noisy neighbor’s living room, move your bed to the side of the room that is farthest from the source of the noise.
Move your bed to be far away from any windows to help reduce the amount of noise you hear from the street.;
, Acoustic tiles are most often used in recording studios and theaters to absorb and diffuse sounds; however, you can use this technology to help block out sounds at night as well. Available online or from many hardware stores, acoustic tiles come in a variety of shapes and colors and when installed can often look like wall art.


You can apply acoustic tiles permanently if you are a homeowner or temporarily if you are a renter. Put these on the walls where the source of the noise is coming from, and the tiles will absorb and diffuse the noise to block out sounds at night.If you can’t find acoustic tiles or don’t like their appearance, try hanging a thick tapestry or rug on the wall for a similar effect.
You can also hang acoustic tiles or thick tapestries from the ceiling to block out noises from above.

, If the loud noises are coming from the outside, the best way to block out noises at night is to make sure your windows are insulated. If you choose to install new double-paned windows to your home, then this can be an expensive solution. But there are other more cost-effective ways to get similar results:Seal any gaps or cracks in the windows with an insulating foam from your local hardware store. This foam won’t harm the existing frames or windowsill, but it will stop noise from entering your bedroom through these cracks.
Hang thick curtains or soundproof curtains on all of the windows in your bedroom. The thick fabric of these curtains will create a buffer to effectively reduce the amount of outside noise that gets into your bedroom at night.

, If the offending noises are coming from below you, a great option for blocking this out is to insulate the floor, making the layer between your floor and their noise thicker. If you rent the apartment or home, this can be done by laying down thick carpets or rugs, or even installing new, thick carpet if your landlord agrees.If you own the space but don’t like the look of carpet, you can also install insulate below the baseboards of your hardwood floors.Cork is the best kind of insulating floor material, but there are other options for insulating the baseboards as well, including fiberglass inserts and acoustically rated floor tiles.
To really block out sounds from below, double up on floor insulation by insulating your hardwood floors and putting down thick area rugs.

, Sometimes the noises at night are amplified simply because of where your bedroom is located within the house or apartment. If your bedroom is a room that is on the main road of the street or next to a room where there is a screaming infant, then switching rooms can help block out a lot of noise at night.


Changing rooms is not always an option if you don’t have another room to switch to, but if it is a possibility, try staying a few nights in a possible new room to see if the noise levels are reduced enough for you to get some sleep."

Take note of your worries.",How to Avoid Sleepiness at Work1," Caffeine is great to wake you up in the morning. However, it can also keep you up at night. Stop drinking caffeine within 4 to 6 hours of going to bed to reduce the chance of it keeping you awake at night., Nicotine keeps you awake, so quitting smoking is a must if you want better sleep. Also, your cravings may be keeping you awake or making you more restless at night., Certain medications can keep you awake, such as antidepressants and asthma medications. Ask your doctor if your pills could be keeping you up, and he or she may be able to help rearrange your medications for more restful sleep., Studies show that exercisers tend to sleep better. However, the actual act of exercising wakes you up because it releases cortisol into your body, so you should exercise earlier in the day to sleep better., To help you sleep, don't try to eat a huge amount just before sleeping, as problems such as indigestion can keep you up. Try to eat larger meals at least a couple of hours before going to sleep., Your body likes routine. If you go to bed every night at the same time and wake up at the same time everyday, your body knows when it needs to get sleepy and when it needs to be awake. Stick to your schedule even on weekends, and you'll have more restful nights.One way to keep yourself on schedule is to set an alarm or reminder to tell you to go to bed. That way, you won't stay up past your bedtime without noticing.If you're having trouble getting enough sleep, try going to bed a little earlier every night until you're getting the recommended 7 to 8 hours of sleep., When you go to sleep, you need to keep out all light from your bedroom, including any sunlight or streetlights. Try light-blocking curtains to block out outside light, and cover your bedside clock to block out its light., Turn off radios and televisions, but also remove items that cause minor noises, such as your laptop computer if it tends to make any kind of noise. If you can't keep out the noise, put in earplugs to drown it out., While your kitty might like to curl up at the foot of your bed, a pet's nighttime movements can wake you up. If you find yourself waking up often because of your pets, you may need to shut them out of your bedroom., That is, power down your screens about an hour before you go to sleep. The lights of electronic devices keep your brain alert, rather than letting it shut down for the night., If you lay awake thinking about who you need to call or what you need to do tomorrow, trying writing a few notes about it before bed, including a plan of action. That way, you can let your mind relax and go to sleep."

Create a good sleep environment.",How to Cope with a Bad Night of Sleep," It's normal to feel sluggish after a bad night of sleep, but you can wake yourself up faster if you do a physical activity when you wake up. Try to do around 10 minutes of a moderately physical activity to get your body active and awake. For example, you might try:A brisk walk
Going for a light run
Biking to work;
, It's a good idea to alternate physical and mental activities. This will wake you up faster. If you're short on time in the morning, you might be able to read an article while you eat breakfast. Or you could do a crossword while you're taking the bus to work.Try to avoid activities that keep your mind inactive, like watching videos or simply listening to music.

, Trick your body into feeling more awake by turning on lights or getting into sunlight. The light will signal to your body that it's time to start your day. Sunshine is the best for waking you up since you'll also soak up vitamin D and maintain your body's natural sleep cycle.Avoid hitting the snooze button and hiding under your pillow. This will only make you feel more groggy.

, Instead of loading up on fatty fried foods, you should choose foods with nutrients to get your day started. Eat a mixture of complex carbs and protein so your blood sugar stays steady and you have enough energy to begin the day.For example, you might eat oatmeal and an apple. Or you could have granola and a hard-boiled egg.
Avoid drinking caffeine first thing in the morning. Save it for your afternoon energy slump.

, For many, the hardest part of coping with a bad night of sleep is getting through the morning. Remind yourself that you just need to start your day. All you need to do is get through the day so you can get a restful night's sleep at the end of your day.


For example, when you feel tired, remember what you have to look forward in the evening. You might be looking forward to getting caught up on sleep, taking a relaxing bubble bath, or just watching your favorite show.

, Depending on your obligations, you may be able to reschedule your day around your bad night of sleep. If you can, move your hardest and mentally demanding tasks for early in the morning. You'll have a little burst of energy in the morning, but it will probably slump in the afternoon so avoid important tasks or meetings later in the day.For example, reschedule your big meeting or obligations for first thing. Save the mindless tasks for the end of your work day.

, If you find that caffeine gives you a little energy boost or keeps you more alert, plan on drinking some coffee or tea when you begin to feel an energy slump. Keep in mind that it will take some time to feel the effects, so try to drink some as soon as you begin to feel tired.Remember that caffeine may keep you awake and disrupt your next night of sleep. Stop drinking caffeine about seven hours before you plan on going to bed.

, Continue to eat healthy foods throughout the day so your blood sugar stays constant. You may still feel your energy drop in the afternoon. Instead of reaching for a sugary snack to go with your cup of coffee, have a healthy snack that will tide you over until dinner.For example, you might have hummus and pita chips or carrots. You could also have a piece of whole-grain toast and fruit.

, If simple tasks start to become difficult and you're having trouble focusing, take a catnap. Sleeping for just 10 to 20 minutes can make you feel more alert and give you a boost of energy to get through the rest of the day. Just make sure you don't sleep too long or you'll feel groggy.If you can, take a quick nap in your office or in your car on a break. If you don't have a private place to go to, even putting your head down on your desk can make you feel more rested.

, Getting more physical activity is a great way to stay alert through the day. A change of scenery and moving around a little can keep you from losing your focus. Even getting outside and being active for only a few minutes can restore your energy.For example, go for a walk around the block, take the stairs, take the trash out, or do some light housecleaning to get your blood flowing.

, See if you can make it to your normal bedtime before crashing. This way, you should fall asleep easily and stay asleep as your body recovers. It's fine if you need to go to bed a little early, just avoid going to bed as soon as you come home from work.


If you sleep early in the evening, you may throw off your sleep cycle, making it difficult to fall asleep at your normal bedtime.

, The good news is that you can recover from one bad night of sleep. If, however, you make a habit of not getting enough sleep, you will begin to accumulate a sleep debt that may be difficult, maybe even impossible, to make up. To prevent the long-term health effects of consistent lack of sleep, focus on restructuring your life and sleep schedule to ensure you get enough sleep moving forward (six hours a night at minimum, but ideally seven to nine).Avoid sleeping all the next day to catch up on lost sleep. Sleeping a little extra every night is the best way to catch up on sleep.
One study suggests a well-timed 20-minute nap may equate to one hour of extra sleep, helping make up short-term sleep debt., Create a simple sleep routine and stick to it. Go to bed at the same time every night and wake up around the same time in the morning, if you can. Calm your mind and relax before you go to sleep. Ease into your sleep routine.If you have trouble relaxing or calming yourself before bed, try dimming the lights or playing soothing music. Avoid staring at screens or using bright lights in the half an hour before you go to bed.

, Make your bedroom a comfortable and enjoyable place to sleep. You should only use your bed for sleep and sex. This will train your body to expect to sleep when you're in bed. Keep the bedroom a comfortable temperature so you're not restless as you try to fall asleep.If you still can't sleep, avoid just laying in bed. Get up and leave your bedroom. Do something non-stimulating (like reading — but avoid exciting thrillers or suspense novels) until you start to feel drowsy. Then you can return to bed and try to sleep."

Wear earplugs.,
Cover up the noise with white noise.,
Play something distracting.,
Invest in high-tech noise suppression products.,
Try mindfulness-based noise reduction techniques.",How to Block out Noise at Night2," Earplugs are an effective way to help block outside noises while you sleep because they muffle and reduce distracting outside noises. earplugs may be a bit uncomfortable at first until you get used to wearing them. There are many different kinds of earplugs, but simple earplugs are available at most local pharmacies.


Look for earplugs that that are rated NRR 33, which means that they reduce the noise in a room by 33 decibels, since this reduction should provide enough relief for most sounds.Be sure to wash your hands before inserting your earplugs, and replace the earplugs regularly or clean them according to product instructions.
Earplugs are most effective when worn properly. For best results, roll the earplug into a thin cylinder, push it into your ear, and hold it there until it expands to fill your ear canal.
While earplugs are a safe solution for blocking out noise, they do come with some risks Don’t ever force the earplug deep within your ear. You want to be able to remove the earplug easily by pulling outward and twisting. Putting them too deep in the ear canal can cause pressure that can rupture your eardrum.One other concern with ear plugs is that blocking noise means you may not hear a smoke detector alarm, a break-in, or your alarm clock.

, It may seem odd to cover up distracting noises with more noise, but white noise makes it less likely that you will notice outside noises.This is why you don’t hear the faucet dripping in your house during the daytime, but at night it’s the only thing you hear. White noise is any type of constant noise that does not have a recognizable variance or tempo so that you don’t really notice that you are hearing anything at all. You can buy white noise machines, phone apps, or use objects around your home. Some popular white noise sounds include:A fan
Falling rain
Ocean waves crashing

, If white noise doesn’t work for you, there are other types of noise you can use to help block out noise at night. White noise is one aspect of the “colors” of noise, which include other color groups of sounds. Blue noise is a more whimsical version of white noise, including sounds like birds chirping or children laughing. Pink noise includes warm, echoing tones like the sound a conch shell makes when you blow into it. Many people also find ambient music or the murmuring sounds of people talking around them comforting, so you can also try leaving your television or radio on quietly as you try to fall asleep to see if that helps.Since leaving the TV or radio on all night can disrupt natural sleep patterns, it is recommended that you turn on a timer to automatically shut the device off after a certain amount of time.
If you can, turn the brightness down on your TV so that the light from the TV doesn’t disrupt your sleep.
When choosing ambient music, first try listening to it during the day to see if it relaxes you before trying it out as a sleeping aid.

, If the noise at night is so great that simple white noise or earplugs are ineffective, then it might be a good idea to invest in more high-tech products for blocking out noise. There are a wide variety of products available online, so do a bit of research to find out what will work best for your needs. Keep in mind that these high-tech products can also be expensive, but the investment may be worth it to you for a good night’s sleep. Some of the most common noise suppression products include:High-tech earplugs that contain a tiny acoustic chip that allows quiet noises to pass through but blocks loud noises outside of a set decibel level. This is great for people who still want to be able to hear if their child is calling for them or their partner is speaking to them but want to block out the sounds of honking cars or construction work.
Noise-cancelling headphones that use microphones to detect patterns of ambient sound and create an “anti-noise” signal to cancel out those sounds. This works great for constant, low-frequency noises like that on an airplane, but is not necessarily the best choice for noises that cause sudden decibel spikes.
Earpieces that work much like an earplug by blocking outside noise, but that also include a small speaker inside to channel white noise or ambient music directly into your ears. This product is great for people who want to totally block out outside noise, but who also find white noise soothing.

, For some people, blocking out distracting noise at night is as simple as dealing with the experience instead of reacting to it with frustration and desperation. Similar to relaxation techniques used throughout the day, being mindful of the noise and your reaction to it, and then altering this reaction can often help people get a good night’s sleep. The goal of this is to reduce how much you allow yourself to be upset by noise at night, which can be done several ways:Concentrate on your breathing and take slow, deep breaths in your nose and out your mouth. Focus on the way your diaphragm and lungs fill with air and listen only to the sounds of your own breathing.
Try focusing on fully relaxing each part of your body, one body part at a time. Start at your feet, working your way up the legs, torso, outward to the arms and fingers, and then the neck and face.
Try adopting a new attitude towards the noise. Forgive whoever or whatever is making the noise, and remind yourself that you will become accustomed to it with time.

Change your position.,
Don't stay on one task too long.",How to Avoid Sleepiness at Work2," Dehydration can make you feel tired, so be sure to drink water frequently, especially when your body is telling you it's thirsty.To help you get enough water, remember that coffee, tea, and even fruit juice count as part of your total.To spice up your water, try drinking sparkling water with a slice of orange or lemon in it.

, While it may be tempting to reach for a candy bar after lunch, the sugar in it may be your downfall for the afternoon slump. Instead, try complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, paired with a lean protein such as fish or chicken.Protein is also connected to regulating your body's alertness, so a meal high in protein can help you feel more energized and alert. Protein raises tyrosine levels in your body rather than tryptophan levels, and tyrosine gives you more energy. Eating too many carbohydrates at once does the opposite.

, Try bringing your shoulders up, so your whole body is straighter. Leaning over can make you sleepier.Another option is a position that requires you to balance yourself. For instance, some people use yoga ball chairs to improve their balance, but they can also help keep you awake., Staying on one task only for hours at a time can lead you to brain burn out and sleepiness. Instead, switch tasks if you notice your brain is wearing out. It will help keep you more alert."

Get out of your chair.,
Try an energy-boosting supplement.,
Try a short cat nap.",How to Avoid Sleepiness at Work3," Caffeine does work to keep you awake by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter designed to tell your cells to wind down.However, because caffeine doesn't work as well the more you use it, try to only drink it every once in a while, rather than every day.Start with something lighter on the caffeine, such as green tea. If you need something stronger, black tea and coffee both have more caffeine., You are limited in your office as to how much stretching you can do, but you can perform a few simple stretches.For instance, pull your hands together behind your back, stretching out the front of your body. Breathe deeply for a few seconds, then let go of your hands. Do it a couple of times in a row.Try stretching out your hips. Turn in your chair until you are facing to the left. Lift your right leg out behind you, stretching it straight. Try to keep the top half of your body sitting up straight. Repeat the stretch a couple of times, and then turn to do it with the other leg., That is, try a wax-melting system in your office or use essential oils. Scents such as peppermint, eucalyptus, and lemon can help keep you alert., Some offices will let you work at a standing desk, which increases movement and alertness. If that doesn't sound like something you'd want, try moving around when you take breaks. Get up and take a short walk to increase your alertness.,You'll do even better if you can step outside for a few minutes in the sun, as it sends signals to your body to wake up., Most supplements rely on calories, stimulants, or nutrients that affect how your body metabolizes energy. You're getting energy from your power lunch, and caffeine is a stimulant. However, if you still need a boost, you might try a supplement that focuses on boosting your metabolizing, with ingredients such as creatine, CoQ10, B vitamins, and taurine., If you have the space and the time, try taking a short 10 to 20 minute nap over your lunch break. These types of naps can help refresh your brain without causing drowsiness. In fact, it's natural to feel some afternoon drowsiness. At about 7 hours after you wake up in the morning, your body calls for a break, and a short nap can help fulfill that need."

Stay away from Red meat.,
Steer clear of spicy or fatty foods at night.,
Nix the beans or bean-based foods.,
Save your veggies for the daytime.,
Keep your chocolate cravings in check.,
Limit your nighttime sugar intake.",How to Avoid Foods That Disrupt Your Sleep1," Red meats, like steak or a burger, can be difficult for your body to digest, making it more difficult to fall asleep. Once you do fall asleep, your body will be working hard to break down that heavy meal, so you’re more likely to wake up during the night.Red meat is also contains saturated fat. Studies show that eating too much saturated fat can lower the quality of your sleep, making you feel tired and irritable.;
, Fatty and spicy foods are both more difficult to digest, which will delay sleep. Spicy foods also cause heartburn and acid reflux, which will keep you from falling asleep and lower the quality of your sleep.The change in position — from sitting or standing to lying down — soon after eating something spicy can lead to heartburn or acid reflux.
Keep in mind that citrus fruits and juices can also cause sleep-disruptive heartburn.

, Beans are tough to digest and can cause gas and bloating. In addition, many bean-based foods, like chili, are often spicy, leading to disruptive heartburn and acid reflux.Chili typically has a red meat component, making it doubly disruptive for your sleep cycle., Veggies are great for your overall health, but eating them right before bed can interrupt a good night’s sleep. Celery, cucumbers, and radishes have high water contents, which will have you getting up for bathroom breaks in the middle of the night.Tomatoes contain the amino acid tyramine, which triggers the brain to release norepinephrine, a stimulant that delays sleep.Broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are high fiber foods that will keep your digestive system hard at work, preventing restorative sleep., All chocolate contains caffeine, which will keep you from drifting off to sleep if eaten too close to bedtime. The darker the chocolate, the more caffeine it contains. A single piece of dark chocolate can contain about a quarter as much caffeine as a cup of coffee!, Chocolate-free sugary snacks are just as disruptive, so stay away from the gumdrops, cookies, and other goodies. Soft drinks, even if they're caffeine-free, can contain lots of sugar, so you should avoid those before bed, too. The spikes in your blood sugar will delay sleep and make it difficult to stay asleep.If you have a hot tea before bed, try not to add sugar.

Understand how different your schedule will be.",How to Become a Dymaxion Sleeper," You will take four naps a day. That means you will need to nap for 30 minutes every 6 hours. You can set those naps whenever is most convenient for you, but you must stick to your schedule once you set it.For instance, you could nap at 2 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM. Alternatively, you could nap at 5 AM, 11 AM, 5 PM, and 11 PM.;
, You will only sleep during your nap times. That means that you won't be sleeping at night, except during your prescribed schedule. In other words, you'll only be sleeping 2 hours a day., Falling asleep at first can be difficult, if you're not accustomed to falling asleep during the day. Make sure you are getting comfortable for your naps and not trying to sleep at your desk.Also, make sure you are tired by getting some exerciseand skipping caffeine.You can also try the age-old trick of counting sheep. Meditation, such as focusing on your breathing, can help clear your mind for sleep.
Also, trust the process. Once you start to adapt, you will have no trouble falling asleep for your naps.

, It's best to set an alarm for 5 to 10 minutes before you must sleep, though you will start feeling tired. You don't want to miss your sleep time. Once you are ready to nap, set an alarm for 30 minutes from your current time. Make sure to use a loud alarm or one you can't turn off easily.


If you're afraid of not being able to wake up, have someone nearby who will commit to waking you up.

, Your body needs time to adjust to this new schedule. Basically, you're training your body to drop into REM sleep as soon as you start napping, rather then going through the other stages of sleep. It takes some time for your body to adjust to this idea., You will feel very tired in the first week or two, so you shouldn't try anything too dangerous while adjusting. That can include driving a car. In addition, you may experience lucid dreaming, where your dreams are especially vivid. Many people count this side effect as a positive., While some people do succeed at this type of sleep schedule, other people find it is not for them. In addition, the long-term effects of such a sleep schedule are not known, so it could also be detrimental to your health in the long term., Once you get your rhythm, you should be able to maintain your nap schedule indefinitely. However, if you do find it too difficult, you could try less-rigorous versions, such as the Everyman (3 hours of sleep plus 3 20-minute naps spaced throughout the day) or the Uberman (6 20 to 30 minute naps spaced throughout the day)., You cannot survive on this type of schedule without a good alarm clock. Basically, when you take short naps on schedule, your body will not want to wake up sometimes. Therefore, your alarm clock needs to be loud or one you can't turn off easily., If you're going to do this schedule, your family must be on board. If you have family obligations at certain hours that will interfere with your naps, you may have a problem following this schedule., To be on the Dymaxion schedule, you must take naps on time. If you skip naps, you are going to feel awful. Therefore, your schedule must be flexible enough that you can take naps when you need to do so., Most everyone else will still be on a 6 to 8 hours a night schedule. That means you will have many hours when your family will be asleep that you must fill. While you can be more productive, you may find you have too many hours in the day."

Identify the long-term consequences of sleep deprivation.",How to Adopt a Polyphasic Sleep Schedule," As you prepare to begin polyphasic sleeping, you will want to choose a method based on your goals, the flexibility of your schedule, and your body’s overall need for sleep. There are four primary documented methods for polyphasic sleeping.The four patterns include biphasic sleep, the Everyman pattern, the Dymaxion method, and the Uberman method.
Two of the four include a schedule with the largest sleep segment occurring at night: biphasic sleep and the Everyman pattern.
Starting with a pattern that includes core nighttime sleep may be the safest way to start. Adjust to sleep reduction gradually to minimize the problems associated with sleep deprivation.;
, Biphasic sleep is basically dividing your sleep into two scheduled segments. Usually the longer segment is at night, and a scheduled nap of either 20 to 30 minutes, or 90 minutes, happens during the early afternoon. Many cultures use this pattern of sleep routinely, and this form of biphasic sleeping may actually be a healthy option.The shorter nap time serves as a refreshing sleep and helps to get past the natural early afternoon slump. The longer nap time allows the person to complete a full sleep cycle, including REM sleep.
The circadian rhythm pattern and hormonal releases of chemicals that help regulate sleep also support a biphasic sleep pattern with the largest chunk of sleep occurring during the dark night hours.
Biphasic sleep has been documented in history as first and second sleep. Prior to the days of electricity, people would sleep for a few hours immediately after nightfall, then get up for several hours and become active. They would then go back to sleep for their second sleep, and awake around dawn with first light.
A biphasic sleep schedule may not be considered polyphasic for those that have goals of a significant reduction in the time they spend sleeping every 24 hours since this pattern of sleeping does not significantly reduce the total number of hours slept in a 24 hour period.

, Depending on your sleep goals, the flexibility of your schedule, and your body’s need for sleep, you may benefit from creating a biphasic patterns that works best for you.Target two segments of time during each 24 hour cycle that you want to sleep. Allow for enough REM sleep time during each sleep segment. Most people require five to six periods of REM sleep every 24 hours.
One normal sleep cycle, including REM sleep, takes about 90 minutes. Devise a schedule that incorporates the 90 minute cycles, and divide that into your two target sleep times.
For example, you may want to have a core nighttime sleep schedule from 1am until 4:30am, then a 90 minute to three hour nap from 12 noon until 1:30pm or 3pm. Adjust your times according to the flexibility of your schedule.
As you get used to your new schedule, gradually decrease the time you spend sleeping as long as you are not having problems.
Always allow at least three hours between your sleep times.
Do not oversleep and do not go to sleep early. Stick with your schedule for at least a week before you make changes.

, The Everyman method consists of a nighttime core sleep period of about three hours plus three scheduled 20 minute naps. This is a good place to start with polyphasic sleeping since it still provides for the largest segment of sleep to occur at night, which is what most people are accustomed to.Set your target schedule. Determine the best time to have your core sleep of three hours based on your schedule. Typical choices would be either 1am to 4am, or 11pm to 2am.Depending on the timing of your core sleep segment, schedule your twenty minute naps accordingly.
Allow for at least three hours between your nap times.
For example, a schedule for the 1am to 4am core sleep would be to nap for 20 minutes at 9am, 2pm, 9pm, followed by the core sleep at 1am.
For a core sleep of 11pm to 2am, you would nap at 7am, 12pm, and 6pm.

, Maintain the initial schedule for about a week, but extend that time if you are having trouble adjusting. Next you can begin to break up your total five hours of sleep into three distinct segments.Maintain your core sleep segment at four hours, then reduce your naps to just two at 30 minutes each. If you work a regular 9am to 5pm job, schedule your naps at lunch and immediately after work, if that is possible.
Stay with the adjustment for a week. Again, extend the time if needed so your body can adjust to the recent changes.
At the beginning of your third week, or possibly a week or so later, add another nap while reducing both the amount of time per nap and the amount of core sleep.
The final adjustment brings you to a core sleep time of 3.5 hours and three naps at 20 minutes each spread out throughout the day.
Adjust your target sleep schedule bedtime and your nap times to fit your schedule.

, Strictly follow your schedule, try not to oversleep, and get up on time. Try hard to resist sleeping just a few more minutes during your core time and your naps.Don’t get too stressed if you are having trouble. Becoming stressed will only make it harder to fall asleep quickly when you absolutely need to take advantage of every minute of scheduled sleep time.
When you are on the Everyman schedule, stick to your core bedtime schedule and your nap times. Plan ahead.
Have a plan for your newly found free time. It is unlikely that other people around you will be operating on the same schedule. Be organized and have a good “to do” list prepared. Focus on including those things you want to do but have not had the time. This will help to reinforce the value of your new sleep schedule and help you to stick with it.

, The most popular schedules include the core sleeping segment with three schedule naps. It is possible to tweak this schedule to meet your personal scheduling needs and adjust the amount of total sleep if needed.Other schedules that still fall within the Everyman method are available.
One schedule includes decreasing the core night sleep segment to 1.5 hours with four to five 20 minute naps scheduled at equal intervals through the rest of the 24 hour period.

, Both methods eliminate the core nighttime sleep segment. If you have adapted to the Everyman schedule and want to try an even more extreme sleep method that completely eliminates core sleep, consider the Uberman or the Dymaxion schedules. These both involve just two hours of sleep spread through the day.Both schedules have very limited flexibility with the need to adhere as strictly as possible to the schedule you develop.
Carefully consider your work, school, and family schedule before you begin either sleep pattern.
Both Uberman and Dymaxion include a total of two hours of sleep every 24 hour period.

, The Uberman polyphasic sleep schedule involves six 20 minute naps placed at equal intervals, or every six hours. The schedule requires the ability to firmly commit to the structured sleep schedule.For example, sleep for twenty minutes at 1am, 5am, 9am, 1pm, 5pm and then 9pm.
If you are trying to stick to this schedule it is essential that you get all of your naps.
The Uberman requires a 20 minute nap every four hours.
If you find yourself becoming very fatigued, struggling to maintain concentration or focus on tasks, you should immediately re-think your sleeping schedule.

, The Dymaxion schedule has the same amount of total sleep as the Uberman, but may be equally difficult to commit to. The Dymaxion schedule requires fewer but slightly longer naps.The Dymaxion strictly requires a 30 minute nap every six hours.
The total 24 hour sleep time with the Dymaxion schedule is two hours.
One possible Dymaxion schedule would be 30 minute naps scheduled at 6am, 12pm, 6pm and 12am.
The Dymaxion pattern is reported to be the result of the sleeping patterns of Buckminster Fuller, a renowned 20th century architect, author, and inventor. It is also said he gave up this sleeping pattern to spend more time with his family., The main principle of polyphasic sleeping is to break up your sleeping into short intervals during the day. When added together these naps will still equal much less than you would get from a normal sleeping pattern. To sustain this type of sleeping pattern, you need to get the most possible benefit from every scheduled sleep segment and nap.Train yourself to nap by getting up earlier than normal, and allowing yourself to give in to that sleepy feeling that usually occurs around midday.
Avoid computer screens and bright lights for at least 15 minutes before you plan to nap.
Nap at the same time everyday so your body can get adjusted to the new routine.
When you lie down to nap, focus on lowering your heart rate. Count it for 60 beats, then listen to it for another 60 beats. Once your heart rate slows, work on clearing your mind.
Set an alarm and don’t snooze. Get up as soon as the alarm goes off.

, It is not easy to jump straight into polyphasic sleeping. Ease yourself into this method of sleeping by gradually reducing the hours you sleep every night.Begin by cutting three hours per night from your regular sleep schedule. Instead of sleeping for eight hours per night, sleep for five hours instead.
Stick with your reduced nightly hours of sleep for three days.

, You may feel quite sleep-deprived during this initial adjustment phase, but adopting a rigid approach to sleeping and waking up on time will speed your adjustment.Place your alarm clock away from your bed so that you actually have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Turn on the light on as soon as you wake up.
If you have access to a lamp or alarm clock that mimics natural light, use that as a light source to help you wake up after each sleep segment.

, As you work towards identifying the best method for you, think about your work, school, family, church, and athletic activity schedule to be sure you select the best pattern for you. Remember, you have to strictly adhere to the schedule you select to make this work.Also consider the fact that the rest of your world is not likely to be on your new sleeping schedule. Be sure you have the means and the desire to work around the schedules of your close friends and family.
Don’t forget about sports and unplanned events that may not be on your schedule. Be sure you are ready to pass up some opportunities.

, You may choose to follow an existing sleeping pattern or to tweak one to suit your own needs. Either way, be aware of some key factors that are critical to the success of your new sleeping pattern.Be sure the schedule includes the opportunity for at least 120 minutes of total REM sleep time every 24 hours.
Build in at least 3 hours between sleep segments.
Distribute your sleep segments as evenly as possible over the 24 hour period.
Identify the best times to nap. If you are unsure of this, then work backwards and identify the best times not to nap.
Work in increments of 90 minutes to begin with in scheduling your core sleep segments.

, Getting enough sleep is essential to your general health and well-being. Polyphasic sleep has not been proven to be safe and may do harm, especially if other medical conditions are present or if your daily activities involve driving or operating machinery.If you have existing medical conditions or concerns, or are currently taking prescription medications, be sure to discuss your desire to alter your sleep pattern with your doctor.
Have a solid plan to safely transition your sleep and be prepared to provide information regarding the potential benefit of trying a polyphasic sleep method prior to your conversation with your doctor.
Based on the limited amount of scientific evidence that supports the use of polyphasic sleeping specific to general health measures, be prepared for your doctor to be against it.

, Before you start on your schedule changes to implement polyphasic sleeping, have a clear understanding of the short- and long-term possible complications.Many sleep experts consider polyphasic sleep as a form of sleep deprivation. Have someone that supports you in this effort be available to help you evaluate any possible changes that might be harmful.
One of the first and very serious considerations is to closely monitor your ability to drive and/or operate machinery during the first few days and weeks as you begin to introduce a reduction in your amount of sleep.
Documented concerns with sleep loss include drowsy driving, automobile accidents and injury to self and others, and occupational accidents and injury to self and others.

, Consider the possibility of the short-term effects of sleep deprivation in all aspects of your life before you begin.Sleep loss can rapidly cause problems with anxiety, forgetfulness, impaired memory, impaired cognitive function, distractibility, difficulty focusing and staying on task, and stressed relationships.
Short-term sleep loss may lead to occupational or automobile injury, harming not just yourself, but others, too. Sleep deprivation has been linked to serious accidents, including nuclear reactor meltdowns, grounding of large ships, and aviation accidents.This has led to changes in the trucking and airline industry, which requires airline pilots and truck drivers to have normal sleep patterns.
Other common complaints related to sleep loss include difficulty with making decisions, timeliness, foggy and confused comprehension, clumsiness, feeling grumpy and argumentative, and trouble paying attention to others during conversations.

, The science behind sleep is still not clearly understood, but many long-term risks associated with sleep deprivation have been discovered.Long-term sleep deprivation can lead to high blood pressure, heart attack, heart disease, stroke, obesity, diabetes, epilepsy, and a shortened life expectancy.
Psychiatric problems can develop and include depression and mood disorders.
Other problems include a disruption of the quality of sleep of a spouse or bed partner, and overall poor quality of life.
If you feel fatigued, are moody, irritable, unable to carry out your normal life, or experience any of the symptoms associated with sleep loss or sleep deprivation, reconsider your speed of transition or you overall plan entirely.
Consider even a short reduction in your total sleep regimen as being a success provided you are still getting the sleep your body needs.

Skip the nightcap.",How to Avoid Foods That Disrupt Your Sleep2," When it comes to establishing a normal circadian rhythm, your eating and sleeping cycles go hand in hand. Try to go to bed, wake up, and eat your first meal at the same times each day. Eat the rest of the day's meals every five hours.Keeping your sleep and eating cycles in sync will help regulate your body's production of cortisol, which manages energy production, your immune system, and many other bodily functions.

, A large meal with many different components is bad for both your sleep cycle and metabolism.Try to have dinner earlier in the evening, or at least three hours before going to bed. If you're prone to heartburn or acid reflux, lower your dinner's spice level to ensure more restorative sleep., A big meal can delay or disrupt sleep, but a hungry tummy can be too distracting to get some shuteye. Do your best to get your eating and sleeping cycles in sync so you won’t be hungry right before bedtime. If you do get hungry before going to sleep, choose a light, healthy snack, like a banana or fortified, low-sugar cereal., Stay away from coffee, caffeinated teas, and soft drinks at night. Remember that chocolate contains lots of caffeine, too. If you like to drink tea before bed, make sure it’s a caffeine-free herbal tea.Some medications also contain caffeine, so check your medicines' labels or talk to your doctor or pharmacist., Alcohol might make you feel sleepy, but it actually disrupts sleep. Drinking before bedtime lowers the quality of your sleep and is linked to nightmares and night sweating. Alcohol also encourages urination, so you’ll be more likely to wake up in the middle of the night with a full bladder."

Go for a banana and other light, healthy snacks.,
Choose tart cherries or cherry juice.,
Drink a warm beverage.,
Consider cereal, quinoa, or other complex carbs.,
Try a bowl of plain rice.",How to Avoid Foods That Disrupt Your Sleep3," If you’re hungry before bedtime, a light, nutritious snack will help get rid of that grumbling stomach without any negative effects on your metabolism.Bananas, for example, contain tryptophan and magnesium, which both promote relaxation.Other good snack options include nuts, seeds, and cheese.

, Cherries contain melatonin, which is a natural sleep-inducing hormone. Try having a glass of cherry juice before bedtime. You can juice your own or go for a store-bought option that doesn't contain any added sugar., A glass of warm milk to promote a good night’s sleep isn’t just a myth. Milk contains tryptophan, magnesium, and calcium, which all encourage relaxation. A warm beverage can also offer a soothing effect, but keep in mind you won’t want to drink too many fluids before bed or you might need a late night bathroom break.A hot herbal tea is a good option, especially if you have trouble digesting milk. Just make sure the box is marked caffeine-free. Try herbal teas like chamomile or peppermint to promote a good night's sleep., Fortified cereals like shredded wheat contain complex carbs that your body digests easily and slowly. That way you’ll fill your belly until breakfast without giving yourself an immediate energy surge. Other examples of complex carbs include quinoa, barley, and buckwheat.Make sure any cereal you eat before going to sleep is low in sugar.
You can also try snacking on a few whole wheat crackers.Whole grain pastas are sources of complex carbs, but skip the acidic tomato sauce. If you choose pasta as a nighttime snack, try making it with sleep-promoting herbs like sage and basil., Similar to complex carbs, rice is relatively easy to digest. However, it’s high on the glycemic index, so your body breaks it down slowly. That means you don’t get a spike in your blood sugar, which could interrupt your sleep."

Get out of bed.,
Engage in a relaxing activity that will distract you from your dream.,
Avoid turning on the television.,
Consider taking a warm bath.,
Do a some gentle yoga stretches.,
Practice self-soothing skills.,
Play soft music.,
Play soothing nature sounds.",How to Get Over a Bad Dream1," If you've just been jerked awake from a bad dream, forcing yourself to fall right back to sleep could send you back to the troubling dream, which can in turn lead to more fitful, restless sleep. You may also not be able to fall back asleep for a while if you're upset.


If this is the case, sleep experts recommend that you get up and if possible, leave the room. Doing this reinforces the message that your bed is a place of rest.Even though you may be worried about needing to get a certain amount of sleep, allow yourself to stay awake for a period so that the bad dream can fade away and so that your mind can center on more positive thoughts.;
, Instead of focusing on the clock and calculating how late it is and how much more sleep you need, try to find a way to distract yourself in a relaxing way.


For example, read a chapter or two of a good book before you try to fall back to sleep. Try to select a book which has a topic far removed from the content of your bad dream: if, for example, you were hiking in your dream and fell off a cliff, avoid adventure novels and instead read a few pages of historical fiction or a romance novel.
You should avoid doing anything that is challenging or overly engaging, such as homework, office-work, or housework.

, Sleep experts generally recommend that we reduce our screen time before going to bed. They tell us that the blue-light emitted from electronic devices can interrupt our natural sleep cycles.Beyond this, television is an engaging medium, which means that we may be overly stimulated when watching it, which can in turn make it harder to fall asleep.

, Many people find that taking a warm bath is a helpful part of their regular bedtime routine. If you are struggling to calm down after having a bad dream, a relaxing bath or shower could sooth both your mind and body.

, After having been woken up by a bad dream, your mind is of course troubled, but your body may also be tense and stressed. Recent studies have indicated that yoga practice can lead to improved sleep.Thus, in an effort to help you relax both your mind and your muscles, consider doing a little yoga before going back to bed.


The best poses to try are easy resting and inversion poses, such as Easy Forward Bend (variation of Sukhasan), Standing Forward Bend (Uttanasan), Child's Pose (Balasana), and Legs Up the Wall Pose (Viparita Karani).Be sure to keep your stretches and poses gentle, and avoid working up a sweat or getting your heart rate too high.
It's important that you don't push yourself past your comfort zone or hold a pose that hurts. It's also a smart idea to learn from a qualified professional, who can help you learn the poses properly and learn to adjust them for your body., You may find that you can calm yourself down and distance yourself from a bad dream by practicing meditation, prayer, or by doing breathing exercises., Many people report being able to fall asleep more easily when listening to the radio or to recordings of soothing music. Because this is a less engaging medium, sleep experts generally give the thumbs up to using it to help you drift off to sleep.


In general, your sleep will probably be more restful if you choose instrumental music, and avoid selecting tunes which have multiple movements, some of which may be more tense and dramatic.
You may also want to consider putting your music on a timer, so that it turns off after a set amount of time. Many music apps have this feature.

, If you find that music distracts you when you are trying to sleep, consider searching for tracks which play gentle, relaxing nature sounds.


For example, you can find cd's or apps with recordings of ocean waves, rain falling, or quiet animal-life sounds.

",How to Catch Some Sleep," A light sleeper may like it better by sleeping in bits and pieces. Think of sleep as work, it has to be done, and can be daunting task. The hour break at work can be applied to sleep by going to bed an hour earlier and taking an hour break from the ""work"" of sleeping. In another case, a two-job worker (or student) might take an hour nap between jobs (or classes and studying) and feel more refreshed than if he added that hour to the bulk of his sleep time. Continuous sleep slows the body way down, too much for some people. 4+4=8, 5+3=8, 7+1=8;
, Sleep times varies daily due to work, family, social or other reasons. When it is the weekend sleep as experts would recommend. By practicing time management, you will be more efficient, organized and productive.

, How you lived your day was by choice, accept the consequences of your actions. Be that as it may, continue to lay in bed, with your eyes closed and lights off. Do not force yourself to try to sleep, let sleep happen on its own. Think about a pressing problem if it concerns you so much, but lay still, keep the lights off and keep your eyes closed. Winding down is not a quick process.

, Draw the curtains, cover the eyes, and most importantly keep the eyes closed. A major part of sleep is resting the eye muscles - the eye muscles are not going to relax if the eyes are open. The eyelid muscles keep the eyes open, the eyeball (orbital) moves the eyeball and in the eyeball are muscles that a). focus and b) control the incoming light (the pupils), like the aperture in a camera. All these muscles have to rest.

, After controlling what can be seen, controlling sounds is next in importance. Foam earplugs are designed to dampen and not eliminate sounds. These plugs are used in occupations where hearing is protected from noise but also where hearing is important. i.e. you will still be able to hear with these earplugs on.

, For gas air pollution start indoor planting with plants that require low light and are drought resistant.

, To relax and to wind down, requires stillness. If some ""things to do"" item causes anxiety, get up, make a post-it and forget about it.

Now, find a good spot to fly.,
Just fly.,
Maintain your flight.,
Have fun.",How to Fly in a Lucid Dream," Try repeating affirmations out loud, such as ""This is a dream,"" and ""I am lucid,"" If your mind is hazy and murky it will be harder to control the dream.;
, It should be free of obstacles and dangerous objects. Although you can fly from anywhere, it may be easier to find something to jump off of or to launch yourself.

, Without thinking about it too much, just run and jump into the air with energy. Flying should be like walking. When walking, you don't think about putting one foot in front of the other. You just walk. Flying should be the same, a natural movement that you don't have to consciously consider. Don't consider the physics of it, just run, jump, and fly.

, Many rookies experience the freedom of flying and soar away, only to look down, notice how high up they are, and fall to the ground. The problem is the nature of dreams. Whatever you focus on in a dream is automatically drawn towards you, so don't let yourself focus on the ground or you'll fall. If you notice the height just accept it and move on. Remember that nothing can hurt you in a dream. Feel confident- you can fly if you choose to!

, Many lucid dreamers like to try aerial acrobatics and tricks such as dives, loop the loops, and rolls. Draw on roller coaster and the graceful movement of birds for inspiration. Or try just flying and looking at the scenery. You can also try super-fast flight or using flight to navigate obstacle-filled environments.

See your doctor to determine if you may need medications or other treatment to address underlying conditions before you consider a sleep aid.Common disorders that interfere with sleep include chronic pain, acid reflux, sleep apnea, and leg movement disorders such as restless leg syndrome. Depression, anxiety, and stress may also interfere with your sleep patterns.;
, While science has come a long way, there is still no such thing as risk-free sleep aid. All of these medications have the potential to cause adverse side effects, such as drowsiness, confusion, and dependency. If you are considering taking a prescription sleep aid, be sure to have a conversation with your doctor about the risks and benefits.


The most common effects associated with sleep medication include increasing daytime sleepiness, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, cognitive impairment, impaired motor coordination, and chemical dependence. Less common side effects of sleeping aids include complex sleep disorders, such as sleepwalking, driving, making telephone calls, eating, and having sex while not fully awake.
Sleep aids may also cause a temporary worsening of depression symptoms.Doxepin and Ramelteon are two sleep aids that are not thought to have a risk of dependency., If you are considering taking a prescription sleep aid, ask your doctor if a short-acting drug would be right for you. While side effects still happen with short-acting drugs (which are absorbed by the the body quickly), they are less common than they are with long-acting drugs (which take longer to be absorbed). Short-acting drugs include Ramelteon, Triazolam, Zaleplon, and Zolpidem. Long-acting drugs include Doxepin, Estazolam, Eszopiclone, Temazepam, and Zolpidem extended release.Long-acting drugs may be more appropriate for some people, especially those who have a problem with staying asleep, versus falling asleep.

, While antidepressants are not approved by the FDA as sleep aids, there are some antidepressants that are also sedatives. Low doses of these drugs may be appropriate for treating insomnia in patients who also suffer from depression or anxiety.Amitriptyline, Mirtazapine, Trazodone are all antidepressants with sedating effects.

, If you are given a prescription for a sleep aid, it's important to follow the dosing instructions carefully. Taking too much or too little of the drug may cause unwanted side effects.


Never reduce or increase your dosage without discussing it with your doctor first, even if you feel that the dosing is not right for you.
Stopping your medication suddenly can cause rebound insomnia., Prescription sleep aids can cause anyone to feel groggy and confused the next morning, but these side effects tend to worsen with age. Be especially cautious about taking sleep aids if you are 50 or older.Older people may be more susceptible to side effects because the body breaks down medication more slowly with age.
If you are 50 or older, talk to your doctor about the correct dose for you, as it may be best to take less than the recommended dose to start.

, Because prescription sleeping aids can cause side effects like grogginess, it's a good idea to avoid doing anything that requires a lot of focus until you understand how the drug affects you. Driving and operating machinery are especially dangerous, so avoid these activities for at least one day after you start taking a new sleeping medication., Sedative and hypnotic drugs can sometimes cause people to engage in complex behaviors, such as eating and driving, while asleep. When this happens, people typically have no memory of the events the next morning. This can be very dangerous, so let your doctor know if you have any reason to believe that you have been engaging in any complex sleep behaviors while taking a prescription sleep aid.

, While it is not very common, some people have serious allergic reactions to prescription sleep aids. If you experience anaphylaxis or facial swelling, it's important to get medical help right away, as these reactions can interfere with your ability to breathe.

, Some people self-medicate with alcohol when they have difficulty falling asleep, but this is not a good idea. While alcohol may make you feel tired, it worsens the quality of your sleep, so you are less likely to wake up feeling refreshed the next morning.Never drink alcohol if you are taking any kind of prescription or or over-the-counter sleep aid, as it may cause adverse reactions.

, OTC sleep aids can be very effective if you use them occasionally; however, it is easy to build up a tolerance to the antihistamines that most of these medications contain, which will render the drugs ineffective for you. To avoid building up a tolerance, don't take over-the-counter sleep aids consistently for long periods of time., Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are the active ingredients in most OTC sleep aids. These medications are generally safe for short-term use, but they are not recommended for the following individuals:People with closed-angle glaucoma
People with asthma
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
People with sleep apnea
People with severe liver disease
People with digestive system obstruction
People with urinary retention
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
People over the age of 75

, Melatonin is a sleep-inducing hormone that is naturally produced by the body. Melatonin supplement pills are popular sleep aids, which may be effective for some, but are not right for everyone.


Melatonin supplements tend to be more effective for individuals who suffer from circadian rhythm disorders (including jet lag) than they are for people who have chronic insomnia.
Although it is ""natural,"" melatonin can still cause side effects, including sleep walking, nausea and next-day drowsiness.
Because it is not regulated by the FDA, melatonin pills can vary in potency from one brand to another. Start out with 0.1–0.3 mg for sleep. If you cannot find a preparation with these doses then it is best to buy the 1.0 mg pills and split them in half. Start ""low and slow."" Keep in mind you can also find delayed and immediate release pills, which can help you further fine-tune your dosage.
Take melatonin about an hour before planning to go to bed and adjust this time as necessary.
Certain drugs, such as beta-blockers, can interfere with your production of melatonin. Caffeine and alcohol are known to have an effect on melatonin synthesis and metabolism.

, Valerian is an herbal supplement that is commonly taken as a sleep aid. It may be effective for some people, but just like every other sleep aid, it may cause side effects and it is not the right choice for everyone.Valerian is typically most effective when it is taken regularly for at least two weeks, so it is a better choice for people with chronic insomnia than it is for people who have occasional sleep problems.
Common side effects include dizziness, headaches, and stomach upset.
Valerian is not safe for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, for children under three years old, or for people with liver disease.
Valerian is not regulated by the FDA, so there are no official recommendations regarding correct dosing.

, All over-the-counter sleep aids, including herbal sleep aids, may interact with prescription and other over-the-counter medications. Always talk to your doctor about all of the medications you are taking.Melatonin can interact with birth control pills, immunosuppressants, diabetes medications, and blood thinners.Valerian can interact with St. John's Wort., Most people sleep better when they are not too hot, but not too cold. To help yourself fall asleep faster and sleep better, adjust your thermostat so that the temperature is between 62 and 70°F (16.6 to 21.1°C) while you sleep.Everyone is different, so try experimenting with different temperatures to find out what works best for you.

, The perfect blanket can also dramatically increase the quality of your sleep. There is no one size fits all solution, so you may have to try a few different blankets before you find the perfect one for you.A light to medium-weight blanket is ideal, as heavy blankets can cause you to become too hot at night, which can disrupt your sleep. Heated blankets may also cause you to become too hot.
If you have allergies, make sure to choose a non-allergenic blanket and wash it weekly in hot water to get rid of any allergens.
Weighted blankets are ideal for people who suffer from anxiety, as they provide pressure similar to a hug, making you feel safe.

, There are a variety of simple changes you can make to your lifestyle that may help encourage sleep. If you are having sleep problems, you may want to try the following techniques before you resort to medication:Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.
Start winding down for sleep a few hours for bed with relaxing activities, such as a warm bath or shower, meditating, or drinking decaf tea.
Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening.
Don't nap during the day, as this can cause you to be less tired at night.
Exercise regularly to help burn energy.
Reduce or manage the amount of stress in your life.

, If you need a little more help improving your sleep, but you don't want to take any medications, you may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy. This kind of therapy will help you identify the things that are keeping you from sleeping well and teach you better sleep habits.Unlike medications, cognitive behavioral therapy will help you address the root cause of your sleeplessness.
You may learn relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation, or use guided meditation.

Keep a dream journal.,
Pay attention to the content of your dreams.,
Understand why we dream.,

Examine your drinking habits.,
Consider other possible causes for your bad dreams.,
Understand that dreaming can be part of the grieving process.,
Seek help sooner rather than later if your dreams trouble you.",How to Get Over a Bad Dream2," By writing down the frequency and the content of your dreams, you may be able to recognize patterns. This can in turn help you pinpoint the cause of your troubling dreams, make sense of them, and distance yourself emotionally from them.


Recurring bad dreams often include more threatening content, and so can linger longer, bother us more throughout the day, and of course cause added anxiety as bedtime approaches.Thus, it's all the more important that you try to figure out why they are occurring, and a dream journal can help you with that.

, Most of the content of our dreams tends to be autobiographical: the people in our dreams are mostly people we know and interact with regularly, and most of the things we do in our dreams are drawn from our daily lives.


For example, pregnant women tend to dream more about pregnancy, birth, and childcare, while health care workers tend to dream more about their patients.When you pay attention to the content of your dream, you can begin to understand what your mind is trying to tell you: are you worried about an upcoming event at work? Are you stressed about your relationship?
If you come to realize that your dream is reflecting your stress about an aspect of your life, once you focus on handling that problem your bad dreams may subside.

, Learning about why we dream can be helpful as we try to process our bad dreams and get some perspective. Understanding what our mind is doing while it's dreaming can help us realize that it's a normal process which sometimes results in bad dreams.


Our brain uses the dreaming process to sort through our experiences and emotions, process the information we've taken in throughout the day, and begin to form memories., Our experiences aren't always processed by the brain immediately. It can sometimes take days or even weeks for an experience to work its way into our dreams.Researchers hypothesize that this is a way for our shorter term memories to be incorporated into our longer term memory.


Why should you care about this? If you realize that your bad dream is just a result of your brain processing and sorting this information, you may be able to conclude that your bad dream is just your brain's way of wrapping up the experience.
If this is the case, you may not need to worry about returning to the dream again.

, Some medications can also lead to an increase in bad dreams.If you have just recently begun to experience bad dreams, examine the labels of your medication to see if bad dreams or poor sleep possible side effects.
If they are, you may be able to speak with your physician about changing your prescription. If not, you'll at least know the possible reason and can take steps to manage and recover from your bad dreams.

, Alcohol can also interfere with our sleep and may be responsible for your troubled sleep.Consider cutting out alcohol in the evening (or altogether) to see if your bad dreams decline.

, People who suffer from migraines seem to be more prone to having bad dreams, as are those with sleep apnea and those with clinical depression.If you suspect that your bad dreams are not a result of normal stress, but may instead be the symptom of some underlying physical or emotional problem, it's important that you visit your physician and/or mental health care professional as soon as possible.

, It's very common for people who have suffered a loss or a traumatic event to experience bad dreams and to be affected by them.This can be both emotionally helpful and harmful.


For some people, the dreams about their loss can increase their depression, but others report that the dreams eventually help them come to terms with their loss.
Once you realize that bad dreams are to be expected after a difficult experience, you may rest better knowing that dreams are part of the grieving process. Just as your sadness will eventually fade or become more manageable, so too will your bad (or sad) dreams also become less frequent.

, You shouldn't hesitate to seek professional help if you think that your dreams are prompted by grief, trauma, anxiety or stress.


Your doctor or counselor will ask you how you've been feeling: be sure to discuss how you've been sleeping and what your dreams have been like as you begin to answer this question.

Be reassuring.,
Label the experience.,
Empathize with your child.,
Chase away the monsters (or the bad dreams).,
Provide your child with a protector.,
Try planning your child's dreams.,
Play soft, relaxing music.This can give your child something to focus on as he tries to fall back asleep, and can mask any “scary” sounding noises from a quiet house.,
Talk to your child in the morning.Your child may not be willing to share the scary details of his dream when he first wakes up, and you shouldn't press him if he's reluctant.,
Help your child rewrite her dreams.,
Talk to your child's doctor.,
Talk to your child's teachers and/or school counselors.",How to Get Over a Bad Dream3," If your child wakes from a bad dream or nightmare, be sure to respond quickly to her calls, and calmly and lovingly reassure her that you are there for her, and that she is safe.It can be tough for children to distinguish between the real feelings that they experience in their dreams and reality. Your calm presence will help relax your child, and will help her realize that she was just dreaming.

, Your child may be confused when he first wakes from a bad dream, and needs to know what just happened. He may be worried that there is still a bad guy in the house, for example, so you need to quickly help him figure out that he was dreaming.


Tell him, “You had a bad dream, but I'm here, it's gone, and you're ok.”, Explain to your child that everyone has bad dreams, and that you know how scary they can be.


Even though you want your child to get over her fear, be careful not to dismiss it, and let her know that it's ok to be scared and upset as a result of having a bad dream., With younger children in particular, you may have good results getting your child to fall back asleep if you prepare magic “potions” or “spells” to cast away the demons, monsters, or bad dreams.


Prepare a monster spray (water in a decorated spray bottle) or good dream dust that you can sprinkle around the room., If after talking together and cuddling your child is still nervous about falling back to sleep, she may be calmed if you provide her with a special stuffed animal or toy whose special job it is to protect your child from bad dreams.


Have a special talk with “Mr. Hippo,” for example, and remind the toy that he needs to help your child have good dreams and chase away all of the bad dreams.

, If your child is nervous about falling back to sleep, take some time to talk about what she'd like to dream about instead.Create a story with your child as the “star” and her friends or toys as the other players in the dream: what are they going to do together when she falls back asleep?
Add plenty of details, and don't rush the story. With luck, your child will fall asleep during the story and will continue it as she dreams.

,


Prompt him to think about the story the music is telling, or ask him to describe what he sees when he listens to the music: does he see a magic forest, or twinkling stars, for example?
Help him come up with soothing visualizations to match the music, and he may become more relaxed and less likely to return to his bad dream.

, See if he's ready to talk about it in the morning, though.


This can also be a good opportunity for you to figure out if your child's bad dream was a normal occurrence or if it's a symptom of bigger problem, such as anxiety about school or friends or depression.

, During the day, your child may be open to talking about her bad dream in more detail. Encourage her to rewrite the dream with a happier ending, or to revise it so that she is able to defeat all of the monsters or bad guys.


This can make her feel less vulnerable to her dreams in general and give her back a sense of control and power., If your child's bad dreams or nightmares become recurrent, you should check in with the pediatrician. Do this especially if your child's sleep is being negatively affected or if you see other emotional or behavioral problems., It may also be a good idea to see if your child has been struggling in school or is having problems with friends. This could be an underlying source of the bad dreams.


Also, even if your child just seems to be going through a phase, it's a good idea to let her teacher know that she hasn't been sleeping as well lately in case it may be affecting her behavior or performance at school.
Keeping her teacher in the loop can help protect your child from being subjected to added stress at school.

While dreams don't have any relationship to the future, they are a reflection of the past and your current life: they reflect trauma, stress, memories, and experiences your mind is trying to assimilate as you rest.When you wake from a bad dream in the middle of the night, it is important that you immediately turn your mind away from the dream and latch on to something in your reality. Think about whatever brings you the most joy in life: your family, your pets, a loved one, a gorgeous sunset. This is called ""guided imagery,"" an intentional mental strategy to guide your mind in the right direction to relax.;
, Calm down and just relax. Nightmares are known to cause physiological responses such as an increased heart rate and a cold sweat.Practice some meditative techniques to get your mind off of your dream and calmed enough to return to sleep.


Practice deep abdominal breathing to relax your heart rate. Lying on your back, place your hand over your stomach and slowly inhale deeply through your nose. Let the air expand your belly instead of your chest, then slowly push the air out with your hand through pursed lips. Focus on the feeling of the air filling and leaving your body., When you were a very young child, it is likely that your mother or father comforted you when you had a bad dream. You can evoke the same feeling by reciting words of comfort to yourself when you wake alone.It can be as simple as ""You're awake, you're safe. You're awake, you're safe."" You could also recite the words to a peaceful poem (Robert Frost's ""Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"" is a great choice) or the lyrics to a calming songs (children's lullabies are often a good choice).
If you are religious, you might prefer a scriptural recitation or prayer that helps you feel comforted in times of stress.

, Whether it's reading a book, watching TV, or calling your friends, take time to unwind and do whatever makes you happy.


If the themes of the dream continue to bother you throughout the day, remind yourself that the dream was not real and that there is no reason to be afraid.

, Since you want to forget the dream, talking about it might seem counter-productive. But sometimes the only way to forget a really troubling dream is to process what it meant and why it bothered you by talking it out with a trusted friend.Tell someone you trust and you know won't laugh or make fun of you. Call your parents, e-mail your friend or just tell them in person. It's better to get things off your chest.
A friend who knows your past and any current stressors in your life might be able to help you pinpoint what is causing the dreams or why they bother you so much., Most people are able to forget about their bad dreams during the day, but begin to feel anxious again toward bedtime because they do not want to re-experience something so troubling. As bedtime rolls around, try to train your mind to calm down and focus on the happy moments.


Avoid television, films, violent video games, or reading right before bed, especially if you tend to watch or read material that is suspenseful or frightening. These types of media can put your mind on edge and result in bad dreams as your subconscious continues on the train of thought started by the TV or book.[
Avoid watching the nightly news or reading news stories online prior to bedtime. News media tend to focus on frightening stories about crime, death, and war because those types of stories seem to attract more viewers, but watching the news will give you a warped sense of reality. Media scholars call this ""mean world syndrome,"" and it’s the tendency for people who watch a lot of television news to believe the world is more dangerous than it actually is.
Do whatever relaxes you most: have sex, read religious scriptures, read or watch soothing, lighthearted books or television, take a long hot bath, or have your significant other give you a massage with pleasantly scented oils or lotions.

, Understanding what triggers you dreams can help you to take steps to prevent them from occurring.


Dreams can be caused by medications (especially narcotics, antidepressants, and blood pressure medications), foods or drinks (particularly alcohol, but your individual triggers could be anything), stressful events, a fever or illness, or sleep deprivation.Some people even experience nightmares if they become overheated from too many blankets or pajamas that are too warm.Do you eat a midnight snack before bed? While people used to think that only certain foods could trigger nightmares (such as spicy food), scientists now believe that it’s the act of eating itself that causes increased dream and nightmare activity, not the specific food. It's thought that eating increases your metabolism, which in turn increases your brain activity at a time when your brain is normally unwinding for rest. The increased activity leads to increased dreams and nightmares.If you have recurring nightmares, keep a journal of the dream that includes information about any medication, unusual foods or drinks, stressful life events or worries, or illnesses that might have accompanied it.

, Not only do bad dreams often reflect stress or anxiety in your waking life, but the experience of having them can add to your stress load,potentially increasing your bad dreams in a vicious cycle. Take time for yourself each day to relieve stress. Try these strategies:


Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness is a meditation strategy that focuses on the present moment rather than the past or future. In studies, mindfulness has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and negative affect.Try yoga as a great way to learn mindfulness.Exercise to relieve stress. Bad dreams can be caused by stress or depression. Exercising is a great way to de-stress yourself, so why not go for a jog in the park? Exercise not only can help resolve your stress (thus eliminating one of the potential causes of bad dreams), it also helps you to fall asleep faster and sleep deeper, which might also contribute to less nightmares., Changing the environment can help to reduce your stress level, which in turn can help to reduce your nightmares. It can also help to make your room's atmosphere seem more reassuring when you wake from a nightmare.


Check the thermostat. Most people sleep best at a temperature of around 65 degrees Fahrenheit.You may be tempted to crank up the temperature on cold nights, but a lower temperature is more conducive to a good night's sleep and may help to ward off bad dreams.
Wear thin pajamas or sleep in the nude, and avoid using more blankets than necessary to fall asleep: a thin sheet and one blanket is probably plenty. Remember, the goal is to keep your body temperature down so that you don't become overheated in the night.
If you typically sleep in pitch-black, consider a dim nightlight. It can help to remind you when you wake that you are safe and in your room.If you typically use a light, consider sleeping in pitch black. Some people find the shadows made by nightlights to be disturbing.
Consider a comfort object. If you typically sleep alone, a stuffed animal can be comforting if you become frightened in the night. And if you're worried that stuffed animals are just for small children, consider this: one survey done in England found that one in four adult men traveled with stuffed animals in their suitcases!, The mind processes stress and traumatic experiences through bad dreams, and allowing those dreams to occur is an important part of coping with the reality that caused them.


Instead of trying to squash all bad dreams, try to get at the root of what is stressing you and deal with that instead. The dreams will naturally subside or change to reflect your reality., In most cases, infrequent nightmares are perfectly normal and just an unfortunate part of life that we have to deal with. For some people, though, they might signal an underlying problem, so see a specialist if bad dreams become problematic.


Persistent or recurring nightmares might suggest an anxiety disorder or a traumatic past, or perhaps a mental disorder that a therapist or doctor can help you to deal with. Remember, to stop the dreams, you need to get at the root of what is causing it. Many therapists are trained to do just that."

Remember that fantasizing about something and acting on it are very different things.,
Know that there are no right or wrong fantasies.,
Remember that fantasizing is healthy.,
Find a quiet place to relax.,
Figure out what turns you on.,
Incorporate the person you wish to fantasize about.,
Utilize all your senses.,
Notice if you start to lose sight of reality.,
Take a break if find your fantasizing taking on an obsessive or compulsive nature.,
Be aware if you're using fantasy to disassociate.",How to Fantasize About Someone," Does fantasizing about someone other than your partner mean you are going to cheat? Does fantasizing about someone of the same sex mean you're a homosexual? It's unlikely.Imagining something is not the same as doing it--and it doesn't necessarily mean it's even something you'd like to do in real life.Don't worry that fantasizing about your friend's girlfriend means you betrayed your friend. In fact, fantasizing about her might ""scratch"" any itch to actually hook up with her.
Part of the fun of fantasizing is it allows you to do something you would never do in real life. From flying like a bird to making out with your teacher--you get to imagine crazy and fantastic scenarios.;
, Sometimes fantasies take a turn for the strange and may leave you wondering if you've done something wrong. You may feel that fantasizing about doing something bad, or having something bad done to you, means there is something wrong with you. You may wonder if it makes you a bad person. The answer is no, it doesn't.Focus instead on the impact of the fantasy. Do you feel empowered and more in control afterwards? Or did it the fantasy feel negative, intrusive, or compulsive?
If it's the latter, your fantasy may be revealing some underlying issues you need to deal with.

, Fantasizing can help us figure out what we want to achieve and even which areas of our lives need work. Everyone fantasizes, whether it's about the delicious meal they plan to eat for dinner or about kissing their crush. It's a natural part of being a human with a curious mind, and nothing to be ashamed of.Think about how your fantasy might relate to your real life. If you fantasize about being dominated, it might mean you are lacking control somewhere in your life.Research has found that if you are experiencing a lack of desire for sexual activity and want to give it a boost, fantasizing regularly about your partner may return you to normal sexual functioning., Go someplace where you are comfortable and won't be disturbed. Sudden interruptions are not usually welcome while fantasizing! Take deep, slow breaths and try to become aware of your body.Close your eyes if it makes it easier for you to visualize.
If you want, you can dim your lights and put on music to help you relax.

, Maybe this is something you've never thought about before. Try to think about times when you've felt excited. What were you doing? What about it excited you? Or, if you're having trouble, you can start with some common scenarios and let your mind wander.


Imagine different settings. Fantasize about being on a beach or in a cabin in front of a fire. Picture yourself in a posh hotel room or in an office or supermarket. There are no consequences in a fantasy, so you can imagine yourself anywhere.Think about past experiences and expand on those. You can exaggerate them or make them more vivid, or replay them in your mind., Once you've figured out what makes you excited, you can picture yourself with that special someone. Let the scene run through your mind like a movie, except you are directing the action.


Try imagining a scenario in which you and this person are separated from everyone else. Maybe you are snowed in at a cabin, or you get locked in the copy room together at work.
Fantasize about all the things you'd like to do with this person. Remember that you are in charge of this fantasy, and if you start to feel uncomfortable, you can change it or simply stop at any time.

, Feeling turned-on is not only about visual stimulation. While fantasizing about this person, think about his or her voice, how he or she might smell, how it would feel to touch him or her, or for him or her to touch you.Your fantasy may be richer if you imagine the sensory details of your surroundings as well. If you are imagining you are on the beach, how does the sand feel on your skin? Try to hear the waves crashing on the shore.

, If you start to have trouble distinguishing between your fantasy life and real life, it is time to cut back on the fantasizing and speak to a mental health care professional. The great thing about fantasy is that there are no rules or consequences, but this is not true in real life. Acting on your fantasies--especially if you don't have the consent of anyone else involved--could have serious consequences.


If the line between these two worlds begins to blur, and you find yourself wanting to act on things that would be inappropriate outside of the safety of your mind, then your fantasizing has gone out of control.
If you find your fantasy life is interfering with your real life, then you are no longer fantasizing in a healthy way and may need assistance from a therapist or mental health professional.

, If you have a significant other and find yourself occasionally fantasizing about someone else, it's nothing to worry about. But if you are consistently imagining getting intimate with this other person--especially if it starts happening when you're being intimate with your partner--then fantasizing has really become a coping mechanism to avoid dealing with real issues.First, put the breaks on your fantasizing. Then, even if it's painful, start looking at your relationship. Are you bored? Are you angry? Is fantasizing about another person a defense against intimacy with your partner?Using fantasy to cope with certain things isn't inherently wrong, but it can keep you from addressing the real problem. You won't be able to repair your relationship without taking an honest look at what's going on.

, When you disassociate, you feel disconnected from what is happening. This often happens to survivors of trauma, who can experience a feeling of watching from a distance as things happen to their bodies. Healthy fantasizing will help you connect with your partner and make your sex life richer.If you start to feel as though you are not present, feeling disassociated or disembodied, you may wish to speak with a sexual therapist.

Ask yourself if you’re having a typical nervousness dream.",How to Tell if You're Dreaming," Although this may seem counterintuitive, lucid dream advocates suggest that it is important to test during the day whether or not you're dreaming.The reason for doing this is that if you get into a habit of checking in waking life, this checking habit will cross over into your dream life.


By deliberately checking during waking hours, you can create a particular habit for your mind to try out one or more of the following reality checks: reading a piece of paper when wondering if you're dreaming, trying to move objects, or checking a clock. When the habit is tried out in a dream, and fails to perform ""normally"", then its failure lets you know that you're dreaming.
If you are really awake, then you might want to consider why you're worried about whether or not you're dreaming. For example, have you taken drugs or have you been poisoned? Are you an accident victim? Are you hallucinating? Might you be suffering from concussion or some other injury?If you are injured or out of your depth mentally or emotionally, either call for medical assistance or signal to somebody to help you as best you can.;
, If you are dreaming, things won't be as they seem normally. Reality checks form a regular part of lucid dreaming and are a means by which you can be actively more involved in your lucid dreaming. Some lucid dreamers like to perform reality checks during the waking hours because it increases the opportunities for lucid dreaming., Appearances can be very deceiving in the dream world, where distortions are common and even the norm. If the dream is set in your home or another place where you spend time, look at common objects. Does anything look different than how you last remember seeing it? For example, is there a window where a painting is supposed to be? These are clear signs of dreaming.

, If you're talking to people who have been dead for years, then that's a sure sign that you're dreaming. Why you're talking to them is a whole other area for dream interpretation, but the fact that they're there, casual as, means you're dreaming.Are you schmoozing up with your enemies like they're your best friends? Definitely you're dreaming!
Does your grandfather suddenly have extraordinary super powers or your sibling has started being nice to you?
If you're in familiar surroundings, can you recognize the people around you or are they all complete strangers?

, Notice your hands, feet, legs, etc. Are they the usual shape? Do you have the right amount of digits? Is any part of your body disfigured? Does your hair color and length appear like it should, or has it changed length, texture and color? Try to find a mirror. What does your reflection look like in the mirror? In a dream state, you probably won't look like the real you. The reflection will often be blurry or distorted., Clearly, if you can fly or lift extremely heavy objects, you're not awake. Keep in mind, however, that a lucid dreaming state can be a good way to practice actual physical actions that can help you in the real world. Some health care professionals use it to help people recovering from injuries envision their bodies recovering. The following abilities, however, are symptomatic of dreams. Test your abilities as follows:Try to levitate or float. If you can, you're in a dream state.
Can you speak normally? If your voice is extremely croaky or not coming from your mouth at all, you're more than likely dreaming.
Try jumping on the spot. Can you jump over the moon, or maintain a jump for an abnormally long period of time? Or did you jump straight up and then land on Earth with a thud?
Are you able to shift objects across a room or area without going near them?
Can you switch appliances and lights on and off with thoughts alone? In addition, note that the level of light will rarely change as a result of flipping a switch in a dream state. Be aware that not every lucid dreaming advocate believes that this is a reliable test - for some dreamers, nothing changes when a light is switched on and off.
Can you make objects appear before you just by wishing?

, A good test of whether or not you're dreaming is if your usual waking habits distort or are inconsistent with what is normally done. For example, if you usually turn the key once to unlock a door but your dream has you turning it three times despite the fact that this would not be possible in waking life, then you have a sign that you're dreaming.

, Test this while awake. Read the paper, look away, then come back to it again and read it. Hopefully the text has stayed the same! The point of this is to reinforce this as an action for your mind whether or not it is dreaming. In dreams, reading is difficult as the words become distorted. Try looking away from the text and then looking back again; if it's a dream, there is a high likelihood that the text will have morphed into something else.


Keep something to read next to your bed. If you have just finished a lucid dream, it's possible that you're still dreaming. If not, and you're actually awake, you can read the text next to the bed.Look at a digital watch or clock. This is a variant on the text distortion - again, if the digital numbers blur, change, or make no sense, then you're probably dreaming.Check complex patterns, another variant of text and clocks.Look at patterns, such as brickwork, floor paving, or soft furnishing designs. Do the patterns remain the same or do they change?

, There are some very typical, shared experience dream signs that indicate you're dreaming rather than sitting wide awake. These dreams often tap into our unconscious fears, and almost all of us have had a version of these dreams at some point in our lives. Scientists have realized, however, that we do have a lot of control over our dreams, and can use techniques to guide ourselves away from dreams we’d rather not have.Think of whatever you want to dream about before bed.
Let an image come into your mind that you associate with whatever it is you want to dream about.
Hold that image in your mind as you are falling asleep.

, The physical sensation dreams are very common and can feel as if you’re actually flying, falling, or running. These dreams also commonly jolt you out of your dream as you startle yourself out of sleeping. Some of the most common of these kinds of dreams are:Flying unaided.
Falling, but never quite reaching an end (although, a sudden jolt in a fall can be enough to awaken you properly).
Having a monster, dangerous person, or strange creature run after you or attack you.
Paralysis - something terrible this way comes but you just sit or stand there because you cannot move.
A fuzziness; not being able to see clearly, often accompanied by an inability to completely control your thoughts and actions.
Missing body parts, with lost teeth being very common in dreams.

, These are often about not having done something, being naked or otherwise unprepared, and sometimes are linked to events in your own life about which you might be nervous. Some of these dreams include:Being lost in a familiar place.
Being naked in public (walking into the city centre, sitting on a bus, sitting in class, etc.).
Normally reliable mechanical devices failing to work as normal, especially if you need to get away from something.
Taking a test when you don't know the answers. Taking a test naked when you don't know the answers!
The toilet dream. This can be a bad one if you're thinking you are awake as you sit on an imaginary toilet and wet the bed in reality. And no, this isn't just for kids!

Search for online communities.",How to Deal With Maladaptive Daydreaming," Since most everyone daydreams, you might assume that your frequent and detailed daydreams are normal. But, if you have maladaptive daydreaming, you're probably distressed by your difficulty in controlling the daydreams. You may also be upset with how they interfere with your life, which can create a lot of shame. You might also regularly struggle to keep the daydreaming behavior hidden.The term ""maladaptive daydreaming"" was created in 2002, but is not yet recognized as an official condition in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.;
, Abuse at a young age is common in those who experience maladaptive daydreams. What starts as imaginative daydreaming becomes full-fledged escapist fantasies. The maladaptive nature of the daydreams really starts impacting sufferers in the early or pre-teen years.If you were abused and struggle with maladaptive dreaming, be sure to get help from a mental health professional.


For example, what starts as simple daydreaming in a child may turn into detailed fantasies after any kind of abuse or traumatic experience begins.

, In addition to early childhood abuse, kinesthetic elements are another shared trait. These are often repetitive movements, like tossing a ball or spinning something in your hand while daydreaming.Other traits often include:Such a strong desire to daydream that it's compared to an addiction
Incredibly detailed and complex daydreams
Acting out the daydreams, but understanding the difference between reality and the daydreams (unlike schizophrenics or psychotics)
Difficulty in fulfilling simply daily tasks (like eating, showering, sleeping) because of the daydreams

, A trigger is an event, place, feeling, or thought that makes you start or return to maladaptive daydreaming. Identify your daydreaming triggers. You can make notes about when you daydream, and what was happening right before. For example, you may notice that when you go into a certain room, you have some of your best daydreams or you daydream when you're bored. Be aware of your triggers and make specific plans to avoid them.For instance, if you are trying to avoid your trigger spot in the house, your plan might look like this: Do work in kitchen instead of bedroom. Get out of the house - go for a walk. Go to a coffee shop to work instead of at home., There are several things you can do to improve your sleep quality. Avoid caffeine or alcohol before bedtime, since these can wake you up or interfere with your sleep. You should also try to stick to a sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same times each day. It may help to make a bedtime routine, like brushing your teeth, showering, and reading before bed. A routine can signal your brain that sleep is coming soon.Studies have shown that poor sleep quality or not enough leads to more frequent daydreaming.It's also been linked to impaired memory, slower reaction time, impaired attention, and intrusive daydreaming.

, Keep your mind busy and mentally unavailable for daydreaming. Choose tasks that take your mental focus, like reading or crosswords. You could also engage your mind and body at the same time, like playing basketball or dancing. Or you could engage in social activities, like getting coffee with a friend or attending a local trivia event with co-workers.


One theory about daydreaming says that daydreaming is a self-soothing technique, used to calm or pacify the daydreamer.In this case, try doing a self-soothing or self-care activity, like cooking dinner, doing yoga, or going with a friend for a pedicure.

, You may struggle to completely cut out daydreaming. Instead, monitor how many times you catch yourself daydreaming during a certain amount of time. Then, tell yourself to reduce this number over time. For instance, you might set the timer for 3 minutes and record how many times you caught yourself daydreaming during that time. Repeat the process until your number starts decreasing.At first, you may not be able to catch yourself at all and the timer will go off in the middle of a daydream. This is fine. Let the timer interrupt your daydreaming until you learn to monitor the behavior yourself.Setting a timer is a good form of self-monitoring which helps you take an active part in reducing daydreaming. Since it's a behavioral modification technique, the results can be long lasting., While there's little research on maladaptive dreaming and treatments, users in maladaptive online forums report that journaling helps. Journaling, writing down thoughts, can help you order your mind and keep you from slipping into daydreaming.Writing down your daydreams can help you slow down and live in the moment. Or, you can journal about how daydreaming emotionally affects you and the role it plays in your life.


Although research is needed to know why journaling can help maladaptive daydreamers, journaling has been shown to slow down thought processes, allow space for self discovery, and relieve tension., Once you've started noticing your daydreams and what triggers them, begin to pay attention to how they make you feel. You may notice that some make you anxious or paranoid while others get you energetic or motivated. If you frequently have the same daydreams, motivating you to do something, consider working towards making the goal of the dream happen.For example, maybe your mind frequently wanders to imagine if you lived in a foreign country and held a different job. What simply seems like a daydream could become a reality if you take steps to move somewhere else and find a new job.

, Since maladaptive daydreaming is not yet recognized as a condition and research on it is still in the very early stages, there are no recommended medications or treatments yet. In fact, many medical providers may not have heard of it. But, you may benefit from meeting with a therapist or psychiatrist who may be able to help you work through underlying conditions of your daydreaming.


For example, if you find yourself slipping into daydreaming whenever you become stressed or irritated, you may be able to work with a therapist to develop coping strategies for stress or anger.

, Maladaptive daydreaming is in the early stages regarding awareness, research, and treatment. The easiest way to talk about the condition and get tips is to find websites created by users with maladaptive daydreaming. These are actually the most active in trying to understand the condition.Be sure to follow any medical developments that come from studying maladaptive daydreaming. As more studies are done, new treatments and coping mechanisms may become available.

Note when the episode occurs.",How to Tell the Difference Between Nightmares and Night Terrors," Nightmares are a type of undesirable sleep experience that occur while you are falling asleep, sleeping, or waking up. There are several characteristic features of experiencing a nightmare:


The storyline of the nightmare is often related to threats to your safety or survival.People experiencing nightmares will awake from their vivid dream with feelings of fear, stress, or anxiety.When the dreamers of nightmares wake up, they will often remember the dream and be able to repeat the details.They will be able to think clearly upon awakening.Nightmares often keep the dreamer from falling back to sleep easily.;
, Nightmares are most common in children ages 3-6, with up to 50% of children experiencing nightmares during these ages.However, nightmares are often experienced by adults as well, especially if the individual is experiencing a particularly high amount of anxiety or stress.

, Nightmares occur most often later in the sleep cycle during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. This is the period of time when dreaming is most prevalent, and it is when both good dreams and nightmares most commonly occur., While nightmares can occur for no reason at all, seeing or hearing something that frightens or alarms a person can result in a nightmare. The sights or sounds that cause a nightmare can be things that have really happened or things that are make-believe.Common causes of nightmares include illness, anxiety, the loss of a loved one, or a negative reaction to a medication., Nightmares usually leave the dreamer with intense feelings of fear, terror, and/or anxiety.It may be very difficult to return to sleep after a nightmare.


Expect to console your child after a nightmare. He or she may need to be calmed down and assured that there is nothing to be frightened of.
Adults, teens, or older children experiencing nightmares may benefit from speaking with a counselor who can help identify what might be a source of stress, fear, or anxiety that is manifesting as nightmares.

, While night terrors are relatively uncommon overall, they occur most often in children (experienced by up to 6.5% of children). Night terrors may be a consequence of the maturation of the central nervous system.In contrast, night terrors are rarely experienced by adults (only 2.2% of adults will experience night terrors).When adults experience night terrors, it is often due to underlying psychological factors such as trauma or stress.


Night terrors in children are usually not a cause for alarm. There is no evidence suggesting that a child who experiences night terrors has a psychological problem or is upset about or disturbed by something.Children usually grow out of night terrors.Night terrors do seem to have a genetic component. Children are more likely to experience night terrors if someone else in the family suffers from them as well.Many adults who have night terrors also have another psychological condition, including bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, or an anxiety disorder.Night terrors in adults can also be caused by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or by substance abuse (particularly alcohol abuse).It is crucial to consider potential underlying causes of night terrors in adults and address these underlying causes if need be.

, There are certain behaviors that are often associated with night terrors. Common behaviors include:Sitting up in bed
Screaming or shouting in fear
Kicking his or her feet
Thrashing his or her arms
Sweating, breathing heavily, or having a rapid pulse
Staring wide-eyed
Engaging in aggressive behavior (this is more common in adults than in children)

, Night terrors often occur during non-REM sleep, most commonly occurring during the short wave period of sleep. This means that they often will happen during the first few hours of sleep., People who are having a sleep terror episode will often be very hard to awaken. However, if they do awaken, they will often emerge from sleep in a confused state, and may be unsure why they appear to be sweaty, out of breath, or why their bed may be in disarray.


Expect the person to have no memory of the event. Occasionally people may recall vague information about the event, but there is no recollection of vivid detail.Even if you do manage to wake up the person, s/he will often be unaware of your presence or be unable to recognize you.

, It is likely that he or she will have a difficult time communicating, even if s/he appears to be “awake” after the night terror occurs. This is because the night terror occurred during deep sleep.

, A person having a night terror may pose a threat to him or herself or to others without knowing it.


Watch out for sleepwalking. A person who is having a night terror can engage in sleepwalking, which can pose a serious threat.
Protect yourself from combative behavior. Abrupt physical movements (punching, kicking, and thrashing) often accompany sleep terrors and can cause injury to the person having a sleep terror, someone sleeping next to them, or someone attempting to control them.

, You should not attempt to wake up a person who is having a night terror unless s/he is in danger.Stay with the person having a night terror until s/he has calmed down.

, A person who has a sleep terror episode will remain asleep, while someone who has a nightmare will wake up and may remember vivid details about the dream., Someone who is having a nightmare can be easily awoken and brought out of the nightmare, but this is not the case with a night terror.In the case of the latter, the person will be extremely difficult to wake up and may not actually emerge from their deep sleep.

, If the person who has experienced the episode appears confused and is unaware of the presence of others in the room, s/he has likely experienced a night terror and will often immediately return to sleep. On the other hand, if the person wakes up with feelings of fear or anxiety and seeks out the comfort or company of another person (especially in the case of children), s/he has had a nightmare.


Remember that a person who has had a nightmare will often take longer to fall back to sleep.

, If the episode occurs during the first few hours of sleep (most commonly about 90 minutes after falling asleep), it most likely has occurred during the early short wave period of sleep. This indicates that the episode is probably a night terror.However, if the episode occurs later on in the sleep cycle, it most likely has occurred during REM sleep and is a nightmare.

Decide you are going to remember your dreams.,
Skip the alarm clock.,
Avoid sleeping pills.,
Drink large amounts of water.,
Skip the alcohol.,
Lose a little sleep.,
Try different foods or supplements.",How to Dream1," Some people just have more trouble remembering them than other people. If you're one of those people, it can help to tell yourself you're going to remember it before you go to sleep. It may seem silly, but this conscious step can help signal your mind to remember.It may take a few weeks for this process to work.In fact, you likely dream an average of 5 times a night if you're getting your recommended 8 hours of sleep.;
, When possible, skip the alarm clock. If you want to remember your dream, you need to wake up after REM sleep. An alarm clock can interrupt your sleep cycle at the wrong time. In addition, if you move or hear noise, it can cause your dream to disappear. When you hear the alarm clock, it's loud, and you probably lean over to turn it off immediately. Skipping the alarm clock allows you to wake up more gradually and without the added sensory input., People who don't sleep as soundly remember more dreams. That's because they naturally wake up multiple times per night, often when they are coming out of a sleep cycle.If you take a pill to sleep soundly, you might skip it a few nights to see if it helps you remember your dreams.


Always ask your doctor before skipping a medication, especially if it's a prescription.

, Another way to help you remember your dreams is to guzzle water before you go to bed, about 4 glasses. The reason this step can help you remember your dreams is because your full bladder will interrupt your sleep multiple times throughout the night, often right when you're coming out of REM sleep. Since you're waking after REM sleep, you're more likely to remember what you dreamed., Alcohol tends to deter dreaming because it tends to suppress REM sleep. Therefore, to increase your dreams, you should avoid alcohol, especially at night.Antidepressants can also have the same effect, but you should talk to your doctor about the fact that you're not dreaming if you want to change or go off your antidepressant. Don't go off your antidepressants without talking to your doctor first., While getting enough sleep is always best, studies have shown that losing sleep can help you remember your dreams. In fact, you go through a rebound process when you haven't gotten enough sleep, meaning that your dreams will be more intense., Some people have luck focusing on certain foods to increase their dreams. For instance, taking 100 milligrams of vitamin B6 an hour or two before bed could help increase the intensity of your dreams. Another option is eating foods rich in tryptophan, such as chicken, soybeans, turkey, and tuna.Instead of tryptophan-rich foods, try taking a 5-HTP supplement a couple of hours before bed."
"
Get a book just for your dreams.,
Keep a notebook handy.,
Take a moment to think.,
Write your dream as soon as you've solidified it.,
Record anything that was said.,
Include details.,
Add notes about emotion.,
Use a voice recorder.,
Try drawing it.",How to Dream2," It's easy to have one notebook for many purposes, but when it comes to your dreams, it's best to devote a single book to it. Mostly, the reasoning is that if you have one notebook for dreams, you won't be tempted to pick it up and move it somewhere else. Pick something that you really like, that inspires your creativity, as it can also inspire your dreams.Recording your dreams helps you remember more dreams, making it seem like you are dreaming more.In fact, some theories suggest that your brain doesn't store all of its dreams to memory simply because so many dreams would cause you to have trouble distinguishing reality from dreams. Other theories suggest that your brain stores the memory of the dream, but they are not readily accessible to memory.Most people forget many of their dreams because they keep on sleeping. That is, you have to wake up to remember your dream, so you likely will only remember your dreams near the times you are awake, such as in the morning. However, you may not even remember those because you move on with your day too quickly., Have a notebook right beside your bed so it is available when you wake up. You'll want it to be instantly on hand the moment you open your eyes, as dreams are fleeting., When you wake up, don't move. Take just a moment to think about what you were dreaming. Once you have a clear image of your dream in your mind, move on to the next step., It may be tempting to run to the bathroom first before writing about your dream, but by then, your dream may be gone. Start jotting down the main images of your dreams as soon as you open your eyes, and reach for your pen and notebook.Include the main details, such as who was in it, what major things you saw, and what the main action was.
If you wake in the middle of the night after having a dream, write down the details of your dream in the notebook before falling back asleep.

, If anybody said anything in your dream, take a moment to write it down. What was said could be important to interpreting your dream, if you are inclined to do so., Once you get the main part of the dream down, try filling in the details. Add in as many details as you can remember, from the time of year to the memories it brought up for you., What you're feeling when you wake up is an important part of the dream. Write down a few notes about your current emotions along with the details of your dream., If you don't enjoy writing, you can record your dream on your phone or some other recording device. Just make sure you have the application open so you can easily access it in the morning.As with written dream journals, you should record as much information as possible and do so as soon as possible. If you cannot remember a dream in full detail, talk about general impressions, images, and feelings that you do recall. You may even begin to remember more as you begin talking about your dream.

, Another way to capture a dream is to make a drawing of it in your journal. Because dreams are driven by images, it may be easier for you to draw than to write it. It doesn't matter if you're not an artist. You just need to get the images down on paper."

Distract yourself.,
Reframe your bad dream.,
Turn on a nightlight.,
Ignore your clock.,
Bring some fresh scents into your room.,
Perform a grounding exercise.,
Tense and relax muscles to fall asleep.,
Meditate to calm yourself to sleep.,
Peel off restrictive bedding.,
Recognize the causes of bad dreams.,
Keep a consistent sleep schedule.,
Write your dreams in a diary.,
Practice a nighttime ritual.,
Reduce stress in your life.,
See a doctor.",How to Forget a Bad Dream and Fall Back Asleep," A bad dream can leave strong images in your mind that are difficult to forget.If you have a bad dream and can’t forget it, find a way to distract your mind. You could get out of bed for a few minutes. Consider watching peaceful images of a beach or mountains from a sleep or meditation app on one of your devices.Leave your bedroom for a bit and sit or lie someplace relaxing. Turn on a dim light if that helps you feel better. Read, watch a funny show, or listen to soft music, all of which can divert your attention from the nightmare.
Show a pet some love, which can calm you and help you forget the dream. Talking to your pet may also help you. For example, stroke your cat and say, “Hello Socks, would you like to snuggle for a bit? What a good kitty you are. Listen to you purr. That makes me happy.”
Load apps on one of your devices that promote sleep and/ or meditation. These often have soothing music and images that can distract your mind and relax you.;
, Cognitive reframing is a technique that has you step back from a situation and alter its various aspects.Change out terrifying parts of a bad dream positive images. Reframing the storyline of your bad dream with different and happy images can help you forget its details. In turn, this can help you relax and get back to sleep.Keep in mind how often you forget dreams in the process of thinking about other things. Reframing your bad dream in alternative terms can help you forget it just as quickly as other dreams.Switch the storyline of the bad dream as soon as you wake up. Remove whatever upsets you by thinking about it or even writing it in a journal you keep next to your bed.This is especially useful because handwriting is closely associated with memory.Replace the bad elements of the dream for something happy and positive. For example, if you dream that a whale capsizes your boat, tell yourself or write, “A giant whale swam next to us and then guided us to a tropical paradise.”
Avoid assigning meaning to your dreams as well. Remind yourself that dreams are just a product of your brain’s processing functions. They do not indicate something about you or about the future. Try not to assign meaning to the dream or to try to interpret the dream. If you want to consider the dream further, then do so later on when you are feeling calm.

, Dim lights can provide comfort in the dark of the night. Turn on your nightlight or small lamp next to your bed as soon as you wake up from a bad dream. This can relax and re-orient you to your surroundings.Choose a light in a soothing color that won’t stimulate your body to wake up. Hues in the red, yellow, or orange range are the best choices.Set the light near your bed so that you can turn it on easily when you wake up from a bad dream.

, If you have a clock in your bedroom or next to your bed, turn it so that you can’t see the time. Watching time pass can make the physical and emotional distress from a bad dream worse. Ignoring your clock can help you forget the dream and get back to sleep more quickly., What you smell can positively affect your mood and your dreams. If you wake up from a bad dream, place some fresh flowers or an aromatherapy oil next to or near your bed. These may help soothe your thoughts, relax you, and help you fall back asleep.Consider some of the following scents:


Coconut
Jasmine
Lavender
Marjoram
Peppermint
Rose
Vanilla, Grounding exercises can help to reduce anxiety and calm yourself down after something frightening has happened. If your bad dream has left you feeling shaken, then doing a grounding exercise may help you to feel better. Most grounding exercises require you to engage with the five senses. A simple exercise that you can do is to name or write:Five things in the room that you can see. You might see a clock, a picture, your cat, a lamp, and a dresser.
Four things you can feel. You might feel the blankets on your skin, your pillow, cool air on your face, and your cat’s fur.
Three things you can hear. You might hear a car passing by, your cat purring, and the sound of a fan.
Two things you can smell. You might smell the lotion on your arms and the scent of fresh rain coming in through your window.
One thing you like about yourself or that other people like. You might note that one good thing about yourself is that you are kind to people.

, A bad dream can make you wake up suddenly. This shocks your body and the fear can increase your heart rate. Use the technique of tensing and relaxing each muscle group to bring your heart rate down to a normal level and help you fall back asleep. Focusing on the tension and relaxation may also further distract your thoughts from your bad dream.Tense and release each muscle group in your body starting at your toes and ending at your head. Tense each muscle group for 10 seconds and then release it for 10 seconds. Taking a deep breath in between each muscle can further relax you., A bad dream can increase your heart rate and it may also cause rapid breathing and anxiety.Taking a few minutes to meditate can lower your heart rate, return your breathing to normal, decrease anxiety, and increase relaxation. In turn, this can help you not only fall back asleep, but may divert lingering memories of the bad dream.Breathe naturally without controlling it to help relax you and bring your heart rate back to normal more quickly. Let your thoughts to come and go as they will. This can help you relax and more easily let go of your bad dream.
Repeat “let” every time you breathe in and “go” every time you exhale if you are having a hard time meditating.

, Bad dreams can cause a lot of emotional and physical symptoms including sweating. Taking off any restrictive bedding can help you cool off, lower your heart rate, and help you fall asleep more easily.Take off only enough bedding to help you stay cool and comfortable. Cover yourself enough to minimize chills and help you feel safe. Having increased body temperature may make it more difficult to fall asleep.Change your bedding if you’ve soaked it during a bad dream. This can help you forget the dream, relax you, and help you fall back asleep.

, There are a variety of things that can cause bad dreams or recurring nightmares. Limiting your exposure to them may help reduce how often you get bad dreams and make the content less frightening. Some common causes of bad dreams include:


Stress
Trauma
Sleep deprivation
Medications such as antidepressants or blood pressure drugs
Substance abuse
Reading a scary book or watching a scary movie, Going to bed and waking up time at the same time every day can help you to fall back asleep if you wake up.It wards off sleep deprivation, which can cause bad dreams. Maintaining a consistent sleep routine can help control nightmares.Get between 7.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep every night to prevent sleep deprivation., Keeping a dream diary may help you identify the source of your bad dreams. If you wake up from a bad dream, write down what the dream. Include any factors that may have made it worse such as stress, alcohol consumption, or entertainment before bed. See if you notice any patterns in the dreams over time.Keep a notebook next to your bed so that you can document the dream as soon as you wake up. You can also consider using a small voice recorder if writing is too difficult.

, Your brain and body need time to switch into sleep mode. Having a pre-bed routine can signal your body and brain to relax, which can help you fall asleep and prevent bad dream.Avoid electronics such as television or devices. This can reduce anxiety prevent you from seeing images that can cause a bad dream.Incorporate things such as reading a light novel with the lights dimmed, drinking herbal tea, or taking a warm bath to relax you.Avoid or limit alcohol and drugs, which can also cause bad dreams and disrupt your sleep.Limiting or quitting either substance altogether may control or prevent nightmares and help you get a better night’s sleep., Stress and anxiety are the primary causes of bad dreams in adults.Reducing how much stress you are exposed to can prevent bad dreams, help you relax, and may promote a good night’s sleep.


Stay away from stressful situations as much as you can. Take a short walk to relax yourself during a stressful situation.
Relieve stress and anxiety by getting at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Exercise can help you sleep easier and have beneficial effects on your mood, which can prevent bad dreams., Bad dreams might seem harmless, but they can affect your mood and ability to function because they disrupt vital sleep time. If nothing stops bad dreams and your ability to fall back asleep, see your doctor. A medical professional can identify the cause of the dreams and treat you for them as well as for the disrupted sleep. A doctor may also send you to a sleep specialistShow the doctor your dream diary if you keep one. This can give the doctor a better idea of your dreams and what is causing them.
Answer any questions your doctor may have about your dreams, sleep patterns, or lifestyle choices that can influence them. Ask any questions you may have about your dreams.
Be aware that your doctor may suggest seeing a sleep specialist or a mental health professional. The doctor may even give you a prescription to relieve anxiety or help you sleep.

In fact,1 in every 2 adults will experience nightmares now and again, while 2% to 8% of the adult population suffers from chronic or recurring nightmares.Nightmares are characterized by vividly realistic images, thoughts and emotions which cause your heart to beat faster and sometimes even force you to wake from your sleep. Sometimes details of the nightmare will be remembered and the terrifying or disturbing images can be difficult to shake.
As a result, nightmares affect the quality of sleep, leading to physical exhaustion and mental anxiety and stress. If your sleep is being interrupted by nightmares, it can cause issues in other areas of your life and even lead to long-term health problems. Therefore, it is important to understand the source of the nightmares and take steps to prevent them.;
, Nightmares and night terrors are two different types of sleep disturbances which are sometimes confused.



Nightmares tend to occur during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, so you will usually experience them in the early hours of the morning. They are experienced as frightening or disturbing dreams which seem vividly real as they occur. The content of the dreams will vary from person to person, though adults often report having nightmares about being chased or falling from a height. People who have experienced a traumatic event tend to relive that event in their nightmare.

Night terrors occur during the deeper stages of sleep and so tend to occur in the first few hours of going to bed. They are experienced as an intense feeling of fear, which is not accompanied by dreams or images. It is often accompanied by movement (thrashing or sitting upright in bed) which may cause the person to wake up. Usually the person cannot remember why they were so frightened upon waking., Although nightmares in adults often happen spontaneously with no serious underlying cause, sometimes nightmares will be the result of psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).


This is particularly likely if the sufferer has recently experienced a traumatic or life-changing event, such as the loss of a loved one, changing or losing a job, having a baby, undergoing surgery or being involved in an accident.
Sometimes nightmares are a symptom of another sleep disorder such as sleep apnea or restless leg symptom. Other times, a person is just genetically predisposed towards nightmares, as research has shown that the likelihood of having nightmares runs in the family., If your nightmares are the result of an underlying condition such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy, REM disorder, or restless leg syndrome, receiving treatment for these conditions should help to reduce nightmares.


If your nightmares are related to anxiety, depression or PTSD, certain forms of therapy or medications might help to alleviate these conditions and lessen nightmares.
In particular, a drug known as Prazosin is often prescribed to help patients with PTSD, anxiety and panic disorders, and can alleviate nightmares.
It is important that you speak to your doctor to figure out a treatment option that is best for you.

, Eating before bed can trigger nightmares, as food speeds up your metabolism and sends signals to your brain to become more active. Therefore, it's a good idea to cut out bedtime snacks, particularly those that are high in sugar. , Stress can contribute to nightmares, so take some time relax throughout the day and aim to go to bed with a calm, clear mind.



Yoga and meditation are both good activities for relieving stress and clearing the mind. Consider taking a class, or simply practice for a few minutes each day in the comfort of your own home.
Other activities such as reading, knitting, running or just spending more time with your family and loved can also help to relieve stress.
Taking a hot bath before bed can help you to unwind after the stresses of the day and leave you feeling calmer and more relaxed .

, Certain medications can increase the likelihood of nightmares, so speak to your doctor if you feel this might be an issue for you.


Anti-depressants and certain blood pressure medications are often responsible for causing nightmares, so speak to your doctor about switching to a different drug.
Sometimes a change in dosage or coming off a particular drug can cause nightmares, in which case the bad dreams should subside once your body adjusts., Although nightmares may cause sleep deprivation, sleep deprivation can also cause nightmares. Therefore, taking steps to improve the quality of your sleep can help to prevent nightmares.



Make your bedroom a relaxing environment. Keep your bedroom neat and tidy, make sure it's dark enough and avoid temperatures that are too hot or cold. Make sure your bed is comfortable. Use a white noise machine to block out any undesirable sounds. Reserve your bedroom for sleeping - working in your bedroom may cause you to associate it with stress.Get more physical exercise. Tiring yourself out with physical exercise is a great way to improve your sleep. Find an activity that you enjoy, whether it's running, strength training, dancing, rowing or rock climbing and work out 3 to 5 times a week. Schedule it for the morning if you can. Just don't exercise right before bed - it will leave you too amped up for sleep.

Cut back on your caffeine, alcohol and nicotine intake. These substances can interfere with your sleep, so it's a good idea to cut them out or at least cut down. Also try to avoid drinking, smoking or consuming caffeine less than 3 to 4 hours before bedtime.

Avoid blue light. The light emitted from electronics like phone, computers, and tablets can suppress sleep hormones and affect the quality of your sleep. Avoid using these devices close to bedtime., Imagery rehearsal treatment is a type of cognitive therapy which has been found very effective in reducing nightmares in PTSD and insomnia patients.With imagery rehearsal treatment, the patient is encouraged to imagine an alternate ending to their nightmares - one with a more pleasant or satisfying outcome - while they are still awake.

For example, if you're dreaming you're being chased, you could imagine the monster that's chasing you, when it catches you, saying ""tag, you're it"" and it's really a game of tag.
If you're dreaming that you're falling, you could imagine that a parachute opens up and saves you.


Sometimes this is done orally, other times the patient is asked to write down, draw or paint the alternate ending to their nightmares., Envision a happy, peaceful place - like a tropical beach or a secluded mountain top. You can make one up, or base it on somewhere real. No matter what or where it is, just make sure it's calm and relaxing. In addition to just envisioning the scenery, try to imagine the sounds, the smells and the overall atmosphere.

, As you drift off to sleep, try to think happy thoughts. They could be anything you like - try imagining yourself as a superhero saving the world, as a famous actor or actress or heading off on your dream holiday. It can also help to focus on your goals and envision yourself achieving them - getting that dream job, hitting your ideal weight or finding your true love.

, Find someone who you trust, and explain your dreams. Also explain to them why they scare you. Just letting your feelings out can make things better. You can also keep track of your dreams in a dream journal, but be aware that sometimes it's more effective to talk to an actual person who you know is listening.

, See if you can manipulate your nightmare by making certain things happen and altering the outcome to make it less frightening or upsetting. This ability comes to some people faster than others, so don't be frustrated if you can't manage it at first.

, Nightmares can also be caused by stress, such as wondering if you will get a job or not. Let go of your worries, and begin having happy dreams again. You can relax by either meditating, or having a nice day at the beach. Just make sure it's a quiet area where you can relax and chill out.

Plan to get a good night's sleep.,
Put a pad and pen or pencil within easy reach of your bed.,
Keep your alarm close to your bed.,
Don't eat, drink alcohol or take medication right before bed.,
Calm your mind and body before bedtime.,
Make a conscious decision to remember your dreams.,
Think about a major problem or emotional concern or read right before you fall asleep.",How to Remember Dreams1," We have more facility to remember the dreams which occur when our bodies are in the sleeping stage known as REM, which stands for Rapid Eye Movement. The body is at rest, but the mind is active with dreams. If you don't get enough sleep at night, or your sleep is interrupted a lot, you get less REM sleep, and fewer dreams. Try going to bed every night at the same time, and waking up at the same time every morning, to make sure you're getting the right kind of rest.


Most people need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep every night to achieve the right amount of rest. People who sleep less than six hours have a hard time remembering dreams, because longer, more vivid dreams take place later in the sleeping cycle.
Create a restful sleeping environment. Eliminate noises and distractions that might be preventing you from falling into a deeper sleep. Wear earplugs if necessary, and make sure you have heavy curtains that block out light from outside.;
, It’s best if it just has plain paper with no designs or other distractions. Use this pad only for recording your dreams. Before you go to sleep, make sure it is open to the next page on which you can write so you don’t have to search for a blank page when you wake up.


Always put the pen in the same spot so that you don't have to search for that, either. (You can write down where you put your pen or other things before you go to sleep so you can find them later.)
An alternative to writing your dreams is to keep a tape recorder near your bed or under your pillow so that you can verbally recount what happened in your dream.

, If you have to get out of bed to turn it off, you will be more likely to forget what you were dreaming about. Set your alarm to go off after you've gotten an adequate amount of sleep. Try not to use a radio alarm clock, since the ads and chatter on the morning show will be distracting.


If you can wake up without an alarm clock, you won’t have to worry about turning it off.
If possible, try using a gentler way of waking up. Ask someone to wake you gently and without talking to you, or hook up a timer to the lights in your room. Many people find that they are able to better recall dreams if they don’t use an alarm clock.
Place a post-it note on the alarm clock, with the words ""What did you dream?"" or similar in large letters, so that it's the first thing you see when you open your eyes (and turn the alarm clock off).


, The chemicals in these items can affect your brain's ability to remember dreams. Try not to ingest anything for at least a few hours before going to bed, so that nothing interferes with your memory or your sleep patterns.

, Is your brain typically buzzing before bed? Having a lot of stressful thoughts in your head can make it harder to remember your dreams, which requires deep focus. Before you go to bed, let your mind relax and be free of heavy thoughts. Let it drift calmly into sleep.


Avoid taking your phone or laptop into bed with you. Emailing and checking texts right before bed doesn't give your mind the time it needs to clear.
Try meditating, or using the classic counting sheep technique, to free up your mind.

, You’ve got a better chance of remembering your dreams if you really want to remember them. Assuming you do want to, tell yourself that you’re going to remember your dreams and conscientiously follow the steps to make your desire to remember your dreams come true. , Think deeply about the situation without pressing for solutions or coming to conclusions. Just thinking about the problem opens the door, in a sense, to more vividly remembered dreams, and the dreams may even offer more insights regarding the problem at hand. "

Keep a dream journal.,
Use reality checks frequently.,
Repeat ""I will be aware that I'm dreaming"" each time you fall asleep.,
Learn to recognize your personal dream signs.,
Drift back to sleep when awakened from a dream.,
Consider purchasing a light alarm.",How to Lucid Dream1," Keep it close by your bed at night, and write down your dream immediately after waking, or the emotions and sensations you experience right when you wake up. This will train you to remember more of your dreams, which is important for lucid dreaming.Plus, there's not much point in controlling your dreams if you forget the experience before the morning.


Alternatively, keep a recording device by your bed.
You might remember more of your dream if you stay still for a few minutes concentrating on the memory before you start writing.;
, Every few hours during the day, ask yourself ""Am I dreaming?"" and perform one of the following reality checks. With enough practice, you'll start following the habit in your dreams as well, cluing you into the fact that you're dreaming.


Read a page of text or the time on a clock, look away, then look back again. In dreams, the text or time will be blurry or nonsensical, or will be different each time you look.Pinch your nose, close your mouth and test whether you can still breathe.
Simply look at your hands and feet. These are often distorted in dreams when you inspect them closely.

, Each night as you fall asleep, repeat to yourself ""I will know I'm dreaming"" or a similar phrase until you drift out of consciousness. This technique is known as Mnemonic Induction to Lucid Dreaming, or MILD.Mnemonic induction just means ""using memory aids,"" or in this case using a rote phrase to turn the awareness of your dreaming into an automatic habit.


Some people like to combine this step with a reality check by staring at their hands for a few minutes before they go to sleep.

, Read through your journal regularly and look for recurring ""dream signs."" These are recurring situations or events that you may notice in your dreams. Become familiar with these, and you may recognize them while you dream, and therefore notice that you're dreaming.


You probably know some of these already. Common dream events include losing your teeth, being chased by something large, or going into public without clothes on.

, When you wake up and remember your dream, write it down in your dream journal, then close your eyes and focus on the dream. Imagine that you were in the dream, noticed a dream sign or reality check, and realized it was a dream. Hold on to this thought as you drift back to sleep, and you may enter a lucid dream.Note that most lucid dreams occur while the person is fully asleep, usually because he notices a bizarre event and realizes he's in a dream. This is just an alternate trigger that starts off about 25% of lucid dreams., Go online and purchase a light-based, instead of a sound-based alarm, or even a specialized ""DreamLight"" designed to induce lucid dreaming. Set it for 4.5, 6, or 7 hours after you fall asleep, or set it to go off every hour if possible. While sound, touch, or other stimuli during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep can also make a dreamer aware of the fact he's dreaming, one study shows that light cues are most effective.You don't want to actually wake yourself up (unless you try the Wake Back to Bed method below). Keep the light alarm more than arm's reach away from your bed, and/or cover it with a sheet to dim the light.

Understand the purpose of your daydreaming.,
Recognize patterns in daydreaming.,
Identify the negative consequences.",How to Keep From Excessively Daydreaming1," Knowing why you tend to daydream is crucial in learning how to change it. If you don't know why something is occurring (what the actual problem is) you may have more difficulty coming to a solution. Sometimes individuals daydream as a way to avoid stress or other painful feelings.This imaginary world allows them to escape and avoid dealing with negative emotional states. Daydreaming can also be used as a way to self-soothe by imagining your wishes fulfilled.In addition, fantasizing can be linked to a need to forget certain information (trauma, painful situations, etc). Daydreaming can actually result in forgetting previously learned information or memories.Make a list of the types of daydreams you have, and what you think the function of this fantasy is. For example, you might identify that you frequently daydream about conversations with friends, which helps you predict what might happen and practice how to respond. Another example is if you have daydreams about buying a home, this may help you think of a brighter day and have hope for the future.
Ask yourself, “what is the purpose of my daydreaming in general?” Do you daydream to escape, distract, make yourself feel better, or pass the time?;
, Understanding the patterns in fantasies you have may assist you in developing a skilled way to reduce each type of fantasy.Do you daydream at school mostly, or at work? Are there certain situations that trigger your daydreaming behavior?


Recognize how often you daydream. Set your alarm for one hour. Keep a tally of how many times you drifted off into a daydream for that hour. For example, the moment you notice you are daydreaming, write a tally mark on a piece of paper, and so on. This will increase your awareness of how much you actually daydream. Sometimes it may take you a few minutes to realize that you were in a daydream and that is okay, just tally each time you notice that you were drifting off.

, If your daydreaming results in difficulties in daily life such as disruption in work or school, interpersonal relationships, or personal obligations, then your daydreaming may be excessive and harmful. Unfortunately, a wandering mind can cause one to feel unhappy.List the negative consequences associated with your rich fantasy life. This list could include things like: less time spent with family or friends, falling behind in school due to not being able to stay focused, not being able to get all work done due to being distracted by daydreams, and friends and family feeling like I am not listening to them because I am daydreaming.

Find a suitable journal.There are some pre-made dream journals out there but they are not necessary and in many ways, it's a lot more fun and creative to make your own.,
Make physical space for your dream journal.A dream journal is best written upon waking up, so the best place for keeping it is next to your bedside.,
Write in the date for the next entry after finishing an entry.,
Arrange the journal appropriately for recording the dream.,
Dream.,
Write down your dreams.,
Write freely.,
Learn when to stop.,
Name each dream.,
Review your progress.,
Begin interpreting.,
Personalize your dream journal.,
Travel with your dream journal.",How to Keep a Dream Journal," The types of things that are helpful to bear in mind when choosing a suitable journal include:


Length: Are you planning on recording your dreams for a year journal, or a shorter or longer amount of time? Think about how detailed you want your entries to be each night; this plus the length of time you aim to record your dreams for will indicate the length of journal that you need.
Ability to move the pages around: If you want to be able to sort pages into themes (for example, ""Recurrent Dreams"", ""Dreams about dogs""), etc., then it might be helpful to use a looseleaf notebook that lets you reshuffle the pages easily. Use a quality binder to keep such a looseleaf journal intact.

Jottings: The ability to add in jottings that you've written down elsewhere can also be important. Make sure that the journal has space for adding in scraps of paper, etc.
Don't forget to get a suitable marker. If you want to write in different colors for specific themes or recurrent interpretations, keep this in mind when purchasing the markers.
Consider finding a tin, basket, or other storage item for your dream journal and markers. This allows you to keep all the things needed sitting neatly and ready for use at any time.
Consider using a travel cover or protective case for your journal if you travel a lot and want to take your dream journal with you wherever you go.;
, The problem with rummaging for something to write on is that you're likely to forget your dream in the meantime, so make sure you can easily reach your dream journal!


If you have it in a container like a tin or a basket, it can be easily moved about and into a drawer or cupboard space when cleaning or to keep away from prying eyes.
Another good idea is to keep a book reading light by your bedside. If you wake up in the middle of the night and feel compelled to write down a dream, an easily accessible light will enable you to do this before forgetting the dream.
If you prefer speaking into a recordable MP3 player, be sure to have it handy and to keep the dream journal files in good order, and to transfer them regularly to a back-up. It doesn't hurt to keep around some spare batteries, too, in case you forget to turn off your MP3 player during the night and you need to make a new entry in a hurry.

, That way, you don't have to spend time worrying about the date when you first wake up and can just get down to writing the dream. Some dream journal writers like to write the next day's date in after the journal entry for that morning is completed, others prefer to write it in the night before as a ""readying ritual"" of sorts.


If you do write in the date the night before, you might also like to note down how you're feeling. The feelings that you are experiencing may have an important influence on the dreams you experience during the night, so keeping a quick note of these can lead to insight later on. It can be especially helpful as a mood reminder for those jolting ""a-ha!"" or ""pull-the-rug-from-under you"" type dreams which can sometimes feel as if they appeared out of the blue.

, There is no right or wrong way to prepare the dream journal or to record in it but you can help yourself by making the linkages between dream and interpretation a little easier to spot.


Column method: If you draw a column down the middle of each journal page, this allows you to write down the dream on one side of the page, and then to write the possible interpretations down on the other side of the page, directly opposite each part of the dream being interpreted.
Write then follow up: If you don't like cramming things into columns, simply follow a process of writing down the dream first, then following up with the interpretation under the dream write-up. After all, writing down the dream is the most time sensitive part and should be given plenty of space; interpreting the dream later on is less urgent.

, Use your usual method for falling asleep and dreaming. You might find it helps to remind yourself that you expect to be writing up your dreams in the morning, so that you have a focus in your subconscious on the importance of remembering your dreams.


See wikiHow's many dream articles for ideas on having, controlling, and influencing your dreaming.
It's a good idea to use a beeping or ringing alarm rather than a radio or music alarm. The talking or singing might distract you from remembering the contents of your dream. If you're fine with waking up without an alarm, that's even better and a lot more peaceful.

, Upon awakening, begin recording your dreams. If you can, hold off on visiting the bathroom until the dreams are recorded because any interruption between waking and recording can lose the dream, or its principal points and edginess. With more experience and practice, you may find this isn't such a problem and recall becomes easier but for the beginner, the fewer distractions the better.Record everything that you can remember. At first it can be difficult to work out what to write down and to distinguish thoughts that may be creeping into your awoken mind from memories about your dreams. With practice though, you'll soon be able to recall the things that the dream has told you. Include characters, symbols, colors, textures, feelings, actions (such as flying or swimming), interactions with other beings, shapes, and anything else that the dream raised.Think of some adjectives to describe the most vivid and pressing images and feelings that the dream brings about in you. For example, if you dreamed about a house on fire, you might write: ""terrifying, exciting, and red hot burning house"", with your feelings being ""afraid, panicking, curious"".
Some dream journal writers like to draw images or use different colors to express different emotions or themes in a dream. (Colors themselves can be an important part of dream interpretation.), Don't try to form a narrative as you are jotting down the contents of your dream. Just focus on getting down all the information you can recall as quickly as possible before the details of your dream fade from memory. You can deal with forming a narrative, and interpreting your dream, later.

, The dream journal isn't a marathon and few people have all morning to lie around writing in a journal. The best approach is to go with the dream or two that really seems most powerful or enduring for you. After the first dream or two, it's likely you'll be getting hazier in your recollection anyway, and it's best to write down the most vivid recollections above all because they're likely to be the ones with the most resonance and meaning for you.

, It's a good habit to get into naming your dreams. In reducing each dream to a title, try to capture the main feeling or theme behind it. It's an easy way for you to find the dream again for future reference and it's also a neat way of summarizing your general reaction to the dream.

, Initially, it might be difficult to remember enough of a dream to write more than a few lines. Persevere because with practice, it becomes easier to remember more and more elements of the dream until it becomes a habit. Therefore it's important to persist with writing in your dream journal every morning even if you think you had a bland or uneventful dream. Sometimes those dreams are telling in themselves and sometimes in writing them down, you realize that they weren't so pointless after all., If you don't wish to start interpreting at the beginning, that's fine. Just getting used to recording dreams is a new learning curve and getting the dreams down initially is the important part. You can always return later and record the interpretation, provided you've added some key feeling words with the dream. In time, it's a good idea to start interpreting the dream using dream interpretation knowledge you've learned from books, online sites, and your own intuition. Some things will be more obvious than others, but give it a good go.Sometimes the meaning of a dream might not become clear until you've realized it's recurring and that there is something happening in your life that you might need to pay closer attention to. Indeed, the more important messages tend to repeat as a way of getting through to you.
Read How to interpret your dreams for more information on how to interpret dreams.

, Ultimately how you use and manage your dream journal is a personal thing and it's up to you to make of it what you will. If you find that any of the suggestions offered here aren't working for you but other ways do, by all means incorporate your ways into keeping the dream journal. Use whatever makes most sense and works best for you., Keep your dream journal with you when you travel or take a vacation. If you don't want to take your main journal for fear of losing it, compile a lightweight travel version that can be inserted into the other journal when you return home. Or, keep electronic notes when away; whatever works for you. What is important is to keep the process going, especially since travel can spark completely different kinds of dreams and awaken new insights into yourself, something you certainly don't want to miss!


Travel or change of location can also bring about memories of dreams you've already had, filling in the gaps so to speak. Use this opportunity to write them down and add to previous dreams.

Concentrate on recalling your dream as soon as you wake up.,
Record your dream in your dream journal.,
Increase the number of dreams you can remember by waking up more often in the night.",How to Remember Dreams2," Typically you can remember only the last dream you had before waking. Don’t move and don’t do anything. Stay in the same position as the one in which you awoke and try to remember as much about your dream as possible before you think about anything else. Think it through from start to finish.


While you're remembering, focus your gaze on the first object you see as you open your eyes. Look at the object; focus on it. That object will most often take the vague recollection of your dream to a place mark in memory where it is easier to recall details. A doorknob, a light bulb, or a nail in the wall, for example, will help you to settle into memories of what you had experienced while sleeping.


, Jot down as much as possible about your dream, starting with a basic sketch that includes such things as the location of the dream, the basic plot, the characters, the overall emotion of the dream (i.e. were you scared or happy in the dream?), and any prominent images you can recall.


If you can remember any dialogue, you may want to write it down first, as words in dreams are easily forgotten. Record everything you can, even if you can only remember one image. As you get the basics down, more of the dream may come to you.
If you can’t remember anything about your dream, write down the first thing that comes into your mind upon waking. It may be related to the dream in some way, and it might trigger recollections. Also write down how you’re feeling when you wake up. The emotions you experience in a dream typically remain, at least for a brief period, when you awake, so if you wake up anxious or elated, ask yourself why.


, We have several REM cycles in the night, and they get longer and longer toward morning. If you only record the last dream you had before you get up in the morning, there are more dreams you might not be remembering. It’s always tempting to go right back to sleep when you wake up in the middle of the night, but take the opportunity to remember what you were dreaming before you do—in all likelihood you will not remember it in the morning.


Since you usually only remember the last dream you had, you can remember more dreams by waking up several times during the night. We go through a complete sleep cycle approximately every 90 minutes, so you may find it productive to set your alarm to wake you at some multiple of 90 minutes (such as 4.5, 6, or 7.5 hours) after you expect to go to sleep. Dreams in the later half of the night are typically longer than those you dream soon after going to sleep, so you probably want to wait until at least the 4.5 hour mark to intentionally wake yourself.
This is only recommended for people who get adequate sleep and who can fall back asleep easily. Otherwise, skip this step.

"
"
Keep a notepad or voice recorder with you throughout the day.,
Go back to your bed and lie down.,
Practice again the next night.,
Notice patterns.",How to Remember Dreams3," Often something you see or hear later in the day will trigger a memory of a dream from the night before. Note these recollections without delay, and think about them to see if you can remember how they fit into the rest of the dream. It also helps to continually think about your dreams throughout the day.

, Sometimes the memory can be jogged when you assume the same physical position you had while dreaming. Try to put your head in the same place on the pillow, arrange your body the same way, and close your eyes. If the dream comes into your head, think it through before getting up to write it down.


It might help to open your eyes and look at the object you first saw when you woke up.
Try creating the same atmosphere in the room - close the curtains, turn off the lights, and eliminate noise.

, Remembering your dreams takes effort and practice. The more you become conscious of your dreams, the more likely you are to remember them. Get into the habit of committing to remembering your dreams and night and writing them down first thing when you wake up. The process will become easier over time.

, Eventually you'll figure out what factors help you remember your dreams. Try to notice patterns pertaining to the time you go to bed and wake up in the morning, the temperature of the room, what you ate for dinner. Do any of these variables seem to influence your ability to remember your dreams?

Travel through time.",How to Have the Dreams You Want," A sleep study conducted in 2011 for the journal Sleep and Biological Rhythms concluded that university students who stayed up later tended to have more unpleasant dreams than those who hit the sack earlier. If you want your dreams to be more pleasant, then try going to bed at least an hour earlier every night and see if that has a positive impact on your dreams.One potential explanation for this finding is that the stress hormone cortisol is released in the early morning, a time in which the night-owls were likely in REM (Rapid Eye Movement), or dream, sleep.;
, Nightmares can be triggered by a variety of things, including late-night snacking, alcohol, caffeine, or cigarettes.If you have persistent nightmares, then consider cutting out these substances, and don't eat for two to three hours before you go to sleep. This will give you enough time to digest your food and will lead to a more restful sleep.


If you're serious about having deeper and more pleasant dreams, then you should avoid the caffeine after about noon. You may feel that you need the extra energy, but it'll make it harder for you to fall asleep.
Though you may think that a glass of wine before bed will help you fall asleep, it will actually lead you to have a less restful sleep. And if your sleep is lest restful and you want to actually control your dreams, then this will make it harder to do.

, Oftentimes, negative dreams are a reflection of the stress or anxiety we are experiencing in our everyday lives.Try not to dwell on these things while you are laying in bed trying to fall asleep. Instead, take a moment to clear your head and think of positive things. The more you focus on having a less stressful outer life, the calmer your inner life and your dreams will be.


Getting regular exercise can help you ease stress levels, have better dreams, and get to sleep faster.Don't exercise too close to bedtime, however, as this can keep you up.

, It's important to ease into sleep and to have a relaxation routine, such as drinking herbal tea or reading a book, before you fall asleep so that your dreams are less likely to be scary or disturbing. Find whatever works best for helping you fall asleep and stick to the pattern you have developed. Try to push any stressful or painful thoughts from your mind as you ease into sleep.


Avoid watching violent, scary, or otherwise stressful movies and television shows before going to bed, as these can cause nightmares.If you want a more restful sleep, turn off all visual stimuli at least half an hour to an hour before bed. That means no phones, no TV, no computer, and nothing else that will make it harder for you to turn your mind off and to have a more restful sleep.

, Scientists conducted a dream study in which women were exposed to the scent of roses throughout the night for at least 30 nights, and reported having more pleasant dreams than usual.It is believed that the scent elicits positive emotions, which in turn make dreams more pleasant.


You can also use rose-scented oils, body lotions, or candles. Be sure to blow out the candles before going to sleep, however, to prevent fires.

, Dreams occur during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a phase of the sleep cycle.If you are not sleeping enough, or frequently wake up throughout the night, your REM cycles may be getting interrupted. You need to make sure to get between 7-9 hours of sleep on a regular basis and to go to bed around the same time every night so your mind and body know what to expect.

, Many people believe that learning how to notice and remember your dreams is the first step to achieving lucid dreams.Before you go to bed, remind yourself that you plan on waking up and fully recalling your dreams. This will eventually train your subconscious to pay better attention to your dreams. Here are some ways to better remember your dreams:


Upon waking up, ask yourself what you dreamt. Don't get out of bed immediately, or it'll be harder to remember what happened. Instead, stay in bed and focus on the details of the dreams.Part of the reason people ""forget"" their dreams is because they wake up and immediately begin thinking about other things. Get in the habit of asking yourself this question every single morning.
Write down your dreams. Do this immediately after you wake up, and keep a journal and pen at your bedside so that you can quickly write down your dreams before you forget them. This will also help you notice your dream patterns over time., Reality checks are tests that you can perform, both while dreaming and while awake, that help you differentiate between the real world and the dream world. Successfully performing a reality check while asleep can help you trigger a lucid dream, as your dream-self becomes aware of its state. Try the following reality check tests:Try to fly. Obviously, this will only work in a dream. Look at your reflection in the mirror. If your reflection is distorted, blurry, or not there, then you are probably dreaming.Try to read a clock. The image will be too blurry to read in a dream. Flick the light switches on and off. Light switches do not work in the dream world. Also, see if you can turn the lights on and off with your mind. If you can, then you know you're dreaming.
Look at your hands. Check to see if they look normal from close-up. If you're dreaming, then you might have less or more fingers than normal.
Try using an electronic device. Computers and telephones do not work properly in dreams.
Look in a mirror. See if you look different.
See if you can ""breathe"" while closing your mouth and nose. If you can, then you're dreaming.
Try to put an item, such as a pencil, through your hand, (the palm). If you are dreaming, the pencil will either go through inexplicably or hang in the air around your hand. If you aren't you'll get a graphite mark on your hand.

, As you get in the habit of recording your dreams, start looking for signs that you're really dreaming. It could be a recurring image, like an island you have never seen before in real life, or a recurring event, such as losing your teeth or getting so dizzy you can't move. Look for patterns that let you know that you're really dreaming and then write these down. Knowing these signs can help you be more aware of the fact that you're dreaming because you'll be able to recognize them more easily.


Once you recognize one of the dream signs in your dream, you can tell yourself that you are, in fact, dreaming.

, One psychologist believes that video games familiarize people with operating in an alternating reality and viewing oneself from outside one's own body, skills that translate into the dream world.Her research concluded that people who played video games were more likely to experience lucid dreams, and were better at controlling them.Don't play violent video games before going to bed, as these can provoke nightmares. Make sure you stop playing them at least an hour before bed if you want to try this technique.

, Melatonin is a hormone that is commonly found in plants, animals, and microbes. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant and has also been shown to boost REM sleep and to make dreams more vivid. Others also say that melatonin can help people fall asleep faster. If you want to be able to dream more vividly, fall asleep more deeply, and therefore, to have more control of your dreams, then you should eat some of the following melatonin-rich foods:Cherries
Oats
Almonds
Sunflower seeds
Flax seeds
Radishes
Rice
Tomatoes
Bananas
White mustard
Black mustard

, As you go about your day, whether you're sitting in class or checking the mail, make a habit of asking yourself, ""Am I dreaming?"" If you do this regularly, then it'll make it more likely for you to ask yourself if you're dreaming when you're actually having a dream. And if you do this, then you'll be able to realize that you are dreaming and to take control of your dreams, choosing whatever you want to happen.


Asking yourself whether you're dreaming or not can heighten your alertness, which will also make you more likely to lucid dream.

, Being able to lucid dream requires that you be fully self-aware and undistracted by thoughts that relate to your waking life. While you are laying in bed trying to fall asleep, clear your head of distracting thoughts, and focus all of your attention on the fact that you are falling asleep and about to enter a dream state.


Meditation will also help you clear your mind of all of the negativity that will keep you from having a restful sleep.

, Before you go to bed, decide what you want to dream about.Paint a vivid image of your surroundings, and be sure to include details like sights, sounds, and smells. Put yourself in the scene, and try moving around within it.


Pay attention to the sensations of breathing and walking around in this dreamscape. Though you are not yet dreaming, tell yourself ""I'm in a dream."" Continue this visualization technique until you have fallen asleep.
Choose your ideal location for optimal results.

, Leave a photo, a symbol, or even a blank piece of paper at your bedside before you fall into sleep. Take something that represents the thing you want to dream about and leave it out before you go to bed so that it can help you transition into the dream you want to have. If you want to dream about a certain person, have that person's picture out near you. If you're an artist who is struggling to find a subject, leave a blank canvas at your bedside.


Taking this measure can prime you to dream about the things you want to dream about because it will plant the kernel of these things in your mind before you go to sleep.

, As you lie in bed and get ready for sleep, tell yourself something as simple as, ""Tonight, when I dream, I want to realize I'm dreaming."" Repeat this to yourself a few times and really focus on making it happen. This will help you get in the mindset you need to be in to recognize that you're dreaming.

, If you really want to control your dreams, then you should sleep in complete darkness, or as close to complete darkness as you can. Sleeping in darkness keeps your melatonin levels high and promotes better dreaming and better dream recall. Ideally, there should be no difference between the darkness you see when you open your eyes in bed and when you close them. Avoid any dim lights, windows that cast a lot of light, or other elements that will keep you from being in the darkest environment possible., Stephen LaBerge of Stanford University, who founded the Lucidity Institute, created a technique known as MILD (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams) which has been called one of the most effective techniques for inducing lucid dreaming. Here is what you have to do:When you go to bed at night, tell yourself that you will remember your dreams.
Focus on realizing when you're dreaming, and also on remembering that it is a dream.
Imagine what you want to do during that dream, whether it's flying or dancing.
Repeat the last two steps of realizing when you're dreaming and reentering a dream until you actually fall asleep.
Continue using this technique until you are able to make yourself have lucid dreams.

, Though it can be difficult to control your dreams and make your nightmares go away, one thing you can try is to visualize an alternate ending to the nightmare. If you always dream about a scary man in your home, imagine yourself warding him off, or imagine him just leaving on his own. Whatever the scary dream may be, find a way to imagine it so that you come out as a victor and that the nightmare goes away.If you think about this intensely enough, write it down, and even say it aloud, then you may be able to reprogram the way your mind approaches the dream.

, Once you've done a reality check and realize that you really are dreaming, try to stay calm and not get too excited about the fact that you're dreaming. If you do this, then it's likely that you'll wake up. Instead, stay calm and immersed in the world of your dreams, and start to control small things before you build up toward something more elaborate.


You can start carefully trying to change the scenery or just to move through the space of your dream. You can start to touch things, and attempt to make small objects appear or disappear.

, Once you're comfortably lucid dreaming and feel like you have a fair amount of control over your dreams, you can start to aim a bit higher when you try to control your dreams. You can make yourself fly, summon people, change the scenery completely, trying to return to a place from your childhood or even to travel through time. As you get more and more used to lucid dreaming, you'll be able to have the dreams you want more regularly.


When you wake up, remember to record the dream. Mark the point at which you realized you were lucid dreaming, and write down all of the things you were and were not able to do. If there's something you are never able to do when you're lucid dreaming, such as flying, then ask yourself what's holding you back.

, Once you're dreaming and have recognized that you're in a dream, you should tell yourself that you're dreaming every so often. If you don't do this, then you may forget that you are actually dreaming, and you won't feel as in control of everything that is happening. If you keep reminding yourself that you are dreaming, then you will feel more capable of changing and controlling your dream situation.

, One thing you can try to do when you're lucid dreaming is to fly. You may not be able to fly at first, but you can build yourself up to get there. You can tell yourself, ""Okay, now I'm going to fly,"" to make yourself get into the mindset of being ready to fly. You can start hopping around, jumping up and down, and moving your body in an upwards motion before you fully fly. Once you're more comfortable doing this, you'll be able to start hovering above the ground until you're flying.


As you're flying, don't be down on yourself or doubt what is possible. If you're filled with doubt, then you won't be able to truly fly. If you find yourself lowering, try taking a big hop or a jump and then take off again.

, You may also want to summon an object or something you really want to play with or hold in your hand. If you want to do this, then you have to be creative about how it can be possible. Maybe you want a delicious cake. Well, then first you should imagine that you're in a kitchen or a restaurant so that the cake can be brought out. If you're just thinking of the cake too hard, then it may not come to you, but if you create an environment that will make the cake more likely, then it will be in your hands.

, You can also change the scenery in your dream if you try hard enough. Once you know you're dreaming, you can try to imagine opening a door that will lead you to your dream place, or you can slowly add parts of the scene to your scenario until you have the scenery you want. If you're trying to remember a childhood home, start by summoning your favorite tree in the backyard, then the back porch, then your back door, and so on, until you have created the world you want.It can help to have an image or a photo of the scenery you're looking for at your bedside before you go to bed. Make sure it's one of the last things you look at, so your mind is more ready for the adventure.

, Some people are able to travel through time in their dreams. You can imagine yourself getting into your own personal time machine or opening a door to a new world. If one thing isn't working, try another. You can even tell yourself, ""Now I'm going to travel through time"" and focus on making it happen without forcing it too much. It helps if you go to bed while thinking of the time in your life that you'd like to return to."

Know when lucid dreams most commonly occur.,
Encourage your body to get more REM sleep.,
Wake up in the middle of the night.,
Stay awake for a while.,
Concentrate on the dream and fall asleep again.,
Try other concentration techniques.",How to Lucid Dream2," Lucid dreams, and vivid dreams in general, almost always occur during REM sleep, the deep sleep phase characterized by Rapid Eye Movement. The first REM phase typically occurs ninety minutes after you first fall asleep, with additional phases roughly every ninety minutes afterward. The goal of this method is to wake up during a REM phase, then fall back asleep and continue the dream aware that you are dreaming.


You won't be able to time your phases exactly unless you visit a sleep lab or have a very dedicated night owl watching your eyelids all night. More realistically, just keep repeating the method below until you catch yourself in REM phase.

, There are many ways to increase the amount of REM sleep you get, as described in the linked article. One of the most effective, and the one that causes REM sleep to appear at regular times, is to stick to a daily sleep schedule and to sleep long enough that you wake up well-rested.


This can be difficult to balance with the step below, which interrupts your sleep in the middle of the night. If you have trouble falling back asleep, try a different method instead, or limit your attempts to once or twice a week.

, Set one alarm to go off either 4.5, 6, or 7 hours after the time you fall asleep.You're more likely to be in REM sleep during these times, although it's difficult to predict in advance. The six or seven hour times are the most likely to work, because later REM phases last longer, and are more likely to contain vivid or lucid dreams., Write down your dream if you were having one, make yourself a snack, or just get up and walk around for a while. Your goal is to get your conscious mind active and alert, while your body is still full of sleep hormones.


One study shows that staying awake for somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes gives the highest chance of a lucid dream., Close your eyes and fall asleep again. If you remember the dream you were having, recall it and fall back asleep, imagining yourself continuing the dream. Even if this takes quite a while to happen, you've got a decent chance at a lucid dream. 

, If your mind wanders while trying to ""catch"" the dream, or if you don't remember the dream at all, instead try focusing on the movement of your fingers. Use a pattern of small movements, such as ""index finger up, middle finger down, middle finger up, index finger down."" Repeat this rhythmic movement until you fall asleep.

Meditate.,
Prolong a lucid dream as it starts to fade.,
Listen to binaural beats.,
Play video games.,
Consider taking galantamine.,
Consider the occasional vitamin B supplement.",How to Lucid Dream3," Before going to sleep, meditate in a quiet, dark room. Taking a meditation training course may give better results, but to start out, just pay attention to your breathing, or imagine ascending or descending stairs. The goal is to stop thinking and enter a quiet, comfortable state, and from there slip into a lucid dream.


Keep in mind that ""Wake Induced"" lucid dreams are rarer and more difficult than dreams that become lucid after you're already asleep.
There are many meditation guide videos online specifically designed to help you lucid dream.

, One common experience among first-time lucid dreamers is waking up due to the excitement of having a lucid dream! Usually, you'll get some warning before hand as the dream feels ""unstable"" or you begin to notice sensations from the real world. These techniques can help you keep the lucid dream going:Spin your dream body around or fall backward. Some people report that this helps, although the reason is unknown.
In the dream, rub your hands together. This can distract you from the sensations of your actual body.
Continue doing whatever you were doing before the dream became unstable, asserting that you are still in the dream. This is much less effective than the techniques above.

, If you send a different sound frequency to each ear, your brain will interpret the two sound waves' overlapping pattern as an audio beat even though no beat is included in the sound. This definitely changes the brain's electrical activity, but so far scientists are unsure whether this can actually stimulate lucid dreaming.There are many websites out there with collections of binaural beats, so it's easy to try it out if you can sleep with ear buds in. Most would-be lucid dreamers use beats that mimic Theta brain waves, which occur in REM sleep, but some swear by Gamma or Alpha beats instead, or a progression through several types.


Binaural beats can come with soothing background music, or just the beat itself.

, Gamers report a much higher rate of lucid dreaming than the general population.While more studies need to be done, it's possible even a couple hours a week could increase your chances of a lucid dream. The type of game played does not appear to make a difference., Galantamine, a drug synthesized from the snowdrop plant, may be the most effective drug for inducing lucid dreaming. Take 4 to 8 mg in the middle of the night for best results; taking it before bed can worsen sleep quality and cause unpleasant dreams.Due to this possibility and the unpleasant side effects listed below, galantamine is only recommended as an occasional supplement.


Talk to a doctor first if you have any medical issues. Galantamine can worsen existing conditions such as asthma or heart problems.
This drug also increases the chance of sleep paralysis, a harmless but often terrifying experience of being awake for several minutes without being able to move your muscles.

, Vitamin B5 or Vitamin B6 supplements can increase dream vividness, weirdness, and emotional intensity, which can lead to lucid dreaming.However, you may need to take a dose of 100 mg for this effect to be noticeable. This dose is much higher than recommended for daily intake, and if you take it regularly over a long period of time, it can lead to unwanted side effects.Use this only for a special lucid dreaming occasion, and at your own risk.


Check with your doctor first if you are taking any medications, or if you have a disorder involving bleeding, the stomach, the intestines, or the heart.
This drug sometimes causes people to wake up in the night, so it may be counterproductive if you're a light sleeper.

Enhance awareness.,
Keep a daydreaming log.,
Set guidelines and limits for your daydreams.,
Focus your daydream.,
Get up and move around.,
Reward yourself for being focused.,
Consider treatment.",How to Keep From Excessively Daydreaming2," You must first be aware of your daydreaming when it occurs in order to begin to change it. Once you have identified the purpose, patterns, and consequences of your daydreaming, it may be helpful to start noticing when you are daydreaming in the moment.Signs you may be daydreaming include: losing eye contact with someone during a conversation, having difficulty focusing on your current task, not remembering what was just said in a conversation, thinking thoughts unrelated to the current situation, and having imaginary conversations with people or imagining events occurring in your head.

, Once you have identified that you are daydreaming, stop immediately and write down what you were daydreaming about, as well as the time of day, situation or place you were in, and how long your mind was wandering.This will help you become aware of when you daydream and will help you understand the patterns of your behaviors better.


Question the utility of the daydream. Ask yourself, is this daydream helping me in some way?

, Certain types of daydreaming can lead to negative outcomes. For example, daydreaming about people whom you do not know very well can increase loneliness.However, imagining people who are close to us can increase feelings of connection and satisfaction with life in general. Choose boundaries that, when crossed, signal you to stop daydreaming. Some of them might include intimacy, spending large amounts of money, or extreme violence.
Sometimes when you are lost in your own dreams and it is wasting your time, just look at your watch. Keeping a watch is a reminder telling you that how precious it is for you make the most of this moment because it won't be back ever again!

, Mind-wandering can be used to self-reflect and work toward fulfilling personal goals.Imagery and visualization techniques are common in therapy, especially in the treatment of anxiety and depression. In using visualization techniques, you can focus your daydream on something that will be helpful and relaxing for you.


One example of an imagery exercise is to close your eyes and imagine yourself in a safe place.This place may be a beach, your bedroom, a church or any place that you may feel safe, secure, and relaxed. Imagine how it feels in this place. Notice the temperature, the air, how your body feels, and what other sensations and feelings you have. Imagine what is smells like and sounds like in your safe place. Are there other people in your safe place? What are you doing in your safe place? Stay in your safe place until you are fully relaxed and ready to open your eyes.
Online resources can help guide you through imagery techniques., Right when you notice you are daydreaming, get up and do something active. This serves as a way to get some of your physical energy out, which may in turn, help your mind to re-focus and reduce daydreaming.Try stretching. Reach for the sky as high as you can without feeling uncomfortable. Then spread your legs apart while standing and reach toward the ground (just as far as is comfortable for you).
You can do jumping jacks, run in place, or shake your arms. Try anything active that is safe and appropriate for the place and situation you are in.

, Every time you are able to complete a task without falling into the daydreaming trap, give yourself a reward. This idea is based on positive reinforcement, a component of operant conditioning, and research has indicated that it increases positive behaviors (such as sustained attention).It also gives you personal boundaries (that you will not do something fun until you complete your task), and something to look forward to (the reward).


Try giving yourself something you like such as a piece of candy or another snack.
You can even give yourself a 5 minute break from your work as a reward.Taking appropriate breaks actually increases productivity overall. Use this time to do something you enjoy such as playing a game or texting a friend.

, Excessive daydreaming can become a problem if it causes issues in your personal life such as difficulties in relationships, school, your ability to perform your job, or other daily activities. If this is the case, treatment can be a useful option.Contact a psychologist (PsyD, PhD), marriage and family therapist (MFT), or psychiatrist (MD).

Try mindfulness exercises.,
Use grounding techniques.,
Get enough sleep.,
Take a break.,
Involve both your body and mind.",How to Keep From Excessively Daydreaming3," If you are daydreaming, it means you are focusing on a fantasy or your own thoughts which are not necessarily related to what is currently going on around you. Mindfulness is about being present in the current moment.Try to eat a piece of fruit that you enjoy while focusing on how it feels, looks, and tastes.
Use resources online to learn about mindfulness and try mindfulness techniques., Grounding helps you detach from emotional pain; it is useful especially when dealing with difficult situations and emotions and can serve as a healthy and useful replacement to daydreaming or fantasizing. Grounding can be done in any situation and at any moment that you choose, and it helps to re-focus your mind. Once you do the grounding exercise, go back to your original duty or task. You may find that you are better able to focus after using a specific grounding technique.


Name some of the different objects in the room and their different uses.
You could name some color or animals that you can think of.
Remember not to spend too much time doing the grounding technique, or you are simply using it as another form of daydreaming. Limit yourself to about 1 minute, and then go back to what you were previously doing.

, A lack of sleep quality has been associated with increases in daydreaming.If you do not allow your mind to rest at night, it can become over-active during the day. Individuals with sleep issues also experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, and medical problems.Develop a sleep schedule (a bedtime and wake-time) and sleep at least 8 hours per night.
Try relaxation and breathing techniques to help you fall asleep at night.

, If you find your thoughts are distracting you, it may be helpful to take a break.Sometimes when we are distracted it is an indication that we have been working too hard. Taking breaks can actually increase productivity overall, especially on brainstorming tasks.Try going for a walk or a stroll down the street.
Do something you enjoy for a few minutes, eat a snack, listen to music, or watch something on television.

, If you're someone who begins to daydream when you are not particularly engaged, such as sitting idly, try doing something somewhat active. Fidgeting may actually help individuals with attention issues concentrate better.Grab a pillow, stuffed animal, or stress ball that you can fiddle with.
Some people find that listening to music while working on simple tasks helps them focus.It serves as a partial distraction for the mind, so it can focus on what is important.

"
"
Find new hobbies.,
Talk to a friend or family member.,
Plan less, do more.",How to Keep From Excessively Daydreaming4," Engage in fun activities that you can focus your attention on.


Do something that inspires you such as: hiking in a beautiful place, meditation, looking at art, etc.
Try exercise such as: biking, hiking, sports, dance, aerobics, and yoga.
Avoid activities that may increase daydreaming such as watch television excessively. Watching too much television could possibly lead to decreased creativity and increase daydreaming behaviors., Individuals with adequate social support tend to have higher mental health overall.We need social support to deal with any issue, including excessive mind-wandering or distraction.


Pick someone that you know very well and feel very comfortable with. Then, ask them if they'd be available to answer their phone and chat with you if you've become particularly engrossed in a daydream.
You can ask friends or family to alert you if they notice that you are daydreaming. This will help to keep you accountable and increase your awareness of your attention-span.

, Planning can be a form of daydreaming because you spend a lot of time thinking about a situation and not much time accomplishing anything. It's time stop dreaming and start doing!


Have a schedule and stick to it. If you find yourself daydreaming, get up and leave the situation or do something productive.
If you drift into a daydream, gently bring yourself back to what you were doing before your mind wandered. Try to be accepting and non-judgmental of yourself.

Don't worry about being uncomfortable.,
Share Your Gross In-Flight Meal.,
Display Your Personality.,
Take advantage of the lavatory line.",How to Make Friends During a Flight," Everyone is. Do you think it's weird to suddenly start yapping with the stranger next to you about nothing in particular? It's not! Chances are they are just as bored and fed up as you are, with the god-awful food, rogue baggage falling from the overheard bins, and last minute flight delays. An off the cuff remark on any of the aforementioned items is bound to get you, at the very least, a slight snicker or a sympathetic nod. And that's when you know it's time to make your friendship move...;
, Hey, what's that you have there, a little itty-bitty vacuum sealed cheesecake slice? At this moment, you'll remember you're lactose intolerant and politely offer it to the criminally attractive gentleman next to you. Few can resist the pleasures of a pretty smile and vacuum packed cheesecake. Next thing you know, you're talking about the best restaurants for lactose intolerant folks and how much you miss cheesecake. You exchange food for friendship. It's really that easy.

, In other words, bait them. The road to friendship is a two way street and you certainly shouldn't feel like you have to make the first move every time. But how do you get the other person to make a move? Simple, if you're traveling with a laptop, notebook, iPad, or well-known book, make sure to whip that baby out ASAP! When you have your device at your fingertips just start jotting down(or typing) things you have to do for work or places you want to see when you get to your destination. Write big/use large font and make those things sound incredible! If your jobs sucks, well here's your opportunity to start writing about those movie ideas that have been running around your head. Can you draw? You lucky devil you! Now is the time to break out that pencil and start sketching whatever comes to mind(bonus points if you can sketch the guy next to you). People love eavesdropping and spying on whatever their neighbor is doing. I'd give it a whole two minutes before the casual ""Oh, wow, I'm reading that book too, how do you like it?"" comes out. Or the ever popular, ""That's such a great sketch, are you an artist?"". Oh, the sweet sweet victory.

, Everyone has to use it. And whether you're flying two hours or twelve, there will always be a line; such is the way of the world. Lucky for you, that means more bumping into potential buddies! But what does one talk about on a bathroom line, you ask? Not the obvious, of course. Is someone on the line wearing those little fuzzy socks they give out to protect your feet from the frigid re-circulated air? Great, comment on how ridiculously cute they are! Ask ""Are they really that warm?"", followed by a warm playful chuckle. The conversation should unfold naturally.

Show up for your friends.",How to Make Friends Easily if You're a Teen," Math class might not be your favorite pastime, but it can be a great place to make friends. One of the benefits to being a teen is that you go to school with hundreds of potential friends. The people in your classes are going to be close to your age, and if nothing else, you’ll have that class in common. Start looking around the room to see if anyone in the class seems interesting or friendly.You could create a study group for a class. While you’re studying and sharing notes, you might find that you have more in common with people in the group.;
, Outside of school, you can look for people your age out in the community. Go out to places where teens often hang out (e.g. pool) or volunteer in the community. You could also get a job at popular hang out spots.For example, if you decide to work at the movie theater, you will probably meet quite a few people coming in and out to watch movies. An even better option might be to work as a lifeguard at a pool.

, Most schools provide a host of extracurricular activities for students. Take advantage of this friend making opportunity by choosing an activity that most interests you. Chances are that other teens in the same activity will have things in common with you.If you are interested in music, you might want to join a band or choir. If you like to run, try joining a track team. These groups will give you opportunities to make new friends.

, Outside of school, communities often have their own groups and events for teens. Take advantage of these gatherings to give yourself the opportunity to make friends that live near you. This is a particularly good way to make friends in the summer or during other school breaks.For example, if your neighborhood has something like community garden club, consider joining to make new friends.

, Your body language can send the message that you are open and ready to talk to someone. It can also send the message that you’d rather be left alone. If you are nervous and uncomfortable, you may accidentally be sending messages that suggest that you’d rather be left alone than talk to people. This will discourage people from approaching you.For example, sitting with your arms or legs crossed gives the impression that you are closed off to other people.
Smiling at people will signal that you notice them and are open to talking to them.

, Just like your body language is important, the other person’s body language can give you a hint as to how they are feeling. If they seem closed off, they may be having a bad day or not feel like talking. If they are smiling and enjoying themselves, you might have more luck approaching them. Considering body language can help you avoid being shut down when someone is having a rough day.For example, if someone is sitting off to themselves with their arms crossed in front of them, they may not be open to being approached.
If someone smiles at you, they may be interested in talking to you.

, Eye contact is important when you are trying to approach someone. If you look at them and they look away, they may be busy or not interested in talking. On the other hand, if they make eye contact with you, that is a good time to say something to them.For example, if you make brief eye contact with someone, reach your hand out and introduce yourself. Say something like “Hi, I’m Mike.”

, Most people enjoy being complimented. If you are having trouble approaching people to start conversations, try dropping a compliment on strangers as you walk by. There is no need to stop and try to initiate a conversation. You could say something like:I love those shoes!
Awesome hair!
That’s a sweet dog!

, If you want to engage someone in conversation, you will do well to put the ball in their court. When you ask someone a question, they generally answer you. This is especially true if the question follows a compliment or is relative to the situation.For example, you might say, “Awesome hair! Who cuts it?”

, You will often find yourself in social situations with people you don’t know. If you want to talk to one of them, you can start the conversation by commenting on the situation. After all, at the very least you have one thing in common - you are both in the same place.For example, you might say something like, “I didn’t expect there to be music here.”
You might also try asking a question like, “So, what brings you out tonight?”

, If you feel nervous to go up and talk to strangers, you’re not alone. You should know is that almost everyone feels the same hesitation. Just realizing that these insecurities are shared by other people can help you to work through them and find the courage to talk to someone new., To really make and keep friendships, you have to spend time with people. Once you’ve introduced yourself and become acquainted with someone, time has to be invested to turn that into a friendship. Make it a point to hang out regularly and talk often.For example, you could have a tradition that you and your friends go out to eat every Saturday.

, Friendships are a two-way street. If you want to keep your friends, you need to be an active listener. This means that you should maintain eye contact when someone is speaking, confirm to them that you are hearing them (e.g. a nodding occasionally), and avoid interrupting.For example, if your friend is telling you about something that happened after school yesterday, keep eye contact with them instead of checking your phone.

, Keeping good friends also means that your needs are met. In order for your friends to know what you need from them, you have to be assertive (not aggressive). This means clearly stating your stance on things (such as which movie to watch), but in a respectful way.For example, there is no need to call someone else’s movie stupid just because it isn’t the movie you chose.

, It is important that your friends feel close to you. Sharing memories and personal experiences will help you and your friends bond. Just do not share too much too quickly. You want to be sure that you can trust your friend, and that you don’t overwhelm them.For example, you might tell someone you’ve known for a long time about your family conflicts, but only tell someone you’ve known for a short time about a family vacation.

, Your friends are likely to confide in you as well. When they do, keep it to yourself. If you tell other people, you will betray your friend’s trust and they will not trust you as much in the future.The exception to this is when your friend tells you that they might hurt themselves or someone else. In that case, you should seek help for your friend.

, You and your friends will inevitably disagree on some things. When that happens, remember that they are your friend and that you respect them. Agree to disagree, but do not belittle your friends.For example, if you discover that your friend does not like the same music as you, just agree to disagree. Belittling their music or genre will just hurt your friendship.
If your friends like different things, it might be worthwhile to try them out. You might like them, too.

, One of the most important things a friend can do is show up when another friend is in need. If your friend needs someone to talk to, or help with something, you should try your best to be available. You should also expect the same treatment in return.For example, if a friend is going through a breakup and needs someone to talk to, be there for them.

It can be anything you want, from Zach to Frookipops, and since you're essentially creating this person, you can be as frivolous as your heart desires. A suggestion, however would be to make sure you can remember the name easily.;
, Are they mean, funny? Or nice and random? You decide!


Come up with a special power or characteristic for this person. It's what will make them fun. Give them flaws, but make sure their personality will make them side with you almost all the time.
Try taking a look at book characters for ideas. They can give you personality and novel ideas. Also, think about what you'd want in a friend, and then incorporate it! Just remember that they can be whatever you want. A human, a beast, a flying carpet, or a spirit, it doesn't really matter.

, Draw them, write a description, or just make a picture in your mind. Do they have black hair or pink? Are they wearing a dress or a tux? Be creative and make up a style!


If you have The Sims, or a Wii (the Mii Channel), you can create them on there. Or make them at South Park Studios website, or WeeWorld (WeeMee).

, For example, decide what school they go to. Do they go to your school in a special class for imaginary friends? Or do they go to the Secret Academy For Imaginary Friends? This is up to you. They don't have to go to school if you don't want them to.

, How do you and your friend talk when you're not with each other? Are you telepathic? Or do you write imaginary letters?

, You have a birthday, why not give your imaginary friend one too? Select a month, a day, and a year to decide when your friends birthday is. Don't forget to celebrate it too!

, Like a real person, your imaginary friend has some history, it gives the friend growth., If you like books, go to the library and read together. If you like video games, hook up your game console and start killing zombies! The possibilities are endless.


Have an adventure with your new friend. Go somewhere exotic (real or otherwise), somewhere that you've never been and share stories together of your findings. Write an imaginary diary about all the wonderful places you've been.

Hold a conversation! If you can't talk to him or her, you essentially won't be friends. An imaginary friend will never tell anyone your secrets or talk about you behind your back so tell them anything.

Be patient.",How to Make Friends As an Introvert," Groups and events such as book clubs, cooking classes, or lectures can be good be places to meet people and find things that interest you. The attendees here are good people to talk to because you already know that you share at least one common interest. Most importantly, it gives you something to talk about when you meet someone, rather than try to make small talk, something many introverts do not enjoy., New friends are very unlikely to just present themselves at your door, so you're going to need to find them. Social outings or places where there are other people to meet are a good way to start finding new friends. Look for social events and accept invitations; start saying ""Yes!"" even if it's hard or you feel more like staying at home.There are many organizations and groups out there for people looking to expand their social circle. It can be easier to talk to other people when you know they are there for the same reason you are.If your workplace or friends are having a social event, offer to help. It will give you something to do at a party beyond trying to meet people. If a conversation seems to be running too long, you can always excuse yourself to deal with something party-related.If you have a hard time bringing yourself to go to social events, try giving yourself an informal quota. Give yourself space to do things socially, while also carving out time for yourself. That way you don't have to feel guilty about going to events, or for turning down invitations., If you are out and about, and are willing to have people come and talk to you,let them know they are welcome. Making your body open and large will make you more approachable to others.Take up space where you are. Keep your head up, sit straight, or take long strides. This makes you appear confident, someone people will want to talk to.
Uncross your arms. Crossed arms is a classic ""don't talk to me"" position. If your arms are open, you will appear more welcoming to people who might want to talk to you.

, It's okay if this doesn't lead to a conversation; a simple greeting tells others that you are friendly. They may not always want to talk, but you've created someone who may want to talk more later., Starting a conversation by telling the other person something about yourself can be a good ice-breaker. It does not have to be especially personal or particularly revealing. A simple statement like ""I'm new here"" or ""It's my first time"" lets the other person know you want to talk to them, and lets them know something about you.

, This gives people an opportunity to answer the question freely, and suggests you are open to learning more about them. Many people love the opportunity to talk about themselves and what they think, and may respond by asking you back.


If you are attending an event, such as a lecture or a class, asking about the event is a good place to start. ""What did you think of the talk?"" can be effective, and it's an interest you already share.
If you are talking to an acquaintance, that is someone you know, but not particularly well, a vaguer question like ""How are you?"" would be appropriate.If you're talking to someone you've met before, try asking something personal, but not too personal, such as ""What are some things you like to do on the weekend?"" or ""Do you have some favorite places around town?""

, You want to improve your ability to interact with others. The only way to do that is the same way you improve any other skill: practice. You don't need to meet new people every day, but be willing to say hello and introduce yourself to people you don't know. Most conversations won't go anywhere, but that's fine. The goal is to get more comfortable in social settings for when you meet someone you do want to talk to.

One way to help practicing is to copy the social skills of people you like or admire. Having an example to work off of can give you some clues about what to do in social settings. Get a more extroverted friend to be your ""wingman."", Focus on the things that interest you, and you'll be able to find people who share those interests. Common interests are a good basis for friendship.

When talking to someone new, be careful about diving into controversial topics. There is nothing wrong with being interested in topics like politics or religion, but plunging right into them right away can put people off. This is unless, of course, you have joined a group of people with a common perspective on these issues., To make friends, you are going to need to put in a little effort. Call or text the other person, arrange to hang out somewhere outside of where you met. It's okay to be a little pushy. What seems like too much to you as an introvert might be just what the other person is looking for.

Making plans for later is a good way to stay in touch, especially if they are concrete. Even if it doesn't quite work out, it lets other people know you are open to meeting again, and may spur them on to other action.Be specific when making plans. For example, rather than saying ""We should hang out sometime,"" say ""Would you like to see the new Spielberg movie next Saturday afternoon?"" This makes it more likely that you'll follow through on your plans.

, If someone reaches out to you to communicate, return the call. You can wait a little bit before you get back to them, but not returning the call or message is good way to push out those who want to be friends.Refusing to communicate, through phone calls or other means, is not introversion. It could be shyness, or perhaps even depression, but those are not the same thing as introversion., Communicating doesn't have to mean phone calls. Introverts may not always enjoy speaking on the phone because context clues like body language are often missing, and there isn't as much control over the conversation. Text messaging, video chats, and even old-fashioned letter writing are all good ways to keep in touch. Just make sure you and the other person are in agreement about the best ways to communicate.

, Friendship is a process and takes some time. Allow for some early awkwardness, remembering that it will get easier if you push through it. Even if you aren't sure you're into it right away, fake it until you get past it.

Respect everyone’s journey through life.,
Treat each action individually.,
Accept that they are a mystery.,
Respect their individuality.",How to Like People1," In conversation, avoid fixating on what they happen to be saying at this moment. Whether you approve or disapprove of their comments, set your reaction aside for the time being. Keep in mind that everyone is moving along a path in life, and not permanently stuck where they happen to be right now. Embrace the fact that everyone changes.Ask follow-up questions to better understand where they are coming from instead of responding immediately to what they just said. For example: ""Why do you feel that way?"" or ""What are you basing your opinion on?""
Remember that even though you might not like where they are right now, they will be somewhere new tomorrow.;
, Refrain from immediately adding each little thing that you don’t like about someone to an ever-growing list entitled “Things I Don’t Like About This Person.” Instead, approach each moment as its own unique experience. Give them the chance to say and do things without immediately being judged for it based on past missteps.Apply this approach even when the same “bad” behavior appears to resurface again and again. Remember, even if someone is, say, consistently late in meeting you, the reasons may be different each time.
Be aware that focusing on a growing list of things you don’t like might lead you to make snap judgments that you wouldn’t otherwise make. For instance, say you thought they were a little rude to your waiter at the beginning of your meal. If you hold onto to that, you might think they are a jerk for only leaving a small tip at the end, even though the service really was kind of poor.

, Be prepared to never fully understand someone, even despite your best efforts. Bear in mind that you aren’t telepathic, and so you may never know why someone said this or said that. Don’t limit yourself to liking only those people you think you understand well. Open yourself to liking people even when they confound you.Unless they did something that is clearly wrong (like shooting someone else in the foot just because they didn’t bring them a beverage), always keep in mind that you don’t know the full story.Avoid judging people for their actions if you don’t know the full reason behind them. For example, if someone doesn’t call you when they said they would, don’t take it as a slight. Keep in mind that they may have lost their phone, been faced with an emergency, or any number of things.

, Whether they are your best friend, a stranger, or a nemesis, remember that everyone has flaws. More importantly, remember that the only person’s flaws that you can fix are your own. Accept that each person is their own person. Don’t give them the undue burden of living up to your expectations.Demanding that someone must change according to your liking may blind you to their positive traits.
For instance, fixating on someone’s refusal to be swayed by your own beliefs about, say, the justice system may frustrate you to the point that you begin to undervalue how dependable they are when you need their assistance.

"
"
Allow for differences in values.,
Appreciate their differences.,
See yourself from their eyes.",How to Like People2," Respect the fact that everyone grows up with different priorities. Recognize how your personal history has led you to develop your own unique set. Think of how this shapes your view of other people. Then consider how someone else’s personal history could lead them to adopt their own unique set of priorities. Understand that they aren’t any less likable just because they hold different values. For instance:A tragedy in your family might have impressed upon you the importance of maintaining strong ties. However, someone who grew up without any such tragedy might be more inclined to let family ties weaken over an issue that you consider minor.
On the other hand, you might consider something like skipping school a rite of passage because you never suffered from it, while someone else might think of it as a major mistake because of the serious consequences that they faced afterward.

, Remember: no one is perfect, including you. Instead of faulting people for not sharing your values, recognize how their own mindset can be a good thing, even if it seems contrary to yours. Appreciate the positive results that come from their unique approach toward life. For example:Your approach toward work might be to dive into it headfirst and stick with it until it is done, while your colleague or study buddy may have a more relaxed mindset. Instead of faulting them for being too eager to take a break, embrace the benefits of taking one. Appreciate how your partner has led you to an experience that you would have otherwise skipped on your own.
Say that you and Person B share very similar opinions. However, yours are shaped by your faith in your religion, while Person B, an atheist, has arrived at them on their own. Instead of faulting them for their lack of faith, appreciate how they have arrived at the same core values without any help from above.

, Don’t assume that your actions always make your line of reasoning absolutely clear for others to understand. Remember that people may be as equally puzzled by why you do certain things as you are by their own choices. Recognize when your conduct might confuse, offend, or alienate others. Then consider ways to compensate and build a better understanding between you. For instance:Say you are an introvert and quiet by nature. Person B, on the other hand, is very open and talkative. Although you wouldn’t be offended by someone simply nodding hello in the morning instead of starting a conversation, understand that Person B might. To compensate, meet them halfway. Compliment their appearance, comment on the weather, or offer any other small form of chitchat to put them at ease.
Now say the opposite: you are very talkative and Person B is very quiet. While you know that you are trying to start a conversation in order to be friendly, recognize that they might feel bullied into interacting. Again, meet them halfway. Say hello, ask how their weekend was, and then leave it up to them to continue talking or back out.

"
"
Take your time.,
Analyze yourself.,
Compare your own flaws.,
Take control of the conversation.",How to Like People3," Avoid being drawn into a heated exchange. Resist the urge to respond right away to every action or comment. Always give yourself a moment to reflect before proceeding.Not only will this give you an opportunity to compose yourself and reconsider potential missteps, but it may encourage the other person to do the same. For example:


Say you're dealing with a neighbor who throws lots of loud parties, and when you complain about the noise, they cite the family reunion you just held a month ago, even though that was the only loud gathering you've hosted all year. Instead of getting snippy right away, reflect on that. Acknowledge that it was a loud gathering. Show them that you are listening to what they have to say so they feel heard.

, Keep a careful watch over your own thoughts and reactions. Recognize when you react negatively to someone. Then investigate the reasons behind that reaction. Distinguish between offenses that can be objectively called “bad” and other offenses that really only offend you personally.For instance, an offense that could be objectively called bad would be physically harming someone else for no reason whatsoever.
On the other hand, an offense that only offends you would be disagreeing with your opinion about a TV show.

, Whenever someone says or does something you don’t like, take an honest look at yourself before judging them. Ask yourself if you are guilty of the same. Be aware that we often react the strongest to other people’s flaws when they happen to mirror what we don’t like about ourselves.When you find this to be the case, cut the other person even more slack. Don’t judge them too harshly for what might have been out of character for them just because you’re hypersensitive about your own shortcomings. For instance:


Say you've been having doubts about your new relationship, and your new boyfriend or girlfriend seems quite taken by someone else whom they just met, which makes you feel jealous. Maybe they really are smitten, but maybe their excitement is simply due to a shared interest that you personally don't share. Either way, recognize that your perspective might be distorted by your preexisting doubts before acting too rashly.

, If someone demonstrates that they definitely have qualities that you do not like, remember: everyone on Earth is going to have qualities you don’t like about them. Redirect the conversation to topics that make you more comfortable. Keep your focus on the other person’s positive qualities by steering them away from areas that make you think poorly of them.For example, if a conversation over politics is making you uncomfortable, make a joke like, “What is this? A Sunday morning talk show? Let’s change the channel to sports.”
If this person is someone whom you have to interact with again and again (like a sibling who is hard to get along with), set firmer rules. Simply say, “Let’s agree to not talk about this subject when we're together.”

Start off with talking to her a few days a week and then slowly add days over the next couple of weeks. Also, increase the amount of time that you spend together. Slowly add time to your phone conversations or face-to-face meetings., Once you find a subject that interests both of you, find more ways to bring that subject into your conversations. Research the subject so that you have new and interesting things to talk about., Most shy people are introverts, and introverts thrive by having alone time. If she asks to be alone, that does not mean that she is mad at you. Give her the space that she needs so that she feel rejuvenated and more able to socialize."

One-on-one dates that don’t require a lot of socialization are where they will feel most comfortable. You can also spend the one-on-one time getting to know each other and building the trust that you need to win her over., She probably understands that she is shy and might even be self-conscious about it. Don’t remind her of her shyness. Instead, help prompt subtle conversation to help her feel more comfortable.


Saying things like “Don’t be shy,” will just remind her of her shyness and likely make her uncomfortable.
She may not be good at making eye contact. If this is the case, avoid pointing that out, too.

, This is a very important step to any relationship. Shy people have a lot of wonderful qualities. For example, shy people are typically good listeners and deep thinkers.

, Silence does not have to be awkward or uncomfortable. While you probably shouldn’t spend the whole date sitting quietly, you can spend moments in silence. She will appreciate that you do not need her to talk, or listen, all the time."

Move at her speed.,
Introduce her to your friends and family.,
Express your interest.,
Earn her trust.",How to Win Over a Shy Girl's Heart4," Spend a lot of time getting to know her and letting her get to know you. Building trust is the key to a relationship with a shy girl. Ask her to do things with you that do not involve large crowds. An evening walk or a movie night at your house might be better than going out to the theater with large crowds of people., Although she is shy, not introducing her to your friends and family could make her even more self-conscious. Just be careful not to introduce her to everyone all at once. Create opportunities for her to meet friends and family in small groups or one at a time.For example, you could go to dinner with just your parents as opposed to bringing her to a large family gathering such as Thanksgiving.

, Though you should avoid pushing her to move the relationship too quickly, make it clear that you are serious. Many shy people are self-conscious and might not assume that you want a relationship with them. By telling her how you feel, you give her the opportunity to think about how she feels.


Mention that you have feelings for her by saying things like “I do really like spending time with you. I hope to do it more often.”

, Shy girls often have trust issues. You will need to earn her trust and not expect it to be given freely.Be honest.
Be reliable.

Use social media to connect with friends and friends of friends.,
Initiate conversations with people.,
Listen when people talk to you.,
Practice your social skills daily to get more comfortable with them.,
Don’t get discouraged if you don't improve overnight.",How to Have a Better Social Life1," If you're a busy person or just someone who has trouble making initial connections with people face to face, social media can be a great place to maintain and develop relationships that can lead to a richer social life in the real world.Dating sites like Ok Cupid have settings that allow you to search for people specifically interested in friendships rather than romantic relationships.
Try initiating conversations online with a question about the person's profile or one of their pictures.
Avoid commenting on appearance. People are much more engaged when you try to connect to them based on their interests. If someone is kayaking in one of their photos, ask them how long they've been doing it, rather than commenting about how good they look in their bathing suit.
Using Skype or other video messaging services to catch up with people you haven't seen in awhile is a much more intimate and social way to keep in touch than say, just sending emails back and forth, or the occasional text.;
, One of the best ways to improve your social life is to create new relationships with people. That involves getting to know them, which involves sharing ideas and stories. Ask someone how their day is going or what they plan on doing over the weekend. Compliment their wardrobe or ask them what kinds of movies or TV shows they like.


Cafeterias and office lunchrooms are great places to socialize with fellow students or coworkers. You can also try bars, dog parks, a reading at a bookstore, before or after church, sporting events, a concert, a farmers market, parties, dances, or art exhibits. Be creative. Think about places people gather around things that are easy to talk about. People at a dog beach will be excited to talk about their dogs. People at an art show will be interested in talking about the art.
Approaching a new person can be scary. Take a deep breath and put on a friendly face.
If the person is alone, ask if it is okay if you sit with them.
Show you are interested and friendly by smiling when you initiate a conversation.
Make and maintain eye contact while you talk. This doesn't need to be eye contact that is never broken, but you should be returning to it often to show the person you are interested in what they have to say.
Keep the conversation moving by asking questions about the other person. Follow your own curiosity. ""What kind of dog do you have?"" ""How long have you been interested in comic books?"" ""So did you play football in high school?""

, Your ability to become a strong listener will greatly improve your social life. When you are talking with people pay attention to what they are saying. Show them you are listening by nodding your head or showing a reaction on your face like smiling or a look of concern. This will help the speaker feel comfortable with you, which will make them want to tell you more things, which will only draw you closer together.


Make eye contact with them as they talk to show you are paying attention.
Listen for things you might have in common. Shared interests are how a lot of people build friendships.
Listen for things that you might want to know more about. Asking questions will allow you to get to know more about them.
Try to listen to their tone as they are speaking. If they sound bored with the conversation try steer it in another direction. If they sound excited then you can keep going with that topic.

, Set little goals for yourself throughout the day. Maybe you try to initiate a conversation with a coworker, or just make a special effort to wish the barista at the coffee shop a good morning. The more comfortable you get with socializing, the easier it will become.Even if you don’t end up hanging out with these people, you’ll still gain a lot by practicing your skills with them.

, Improving your social life isn’t going to happen overnight. A lot of it is going to have to do with the friends you make and the relationships you form and those things take time. Be patient. A little bit of work every day will add up sooner than you think!Make a chart or list of the things you are doing to try to improve your social life. This way, even if you haven't had a particularly successful day, you can see the overall progress you are making. This will help you stay motivated.

Let people know you are available and interested in hanging out.,
Ask others what they are doing after work or over the weekend.,
Don’t invite yourself along.,
Step outside your comfort zone.",How to Have a Better Social Life2," You don’t have to overdo this, but sometimes people might not think to invite you places because they assume you are either busy or uninterested. An occasional post on Facebook like, “Looking for something fun to do this weekend. Anyone have any ideas?” Will let people know you are available and willing to meet up.


If someone tells you about a fun thing they did let them know you would be interested in participating in the same activity. ""Boogie boarding sounds like it was so much fun, I'd love to try it sometime.""

, When you show interest in them, they will show interest in you. They might ask you to come with if they are going out for drinks or heading to a museum.Even if they don't you can still get some good ideas for things to do on your own where you might be able to meet new people.

, Not everyone is going to ask you to join them, either because they haven't picked up on your signals or because they may not be able too for their own reasons. The worst thing you can do is be too pushy about being included. Be patient.

, Be willing to do some things that make you a little uncomfortable, knowing that ultimately they will help you grow. This could be something as simple as initiating a conversation at an office party or during your lunch hour at school."

Take a class to meet like minded people.,
Join an intramural sport.,
Attend parties to meet new people.,
Check your local newspaper's metro section for social events in your area.,
Go to meet ups connected to things you are interested in.",How to Have a Better Social Life3," Find something you are interested in learning more about and sign up for classes. This can be a great way to meet new people who have similar interests.If you are in school try taking a class you've never taken before. In college you can consider an elective outside of your main field of study.
If you're not in school consider a class at a local community college. The YMC, library, local arts center, or park district might also offer classes for kids and adults.
Classes like salsa dancing, cooking, or acting involve a lot of participation and interaction with other students.
Ask your classmates if they would like to have coffee or go out for drinks after class. You can talk about that day's lesson or how you became interested in the class in the first place. Both are great jumping off points for getting to know new people., Many park districts offer intramural sports leagues like softball, basketball, or touch football. These teams are usually made up of amateur players and tend to be just as much about socializing as they are about competing.


Don't worry if you're not very good at sports. Most of these leagues are more about having fun rather than winning. That said, ask around. Consult the league president or park official. Ask them what the league is like. Tell them what you are looking for and they may be able to put you on a team with some like minded people.
Be encouraging to the other players. Congratulate them on good plays.

, Parties can seem overwhelming, but they can be great places to meet new people and expand your social circle. If your friend or family member is having a birthday party or other celebration make sure you attend.Don't just stand in the corner. Move around and mingle with lots of different people.
Ask your host to introduce you to some new people. This will take some of the initial pressure off of you.
If you don’t get lots of invites to parties don’t worry. As you increase your social circle using some of these other steps the party invites will come soon enough. , Look for events in your neighborhood like concerts, literary readings, or special events at bars and restaurants. These events often have a party atmosphere and rarely require an invite to attend.

, Websites like meetup.com are a good place to search for like-minded people. Try searching for meet ups that are centered around a hobby you have like playing video games, collecting baseball cards, computer programming or bird watching. You can also search for people who share similar beliefs as you and are interested in discussing and sharing knowledge. Things like religious studies, gender equality, or amateur philosophy are great things to search for."

Don't over-think it.",How to Win a Girl Over," Got your eye on someone? Winning someone over doesn't need to be super-complicated. If you want a girl to start noticing that you exist, just start saying hello. When you pass in the hallway between classes, make eye contact and say, ""Hey!"" Smile and give a little wave. She'll get the hint.


You don't even have to say anything. Just start smiling when you see her coming. This will always be appreciated.
Use her name. Hearing your own name called helps people feel validated and secure. It's like a little compliment every time. When you see her, say her name often.If you've never seen this girl before and want to approach her, just go up and say hello, then start a conversation.;
, After she's aware of your presence, strike up a conversation. Lead with something interesting and specific, or talk about something you know you've got in common.


Be funny. Lead with something that will break the ice: ""I'm thinking of cutting gym and renting a Cadillac to drive to Mexico. What do you say? I need an accomplice.""
Talk about something you've got in common. If you see a girl out at a bar or restaurant, say, ""Isn't this place great? What do you think? Have you been here before?"" If you have class together, ask her about how she did on the last test, or how she feels about the readings.
Avoid ""closed"" questions that won't give you anything to talk about. If you say, ""What's up?"" or ""Hows it going?"" that conversation is going nowhere.

, Getting to know someone is tough in a group setting. If you want to get to know her better, try to find an excuse to talk, just the two of you. Make it a regular thing.


If you start talking to a girl while you're out somewhere, ask if she wants to move into a booth, or stand outside and talk for a while. ""Want to talk outside so we can hear each other? I want to hear what you have to say.""
Sit next to her at lunch, or on the bus, or chat her up in the hallway while she's walking to class. If you both walk home from school together, walk together.

, Sometimes, it can be a lot easier to get to know a girl online, or via text. Girls might open up a little more and be a little more talkative in writing, than in person. It's always better to talk in person and find a little connection. But after you get a girl's number, text her when you have something interesting or specific to talk about.


Text or message about something timely. If you're working on the homework for a class you've got together, text her: ""This English reading is killing me. Distract me?""
Never waste a girl's time by texting, ""Hey"" or ""What up"" or some kind of emoticon. If you want to attract her, say something that she can respond to.

, Want to ""win"" a girl over? Spend time getting to know her and becoming her friend first. Lots of guys complain about getting lost in the ""Friend Zone."" News flash: Girls are either attracted to someone, or they aren't. The more time you spend with someone, the more feelings will develop. It may not initially be the romantic feelings, but it may soon develop into something more than just ""hanging out.""


It's good to be proactive when you're ready. Girls like it when you ask them out first. If you are shy or scared of rejection, just take it easy. If you like a girl and want to win her over, just ask her to hang out and spend more time with her.

, Everyone wants to be made to feel comfortable and at ease with a potential partner, or date. If you want to put a girl at ease, get her talking. How? Ask her open-ended questions about her interests. Get to know her hopes and dreams, and her desires. Learn everything you can about her.


Look for open doors in things that she talks about. If she mentions off-hand that she hated watching the new Avengers movie, ask her what kind of movies she likes. If she says, ""Horror"" ask, ""What do you like about those movies?"" Keep her talking, and keep it positive.
Ask open-ended questions always. Don't ask questions that have one-word, ""yes or no"" answers.

, When you're together, be together. Show her that she matters to you by putting away distractions when you're together. If you're looking over her shoulder and trying to eavesdrop on another conversation, or are distracted by your phone, she'll feel like second fiddle.


If she's speaking in a group, direct your attention to her. Even if others are trying to talk over her, she'll appreciate that fact that you care about what she has to say.

, Making conversation involves connecting. To find common interests, you have to actually listen when she talks, respond to what she says, and give her the time of day. You can't just fake your way through a relationship. You have to really listen and get to know her.


Make eye contact when she's talking. Nod your head when she says something you agree with. Summarize her points when she's talking and prompt her to say more. Be a good listener.

, Lots of guys have an idea that waiting to text, call, or email shows that you're ""hard to get"" and it makes you attractive. Really, it just makes it look like you watch too many rom-coms. Want to win a girl over? Text her when you notice that she's texted you. Respond to a call or an email when you see it. Don't try to put her on ice to show that you're cool.


At the same time, it's important to avoid over-texting someone. If you see she hasn't responded right away to something that you've said, don't blast off 50 more texts asking, ""Hey? You there?"" Give her some space and chill.

, One of the key components to attraction is sharing a sense of humor. Recent studies show that guys who try to be funny are always more attractive than very serious or very stoic guys, when courting women.Even if your joke falls flat, it's typically a good idea to try to show that you like to laugh.


Cut up the way you might with your friends, but on your best behavior. If you don't share the same sense of humor as someone, you don't want to be with them anyway. You won't be able to fake it.

, Be on her side. If she's wrong about something, or struggling, tell her gently and keep her best interest at heart. If she's right, encourage her to do what makes her happy. When she's sad, be there for her and let her know that you are there for her. Let her know she can talk about anything with you.

, Positivity is attractive. When you're together, try your best to keep things light and fun instead of serious and dramatic. Focus less on complaining about things together and more on focusing on the good. Being together should be fun.


When you're around her, don't be someone who hates on others and brings others down. Be someone who appreciates things and her, so when she's around you she'll feel better about herself and the life around her.

, Some studies show that teasing a woman gently can increase the electricity of attraction.Respect a woman's intelligence by treating her like a regular person, not something to be put on a pedestal.


Be kind. ""Teasing"" doesn't mean ""being mean."" It's one thing to say something teasing, like, ""I saw all those selfies you put up on Facebook today. And I'm being totally serious when I say this: Your room is a huge mess."" It's another to say, ""I saw all those selfies you put up on Facebook today. That's pretty vain. Do you really like attention from guys?""

, Everyone likes a good compliment now and again. But if you start doing nothing but compliment a girl's appearance every time you see her, it's going to grow tiresome quickly. Just as tiresome as the ""Hey-what's-up-not-much"" conversation.


Compliment her appearance, sparingly. Focus on choices that she makes, not physical attributes. Say, ""That dress looks really good on you"" instead of saying, ""Your body is really sexy."" Attraction is nice, but if she thinks that all you care about is how beautiful she is then she'll begin to think you're shallow.

, Light touching is sometimes electric and attractive. Brushing a wisp of hair behind a girl's ear, or touching her hand can be an exciting little moment and increase your intimacy. It can also turn a girl off significantly. It's important to read her body language and respond in turn.Respect her boundaries. If a woman says no, understand that you should stop right there. If a woman shows signs of disinterest, don't persist. If a woman shows signs of being uncomfortable, stop being a creep. If a woman says she's not into something now or never, respect that and don't try to persuade her into doing anything she doesn't want to.
Respect her decisions. She wears lots of makeup? Fine. Let her know if it makes her happy then she can go all for it, she looks incredible with or without. She wants to wear wacky clothes that show lots of skin? Okay. It isn't your place to tell her what she can and cannot do.

, Looks do matter. If you want to win a girl over, give some extra time and though into grooming yourself and styling yourself when you know you're going to be around her. Pick clothes that make you feel comfortable and that flatter your body. Shower regularly and try to get in shape.

, Women aren't prizes to be won or ladders to be climbed. Strictly speaking, you don't ""win"" a girl. You get to know them, and you form a relationship with them. Sometimes, attraction is there. Sometimes not. If you want to get to know someone better, there's no better way than to go up to her and ask.


Rejection happens. If you're not right for someone, take it as a good sign. There are lots of other people who you're more compatible with. Don't waste your time on someone you're not right with.

When it comes to the time to confront your ex-boyfriend about the whole mis-happening, don't beg and plead for him to take you back. Give him subtle hints about memories that you two shared together.

You'd like your man to be honest with you, so be sure to afford him the same courtesy.
You should never withhold or hide things from your man -- you may think that you are preventing him from getting hurt or angry, but this could really backfire in the long run, when he eventually finds out.;
, Kindness is an important trait in any relationship, but one that is often overlooked.


The whole ""treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen"" is fine for the dating scene, but doesn't really work once you're in a relationship.
Being kind encompasses a lot of things -- it means being patient and understanding if your guy makes a mistake, it means doing nice things for him just because you care, and it means treating him with dignity and respect, just as you would like to be treated.

, Men may not like to admit it, but most of them desperately want a little TLC every now and them.


So don't forget to express your affection by giving him a big hug and kiss when he's looking a bit down.
If you're at the ""I love you"" stage in your relationship, don't be afraid to remind him of how you feel or feel like he's the one who has to say it first.

, Very often, people in committed relationships find themselves settling into a comfortable, predictable routine.


And while this has its benefits, its nice to inject some fun into your relationship and do something spontaneous every once in a while, just to keep things interesting.
Plan a romantic weekend trip for the two of you, or organize a day out to visit a museum, zoo or art exhibition. Book a sky-diving or scuba-diving experience. Get out of your comfort zone and you'll see a whole new side to your other half!

, Treating a guy well is all about loyalty -- there's no point being nice to his face, then complaining about him behind his back to family and friends.


He needs to know that you're there for him and that you have his back 100% of the time -- just like he has yours.
Next time someone disagrees with your man or criticizes him for something, speak up on his behalf -- this will let him know that you're on his side.

, If you want your guy to trust you 100%, then you need to afford him the same luxury. Trust is a two-way street.


Don't panic if he doesn't immediately return your call or reply to a text -- guys are forgetful about these kinds of things -- it doesn't mean he's up to something shady.
If your man is open and honest with you and has never done anything to hurt you in the past, then you have no reason not to trust him. So if he wants a wild night out with the guys, you can be totally zen about it!

, Making a guy feel good about himself is an important part of treating him well. You don't want to be around someone who puts you down all the time, and neither does he.


Be considerate of his feelings -- thank him when he does something nice for you to let him know that you appreciate him, and apologize when you say something harsh or uncalled for.
If he's having a hard time at work, let him know that you believe in him and have confidence in his abilities. He'll feel much better about himself afterwards.

, Sometimes we all just need to vent and share our feelings with another person.


You want to be that person for your man when he needs it, so show him that he can tell you anything by being a good listener.
Try not to interrupt or make any judgmental comments -- just listen to what he has to say, try to be sympathetic and offer some constructive advice.

, Men are egotistical creatures, so boosting his ego with a well-timed compliment can put him on top of the world.


Tell him he looks great today, that his gym workouts are really paying off, or that his new haircut really suits him.
Let him know that he's the only man for you, and that you feel lucky to have him.

, Your guy should know that he can count on you no matter what and that you'll always be there for him when he needs you.


Be his safety net when he needs it -- back him up if he wants to take a risk with a new business idea, support him if he's having family issues and be his shoulder to cry on when something bad happens.
Being in a loving relationship is about sticking it out through the bad times as well as the good -- so don't be a fair-weathered girlfriend!

, Treating a guy well involves doing nice things for him from time to time, so why not let yourself in on the action and plan a fun date together!


Do the classic dinner and a movie if you haven't done that in a while, or try something a bit more adventurous like going paintballing, taking a dance class or attending a concert.
Even a quiet night in can be jazzed up with a few candles, some romantic music and a nice bottle of wine!

, The old saying that ""the way to a man's heart is through his stomach"" is pretty spot on -- so do something nice for your man by cooking him a delicious meal, whether it's an old favorite or something new and exciting.


Don't worry if you're a terrible cook -- pick a very simple but tasty recipe, like some kind of pasta dish or coconut-based curry, and give yourself lots of time to prepare.
Alternatively, you could just order take-out from his favorite restaurant and serve it nicely -- from actual plates rather than plastic containers!

, You really can't go wrong with giving your man a massage, especially after a long, stressful day.


Get some nicely scented massage oil, dim the light s(or light some candles) and put on some relaxing music.
Invite him to take off his shirt and lie down. Work your way up his back and across his shoulders, focusing on any knots or areas of tension. He'll feel so good afterwards he might just fall straight asleep!

, Every so often, it doesn't hurt to get all dressed up for your man and make him feel lucky to have you. You'll feel like a million dollars when you see the appreciative look on his face!


Do all the things you used to do when you first started dating -- spend three hours getting ready if that's what it takes -- shaving and moisturizing and applying makeup and curling hair.
Put on your best dress and a pair of killer heels -- now you're all set for whatever the evening may bring , whether it's a night on the dance floor or a romantic evening at home.

, Nearly all men appreciate when a woman has an adventurous side in the bedroom, so unleash yours and watch your guy become putty in your hands!.


Try taking the lead if you're normally the one who just goes with the flow -- experiment with tying your man down or handcuffing him to the bed if that's what he's into.
Remember that sexual intimacy is an important part of any healthy relationship, so don't withhold sex if you're feeling angry -- work things out in the bedroom!

Admit the lie to yourself first.,
Meet face-to-face with your boyfriend.,
Be forthright.,
Use “I” statements.,
Apologize.,
Answer any questions truthfully.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend the Truth About How You Feel After Months of Lying1," Before you can admit your lies to your boyfriend, you must acknowledge them on your own. Sometimes, you can repeat a lie over and over again to the point that you start to believe it. In order to break this cycle, you must admit that there is a problem.Say it aloud to yourself: “I have been dishonest with Matt for a long time now. I need to tell the truth.”
It may also help to share this admission with a friend. Confiding in someone else about your lies can serve as a way to practice coming clean to your boyfriend. Plus, if you choose someone who is understanding and supportive, he or she can give you the courage to finally tell the truth.;
, It may be tempting to want to spill your guts over a phone call or a text message. However, coming clean after months of lying requires sensitivity in how you handle the situation. Set a date with your boyfriend ahead of time so that you can talk in-person without distractions.


Leave your cell phone in another room. This is important not only to minimize distractions, but it will also reduce negative feelings. Studies show that when a pair is discussing a meaningful topic, the presence of a cell phone can increase feelings of distrust and compromise relationship quality., A full confession is best and will actually help you feel better about yourself.You may believe that a partial confession is more likely to preserve your boyfriend’s feelings (e.g. “If I tell him how long I’ve been lying, he will be devastated.”) Nonetheless, only coming halfway clean will simply reinforce your lying habit. Be completely honest about what you have been feeling.


For instance, you might start off the discussion by saying something that denotes the seriousness of the situation and gets straight to the point. “I wanted to talk about my feelings for you…” or “I have been dishonest with you for a while now. I need to tell you the truth about my feelings…” is a forthright way to start the conversation.

, “I” statements give you an opportunity to take ownership for your own feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. As opposed to “you” statements that trigger defensiveness, “I” statements build bridges to increase trust and openness.Be specific in your remarks while avoiding “should” statements or labels. Include your thoughts and feelings.


An example of a potential “I” statement for this scenario might be: “I am feeling ashamed about not telling you the truth before now. I care about you and didn’t want to hurt you, but I know I have.”

, Just as your wording should emphasize that you are taking full responsibility for your lie, your words should also reflect remorse. Let your boyfriend know how terrible you feel about lying. Being able to own up to your guilt is an integral part of moving forward.Tell him ""I'm very sorry that I kept this from you. I feel ashamed, like I have disappointed you. I hope that you can come to forgive me someday."" Take note that you can request forgiveness, but only he has the power to grant it to you.

, Just as you should be forthright and take ownership of your lie, you also want to emphasize honesty going forward. If your boyfriend asks any clarifying questions about your deception, answer them as truthfully as you can.


For example, if he asks “When did you know how you really felt?,” you need to be clear: “I have known that I was no longer in love with you since April. I just didn’t know how to tell you the truth.”

"
"
Allow him an opportunity to react.,
Assess whether you want to remain in the relationship.,
Take some time to think things over.If you want to give the relationship another shot, it's okay to share your feelings with your boyfriend.,
Develop a plan to rebuild trust.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend the Truth About How You Feel After Months of Lying2," If you make the effort to address the problem head-on versus waiting to get caught in a lie, your partner may view you in a more positive light.Regardless, after you have come clean about lying, you must allow him the chance to respond.


Listen attentively to what your boyfriend has to say. He may get angry and express feeling betrayed. Try not to be defensive. Remember that he is allowed his own feelings and experience. Just listen and honor his need to vent.

, The content of your lies will help the two of you determine if this relationship should continue. For example, if you have been lying about something minor like searching for a job, then you may be able to overcome such a lie. However, if you have lied about your romantic feelings or covered up an infidelity, your relationship may not recover.


Dig deep and consider the foundation of your relationship and the strengths it has that may allow you to move forward. If lying has been a reoccurring theme in the relationship, or if you two lack other strengths such as shared goals or values, it may be time to call it quits.Both of you should be honest with yourselves and each other at this point. Do you really want to be in this relationship? Are you willing to undergo the changes necessary to make it work?

, However, you must not expect him to make a decision on the spot. Agree to take a break from the relationship for a few days or weeks to get space for the both of you.


This does not necessarily mean you are going to break up, but it can help both of you get perspective and determine if you are actually committed to making an effort.
Use this time to evaluate how you feel about your boyfriend and whether you are going to fully dedicate yourself to being consistent in your words and actions in the future. The two of you can set a specific date to meet back up and resume the conversation.

, If you want the relationship to recover, then it’s important that the two of you are on the same page going forward. Being honest may be uncomfortable and even foreign to you, but it’s necessary for trust in relationships. Sit down with your boyfriend and talk about ways you can regain his trust.


One of the best ways to rebuild trust is through transparency. Try to be straightforward with your boyfriend from now on and encourage him to ask you questions if he has concerns. Also, show consistency in your words and behaviors. If you say you will do something, do it. This will go a long way in helping him trust you again.You must prepare yourself for the possibility that you may never fully regain his trust. After finding out about a lie, your partner may have doubts going into the future. If you have difficulty rebuilding trust, it can be helpful to see a couples therapist who can help you work through this.

"
"
Consider the root cause of your deception.,
Set realistic goals to adopt honesty.,
Practice expressing yourself while still being sensitive to others.,
Consult someone.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend the Truth About How You Feel After Months of Lying3," In order to practice honesty, you must have an understanding of why you lie in the first place. Do you lie to save face or act like you know something when you don’t? Do you lie to “protect” others’ feelings? Do you lie to avoid showing vulnerability? All of these are common reasons why people lie.Look to your past to spot themes in the reasons behind your lies.

, Once you get an understanding of the reasons you lie, establish a few realistic goals to stop your lying habit. Avoid making promises that you can’t keep, such as “I’ll never lie again.” Instead set the bar low and raise it as you develop a greater ability for honesty.For example, you could simply tell your boyfriend that when you get the urge to lie, you will share your feelings with him. That way, he can help you adopt the habit of honesty. Other goals you can set may include taking your time to answer questions so that you don’t resort to an impulsive, untrue answer., Being completely truthful after a long period of lies can be difficult, but it’s possible with practice. Take baby steps with your goals and try to be more direct and honest in small daily interactions. Replace your bad habit with a positive behavior like telling the truth.As you practice telling the truth, you will notice that the act becomes easier to do. You will also feel liberated from having to keep track with lies you have told people.

, If you feel you need extra help working on quitting lying, a therapist, self-help book or support group may offer valuable help. In addition, if you are having difficulty uncovering the reason behind your lying and believe it to be compulsive, you need to seek out professional help as soon as possible.Plus, it can also be helpful to have your boyfriend join in on a session to discuss rebuilding trust in your relationship.

Wait until you feel ready.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Wear a supportive bra.,
Be patient.,
Stick to low impact exercises.,
Take care of your body post-surgery.,
Do a few sets of Kegels every day.,
Try some pelvic lifts.,
Take slow walks.,
Swim.,
Wait a few months to resume full intensity exercises.",How to Exercise After Childbirth," Many healthcare providers have advocated for waiting at least six weeks before exercising after giving birth. Recently, though, it’s been found that you don’t need to wait, as long as you had a normal vaginal delivery without any problems. If your delivery had complications, or you had tearing, you will want to wait until you’re healed to exercise. Otherwise, you can resume exercise as soon as you feel ready to do so.You know your own body. You’ll know if and when you feel up to getting back into your exercise routine, but trust your instincts. If you don’t feel quite ready, take some more time.
If you had a C-section, there are special considerations, found in Part 2.;
, If you have any concerns about getting back into exercising after childbirth, talk to your doctor. Your doctor will be able to advise you on whether or not they think it’s safe for you to resume working out. Alternatively, if you start working out again and something doesn’t feel right, talk to your doctor.If you notice any excess bleeding or pain after or during exercise, see your doctor immediately.

, Since your breasts will be larger and more tender after giving birth and while breastfeeding, you will want some stronger support for them when exercising, so having the correct sports bra size is important. You may also want to get some nursing pads to put in your bra, in case of any leakage.If may help to breastfeed or pump prior to exercising, just for your own comfort.
Intense exercise can sometimes create a buildup of lactic acid which can come through your breastmilk. Some babies may not want to drink this milk as it might have a salty or sour taste. If you engaged in intense exercise while breastfeeding, consider ""pumping and dumping,"" or feeding prior to exercising., Many doctors will tell you that a six-week waiting period following a C-section is adequate before returning to exercise, but you may want to wait longer. Don’t push your body before it’s ready. You are healing from more than just a vaginal birth, and will need to make sure your body is fully healed before getting back into your exercise routine.Remember that a C-section is major abdominal surgery! Your doctor had to cut through many layers of your body to reach the baby, meaning you have multiple layers of sutures and scar tissue that is forming as you heal. Treat recovery from a C-section as seriously as you would any other major surgery.

, When recovering from a C-section, you won’t want to jump right back into high impact or intense exercises. Start small with low impact exercises. Don’t overdo it with running or weight training. Take your time easing back into your normal physical activity level.


Since you will be healing from a major surgery, you will want to refrain from all exercise until your doctor gives you the green light. You have healing sutures that are at risk for breaking, which can halt or slow your healing process. Minor, low impact exercises are a good alternative to full blown workouts.
Ask your doctor if you can go for walks while healing, as this may help you heal faster.

, If you want to get back to your normal self at a good pace, you’ll need to look after your body after having a C-section. For example, don’t push yourself even doing minor things like lifting or sitting up. When moving from lying down to sitting up, roll onto your side first, then push yourself up. This will help keep your abdominal muscles relaxed and avoid pulling on your sutures.By letting your body take the time it needs to heal, you might be back on the road to normal exercise sooner.

, Kegels are exercises that involve tensing and flexing the muscles of your pelvic floor. Since your pelvic floor can become weaker during pregnancy, strengthening it again after birth is important. Think of these muscles as the muscles you might use to stop yourself from urinating. To do a Kegel, tighten those muscles and hold it for 10 seconds. Repeat this eight to 10 times to complete one set. Try to do about three sets throughout the day.These are great exercises that you can start doing right away after you come home from the hospital, or a few days after giving birth. You don’t have to move around, and you can do them from the comfort of a seated position, making them a really good low impact and easy exercise.
Many women experience incontinence after giving birth due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. Kegels can help with this.

, Since you won’t want to put too much tension on your abdominal muscles as you heal by doing moves like crunches, you can try pelvic lifts as an alternative. Lie on the floor on your back and bend your knees, planting your feet on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Then, gently lift your hips off the floor until your back is in a straight slope up through your knees. Hold this position for a few seconds, then gently lower back down. Repeat this for about three sets of 10 repetitions each, or less if you aren’t feeling up to that many.Do not lift the hips above the ribs as this decreases the effectiveness of the exercise.
You can also start off smaller and only lift your hips a few inches off the floor rather than going into the full pelvic bridge. Do whatever you are comfortable with, and whatever your body is ready for.

, Walking is a great way to ease back into physical activity. Not only is it a way to get outside and get some fresh air, you can also bring baby in a stroller and enjoy some time together. Go for a stroll around the block once a day, and work up to going twice. If you start to feel any discomfort or fatigue, you can always head back home and relax.Don’t push it to a fast walk or even a slow jog until you are completely healed and recuperated.

, Swimming is a great low-impact exercise to try out after giving birth. Spend 30 minutes to an hour in the pool, swimming slowly and gently. Even with swimming there is still the potential to overdo it, so make sure you’re listening to your body and taking it easy. Swimming is a great way to get a little low-impact cardio while relaxing.Avoid swimming as an exercise option until all of your postpartum bleeding has ceased.
If you had a C-section, you must get clearance from your doctor before swimming, as your sutures must be healed before you can immerse them in water.

, It’s best to stick to low-impact exercises for the first two to three months following childbirth. Instead of sprinting, take a brisk walk. Instead of lifting heavy weights or doing intense cardio, opt for a few sets of modified push ups or yoga. Even if you exercised during your pregnancy, you’ll want to take it easy and slowly ease back into more intense exercises.Remember that your joints will still be a little loose for at least three months after birth, so be careful while doing even low-impact exercises. Make sure you don’t trip and fall while walking.

Display open body language.,
Project positivity.,
Maintain a personal sense of style.,
Appear well groomed and put together.",How to Have Friends1," Many people judge confidence based on how you carry yourself and present yourself to others. You can appear confident and appealing to people by displaying open body language. This will help you project a sense of self-worth and draw more positive attention in a room full of people.Displaying open body language means maintaining eye contact with the person you are addressing and with people in the room. Eye contact can be a big indicator of confidence.
You should also take a relaxed stance, with your arms resting at your sides. Try to stand straight, with your shoulders rolled back. When you are speaking to someone, you should position your body so you are turned towards them and lean in so you can show them you are engaged in the conversation.
Avoid slouching when seated or standing and do not cross your arms over your chest. These are all signs of closed body language, signalling to others that you are not approachable or willing to be social.;
, You may find people prefer being around those who are positive and proactive. You should try to project a positive attitude so people find you appealing and fun to be around. You may work on developing a happy demeanor and focus on positive habits, rather than negative ones, so you are someone that people enjoy spending time with.You can be a positive addition to a conversation by telling a joke or a funny story. Using humor to communicate positivity can add levity and spontaneity to your interactions with others.
You can also be a positive person by being empathetic towards the needs of others and by being a good listener. Showing empathy for someone will demonstrate that you can put your ego aside and focus on how you can best help and support that person. This is often appealing to people and is a strong quality of a good friend.

, Avoid following the latest trends and styles, as this may only show others that you are a follower and not confident enough to make your own choices. Instead of following trends, you should try to maintain your own personal sense of style. This means dressing for your body and based on your tastes. You should also try to always wear clothes and outfits that express who you are and what you like.Though you may be worried about standing out in a room due to your outfit or getting noticed in a weird look, you should try to embrace your own sense of what looks good. Have fun with your sense of style and do not be afraid to wear clothing that might seem strange or weird. Wearing any outfit with confidence will make it seem appealing to others.
You may research more into dressing for your body type and look for clothing that suits your sense of style. You may also check your appearance in the mirror before you leave the house to confirm your outfit is great and you can walk out into the world with confidence.

, You can also attract friends by presenting yourself so you appear well groomed and well put together. Maintain good hygiene by taking a shower every day and putting some effort into your appearance. Though your outfit may be plain, it will still look confident and appealing if it is put together.You may stick to a regular bathing routine and wear deodorant to smell nice every day. You may also put on makeup as part of your daily routine and do your hair so you look put together and appealing to others.

Fight the midday slump with movement.",How to Gain Energy During Pregnancy1," See your doctor to rule out any possible reasons to not exercise. If your doctor approves, get plenty of daily moderate exercise.It is recommended that pregnant women get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day.There are no heart rate limitations on the exercise you can do. Make sure you can still talk normally while working out. If you are breathing too heavily to talk, you are probably working too hard.During your third trimester, it is safe to exercise as long as you are not at risk of delivering a preterm baby. If you usually do moderate or high-impact exercise, discuss if you can continue as usual with your doctor or midwife. Try prenatal yoga, brisk walking, along with abdominal and back exercises. Since you can't do crunches on your back, do standing pelvic tilts. This late in pregnancy, you should avoid lifting heavy weights. And as always, stop if you feel dizzy or lightheaded.If you are tired, try short bursts of exercise instead of one long exercise.Exercise helps keep your heart, lungs, and muscles healthy, and ensures you get plenty of oxygen to your brain and other organs.
If you will be exercising at an altitude, be aware that acute mountain sickness (AMT) is a risk. Give yourself time to get used to the altitude if you travel to a location that is above 2500 meters. Wait two or three days before doing any moderate exercise.Resistance exercises are safe, but use light weights and complete a large number of repetitions (e.g. 15-20 repetitions).;
, Make time each day to go for a walk. Go for a walk during your lunch break, take the dog for a walk, or set aside time to walk with a walking partner after you get home from work. Walking is important because it increases blood flow, which boosts energy.When walking, keep it slow. You don't want to raise your heart rate so you huff and puff. Only engage in a light walk.
Try for at least a 30 minute walk every day., Strength training while pregnant can be a great way to get safe exercise. However, you will want to use lighter weights. Your center of gravity is changing and you may have trouble supporting a lot of weight. In stead of choosing heavy weights, use light weights and do 15-20 repetitions per set.Work on creating upper body strength while pregnant. Do bicep curls, tricep extensions, and shoulder presses. It'll help you when you're lifting your baby later.

, Swimming is considered one of the safest exercises for pregnant women. It doesn't add extra stress to your joints or get you too heated as you work out. This is a great, refreshing way to get your blood pumping and wake your body up.Splashing your body with cool water refreshes instantly, which can help boost your energy levels., Half an hour on cardio machines at your local gym can help boost your energy levels. A stationary bike is a good, safe way to exercise. The bike supports your weight, and because it's stationary, you don't risk falling off. A stair-climber, elliptical, and treadmill also are good ways to exercise and fight fatigue.Just be aware that some activities may require special adjustments to keep you and your baby safe. If you are not sure if an exercise is okay, talk to your doctor to be sure., There are many yoga routines geared towards pregnant women, and many of them aim to help raise energy levels. Go to a yoga class at your local gym or yoga studio. Look online or buy a DVD of pregnancy yoga routines so you can fit a half hour of yoga into your day whenever you have a spare moment.


Some studios and gyms offer classes specifically for pregnant women., A good way to boost your energy, your endorphins, and your overall mood is to put on some upbeat tunes and dance. Increasing your endorphins helps reduce stress, which can cause fatigue.Make sure you don't do too much jumping, leaping, or spinning.

, If you are at work and just can't seem to wake up, try doing spurts of light movement. Do a few stretches and breathing exercises at your desk, take a walk around the office, or step outside for some fresh air and sunshine."

Make use of the savings.",How to Form a Women's Self Help Group in South Asia," Mobilize them by explaining the benefits that they'd receive from joining together for the sake of advocacy, information sharing and pooling resources together. You can use story-telling and sayings to help them to understand the benefit of coming together as a group, especially for poor and weaker persons in society who don't often have a voice.


Tell them well-known parables about strength together, such as the story about the four cows and the lion.
Motivate them by saying that ""One thread can't tie an elephant but one rope made of threads can"".
Tell them that ""for one person alone it is difficult to fight a problem, but it will be easier as a group to fight a common problem such as poverty"".;
, It is up to you what the group should have as its goals but here are some ideas:


Working as a bank for local women to start businesses or take out loans. (This aspect is discussed below.)
Campaigning against a law, for a law change or for the development of a law.
Campaigning for local improvements, such as schools, parks or safe areas for women and children.
Build on successful examples of SHG models in such countries as India and Bangladesh.

, Ask the members to name their SHG on their own. Names that motivate SHG members will be a good selection. Encourage them towards coming up with this during a meeting.

,, Meet at least once every two weeks or weekly.

, Group members themselves should fix the amount according to what they can each afford.


SHG savings meetings (weekly or 15 days) can be conducted at SHG members' houses. It helps all the SHG members to know each other better and to understand their economical conditions.

, Interest will be an important form of income for the SHG.

,
Know that most Girls Are Mature: Girls are much much more mature than guys are, research shows that girls are 2-3 years more mature than guys are, so while you may be in a stage where you think burping or telling dirty jokes is hilarious girls do not think so and this will probably creep them out so if you want them to like you, Do not do this.

Join social clubs at school or at work.,
Volunteer in your community.,
Take up a team challenge or activity.,
Do a hobby you enjoy with others.,
Initiate conversations with new people.",How to Have Friends2," One way you can meet people and build relationships with others is to join a social club at school or at work. Try to pick a social club that meets regularly. You join the student social club at school or the social committee at work. This type of club can really allow you to socialize and get to know others around you.Once you have joined the social club, you should make an effort to participate in the activities in the club and be an active member of the club. Showing enthusiasm and positivity can encourage others around you to become friends with you.

, Another way you can build friendships is to spend your free time volunteering with organizations or groups in your community. Pick a cause that you are passionate about, such as helping the homeless or working with underprivileged kids. Then, see if there is a group or organization in your community that tries to address this cause.If there is no existing organization or group that serves your cause, you may start up your own organization and try to recruit members. This could be a good way for you to reach out to others in your community and connect.

, You can create friendships with others by taking up a challenge or activity where you have to work in a team. This could be a team sporting event where you work together as a team or an arts event where you work with a group of other artists. Look for team challenges or activities in your area or community and sign up.If you are shy you may find it easier to do team challenges online. You may join an online gaming challenge and connect with others that way. Over time, you may end up moving your relationships with the other players into the real world, with face to face hang outs.

, You can also use your interests to help you connect with others. Focus on a hobby or activity you enjoy and see if there is a group that does this activity together. This will allow you to do something you like and be social at the same time.For example, maybe you enjoy playing basketball. You could then see if there is a basketball league in your community or a basketball after-school club. You could join the league to connect with other players and make friends.

, Once you have put yourself in a social situation where you are surrounded by new people, you should make an effort to initiate conversations. You may start a good conversation with the person next to you or tell a funny story to get someone's attention and engage them in conversation. Striking up a conversation with a person could lead to hang outs in the future and the forming of a new friendship.


While you are talking to the new person, you should maintain open body language. Maintain eye contact with the person you are talking to and keep your arms relaxed at your sides, with your body turned towards the person.
You should also try to talk to new people on a daily basis, if only to help you get better at talking to others. Chatting with someone on a consistent basis, or every time you see them, can lead to the formation of a friendship. You may be comfortable with initiating a hang out once you have spoken to the person a few times and you both seem to get along.

Spend quality time with your friends.,
Support and cheer on your friends.,
Be honest with your friends.,
Maintain contact with your friends.",How to Have Friends3," Once you have friends, you should take steps to maintain your friendships. Gaining good friends is difficult and you do not want to have to start at square one if you start losing friends over time. You should always make an effort to spend quality time with your friends, doing things you both enjoy. This way, you and your friends have fun and you also build memories and share experiences together.For example, if you know your friend is a big fan of a certain comic book character, you may get her a pass to see the creator of the character at next year’s Comic Con. Or, you may treat your friend to a night out at their favorite restaurant. Doing nice things for your friends and making your time together meaningful will show them how much you value their friendship.
Don't get into the habit of waiting to be invited to do things with your friends. Invite your friends to do something fun. Sometimes people become complacent and wait around for an invitation, when instead they should take the initiative to plan and invite their friends to something.
Try asking your friend something like, ""Are you around on Friday night? Do you want to see a movie or go to the football game?""
Or you can ask, ""Do you want to get together sometime this weekend? I would love to see you!""

, You can also be a good friend by supporting and cheering on your friends when they need you. You should make an effort to keep up with what your friends are interested in and their goals. Supporting your friend’s goals and aspirations will show them that you can be there for them and are on their side.You may have friends who play sports and attend their games to show your support. Or you may have friends who do the performing arts and attend their performances so they have a familiar, friendly face in the crowd.

, A good friend will also be honest. You should try to be okay with constructive criticism and feedback from your friends, especially if they have your best interests at heart. You should be willing to be honest with your friends and accept that sometimes they may be honest with you.You should feel comfortable talking to your friends about issues or problems in your life, and they should also confide in you. You should look to your friends for advice and support and feel you can also give them advice when needed.

, An important part of having friends is maintaining contact with them. If you haven't seen your friend in about a week or so, or you've been spending time with other friends, drop them a quick text or call to ask how they're doing.


You can say something like, ""Hey! How'd your test go the other day?"" or ""Hey! I miss you! Let's grab coffee this week?""
If you move away from your friends (or a friend moves away from you), set up a weekly or monthly phone call with that person. Try to make a plan to go visit your friend for the weekend.

Change your bedtime.,
Take naps.,
Shift your position when you constantly feel the need to urinate.,
Use a pillow to help joint discomfort.,
Cut out unnecessary commitments.,
Reduce your stress.",How to Gain Energy During Pregnancy2," Getting enough rest during pregnancy is important to have more energy during pregnancy.

Stretch before bedtime to help with leg cramps., Because your body will be expending more energy, and you will feel more tired during your first and last trimester, you should start going to bed earlier than normal. Getting these few extra hours of sleep every night will help you not feel so tired during the day., When you feel tired during the day, take a short nap. Naps should only last 20 to 30 minutes to reap the full effects, but a 60-minute power nap can refresh you. Even if you are at work, take a 10 to 15 minute break, turn out the light, close your eyes, and rest your head.A daily nap can be especially helpful during the first trimester because you are likely to be fatigued on most days.

, One way to help you sleep is to shift your body so the baby moves away from your bladder. Try raising yourself up on all fours for a few minutes. This can help move the baby, and hopefully, lessen the urge to urinate., If you are experiencing pain when you sleep on your side, then try placing a pillow between your knees. This can help with lower back and hip pain. You can also place a pillow behind your back for added support.You can also purchase a body pillow to help support your body while sleeping on your side.

See if you can work from home. Your rest and sleep is more important than dinner with friends, a PTA meeting, or a load of laundry., Some stress is normal during pregnancy, but too much stress can make it hard to sleep at night. It can also cause headaches and changes in your appetite.Take time for yourself during your pregnancy. Do whatever it is you need to do to reduce stress. Read a book, listen to your favorite song, do yoga, or sit outside in the sunshine.


Try meditation. Close your eyes and clear your mind of all other thoughts. Focus just on a single image or thought for a few minutes a day.
Practice deep breathing. Take deep breaths for 2 minutes. This can help calm you and restore your energy.

This helps even out your energy and helps you avoid crashes.


In addition to breakfast, lunch, and dinner, have at least 2 substantial healthy and nutritious snacks throughout the day to keep your energy up., Protein is a great way to get energy that lasts throughout the day. Plus, the amino acids found in foods containing protein help aid in the development of your baby's cells. When you are pregnant, you need 75 grams (2.6 oz) per day. Good sources of protein include:


milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products
eggs
lean meats, such as chicken and fish
tofu or soy, like edamame
beans or lentils
quinoa
hummus
nuts and seeds, Healthy complex carbohydrates are important during pregnancy. They help fuel you while nourishing your baby. Stay away from refined, processed carbs, like snack cakes and chips, and skip the white bread. Choose instead:


oatmeal
fresh or dried fruit (with no added sugar)
fresh vegetables
whole grain bread, crackers, and cereal

Fish is a good source of magnesium. Try halibut., Balanced blood sugar levels help keep you energized. Eating sugary foods spike your blood sugar, giving you a short burst of energy followed by a fatigue causing crash.If you need a sweet fix, try fruit, dark chocolate, or granola.

, When pregnant, you should eat a healthy, nutritious diet, along with making sure you don't gain too much weight. However, because your body is hard at work developing your baby, you need extra calories. Add in 300 extra calories to your normal daily food intake to compensate for the extra work your body is doing. Eating under that will cause fatigue and depleted energy levels., Drinking enough water during pregnancy is vital. During this time, drink 8, 8-oz. (23.7 ml) glasses of water. Milk, juice, and other beverages count towards this number.Dehydration can lead to fatigue and other health problems.

Check for anemia.,
Decide if you have depression.,
Get your thyroid checked.,
Get tests run.",How to Gain Energy During Pregnancy4," When you're pregnant, your body produces more blood, increasing the need for more iron.If you are not getting enough iron or other nutrients, you might end up anemic. Having mild anemia when you are pregnant is common. But chronic fatigue may point to severe anemia from low iron or vitamin levels.Many of symptoms of anemia are also common symptoms of a normal pregnancy such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and trouble concentrating. Ask your doctor to do a blood test to see if your fatigue is due to anemia., During pregnancy, you might feel tired, run-down, low, and hopeless. Chronic fatigue can be a symptom of depression. If you feel tired, hopeless, and have lost interest in things you normally enjoy, speak to your doctor or midwife to rule out depression., Hypothyroidism is an underactive thyroid. Having hypothyroidism can cause complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, infertility, and other problems. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists state that 1 in 10 Americans suffer from thyroid disease and over 13 million are undiagnosed. Get your doctor to check you for thyroid problems early in your pregnancy., If you are unsure why you are still so tired, go to the doctor and get tests run. This way you rule out any serious underlying medical conditions."

Identify any infections.,
Check for imbalances.,
Embrace your natural odor.,
Consider that maybe it's him!,
Check for foreign objects.",How to Eliminate Vaginal Odor1," If you want to stop vaginal odor in its tracks, you need to figure out what's causing it first. The most common source of vaginal odor is an infection. This can range from yeast infections, to bacterial infections, to STDs/STIs. The best practice to make sure that this is not the case is to go to the doctor and have them check you out. That said, there are a few different ways you can gauge if this is your problem:


If you have a lot of chunky white discharge, you probably have a yeast infection. Medicine for this can be found easily at any drugstore and many grocery stores.
You might contract a bacteria infection if you don't practice proper cleaning procedures after defecation. Do you wipe front to back or back to front? Wiping back to front introduces bacteria into your vagina and can cause infections.
If you think you might have contracted an STD/STI, just go to the doctor to get tested. This is the kind of thing you need to know for sure, for your own safety and that of those around you. There are organizations which do free or cheap STD testing, like Planned Parenthood, and they are very discreet.;
, The vagina is kind of like a rich ecosystem. Everything has to exist in perfect balance, and that balance can be really easily upset. If you use soap, antibacterial products, take baths that are too hot, go in pools frequently, use scented pads, use lotion too close to your vagina, don't change your underwear often enough or wear underwear of the wrong material, or a large number of other things, you can cause your little ecosystem to get totally out of whack. Basically, avoid using those things and just be very careful about washing every day with water (no soap!) and wearing clean clothes.

, Lots of women don't like the way that their vagina smells, but if you ask their boyfriends those guys will say they love it! Don't underestimate your natural odor. You might associate it with being unclean, but...this is not the case with many guys and women who associate that smell with adult 'activities', not poor hygiene. They don't want you to smell like flowers down there, they want you to smell like...er....well...you. If you've figured out that your smell isn't caused by an imbalance or an infection and that it's really just how you smell, you should probably consider coming to terms with it and embracing it.

, Certain sexual practices can also cause vaginal odor, either from his bacteria colonizing your body or just the smell of sex itself...nevermind if you're taking the sexual practices outside of Missionary 101. Consider if this is the reason you smell different and take whatever measures you believe are warranted.


Just going to put it out there: putting it in your butt and then putting it in your vagina is a terrible idea. At least switch condoms between these activities.

, You know, it happens: sometimes you just forget you have a tampon in there. Sometimes the occasional condom (or piece of) gets left behind. These things can cause an odor as your body tries to get rid of the object. Check for objects and get them out!


Leaving tampons and pads on for too long can also cause smells, even after they've finally been changed. Change them frequently to avoid that.

Take a prenatal vitamin daily.",How to Enjoy Sweets During Pregnancy," If you want to incorporate some sweets into your diet while you're pregnant, it's important to make sure you're only eating them in moderation. If you eat them too often you may gain unnecessary weight.


Determine what ""moderation"" means to you. Is it one sweet a week? Is it two sweets a week?
It's a good idea to give yourself a definitive and specific rule to follow so that you don't end up eating too many sweets. The more specific you are the more likely you are to follow your definition of moderation and not go overboard.
Make sure your definition of moderation fits in with your overall guidance and dietary advice provided by your OB/GYN. You want to be able to enjoy sweets, but not have them effect your health, your baby's health or your weight.;
, When you're incorporating more foods that may be higher in calories or sugar, it's important to stick to appropriate portion sizes. This is what will help keep the overall calories in check.


Always read the food label on sweets that come in a package, box or tub. This will give you the serving size, calories, fat, sugar and other nutrient information. Use this information to make sure the treat you plan on eating fits into your overall meal plan.
If you're purchasing a ""single-serving"" treat, ensure the nutrition panel reads ""one serving"". Sometimes a small bag may seem like one serving, but may be 2 servings instead.
If you're unsure of the serving size (for example, if someone brings in cupcakes to work), aim to eat about 1/2 cup or about 4 oz. This is about 1/2 of the size of your fist.
Another trick is to split desserts and treats with your friends, family or husband. This is an easy way to enjoy desserts that are portion controlled.

, When you're pregnant, you need to be vigilant with your overall nutrition to make sure you're consuming adequate amounts of every nutrient to support your pregnancy. Use your sweet treats to your advantage and choose a treat that also has nutritional benefits.


Dark chocolate. This tasty sweet is full of wonderful nutrients. It's known to be high in antioxidants like flavonoids and flavonols. Dark chocolate may help support a healthy cardiovascular system and protect your body from damage by free radicals.Berries. Raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries are all nutrient power houses. They're also known for being very high in antioxidants and may help prevent anything from diabetes, high blood pressure and cancer to preventing wrinkles.Apple and pears. Both of these fruits are known to be very high in fiber. With about 5-6 grams of fiber per apple or pear, these fruits will help keep your GI in good shape.Nuts. These high protein legumes are also a great source of heart healthy fats. They've been shown to help lower cholesterol levels and reduce your risk of blood clots., You may think that if you want to gain a healthy amount weight during your pregnancy that you should choose low-calorie, ""diet-friendly"" sweet treats. However, you may want to avoid these low-calorie substitutes.


Although it's a great option to have low-calorie, low-fat or low-sugar sweet treats available, many of these ""diet"" treats are overly processed, contain many types of artificial sugars and sweeteners and have many added preservatives and other chemicals.
Although there is no strong research that advises pregnant women to stay away from ingredients like artificial sweeteners, you may want to choose more all natural, less processed foods while you're pregnant.
In addition, ""diet-friendly"" sweets may not taste as good or be as satisfying as the full-fat or ""regular"" versions of desserts. It may be better to have one higher calorie dessert once a week rather than a diet dessert everyday.
Limit or avoid treats like: sugar-free ice-cream, ""100-calorie packs"", sugar-free chocolates and candies, and diet cakes or pies.

, Keep your sweets more nutritious and less processed by making some of your favorites at home. You can control what goes into your treats and keep both calories and sugar in moderation. Try:


Dark chocolate dipped bananas. Freeze halved bananas and then roll the halves in melted dark chocolate. Freeze again and save for when those sweet cravings hit.
Chocolate berry smoothie. Blend together some greek yogurt, milk, a handful of your favorite frozen berries and chocolate syrup for sweet beverage.
Sautéed apples with whipped cream. Sauté some apples or pears with a little butter and cinnamon until they're softened. Top with some chopped nuts and a dollop of whipped cream.

, It's expected and needed for most pregnant women to gain some weight as their belly and baby grows. However, if you're eating too much - especially sweets - you may gain too much weight during your pregnancy.


Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is not safe or healthy for you or your baby. You're more at risk for developing gestational diabetes and having an overweight or obese child.If your BMI is 20.0 to 24.9 you should gain about 25-35 pounds during your pregnancy. If you have a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9, should gain 15 to 25 pounds during your pregnancy. If you have a BMI of 30.0 and above, you should gain 11 to 20 lbs.Track your weight weekly and keep in contact with your OB/GYN to make sure your weight gain and rate is appropriate. If you think you're gaining too much or gaining too quickly you may need to cut down on the amount of sweets you're eating.

, Cravings can be difficult to manage, especially during the first and second trimester. If you catch yourself having sweet cravings on a regular basis, find healthy swaps to help you limit your overall sugar consumption. Find some healthy swaps to help keep your diet more nutritious and moderate in calories.


Eating a higher calorie sweet treat on a regular or daily basis may be too many calories for you. This could cause you to gain too much weight during your pregnancy.
Go for fruit. If you're craving something sweet after a meal, try settling that craving with a sweet piece of fruit. Make sure to choose ripe fruit that has a sweet flavor. Try: bananas, pineapple, mango, peaches or berries.
Have a cup of tea. Another trick to satisfy a sweet craving is by having a cup of hot tea. Pick a flavorful brand with natural sweetness - like orange cinnamon or chai - and add a drop or two of honey or agave syrup.
Have some yogurt. Stock up on some of your favorite yogurt flavors. These are naturally sweet and with some added fruit, this can really satisfy your sweet tooth.

, Another way to manage your sweet cravings is by adding something sweet to your meals. Tasting sweets during your meal can help decrease the desire to end your meal with a treat. Try:


Adding sliced fruit or dried fruit on a salad. Fruit pairs well with many lettuces and dressings and can add a sweet bite to your fresh salads.
End your lunch with a piece of fruit. Pack a piece of fruit with your lunch and eat this last. Whether its a few grapes, a sliced apple or a fruit cup, ending your meal by eating your serving of fruit last leaves the sweet flavor in your mouth.

, Although pregnancy cravings are common, they are not a sign that you need any nutrients or specific foods. Work on moving past and ignoring some of your cravings so that you can stick to your definition of moderation.


If you're having a very strong craving and can't move past it, indulge yourself. However, if it's not an overly strong craving or you know you just had a small bowl of ice cream last night, consider moving past your craving.
Try going for a short walk. A little exercise is a great way to get your mind and eyes off of sweets that may be hanging around your house. Walk for 10-15 minutes at a time and revisit your craving when you get home.
Try calling a friend or family member to help distract you mentally from your craving. You can also ask them to be your support and help you stick to your definition of moderation.
If you have a baby on the way, there are probably plenty of things you can be doing around the house to get you, your family and your home ready for the new baby. Distract yourself by going shopping for things you may need, looking online for a crib, or planning out your new nursery.

, If you're having significant sweet cravings, it can be difficult to manage them or stick to your definition of moderation if your pantry, refrigerator and freezer are full of sweets. Limit how much you keep in your house so you're not so tempted.


If you notice that your cravings are getting worse or you're having difficulty managing them, consider cleaning out your kitchen to help you avoid overdoing it.
First consider getting rid of highly processed processed sweets or those that are overly high in calories or fat. Items like snack cakes, candy or fruit treats do not offer many health benefits and are overly processed.
Keep some of those healthier snacks or sweets on hand. Stock your kitchen with dark chocolate bars, fruit, or some of your homemade treats (like frozen, chocolate dipped bananas).

, In addition to monitoring weight and sweet cravings, it's important to maintain an overall nutritious diet. This means eating the right about of protein for you and your growing baby.


It's typically recommended for pregnant women to eat about 75-100 g of protein each day.Adequate protein helps support your growing baby's development (especially their brain) in addition to supporting the growth of your uterus and breast tissue.Include 1-2 servings of protein at each meal. One serving is about 3-4 oz or about the size of your palm.Choose foods like poultry, eggs, low-fat dairy, lean beef, pork, legumes and tofu. Seafood is another great option but only choose fish and shellfish that are low in mercury and are fully cooked., Another set of important food groups are fruits and vegetables. This is where you will get the majority of your fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants to support a healthy pregnancy.


Aim to eat at least 5-9 servings of fruits and vegetables each day. To get this amount, you'll need to eat at least 1 or 2 servings per meal. Aim for about 1 cup of vegetables, 2 cups of leafy greens and 1/2 cup of fruit.Make sure to focus on folate rich vegetables like: dark greens (turnip greens, kale, spinach and cabbage), tomatoes, oranges, strawberries, mangoes and grapefruit.Folate is essential for the normal growth and development of your baby's brain and spinal column., If you can, when you're choosing to eat foods like, bread, rice, pasta or tortillas, aim to choose 100% whole grains. These foods have many more nutrients that refined grains.


Refined grains are overly processed while whole grains are much less processed. Whole grains contain all the parts of the grain which make them much higher in fiber, protein and other essential nutrients.
In addition, some whole grains are especially high in folate - like bread, cereals, oatmeal, cornmeal and pasta.Serve yourself a 1/2 cup or about 1 oz of whole grains per serving., Like foods, water is another important nutrient that you must consume in adequate quantities for a healthy pregnancy. In addition, you have increased fluid needs during pregnancy making this even more essential.Typically, pregnant women need to drink about 2 or 2 1/2 liters of hydrating fluids each day.Try to stick to calorie-free, decaf beverages as these are the best and most hydrating. Try: water, flavored water, sparkling water, decaf coffee and tea. Even skim milk has some water plus the added protein and calcium., Although you may be eating a very balanced and nutritious diet, it's still important to take a daily prenatal supplement. These are designed to fill in any nutritional gaps that your diet doesn't meet.When you're pregnant you need to make sure you're getting adequate nutrition everyday in order to support your growing baby.
Prenatal vitamins are an easy way to make sure you're doing this. In addition, they are typically higher in folate and iron which are important in the normal development of your baby's brain, spinal cord and the prevention of anemia.Always talk to your OB/GYN prior to starting any supplement - even a prenatal vitamin - to make sure it's safe and appropriate for you.

Ask for help if you don't think you're doing Kegels properly.,
Continue doing your Kegels if you want to keep incontinence at bay.",How to Do Kegel Exercises," Before you do your Kegel exercises, it's important to find your pelvic muscles. These are the muscles that form the floor of your pelvic floor. The most common way to find them is to try to stop the flow of your urine mid-steam. This tightening is the basic move of a Kegel. Let those muscles go and resume the flow of urine and you'll have a better sense of where those Kegels are.Just remember to see a doctor before you begin your Kegel exercises if you have any medical problems that may prevent you from doing Kegels safely.


However, don't stop urinating mid-stream as your regular Kegel exercise routine. Doing Kegels while urinating can actually have the opposite effect, weakening the muscle.;
, You should feel the muscles tightening and your pelvic floor move up. Relax and you'll feel the pelvic floor move back again. Make sure your finger is clean before you insert it into your vagina.If you're a sexually active woman, you can also ask your partner if he can feel you ""hugging"" his penis and letting go during sex.

, If you're still having trouble locating or isolating your Kegels, place a hand mirror below your perineum, which is the skin-covered area between your vagina and your anus. Practice squeezing and relaxing what you think are your Kegel muscles. If you do this correctly, you should see your perineum contracting with each squeeze., This is important. You don't want to do your Kegels with a full or a partially full bladder, or you may experience pain while you do your Kegels, as well as some leakage. Before you start your exercise routine, do a bladder check so you can perform those exercises as efficiently as possible.

, Your Kegel exercises should focus on these muscles only, so you should avoid flexing other muscles, such as your buttocks, thighs, or your abdomen, for best results. To help your concentration and the efficiency of your movements, make sure you breathe in and out as you perform each set of Kegels, instead of holding your breath. This will help you relax and get the most out of your pelvic floor exercises.One way to keep your muscles relaxed is to place one hand on your belly to make sure that your belly is relaxed.
If your back or belly ache a bit after you complete a set of Kegel exercises, then it's an indication that you're not doing them correctly.

, You can do these exercises either sitting in a chair or lying on the floor. Make sure your buttock and tummy muscles are relaxed. If you are lying down, then you should be flat on your back with your arms at your sides and your knees up and together. Keep your head down, too, to avoid straining your neck.

, When you're just starting off, this is a great exercise. You don't want to strain those muscles too much by squeezing them for too long. If five is even too long for you, you can begin by squeezing those muscles for just 2-3 seconds.

, Ideally, you should always give those pelvic floor muscles a ten-second break before you repeat the exercise. This gives them enough time to relax and to avoid strain. Count to ten before you begin the next repetition.

, This can be considered one set of Kegels. If you started off by squeezing those muscles for five seconds, then squeeze them for five seconds, relax them for ten, and repeat this exercise ten times. This should be enough Kegels for one time and you should do the same set of ten 3-4 times a day, but no more., You can increase the amount of seconds that you squeeze those muscles each week. There's no need to do them for any longer, or to do more than one set of them per time. Once you've reached the magic number of ten seconds, stick to it, and continue to do one set of 10 10-second squeezes 3-4 times a day., This is another variation on the Kegel. To perform a pull-in kegel, think of your pelvic floor muscles as a vacuum. Tense your buttocks and pull your legs up and in. Hold this position for 5 seconds and then release it. Do this 10 times in a row. It should take about 50 seconds to complete.

, If you really want them to stick, then you have to make them part of your daily routine. 3-4 times a day should be doable, as each Kegel session won't last very long, and you can find ways of fitting Kegels into your daily routine. You can aim to do them in the morning, afternoon, and evening so begin to do them like clockwork, instead of worrying about scheduling a time to do your Kegels.

, The best part about doing Kegels is that you can do them without anyone knowing. You can do them while you're sitting at your desk in your office, having lunch with your friends, or just relaxing on the couch after a long day at work. Though lying down and isolating your Kegels and focusing hard is important for beginners, once you get the hang of isolating those muscles, you can do your Kegels almost anywhere at anytime.You can even make a habit of doing them during a routine activity, such as checking your mail or email.
Once you've found a set of Kegel exercises that works for you, you should stick to this routine instead of doing even more Kegels, or doing them more strenuously. If you overdo it, you may suffer from straining when you have to urinate or move your bowels.
Just remember that, while stopping urination mid-stream is a great way to locate your Kegels, you should not actually do your Kegels routinely while urinating or you may suffer problems associated with incontinence.

, For some women, the results are dramatic; for others, Kegels prevent further urinary tract problems. Some women get frustrated because they do Kegels for a few weeks and don't feel any difference. Stick with it long enough to feel the changes in your body. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), you may be able to feel results as early as after 4-6 weeks.

, Your doctor can help you identify and isolate the correct muscles to perform the exercise. If you feel like you've been doing Kegels for a considerable amount of time, such as a few months, and have seen no results, then you should seek help from your doctor. Here's what your doctor can do for you:


If necessary, your doctor can provide biofeedback training. This involves placing a monitoring device inside your vagina, and electrodes externally. The monitor can tell you how successful you were in contracting your pelvic floor muscles and how long you were able to hold the contraction.
A doctor can also use electrical stimulation to help you identify the pelvic floor muscles. During this process, a small electrical current adheres to the pelvic floor muscles. When activated, the current automatically contracts the muscle. After some use, you'll most likely be able to reproduce the effect on your own.

, If you want to keep those muscles strong and to keep incontinence away, then you have to continue doing your Kegels. If you stop them, even after months of exercise, your incontinence problems will return. You'll have to work to keep those muscles in shape and should be ready for the commitment."

A lean source of protein, such as a small piece of poultry, hard boiled egg, nuts, low-fat yogurt or cheese, should accompany every snack.
Fruit is a great snack as long as you also eat a protein with it. The water content in most fruits is even higher than many vegetables. The fruit, which is high in sugar, needs a protein to help your body to process it.

, Studies have found high levels of women who report the worst PMS symptoms show deficiencies in calcium.


Low-fat dairy protein choices, such as yogurt, cheese, milk and ice cream, have the added benefit of providing calcium.
Green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach and broccoli are also high in calcium.
Eat fortified products such as breakfast cereals and nutritional bars if you need additional sources of calcium in your diet.

,


Green leafy vegetables chosen for calcium, such as swiss chard and spinach, also have a high level of magnesium.
Snack on sunflower and pumpkin seeds, soybeans, cashews, peanuts and peanut butter, which are all high in magnesium.
Choose whole grain breads, brown rice, potatoes with skins on and salmon whenever they are options. All are healthy sources of magnesium.

, Vitamin B6 may also provide some help with breast tenderness.


Vitamin B-6 is necessary for the body to make dopamine, a mood neurotransmitter. Research is mixed, with some studies concluding that an increase vitamin B-6 is beneficial for PMS sufferers, and others reporting no correlation between the amount of B6 a woman consumes and her PMS symptoms.
Since foods that are high in B-6 are healthy in other ways too, there is no reason not to eat more of them.
Some good sources of vitamin B-6 include lean beef, pork, chicken breast and salmon. Other foods that provide high levels of B-6 are fortified cereals, oatmeal, bananas, lentils and white potatoes with skins on.

, There are a limited number of foods high in manganese including: spinach, collard greens, lima beans, pineapple, raspberries, oats, wheat germ, walnuts and pumpkin seeds.

In addition, walking feels like a more relaxing exercise instead of something more difficult or intense like running or a spin class.


Many studies have shown that walking is a particularly good exercise for relieving PMS symptoms like cramping, bloating and depressed mood.Try going for a 30 minute moderate to brisk walk during the days leading up to and during your menstrual cycle.
Better yet, grab a good friend, your spouse or family member for your walk. Along with the aerobic aspect of walking, the social connection of being with a good friend can help alleviate a depressed or irritable mood.;
, In addition to walking, yoga is another great form of exercise to do when you are experiencing PMS symptoms. Yoga is relaxing, is great for stress and can alleviate the aches and cramps associated with PMS.Some particularly good yoga poses to try include:


Seated twist. This is an easy pose that can help massage your lower abdomen and work to relieve cramps. While sitting, cross one leg over the other placing your foot flat on the floor. Your crossed leg should be bent with your knee facing the ceiling. Twist your torso in the opposite direction of the bent leg. Hold this position for a few seconds and then switch sides.
Wind pose. This is another great pose to help relieve cramps and bloating. Lay flat on your back to start. Bring both of your legs up to your chest in a bent position. Wrap your arms around your shins and hold for a few seconds.
Child's pose. This is a calming and de-stressing yoga pose. Kneel on the floor to start. Fold your upper body over your legs and allow your forehead to rest on the floor. Lay your arms on the floor behind you. Hold this position for a few moments.

, You may not associate being in a bathing suit or swimming with a PMS exercise. However, being in the water is a great way to get in some exercise and also help relieve some PMS symptoms.Swimming, like walking or using the elliptical, is a low-impact exercise. You avoid the hard jumping or pounding associated with exercises like running or jumping.
Swimming is also great for PMS because the water helps your body feel light and agile. Plus, the cooling sensation of the water can help you feel a little more relaxed and ease any aches or pains you may have with PMS symptoms.
You can try doing a few laps, do water walking or jogging or try out a water aerobics class. Aim to be moving or swimming for at least 30 minutes.

, Very similar to yoga, there are some stretches and flexibility training exercises that can also help relieve symptoms of PMS. These exercises are particularly good for cramping, tension headaches or back and neck pain.Try doing a forward bend. This can be done anytime you feel your neck, shoulders or back tightening up. Stand with feet hip width apart and allow your torso to fold over so your head hangs towards the floor. Let your upper body relax and all your muscles go limp. Hold here and repeat as many times as needed.
Try doing a reclined butterfly stretch. Sit on the floor with your legs bent into a butterfly stretch. The bottoms of your feet should be touching each other and legs bent. Recline down to the floor so you are lying on your back. Allow your legs to relax open.
Also try a reclined hamstring stretch. Lay on the floor with your feet straight out in front of you. Bring one knee up to your chest and gently pull your knee closer to your body with your hands. Hold here for a few moments and then switch sides.
Try a seated forward bend. Sit on the floor with your legs out in front of you. Spread your legs open so they're at a 45 degree angle from your body. Inhale deeply and fold your torso over in front of you. Hold this position for a few seconds while you exhale. Repeat as you desire.

, Exercise is one of the best remedies of the host of PMS symptoms that women experience the week or two prior to the start of their cycle. It can help relieve cramping, bloating, headaches, moodiness, aches and depression.Try to stay active the entire month to get the best PMS relief.


Studies have shown that the more active you are, especially in regards to cardio, the less likely you are to experience intense PMS symptoms.For example, those that participated in the 150 minutes of cardio weekly had less painful and intense cramping during their cycle.
Most health professionals recommend aiming for at least 150 minutes of aerobic activities each week. This could include walking, jogging, hiking, dancing, swimming or taking a spin class.
In addition to cardio, go for a day or two of strength training as well. These exercises don't affect PMS symptoms all that much, but will round out your workouts during the week.

, Even if you're not planning on being active during your period, it's important to drink a lot of fluids. When you're exercising, it's even more important to drink an adequate amount of fluid to prevent dehydration.It's important to drink adequate fluids before and during your menstrual cycle. Many women experience some fluid or water retention which can be eased by ensuring you're drinking an adequate amount of water and other beverages.
When you're exercising, you can help relieve the annoying feeling of being bloated or heavy. However, you'll need to take extra care to make sure you're replacing all the fluids lost through sweat.
You should aim for 10 to 13 glasses of clear, hydrating fluids. Aim to drink 1 to 2 ounces of water per kilogram of body weight. For example, if you weigh 70 kilograms (154 pounds), then you would need to drink between 70 and 140 ounces per day depending on your activity level.
Definitely skip the alcohol and caffeine during this time.Go for water, sparkling water, flavored water or decaf coffee and tea.

, Even without PMS symptoms, it is important to wear clothing that is comfortable during exercise. This is especially true if you're experiencing PMS symptoms. You'll want to feel comfortable in your clothes when you may not be feeling 100%.


To start, go for stretchy or looser fitting clothes. You may want to go for a stretchy pair of yoga pants or a baggy t-shirt instead of a fitted top.
Also, if you feel uncomfortable about the heaviness of your flow (or the possible start of your flow) consider wearing dark colored pants (like black, dark grey or dark navy blue).
Another component to consider is your sports bra. If you experience breast tenderness or swollen breasts as part of your PMS symptoms, wear a comfortable sports bra that will give you a lot of support if you're doing an activity like jogging or using the elliptical.

, Whether you're going for a swim, relaxing in the steam room or going for a jog, it's important to have the right type of products on hand to make sure you can exercise comfortably.If you're experiencing PMS symptoms, that doesn't mean you have to skip the pool or avoid swimming. Make sure to wear a tampon instead of a sanitary pad. It's a complete myth that you have to avoid the pool or ocean on your cycle.
Some women may feel more comfortable using a sanitary pad or panty liner with exercises. These will work just as well and can be a good back up if you're worried about leaking.
Regardless of which item you choose, you'll be OK to exercise. Even tough workouts do not cause an increase in flow.

, It can be difficult to get motivated and feel comfortable enough during your cycle to exercise. However, the more proactive you are with managing your PMS symptoms, the easier it will be to stick to an exercise routine.


Track your symptoms on a calendar or PMS app. This can help you start treating PMS symptoms or preparing for them before they begin. This can help you avoid getting to the point where you feel horrible and don't want to exercise at all.
A few days before you think you'll begin to experience PMS symptoms, try upping your water intake, increasing your aerobic exercise and minding your diet.
Also consider planning in special exercises during the upcoming week that can help relax you and ease your symptoms. For example, ask a friend to plan a few walks with you during the week, or sign up for some water aerobics classes at your gym.

, Diet can play a really important role in managing PMS symptoms. There are items that can help ease PMS and even prevent some symptoms. In addition, there are foods that can aggravate them as well.Try making these changes in addition to focusing on your exercise routine:


Focus on eating smaller meals. This can help reduce the feeling of being full or bloated during the day.
Also go for lean protein, fruits, 100% whole grains and vegetables. This balanced diet can help provide you with adequate amounts of iron and other essential nutrients.
You may want to avoid gas-producing vegetables to help minimize bloating. Consider skipping foods like beans, lentils, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower.
In addition, skip alcohol, caffeine, salty foods or high fat foods (like fast foods, fried foods or junk food treats).

, When you're experiencing PMS symptoms, it may seem easy to get overly stressed or anxious about things going on in your life. The hormone fluctuations do not make managing stress easy, so take care to find stress-relieving activities. Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and manage symptoms. The following practices can also help:


Talk to someone. An easy way to manage stress, moodiness or depression during your cycle is by talking to a friend, family member or therapist. Spend some time together or consider working out together.
Spend time meditating, sit down with a good book, watch a good movie or listen to your favorite music.
Consider doing acupuncture. It's been shown to help relieve stress and some common PMS symptoms., From vitamin supplements to herbal supplements, there are a variety of over the counter items that you can take to ease PMS symptoms. Give some of these ideas a try:


Go for a multivitamin. This all in one supplement has iron, folate and Vitamin E which are all great for PMS symptoms.
Include a fish oil or omega-3 supplement. Studies have shown that these healthy fats can also curb PMS symptoms.
Try herbal remedies. There are a few herbal remedies that may also help ease PMS symptoms. Try raspberry leaf, chaste berry or valerian root supplements.

, You may already rely on some of the common over-the-counter medications designed for PMS symptoms. However, these can be great medications to use proactively so you feel good enough to get in a good workout.Take ibuprofen or naproxen. These medications provide the best relief for menstrual cramps.
If you only experience mild cramping or headaches, you might do well with a pain reliever. Avoid a pain reliever with added caffeine.
If you experience a wider range of PMS symptoms, there are some medications that help relieve multiple symptoms. Most include a pain reliever, diuretic and medications to help you feel less bloated.
Regardless of what symptoms you experience, treat them immediately. The quicker you address them, the quicker you'll feel good enough to get in a PMS relieving workout.

, Holding a heating pad against your abdomen or lower back can also help to ease menstrual cramps.Try using a heating pad for 10 to 15 minutes at a time and then remove it and allow your skin to return to its normal temperature.

You can also try adhesive heating pads if you want to use one while you are on the go.
Another option is to take a warm bath. Try taking a bath after a workout to help soothe your cramps and relax your muscles.

Stop using fragrant body washes and soaps.,
Avoid using douches to clean your vaginal area.,
Eat yogurt.,
Avoid foods that contain a lot of sugar and yeast.,
Stop taking really hot baths or showers.,
Avoid pads and panty liners outside of your period.",How to Eliminate Vaginal Odor2," It is best to use a mild soap with warm water. Soaps that are too harsh or have too many chemicals and fragrances can actually make your vagina produce more discharge that gives off the foul smell.


Make sure you aren't putting any soap too close to your vagina. You can use soap to clean your pubic hair, but try to keep it away from your vagina. Soap of any kind can throw off the delicate balance of your body.

, Douching can alter the balance of healthy bacteria in your vagina, causing other bacteria to grow and create a foul vaginal odor. You should douche only if asked to by a doctor or gynecologist.

, Yogurt that contains live cultures introduces probiotics (or good bacteria) into your body. This can reverse the problem if you have a mild case or a yeast infection that is just starting out, and acts as a great preventative measure if you start the treatment before the problem develops further.

, Foods such as bread and beer contain yeast, and the sugar in other foods turns into yeast. These foods can increase the amount of yeast in your vagina, causing a yeast infection.

, This can kill your body's natural bacteria. Try taking warm baths or showers to see if it helps reduce your vaginal odor. Doing this step alone will probably not help you, however, so make sure to take a few other suggestions as well.

, You want vaginal discharge to be wicked away from your body, not held close next to it by items like panty liners and pads. Use these only when you need them and absolutely do not use scented products (as these can throw off your body's natural balance).

Wear cotton underwear.,
Wear perfume.,
Apply a mixture of tea tree oil and water to the vaginal area.,
Drink 1 tbsp.,
Soak yourself in apple cider vinegar.",How to Eliminate Vaginal Odor3," Panty hose and any synthetic material will block some air flow to the area. Loose cotton garments will give the region more ventilation, which will help get rid of vaginal odor over time. Wearing silky, fancy knickers once in a while for a special occur is unlikely to harm you. You are not compelled to wear loose cotton knickers every day for the rest of your life..

, You can wear perfume normally to generally help reduce the smell, but if you have reason to think that someone special is going down there and you want to make sure you smell great, dab a very small amount of perfume about 4"" up from your knee (on your inner thigh). Choose a perfume with a musky scent, as this will most closely resemble your natural smell.

, Mix 6 oz. (170 grams) of water with 2 drops of tea tree oil. Tea tree oil is antibacterial and anti-fungal, and will help get rid of bacteria that are contributing to your strong vaginal odor.

, (15 ml) of liquid chlorophyll mixed into 8 oz. of water twice a day. Chlorophyll comes from green plants and is a natural internal deodorizer. The chlorophyll may make your tongue turn blackish, or your urine and feces a little green. These are common side effects and should not be something to worry about.

, Apple cider vinegar is a natural anti-bacterial. Add 1 to 2 cups (240 to 470 ml) of it to your bathwater and soak for 20 minutes. The vinegar should help to get rid of toxins and bacteria that is causing your vaginal odor.

Live your life with TS.",How to Diagnose Turner Syndrome," Many cases of TS are detected inadvertently and while a baby is still in the womb. A typical prenatal ultrasound can often reveal several indicators of the condition, although specific testing is required for a diagnosis of TS.


Lymphoedema, a swelling of the body’s tissues, is a frequent prenatal indicator of TS and can often be picked up on an ultrasound. If it is detected, testing for TS may be warranted.Lymphoedema on the back of the neck is a strong indicator of TS. Other common prenatal indicators include specific heart and kidney abnormalities.Certain anomalies noted on fetal ultrasound warrant a karyotype analysis on fetal cord blood or neonate’s blood to check for TS.;
, If not detected in the womb, many cases of TS are clearly indicated as soon as a female child is born. When these physical indicators are present at birth or during early life, genetic testing to confirm or rule out TS should be done.


If not detected in the womb, lymphoedema or heart or kidney abnormalities after birth are possible signs of TS.Additionally, newborns with TS may have one or more of the following: wide or web-like necks; small lower jaws; broad chests (""shield chests"") with widely-spaced nipples; short fingers and toes; upward turned fingernails; below-average height and growth rate; and other possible signs., Karyotype testing is a chromosomal analysis that will detect the abnormality that causes TS. For newborn girls onward, a simple blood draw is all that is required to begin the testing process. Karyotype testing is very accurate in diagnosing TS.For fetuses still in the womb, an ultrasound that indicates possible TS will usually be followed by testing of the mother’s blood, which contains traces of fetal DNA. If this also indicates TS, testing of a sample of the placenta or of the amniotic fluid can confirm the condition.

, In a small number of cases, signs of TS do not become apparent until a girl reaches her teens or even early adulthood. A female that is consistently well below average height or seems to never experience a ""growth spurt"" may benefit from testing for TS.Generally speaking, if a teen girl is 8 inches (20 cm) or more below average height, testing for TS may be warranted.

, Most females with TS have ovarian failure that causes infertility and prevents the onset of puberty. This failure can occur early in life or progressively over time, making it possible that it will not become apparent until the teen years.If there is little indication of the start of puberty — body hair growth, breast development, menstruation, sexual maturation, etc. — in a girl who is well into her teens, TS should be considered a strong possibility., TS can also impact the mental and emotional development of some females, and these effects may not be as noticeable during early childhood. If, however, as a teen or young adult, a girl has social difficulties due to an inability to ""read"" others' emotions and responses, TS should be considered.Additionally, teen girls with TS may have a particular learning disability in regards to spatial concepts. This, for instance, may become more apparent as mathematics classes become increasingly advanced. This doesn't mean that any girl having trouble in math class has TS, of course, but it may be worth consideration when other factors are present.

, Just because a girl is especially short, has kidney problems, has a low hairline on the neck, or has not started puberty by the typical age range does not mean she has TS. Visual cues and common symptoms can only indicate TS; a medical diagnosis via genetic testing is the only way to confirm the condition.Karyotype genetic testing to accurately diagnose TS requires only a blood draw and a wait of a week or two for the lab results. It is simple and highly accurate.
Most cases of TS are detected and diagnosed before or shortly after birth, but if you suspect an undiagnosed case, seek a medical opinion promptly. The sooner the condition is confirmed (if present), the sooner important treatments can begin. A timely use of growth hormones, for instance, can make a significant difference in the final height of a female with TS., TS is caused by a missing, partly missing, or abnormal “X” chromosome in a female. All indications are that this is a random developmental occurrence, and that family history plays no role. This means, for instance, that you are no more likely to have a second child with TS if you already have one with the condition.A male gets an X chromosome from his mother and a Y chromosome from his father; A female gets two X’s, one from each parent. Females with TS, however, are either missing one of the X’s (monosomy); have one X that is damaged or partly missing (mosaicism); or have traces of Y chromosomal material mixed in.TS occurs in about 1 in 2,500 female births worldwide. This ratio, however, is much higher among miscarried and stillborn females, of which TS can play a significant role. Testing improvements also mean that an indeterminate (but likely higher) ratio of fetuses with TS are aborted., Beyond the typical impacts on physical growth and reproductive development, the possible effects of TS are wide-ranging and can vary greatly from person to person. The precise nature of the X chromosome abnormality and a host of other factors play into determining just how TS will affect a female. Expect, however, to face numerous challenges.Complications arising from TS can include, but are by no means limited to: heart and kidney defects; increased risks for diabetes and high blood pressure; hearing loss; vision, dental, and skeletal problems; immune disorders such as an underactive thyroid; infertility (in nearly all cases) or significant pregnancy complications; and psychological conditions such as ADHD., Females with TS are 30% more likely to have congenital heart defects, and 30% more likely to have kidney abnormalities. All females diagnosed with TS, therefore, should undergo a cardiac evaluation and renal ultrasound, and continue to have regular checkups with specialists in these areas.A female with TS should also undergo regular blood pressure, thyroid, and hearing tests, among other tests and examinations recommended by her medical team.
Managing TS requires regular and ongoing medical care from a team of medical specialists from a variety of fields, which can be a daunting prospect; however, in most cases, this team-oriented approach will permit females with TS to live largely independent and healthy lives., A Turner Syndrome diagnosis, whether it occurs before birth or during early adulthood, is far from a death sentence. Females with TS are every bit as capable of living long, active, fulfilling lives as anyone else. Proper diagnosis and treatment are essential for making this possibility a reality, though.Treatments for TS usually include growth hormone therapy, to increase final height; estrogen therapy, to spur physical and sexual development as associated with puberty; and symptom treatments (such as for a heart or kidney condition).Fertility treatments can in some cases enable women with TS to bear children, but most women with the condition remain infertile. A normal, active sex life is almost always possible regardless of fertility status.

Understand when the cervix would need to be dilated.,
Know the risks of inducing labor.,
Talk to your doctor about medication used to dilate the cervix.,
Find out if a mechanical dilator will be used.",How to Dilate the Cervix1," Since the dilation of the cervix happens when labor moves from ""early"" to ""active,"" intervening in the process instead of letting it occur naturally is essentially the same as inducing labor. There are a number of reasons why a doctor or midwife might determine this to be the best course of action:


If you're two weeks past your due date with no signs of early labor.If your water has broken but no contractions have occurred.
If you have an infection in the later stages of pregnancy.
If there's a problem with your placenta.
If you have a medical condition that might pose a risk if you wait too long to have the baby.
If you're undergoing a dilation and curettage procedure.;
, Inducing labor should not be done as a matter of convenience, since it can pose risks to both the mother and the baby. Inducing labor should not be done lightly - be sure you understand exactly what your body will experience before you agree to taking medication. Inducing labor increases the risk of these complications:


Having a C-section.Premature birth.
Lowering the baby's heart rate and oxygen intake.
Contracting infection.
Uterine rupture.

, The most common medication used for this purpose is synthetic prostaglandin. Dinoprostone and misoprostol are two synthetic prostaglandins that may be used. Both of these medications are administered vaginally or orally.


These medications have side effects that may impact the health of the baby. Be sure to talk with your doctor about the risks involved before taking medication.

, Sometimes doctors use implements that will dilate the cervix mechanically, rather than chemically. Either a balloon-tipped catheter or a type of seaweed called laminaria is inserted inside the cervical opening.


Once the balloon-tipped catheter is inserted, saline is injected into the balloon, causing it to expand and dilate the cervix.
Laminaria is a type of seaweed native to Japan that forms a thick, sticky gel when wet. The dried stems of the seaweed are formed into ""tents"" that will swell up gradually. A layer of this substance is placed just inside the cervix, around the neck of the uterus to promote cervical dilation. Although laminaria has been used both prior to dilation and curettage and to stimulate labor, the safety of its use during pregnancy has not been proven at this time.

Think years ahead.",How to Donate Eggs," Donating your eggs is a very emotional experience for all parties involved, yet is still a legal contract.Be sure you have someone that is looking out for your best interest legally.The legal matters also include your financial compensation. Make arrangements up front with all parties involved to ensure that the financial matters are clearly understood by everyone. The reimbursement for this type of third party reproduction assistance can vary from state to state, so do some research so you are aware of what to expect. Generally, around $8000 is considered a fair rate of compensation.;
, Most egg donations are done in this manner.You will not know the woman receiving your egg donation and she will not know you.Potential recipients will have access to general physical information about you. That information includes a picture of you, your blood type, ethnic family history, height, weight, body type and build, eye color, hair color and texture.In addition to your physical characteristics, potential recipients are given basic personality information about you, such as your level of education, occupation, special interests or hobbies, and your family’s medical history.Your personal contact information is not shared., Some programs honor any wishes for the donor and recipient to meet in person.All parties involved must agree to the meeting.You may also be provided the opportunity to choose to meet the child that may be conceived and born as a result of your egg donation, once that child reaches an adult age., This is done to improve the odds of maintaining the pregnancy for the recipient.The clinic will use medications to synchronize your cycle with that of the recipient once you have been selected or matched.You may be matched with more than one person for a single donation procedure., Hormone supplements, meaning birth control pills, are given to synchronize your menstrual cycle with that of the recipient.You will take birth control pills for a short time, usually not more than two to three weeks.The doctor in charge of your care will work with both you and the recipient to be sure your cycles match., The initial series of injections are used to interrupt the function of your ovaries.Injectable medications that stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs are given next.One egg is released from the ovaries every month in a normal menstrual cycle. When you donate eggs, hormone injections are given which stimulate the production of more than one egg for that cycle.Harvesting more eggs increases the chances that one will be viable and increases the option to donate to more than one recipient during the same procedure., The calendar or schedule provided will include the exact timing of the injections and schedule of clinic visits.Following the schedule exactly is critical to the success of the egg donation procedure.Some of the injections can be self-administered at home. You, or someone close to you, will be taught how to administer the injections., Ultrasound technology is used to monitor your progress as you move further into the program.Many clinics require short, but daily, appointments to evaluate your progress.The daily appointments usually last for about two weeks.After the two weeks of daily evaluations, you will undergo the procedure to have your eggs retrieved., The actual procedure to donate your eggs usually takes about 30 minutes.You will be put under a mild form of anesthesia so someone will need to be with you to drive you home.The eggs are retrieved through the vagina using ultrasound guided techniques for oocyte aspiration.Most women can resume normal activity the following day., This is referred to as direct donation.The majority of women that participate in direct egg donation are donating an egg to a close friend or family member.The most compelling reason women cite in deciding to donate eggs is a desire to help a woman struggling with infertility.
Having a child is an extremely personal and emotional event. Even if you are working with a close friend or a family member, proceeding with egg donation is a very intense and emotional decision since there is still a possibility of failure.Choose a clinic that you both agree on, and seek legal advice to protect all parties involved before you begin the procedure.One additional area to resolve when working with a close friend or family member is the disclosure of information to the child. Come to terms with this matter before you begin., Some women will place ads on the internet or other forms of media.Take appropriate precautionary steps if you choose to donate to someone you met through an advertisement.It is not recommended that somebody who is poverty-stricken donate because this could be an unfair compulsion for them to do so.

, Talk to someone that knows the laws regarding third party reproduction.The laws are constantly changing in the area of third party reproduction, which includes donating your eggs to another woman. Also seek legal counsel about handling payment arrangements in a manner that protects you.Take care to have a third party involved, such as an informed lawyer, that will look out for your best interest if you choose to work with someone that you met via an advertised need for an egg donor.Select a clinic together that suits your needs and the needs of the recipient. Proceed confidently, but carefully, with legal documents in hand.Have your lawyer arrange the payment in such a manner that protects you from any changes that may be decided by the recipient. Remember, egg donation is not a guaranteed method of conceiving. You deserve to be paid in full even if the recipient is not able to maintain the pregnancy., Universities that offer medical programs often have a third party reproduction program, which includes egg donor programs.If you live in a larger city, especially one with a major medical center, there may be clinics or programs that are easy for your to access.Keep in mind that you will need to be able to keep very frequent appointments, so you should look for a clinic or program that is close to your work, school, or home., The responsibilities of egg donors may vary slightly depending on the agency or program you decide to work with, but most are consistent with recommendations of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.You are responsible for providing truthful information about your medical history and your activities throughout the process.Follow all instructions exactly as stated by the doctor in charge of your donation procedure.Strictly adhere to the medication schedule provided for you.Do not miss, or be late for, a monitoring appointment.Be sure you have adequate transportation to and from all appointments and procedures.Donate your eggs, also called oocytes, via aspiration as outlined in the agreement.Do not have sex once you have started the medication provided, and for three weeks after the egg donation process has been completed. You can more easily get pregnant during this time.Avoid using any recreational drugs or taking medications other than what has been approved or prescribed by the doctor providing your care during the donation process., The process begins with basic questions and possibly a phone interview to determine your appropriateness for egg donation.Most programs include women that are between the ages of 21 and 34. Some may only include women up to the age of 30.The first steps involve answering basic questions about your background, your personal medical history, and information about the medical history of your family.The next step will involve meeting with a psychologist. Donating eggs can be a very emotional experience. The psychologists will evaluate your mental status and your ability to make an informed decision.The psychologist will want to understand your motivation for donating eggs as well as help you understand possible long-term effects may be relevant to you.Meet with a genetics counselor. Blood tests may be ordered to determine the presence of any genetic links to possible diseases. The presence of genes for some diseases may prevent you from donating your eggs.Part of the genetic and psychological screening will include questions about your personal and family history of mental health conditions that can be passed on genetically.

, The first part of the medical evaluation is similar to a basic gynecological exam.This part will include a pelvic exam, cervical cultures, and blood work to determine the presence of any infectious diseases and to evaluate your current hormone levels., Most women can continue their routine work or school schedule, provided they understand the need to make frequent clinic appointments and adhere strictly to the schedule provided by the clinic.The screening process usually takes about two weeks. The entire process can take as long as four to six weeks, but may vary depending on the length of time between the initial screening and being matched with a recipient., There are several drugs used during the process that manipulates your menstrual cycle.Drugs commonly used during this procedure fall into four categories. The first is regular birth control pills used to regulate your menstrual cycle.The second category is called gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analogues. This group of drugs suppress the release of eggs from the ovaries, allowing the doctors to control the timing of the development of mature eggs.Follicle stimulating hormone injections come next, given by daily injections. This type of drug is given to encourage multiple eggs to mature.The final agent given is human chorionic gonadotropin. This drug triggers ovulation once the eggs have matured., Understand that your exposure to any given agent is short. While side effects are always possible, women that participate in egg donation most often do not experience caused by the medications given due to the brief exposure.The use of birth control pills may cause a feeling of abdominal pressure and bloating, abdominal pain and swelling, breast tenderness and moodiness. These symptoms usually resolve by the next menstrual cycle following the procedure.Common side effects caused by the second group of medications used, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analogues,include hot flashes, joint pain, headache, feeling bloated, vaginal dryness, and mood changes.The third class of drugs, follicle stimulating agents, can cause side effects such as abdominal discomfort, bloating, and nausea.The last agent given, human chorionic gonadotropin, can possibly lead to the development of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or OSSH.While OSSH is a possible complication, it is a rare event, reported to occur between 0.1% and 10% of women participating in egg donor programs.The condition of OSSH can result in fluid accumulation in the chest and abdominal area, and enlargement of the ovaries. In some cases this can cause permanent injury and possibly death., Sometimes women can develop mild skin reactions where the needle from the drug or the lab work has penetrated their skin.


Common problems reported from either the injections or from the lab work done include pain, redness, or bruising at the site of the blood draw or the injection., Most women have little to no discomfort from the actual procedure.The documented risk of serious problems caused by the procedure is rare, about 1 in 1000 women.The most serious complications from the procedure include bleeding that requires observation in a hospital setting, the possible need for a blood transfusion, and possible damage to internal organs.Since the ovaries are located in close proximity to other major organs like the bladder, uterus, bowel, and kidneys, it is possible to cause structural damage to the surrounding areas. This occurs approximately 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 cases.Some research suggests that 1.5% of women that participated in egg donor procedures experienced complications severe enough to warrant hospitalization.The procedure is minimally invasive therefore it also carries a slight risk of infection.You may be give a prescription for a short course of antibiotics to cover the risk of any possible infection from the procedure.Minor discomfort reported by some women usually resolves once the procedure is complete., The physicians at the clinic will have standard protocols in place to monitor your health throughout the procedures and for several weeks following the procedure.


Talk to the doctors at the clinic to better understand how they monitor for possible complications including drug reactions, and how they take care of you should a problem arise.
Be sure you have a written document that clearly states the responsibilities of the clinic in providing care for you should any problems be caused by the medications given or the procedure itself.

, The desire to have your own children in the future is an important consideration.


There is no evidence of an increase in the risk of infertility as a result of being an egg donor.There has also been no evidence to suggest an increase in the risk of developing ovarian cancer that is associated with the drugs and procedures used to donate eggs., Most clinics provide at least one follow-up appointment.In addition to scheduled follow-up appointments, you will be given clear instructions regarding any sudden need for medical attention following the procedure.The follow-up appointments include a medical check-up to be sure you have resumed your normal menstrual cycle, and often includes a session with a psychologist to help answer any remaining questions you may have and to help you provide healthy emotional closure to the procedure of donating eggs., Consult your legal counsel regarding the possible rights of the child in the years to come.The laws regarding third party reproduction assistance, including egg donation, are evolving. The answers regarding your privacy and the rights of the unborn child are not clear.There are no guarantees regarding confidentiality beyond what is agreed upon by you and the recipient at the time of the procedure.The legal rights of the unborn child in situations such as this are being debated. There is no way to know today what the choices of the unborn child will be regarding their potential right to identify those that biologically contributed to their birth."

Know the normal reasons your discharge may change.,
Don't worry about ""cleaning out"" your normal discharge.,
Examine the color and texture of your vaginal discharge.,
Evaluate the vaginal discharge.,
Consider other causes of abnormal discharge.,
Consult your physician.,
Make an appointment with your physician.,

Have your samples sent to a lab for testing.,
Wait for your test results.",How to Diagnose Vaginal Discharge," The vagina has a specialized lining, which contains glands that excrete small amounts of fluid every day. The purpose of regular, daily vaginal discharge is to collect old, sloughed cells and possible pathogens or ""foreign bodies"", and to expel them from the vagina. In addition, this discharge encourages a healthy balance of bacteria and yeast which protects against infection.


In other words, most vaginal discharge is good for you. Discharge is a natural way that your body protects itself.
Women will have a normal discharge every 80 minutes during sleep. This is a normal physiologic function (men as well have an erection every 80 minutes during sleep).;
, Normal vaginal discharge is usually clear or milky-white and may have a mild, if any, odor. It can be watery or thick and mucus-y, but the consistency should be relatively smooth and lump free most of the time.In premenopausal women, it is normal to have about 1 teaspoon of white or clear vaginal discharge every day.However, the amount and characteristics of vaginal discharge can vary from one woman to another.

, There are a number of reasons that your vaginal discharge may look, smell or appear slightly different. If you're concerned about your discharge, run through this quick check list to see if you are experiencing or have recently experienced any of the following conditions. These are the most common - but completely normal - reasons your discharge may change:



Ovulation: During ovulation, there is usually an increased volume of discharge. This discharge is more clear, stretchy, and slippery. The purpose of this change is to allow easier passage of sperm during the time that an egg is ready for fertilization.Menstruation: Discharge that is thick and white typically makes an appearance just before and after your menstrual cycle.Pregnancy and post-partum: Pregnant women often notice an increase in the amount of discharge and a change in its consistency. This is especially noticeable in the last few weeks before delivery, when discharge can become thicker and more voluminous. After delivery, women will experience discharge termed “lochia."" This particular discharge consists of blood, small clots, and sloughed-off tissue from the lining of the uterus that built-up over the course of pregnancy. Over time, it will change into a watery, pink discharge and eventually subside.Menopause: The normal amount of vaginal discharge typically decreases during menopause as estrogen levels fall.Sexual arousal: Watery discharge that is clear or slightly white is a sign of sexual excitement. The purpose of this discharge is to provide lubrication to protect the vagina during sex., Your discharge is your body’s natural way of protecting itself. Douching is advisable only on rare occasions.


If you don't like the feeling of wetness on your underwear and clothing, consider wearing a panty-liner in your underwear. These can be purchased at grocery stores, drug stores and pharmacies, and convenience stores. You can also make your own pantyliners out of fabrics you have around the house, or bought from a craft store, if you want a cheaper and more natural solution.

, If it looks different from the vaginal discharge you usually secrete, then there is a chance that it is abnormal and a symptom of an infection or change in the vaginal environment. A good rule of thumb is that if the discharge isn't clear or white, then you may have a problem. The most common symptoms of a pathology include: White, thick, lumpy discharge that is itchy.
Green and foamy discharge.
Grayish, yellowish, brownish or greenish discharge.
Foul-smelling discharge.
Discharge accompanied by pain, itchiness or burning, bleeding, etc.
Discharge that it is heavier or thicker than usual.

, Having examined the discharge, now assess which of the conditions that can cause abnormal discharge may apply to you. If your discharge does not fall in the ‘normal’ range of colors and textures, it may be a result of one of the following:



Bacterial vaginosis: This is the most common cause of abnormal discharge in women of childbearing age.Bacterial vaginosis is a mild vaginal infection caused by ""bad"" bacteria. Essentially there are ""good"" and bad types of bacteria and the good types help to regulate the growth of the bad types. In cases of bacterial vaginosis this balance is upset and there are too many bad bacteria.Symptoms include grayish-yellow, slippery, and fishy-smelling discharge as well as itching or burning in the vagina. Most discharges with odor are due to bacterial vaginosis.Vaginal candidiasis (yeast infection): If your discharge is white but thick and lumpy (think cottage cheese), it could be a sign of a yeast infection. In addition to the change in texture and color, you may also notice itching and burning sensations. Yeast infections do not usually produce a strong scent. These infections are the second most common type of vaginal infection among women. They are particularly likely to occur after a regimen of antibiotics, in patients with diabetes or immunocompromised patients.Trichomoniasis: Discharge that is slightly green in hue and ‘frothy’ in texture is typically a symptom of trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis is an infection with trichomonas, a single-cell parasite which is passed between sexual partners. This infection, the third most common infection that can affect your vaginal discharge, can also cause vaginal itching or pain.STIs (Sexually Transmitted Infections): The common STIs chlamydia and gonorrhea can sometimes have the sole symptom of increased vaginal discharge. The characteristics of this discharge can vary, but it is often discolored (i.e. gray, yellow, green), thick, and foul-smelling. Women may also notice pain during sexual activity, as well as spotting or brown discharge afterward.Bacterial vaginosis, Candidiasis, and Trichomoniasis can also be spread sexually.

Vaginal or cervical cancer: Keep in mind that cancer of the vagina or cervix is a very rare cause of abnormal discharge., There are a lot of things than can affect the vaginal environment.


Exposing the vagina to a new type of cleaning agent or hygiene product can have an effect on it. Chemicals found in detergents and fabric softeners, feminine sprays, creams, douches, and contraceptive foams or jellies or creams may irritate the vagina and/or the skin around the vagina. Medications, such as antibiotics, can also increase the possibility of infection. Any of these may be causing your symptoms and the changes in your vaginal discharge. Think about what you have used most recently and when your discharge began to seem different to you. Once you are able to narrow the potential cause down, try eliminating it and seeing if your symptoms disappear. For example, if you recently changed to a new laundry detergent, avoid using it for a while and return to your old brand. If your symptoms go away, then you may have found the culprit! If your symptoms persist, however, even after you've considered any new chemicals that may have recently been added to your environment, you should visit your doctor. Systemic illnesses that can also alter the balance of the vaginal environment. For example, women with diabetes have an increased risk of fungal infections (like yeast infections).A not uncommon cause of vaginal discharge with a foul odor is a tampon that has been left in and forgotten. If you suspect that you may have left a tampon inside of yourself, you can do your own investigation. Begin by washing your hands and then squatting or placing one foot on the edge of your bathtub or toilet. Reach up inside your vagina as far as you can reach and feel around for anything. If you find a tampon but can't locate the string to pull it out, then use your finger and thumb to grab onto it and pull it out. Make sure the tampon is still generally intact; if it has started to disintegrate and you are unsure that you pulled all of the pieces out, contact your doctor as nothing should be left behind. Note that if you feel all the way up to your cervix and find nothing, there is likely nothing up there. If you still suspect that there is something up there but that you couldn't find it, contact your doctor, who can do a more thorough check for you., If after self-examination, you believe your discharge is abnormal, visit your doctor. Though it's useful to pay attention to your body and its many changes, don't rely on your own diagnosis as confirmation of particular condition. Let your health care provider examine you, run any necessary tests, and decide on a course of action or treatment.One exception here may be if you've had a yeast infection (Vaginal candidiasis) in the past and feel confident in your ability to self-diagnose this infection based on your previous experience. Treatments for yeast infection are readily available over-the-counter at pharmacies and drug stores and can be administered at home. However, if the infection persists after this over-the-counter, standard treatment for candidiasis, it is highly advisable that you visit your physician.

, You should try to see your doctor as soon as you notice or suspect that your vaginal discharge is abnormal. Be prepared to describe the color, consistency, and frequency of the discharge.


If you are currently menstruating, it's best to wait until after your cycle finishes to see your doctor, if at all possible. But if there are significant symptoms, then be seen as soon as possible, even if menstruating.
If you are visiting a walk-in clinic and not your regular doctor, be prepared to give a full medical history.

, For example, if you think you may be pregnant or recently had unprotected sex (i.e., sex without a condom), you should let your doctor know.

, A full exam includes an external and internal examination of the female pelvic organs:



The External Exam — Your health care provider will examine the opening of your vagina and the folds of your vulva. In particular, your doctor is looking for abnormal discharge, cysts, genital warts, irritation, or other conditions.

The Internal Exam (a) — The internal exam has two parts: the speculum exam and the bimanual exam. During the speculum exam, your doctor will gently insert a lubricated metal or plastic speculum into your vagina. The speculum separates the walls of the vagina when it opens. This should not feel painful, but may feel slightly uncomfortable. Let your health care provider know if you do feel any pain. She may be able to adjust the size or position of the speculum. If there is a significant vaginal infection, the Pap test usually done at this time might be deferred, since the results of the Pap smear might be compromised. If so, you should return for a Pap test once the infection is cleared. In the Pap test, a tiny spatula or small brush to take a small sample of cells from your cervix. This sample will be examined to see if there are any cancerous or precancerous cells in the cervix. A sample of discharge from the cervix also may be taken from the vagina to test for STIs. In addition, your doctor will measure your vaginal pH and take samples of vaginal discharge for testing.The Internal Exam (b) — The second test, the bimanual exam, involves your doctor inserting one or two gloved and lubricated fingers into your vagina while gently pressing on your lower abdomen with the other hand. This is a way to check for the size, shape, and position of the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes, which could affect your fertility and health. For example, an enlarged uterus could mean that you are pregnant or have fibroids, while pain or tenderness in the adnexa areas (ovary/tube) experienced during the exam could indicate an infection, cyst or possible mass.Sometimes as part of a pelvic exam, your doctor may perform a rectal exam. In this instance, your doctor will a gloved finger into the rectum to check for any tumors or other abnormalities. , After the exam, your doctor will send all cultures and samples to the laboratory for testing. The most important test for samples of vaginal discharge is microscopic examination, or a wet prep test. In a wet prep test, a technician will mix the sample of vaginal discharge with saline and take a drop of this mixture and put it on a slide to examine. This is usually done in the doctor’s office, so results are available immediately.The technician will carefully examine the slide at both medium and high power for trichomonas, clue cells, and yeast. Trichomonas are fluid, flagellated organisms that can be identified by their characteristic twisting motion. Clue cells are unusual cells whose existence in the sample means that bacterial vaginosis may be present. Lastly, yeast may be identified on the slide as budding or branching forms and is indicate of a yeast infection. The presence of yeast can also be determined through the Pap test., Make sure to find out when you should expect results from these tests so you can meet again with your doctor to development a treatment plan if needed."

Understand that women with salpingitis sometimes have no symptoms.,
Pay attention to abnormal vaginal discharge.,
Note any spotting between your periods.,
Talk to your doctor about painful menstrual periods.,
Take abdominal pain seriously.,
Factor in urinary problems.,
Discuss painful ovulation with your doctor.,
Monitor your back pain.,
Watch for fevers.,
Know that symptoms might come and go.",How to Diagnose and Treat Salpingitis1," In some cases, salpingitis causes no noticeable symptoms. Therefore, you may not discover that you have the condition until your reproductive organs are examined for another reason, such as infertility.;
, Some vaginal discharge is normal and healthy, but if you notice any changes in the amount, color, consistency, or smell, you should make an appointment with your gynecologist. Heavy or otherwise unusual discharge can indicate infection and a number of reproductive ailments, including salpingitis.

, If you bleed between your normal menstrual periods, schedule an appointment with your gynecologist. As with abnormal discharge, abnormal bleeding can indicate a number of possible problems, one of which is salpingitis.


Changes in hormonal birth control can sometimes cause spotting between periods. If you have recently started a new birth control pill or gotten an intrauterine device (IUD), that may be the reason for your spotting. It is probably safe to wait a few months to see if the issue resolves itself, especially if you have no other symptoms of salpingitis.

, Most women experience some degree of cramping before and during their periods, but if yours are especially painful, schedule an appointment with your doctor. Very painful menstrual periods (also called dysmenorrhea) can sometimes be caused by salpingitis (as well as by endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroid tumors, and other conditions). See your gynecologist for a complete exam.


This symptom is especially concerning if your menstrual periods were not always so uncomfortable. If the pain is new or has increased dramatically in severity, you should definitely consider it a warning sign that something is wrong. Seek treatment as soon as possible.

, Some women with salpingitis have noticeable abdominal pain, which can range in severity from mild to severe. This pain may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

, Salpingitis can cause the urethra to swell (this condition is known as urethritis). As a result, you may experience painful or frequent urination, and you may feel like you have a urinary tract or bladder infection.

, Many healthy women experience some pain or discomfort when they ovulate (this condition is sometimes called “mittelschmerz”). If you begin experiencing this problem suddenly, or if it occurs in conjunction with other symptoms, make an appointment with your gynecologist.

, Back pain can occur for many reasons, but if yours becomes severe, or if you have any other troubling symptoms, you should see a doctor. Some women with salpingitis experience lower back pain.

, When salpingitis leads to a serious infection, it can cause fevers and chills. If you have a fever along with other symptoms of salpingitis, you should see a doctor immediately.


In some women, this fever is accompanied by back pain that shoots down the legs. If you experience this symptom, seek treatment immediately and mention it to your doctor.

, Women with salpingitis often notice that their symptoms appear during certain parts of the menstrual cycle – frequently after their periods.

Have sex with your partner.,
Stimulate your nipples.,
Watch for signs of cervical dilation if you are near the end of your pregnancy.",How to Dilate the Cervix2," Sex starts a prostaglandin release in the body that may result in cervical stimulation and dilation. Before having in sex at this point in your pregnancy, consult with your physician. In most cases, sex at this stage of pregnancy is absolutely safe as long as your water has not broken. Although studies to support the connection between sex and cervical dilation are not entirely conclusive, many doctors continue to recommend this method to patients who are becoming impatient with their pregnant status.

, Nipple stimulation releases a hormone called oxytocin, which causes labor to begin.Rub your nipples or have your partner do so for you.

, This indicates that you are in labor, and it's time to talk with your doctor or midwife. As the baby's head begins to press down on the opening of the uterus, the cervix will start to thin out and open. Your doctor can do a simple examination to determine whether dilation and effacement of the cervix has begun, indicating you may be in the very early stages of childbirth.

Understand that most cases of salpingitis are caused by bacteria.,
Note that viral infections can also cause salpingitis.,
Know that salpingitis is often connected with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).,
Recognize the role of certain medical procedures in causing salpingitis.,
Consider the role of pregnancy.",How to Diagnose and Treat Salpingitis2," In 90% of all cases, a bacterial infection is to blame. This bacteria can be sexually transmitted (as with chlamydia or gonococcal, the bacteria that causes gonorrhea), but that’s not always the case. Other bacteria that frequently cause salpingitis are:


mycoplasma
staphylococcus
streptococcus

, Less commonly, salpingitis can be caused by a virus.

, In some cases, PID can begin an infection or inflammation in other reproductive organs, then spread to the fallopian tubes, causing salpingitis. PID involves any inflammation and infection in the reproductive organs, and it’s very common – more than a million women in the United States experience it each year.

, Medical procedures themselves aren’t to blame for salpingitis, but some of them are responsible for introducing bacteria through the cervix and into the uterus and fallopian tubes. Laparoscopy, uterine and endometrial biopsies, and dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedures can all do this, as can the insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD).

, Abortion, miscarriage, and childbirth can all introduce bacteria through the cervix and into the reproductive organs. This bacteria can cause salpingitis. If you have any of the symptoms above and have recently been pregnant (no matter what the outcome of that pregnancy was), you should definitely talk to your doctor as soon as possible.

Make an appointment with your gynecologist.,
Have a pelvic exam.,
Get blood work.,
Pursue other testing recommended by your doctor.,
Consider laparoscopy.,
Get a specific diagnosis.,
Understand that it can sometimes be difficult to accurately diagnose salpingitis.",How to Diagnose and Treat Salpingitis3," If you have any reason to think you may have salpingitis (or pelvic inflammatory disease or another reproductive ailment), you should see a gynecologist as soon as possible. Provide a complete medical history and a detailed account of your symptoms.

, Your gynecologist will probably start by performing a standard pelvic exam to check for abnormal discharge, pain or tenderness, and other signs of inflammation. He or she will use a speculum to view the cervix and may perform a pap test to check for signs of cervical cancer.

, Your doctor may want to check your blood for various indicators of infection. A white blood cell count, for example, will help determine whether infection is present.

, Individual circumstances vary, but your doctor may want to perform other diagnostic tests. He or she may test your urine, for example, or perform other tests to view your reproductive organs.

, Depending on the severity of your symptoms and the results of other tests, your doctor may recommend laparoscopy – a medical procedure in which a device is inserted into the fallopian tubes through an abdominal incision. A laparoscopy will allow your doctor to see the fallopian tubes in detail.

, If your doctor decides that your fallopian tubes are infected and inflamed, he or she will diagnose you with salpingitis. If possible, he or she should determine the cause. Salpingitis is further divided into two basic categories: acute and chronic.


Acute salpingitis is a more severe attack, in which the fallopian tubes become swollen and inflamed; they may secrete fluid and stick to the intestines or other organs, and they may fill with pus.
Chronic salpingitis is a lower-level inflammation, which often follows an acute episode. The infection is milder, but it also lasts longer.

, Some women are mistakenly diagnosed with cysts, endometriosis, or other problems before it becomes clear that the fallopian tubes are inflamed. You may have to be persistent. If your doctor thinks you have something else, but you doubt the diagnosis (or still have symptoms after treatment), get a second opinion.

"
"
Take antibiotics.,
Consider hospitalization.,
Discuss the possibility of surgery in severe cases.,
Treat sexual partners if necessary.",How to Diagnose and Treat Salpingitis4," As a first course of action, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection. For most women with salpingitis (around 85%), antibiotics alone can successfully eliminate the problem.

, In more severe cases, your doctor may recommend that you enter the hospital. While there, you can receive fluids and antibiotics intravenously (through a needle in your arm).

, Most women are successfully treated with antibiotics, but in some cases, surgery does become necessary. Your doctor will recommend surgery if there are abscesses on your fallopian tubes that must be drained. In a small number of cases, you may also need a salpingectomy – the removal of damaged fallopian tubes.


If your salpingitis is related to a larger case of pelvic inflammatory disease, you may wind up undergoing a complete hysterectomy along with a salpingo-oophorectomy. In such cases, a surgeon will remove your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes.

, If your salpingitis is traced to a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea, your recent sexual partners should be tested and treated. Keep in mind that these partners may be infected even if they have no symptoms.

Take ginseng to reduce irritability.",How to Ease Menopause Symptoms with Diet," If you're getting hot flashes around your face and upper chest, try taking soy products. Soy contains phytoestrogens that mimic or slightly block your body's estrogen. Many women find that eating more soy or soy products relieves hot flashes within days or weeks. Eat one or two servings of tofu, soy milk, or soy yogurt every day.If you've had an estrogen-dependent breast cancer, avoid soy and soy products. You should ask your doctor if your breast cancer was estrogen-dependent before you increase the soy in your diet.;
, During menopause, your metabolism might slow down which can make you gain weight. You can control weight issues by eating more fruits and vegetables. These contain fiber which can help you feel fuller longer and curb your appetite.High-fiber foods include: beans, legumes, raspberries, pears (with the skin), apples (with the skin), split peas, artichokes, and green beans.

, You may feel over-tired. To improve your energy levels, avoid sugary foods or drinks. Excess sugar can increase your blood sugar quickly which makes you feel tired. Limit your sugar to 2 tablespoons a day. Read food labels to watch for added sugars.Instead of eating sweet snacks, choose high-protein snacks like nuts, seeds and sugar-free yogurts or smoothies.

, If you find it hard to fall asleep or stay asleep at night, have a snack. You can eat nuts, a banana, yogurt, whole-grain crackers, an apple, peanut butter, or cheese. These can keep your blood sugar stable and help your body release healthy levels of serotonin, a brain chemical important for sleep.Avoid any sugary snacks before you go to bed. Your snack should always include a lean, high quality protein like cheese or lean meat. These can help your body make serotonin.

, If you find your moods swing or you're more likely to cry or get upset, eat foods that can reduce irritability and anxiety. Many mood-improving foods contain selenium and tryptophan. These contain neurotransmitters that can regulate mood and sleep. Try to eat 1 to 2 servings of these foods every day:Brazil nuts: 3 nuts count as one serving
Oats: 1/2 cup is considered one serving
Bananas: one serving is a medium banana
Poultry: eat some chicken, turkey, or game hen a few times a week
Lentils: 1/2 cup of cooked lentils

, Since more research is needed to determine how chemicals from food contribute to menopausal symptoms, it's best to avoid processed or conventionally grown food. Keep your food as close to its original or natural form as much as possible and choose organic foods. Try to cook from scratch so you can control what you're eating.


If you are pressed for time, try using a crock pot or preparing the basics (like rice, beans and even meats and vegetables) ahead of time and freezing those basics.

, 90 to 95% of the carbohydrates you eat should be complex. This means that when the carbohydrates break down into sugars, they break down into more complex molecules that take longer for your body to process. This prevents blood sugar from spiking quickly. Get complex carbs from whole, unprocessed foods like grains, peas, lentils, beans, and vegetables.Eat most of your complex carbohydrates at lunch so your body has longer to digest them and cut down on the portion sizes for other meals.

, Unlike complex carbohydrates, simple carbohydrates that are found in processed foods are broken down quickly by your body. This means that your blood sugar will peak rapidly. This can make menopausal fatigue even worse. To cut back on simple carbohydrates and sugar, avoid foods like white bread, white pasta, white rice, candies, cookies, cakes and other confections.


Read labels and avoid products that contain a lot of added sugars like glucose, sucrose (table sugar) and fructose (most often added as high fructose corn syrup(HFCS)).
Studies have found that drinking beverages with HFCS increases your risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease., Fatty acids (omega-3s) are healthy fats that can reduce inflammation, improve brain and heart heath, and can regulate mood swings. Studies have shown omega-3s can relieve depression symptoms caused by menopause. To get omega-3s in your diet, eat:Wild-caught fish: salmon, mackerel, tuna, cod, haddock
Ground flaxseeds: these also contain a lot of fiber
Limit foods high in saturated fats (like beef or poultry with skin)

, Try to eat at least 3 to 5 fruits and vegetables of any variety. Switch out what produce you're eating so that you're getting a variety of colors and nutrients. The nutrients in produce (like phytoestrogens, vitamins, and minerals) are good for keeping your heart and bones healthy during menopause.You should also drink more water throughout the day. Try to drink 1 to 2 liters or 6 to 8 eight-ounce glasses of water each day.

, If you're having trouble falling asleep at night, you can take chamomile or valerian as an herbal supplement or tea. Studies have shown that valerian (a plant) can help you fall asleep faster and improve your sleep quality.You can use valerian occasionally, but don't make a habit of relying on it to fall asleep. You should also ask your doctor about any drug interactions if you're taking medication.

, The root of the black cohosh plant has traditionally been used to relieve cramps, mood swings, irritability, and hot flashes caused by menopause. Studies have shown that black cohosh is actually more effective than some prescription medications in treating hot flashes and night sweats. Black cohosh is most effective when you take it as a tablet supplement.Some doctors advise against using black cohosh for more than 6 months.
Since black cohosh might contain plant estrogens, talk with your doctor before using it if you have breast cancer, a history of breast cancer, or are at risk for breast cancer.

, More research is needed, but evening primrose oil is often taken to relieve the symptom of hot flashes. Evening primrose oil (and black currant oil) contain gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). This fatty acid is an anti-inflammatory.Evening primrose oil (specifically the GLA) can interact with certain medications. Talk with your doctor before taking this supplement.

, More research is needed, but some studies have found that taking ginko biloba supplements may improve mood and relieve depression caused by menopause. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and consider taking it with a vitamin and mineral supplement.Ginseng comes from the same plant as ginko biloba, but ginseng is extracted from the roots (not the leaves and seeds, as in ginko biloba).

When creating the victory rolls, you'll only work with the top portion of hair. Tying back the bottom portion can keep it out of your way and make it easier to complete the rolls.

, Use your comb to create a straight, deep side part.


If you have side-swept bangs, section your hair so that the part lands on the opposite side of your bangs. If you don't have bangs, draw the part on either side.
You'll work with the smaller of these two sections first, so it might be a good idea to clip or loosely tie back the larger section until you're ready for it.

, Separate the smaller section of hair into three sub-sections. Tease the top and middle thirds along the underside of the hair, then tease the bottom third along the top of the hair.


Use a standard comb or boar bristled teasing brush while teasing your hair.
Hold the hair taut with one hand. Using your other hand, brush upward along the sub-section, moving closer to the scalp. Start approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the scalp and work along the length of each sub-section in 3-inch (7.6-cm) intervals.

, Release the larger side of hair, then separate it into five sub-sections. Tease the top four sub-sections along the underside, then tease the bottom fifth along the top side.


Follow the same teasing procedure for this larger side as you followed for the smaller side.
Note that you're still only working with the top section of hair; the bottom section should remain tied back in a ponytail.

, Form a line of bobby pins along both sides of the part. Position the pins roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from the part.


Start each line at the back of the part. Lay the pins from end-to-end, continuing until you nearly reach the front of your forehead. Stop at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from your forehead.
This step isn't strictly necessary, but following it will create a base for your victory rolls, which may make it easier to shape them correctly.

, Gather together the hair along the small side of your part. Bring the ends over and around to the top, forming a loop. Continue rolling over this loop until you reach your row of bobby pins.To create the right shape and width, position two fingers roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the ends of the hair and roll the ends around them. Tuck in the ends to keep the roll tidy. Continue rolling toward your scalp, keeping it as neat as possible the entire time.
Alternatively, you can roll the section around a 1-inch (2.5-cm) curling iron instead of your fingers. Doing so can produce a smoother, neater roll.

, Gently remove your fingers or curling iron from the center of the roll, then slide a bobby pin into the roll through the front to hold it together. Insert a second bobby pin through the back of the roll to make it more secure.


Secure both bobby pins through the bottom of the roll and into the hair lying directly along your scalp.
Right now, the roll should look like a small ""o"" with a hollow center.

, Use your hand to gently flatten the back of the roll, closing it off. Pin the bottom of the roll in place using another bobby pin or two.


If necessary, shape the front of the roll during this step as well, making it as rounded as possible.
You can use more bobby pins to help hold the shape of the roll, but make sure that each one remains hidden somewhere within the roll itself.

, Cover all sides of the first victory roll with hairspray to help hold the final shape.


Cover your unrolled hair with one of your hands to prevent the hairspray from soaking into it too much.
It's best to spray down each roll individually instead of waiting until you complete both. By spraying the first roll now, you'll protect it from possible disturbances as you work on the shape of the second roll.

, Gather the hair together along the larger side of your part. Follow the same steps to create another victory roll from this portion of hair.


Roll the hair, pin the roll down, shape the roll, and apply hairspray.
Note that this roll can be more difficult to complete than the first since you'll be working with more hair. Be patient and work slowly.
When finished, the two rolls should be mirrored side-by-side down the length of your part. The victory rolls are complete, but you'll still need to style the bottom portion of hair previously tied back.

, Untie the bottom portion of your hair. Comb it out, working the brush straight down until your hair seems smooth again.


Unless your hair was wavy or curly before you began, this bottom section will likely seem out of place with your victory rolls. There are several ways to create a matching style, but the simplest is to leave the lower section down and give a loose, wavy curl.

, Use a 2-inch to 3-inch (5-cm to 7.6-cm) curling iron to curl large sections of your remaining, loose hair. Work around your entire head until you achieve a result you feel pleased with.The waves or curls of this section should spiral down vertically. Do not curl the hair in horizontal sections.
To give the look a little more pizzazz, form tighter curls toward the ends of each section. You can use your curling iron for this, or you can make the curls more pronounced by accentuating them with a round hair brush.

, Cover your face and spray your entire head of hair with more hairspray. Use enough spray to help hold both the rolls and your loose-hanging waves/curls.


If your hair looks frizzy at this point, you can also use a small amount of hair cream or serum to help tame the frizz and create a smoother style.

, You can leave the victory rolls as they are, or you can give the look even more retro, feminine flair by highlighting them with a flower or bow.


For best results, use a bow or flower hair ornament attached to a hair clip.
Position the accessory on the side with the smaller victory roll to keep the look balanced. Slide the hair clip into the flat hair toward the front of your face and just above your ear. The ornament should not grab into the hair used to complete the victory roll itself.

, Give your victory rolls a final check in a mirror and touch them up as needed. Once you're satisfied with how they look, you should be ready to show off your new victory rolls out in public.

Your doctor should not pressure you in any direction. They should simply provide you with information about what options are available to you.
If you are considering an abortion, you may wish to prepare a list of questions to ask your doctor. You may feel embarrassed or shy about talking to someone about an abortion, but your doctor is there to help you. If you feel pressured by the doctor to not have an abortion (for a reason that doesn’t directly pertain to your health), consider looking for another doctor.;
, If you are an adult, you do not need to tell anyone about your decision to have an abortion. You may, however, wish to tell a trustworthy friend or family member to help support you during the procedure.If you are under 18 and wish to have an abortion, you may be required to get a parent’s permission, or, if you do not wish to inform your parents, a judge’s permission, before you may have the procedure. This policy varies by state, and most states have parental notification laws. Know your state’s parental consent policies., Because abortion is a controversial procedure, there is a lot of misinformation floating around about abortion and its effects. Do your research. Talk to your doctor. Look for information from government publications or reputable news sources.


Use caution when doing online research. Beware of any website that seems to push an overtly pro-choice or pro-life agenda.
Know that abortion is safe. Only one percent of abortions have complications.Know that abortions will not cause breast cancer. Additionally, an uncomplicated abortion will not cause infertility or trouble for future pregnancies.Abortion will not cause “post-abortion” syndrome or other mental health issues. It is, however, a stressful event, and some women find themselves having a more difficult time following the abortion, due to preexisting mental health conditions or a lack of a support network, for example., Medical, or non-surgical abortions, can be done up to ten weeks (70 days) from the first day of the woman’s last period. Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, usually including an ultrasound, and then prescribe mifepristone (or sometimes methotrexate) and misoprostol.If you are able and willing to pursue a medical abortion, you will first take the mifepristone, which blocks your body’s production of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy.
After 24-48 hours, you will take the misoprostol, which causes the uterus to empty. You will have cramps and heavy bleeding, usually within 4-5 hours of taking the medication.
Once this is complete, you will need to see your doctor to make sure your body has expelled all of the tissue. Follow-up is absolutely necessary, to ensure that the pregnancy was successfully expelled. Failure to expel the pregnancy completely could lead to serious complications and infection.The benefits of a medical abortion are that it can be done at home, and can be done early in the pregnancy (as soon as you know you are pregnant). However, there are also risks of the abortion being incomplete. If it is, then you would likely need a surgical abortion., A surgical abortion, also known as suction aspiration abortion, can be performed if you are under 14-16 weeks pregnant (this may vary by provider). The procedure involves dilating the cervix and inserting a small suction tube into the uterus to remove the pregnancy tissue.The actual aspiration, or abortion procedure, takes only a few minutes. Most of the time spent in the clinic or doctor’s office will be spent waiting for pain/relaxation medication to begin to work, as well as dilating your cervix to create an opening large enough for the suction tube to fit through. Your cervix may be dilated with metal rods of increasing thickness, medication, or dilators that expand through fluid absorption.You will spend at least an hour in recovery to ensure there were no immediate complications from your procedure. You may be asked to schedule an additional follow-up appointment.
If you are over 16 weeks pregnant, you will have a procedure known as a dilation and evacuation (D&E). This is similar to the aspiration abortion, though it requires more time and equipment. You will likely have a slower recovery than with an aspiration abortion., As you consider what to do about your pregnancy, think about what is currently going on in your life and consider how a pregnancy or baby would impact it. You may want to spend some time thinking through some issues on your own.


Consider your financial situation. Are you able to afford having a baby and raising it?
Think about your personal beliefs about abortion. If you do not feel comfortable with abortion, would you consider putting the baby up for adoption?
Think about your health. Would being pregnant be harmful to your body or mental state? Would you be able to handle the emotional and physical impact of having an abortion?
Think about your support network. Who would help you raise the child? Would the baby’s father be involved? If you had an abortion, who could be there to support you?, Talk to your partner, loved ones, or friends who you know won’t judge or influence your decision. Many women feel alone when dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. Talking to trustworthy members of your support network may help you feel less isolated.If the father is present and involved in your life, you may wish to speak to him about what he would like to do. Remember, you do not need his permission to get an abortion. If you feel he may pressure you one way or another, however, you may wish to avoid telling him.
Don’t let anyone pressure your decision. If your friend says something like, “If you have an abortion I won’t be able to be friends with you anymore, because I believe abortion is wrong,” you could say, “I’m sorry you feel that way, but please don’t put pressure on me. I need to do what is best for me.”
Talk to someone who has had an abortion. If you know of anyone who has had an abortion, ask what their experience was like, and how they look back on it positively or negatively. You could ask, “Are you comfortable talking about your abortion? Could I ask you a few questions about it? I’m pregnant and I’m not sure what to do.”

, Your doctor, family planning clinic, or community health agency may know of counseling services that can help you decide what to do. Make sure the resources they give you are unbiased, nonjudgmental counseling services that do not attempt to push the woman toward one option or another.


Do your research on any names or agencies you receive to make sure they are unbiased. Look for any affiliations that may seem questionable to you (political or religious).
Understand that any reputable agency or counselor will help you explore all your options without judgement or coercion. If you feel pressured into making a particular decision, find someone else to talk to., If you are considering abortion, you do need to make a decision as quickly as possible. While you want to be certain of your decision, also understand that the earlier in the pregnancy you decide to terminate it, the easier your procedure will likely be. You will also have more options available.


In most states in United States, you cannot get an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy, unless the pregnancy is a risk to the mother’s health., If you are still unsure of what to do, you may wish to write a list of the pros and cons of terminating your pregnancy. Seeing your thoughts and feelings on paper may help you reach a decision more easily.


Write down the positives and negatives, no matter how big or small they seem. Compare your lists. You may want to weigh all three options (parenting, abortion, or adoption) or just two if you know you are not ready to be a parent, for example.

, Once you have made your decision, take your next steps quickly. If you are choosing to continue with the pregnancy, you will still want to follow up for prenatal care as soon as possible. If you decide to have an abortion, schedule it as soon as you can.


Keep in mind that you may need to travel to a clinic, and factor in some states’ mandatory waiting periods as well. Consider any financial needs you may have in order to pay for the abortion.
If you are planning to continue the pregnancy, be sure that you are not smoking, drinking, or using drugs, eating well, and are taking a prenatal vitamin that includes folic acid -- a necessary nutrient for a developing fetus., Consider discussing your future birth control needs with your provider or at your family planning clinic at your next appointment. Research options online and speak to your doctor about options that may work best for you.


If you decide to have an abortion, you may be able to have an IUD (intrauterine device) inserted at the time of your abortion procedure. Check with your doctor about this option. While it prevents pregnancy, it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.If you have a regular sex partner, discuss with them what protection you’d both like to take going forward.

Discuss the terms of the surrogacy arrangement.,
Do not draft the contract yourself.,

Check the choice of law provision.,
Raise problems before signing.,
Follow the contract.",How to Become a Surrogate Mother in Ohio," There are primarily two types of surrogacies: gestational and traditional. In a gestational surrogacy, an egg and sperm are joined to create an embryo which is then implanted into the surrogate who will carry and bear the child. The surrogate is not a biological parent of the child. In a traditional surrogacy, the surrogate is impregnated via artificial insemination by the donor sperm fertilizing the surrogate’s egg. In this case, the surrogate is also the biological mother of the child.The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized the validity of some gestational surrogacy contracts but has not addressed contracts regarding traditional surrogacy.Presumably, normal family law would apply to traditional surrogacy, granting parental rights to biological parents.;
, In Ohio, it is illegal to pay a fee for adopting a child. However, fees for surrogacy have been upheld so long as they are reasonable and do not appear as if the baby is being sold.


According to the Ohio Bar, fees generally range from $7,000 to $25,000. However, according to one surrogacy center, the average compensation for a surrogate ranges from $39,450 to $52,450, depending on various factors. These factors include whether the surrogate has worked as a surrogate before and whether she is carrying multiple babies.The amount can increase depending on lost wages due to enforced bed rest, as well as travel expenses and life insurance., If you haven’t been pregnant before, then you should become aware of how pregnancy will impact your health and lifestyle. This impact includes time missed from work for appointments with the obstetrician or for childbirth. Even if you have had normal pregnancies in the past, complications can occur, which could subject you to bed rest or hospitalization.


Also, be aware that many women grow very attached to a child they have nurtured in the womb for nine months. Giving that child up can be emotionally challenging. Changing your mind and breaching a surrogacy contract could subject you to financial penalties. It also can be very traumatic for the intended parents.
Another consideration is how the pregnancy will affect your other children, who you will be caring for during and after the pregnancy.You should be willing to tell your children that you are carrying a baby for other people and that the baby will not return home with you after being born.

, You should not undertake surrogacy lightly. A skilled surrogacy attorney can discuss with you whether or not this is a good option. Also, a skilled attorney can help you review the surrogacy contract and can provide legal advice should any disputes arise between you and the intended parents.


It may be difficult to find an attorney who has experience with surrogacies. The Ohio Bar runs a referral program, which can be found here. However, it does not list “surrogacy” as a specialty that you can search for. Accordingly, you may want to find attorneys who practice “family law” and call to check if they have handled surrogacy issues.
The American Academy of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys is a national organization of attorneys dedicated to advancing best legal practices with respect to assisted reproductive technology. You can also check their directory here for lawyers in Ohio.

, Surrogate contracts are often negotiated between couples and a surrogate who have known each other for many years and may even be related. For example, a sister may be willing to carry the fertilized embryo of her sibling and his or her spouse.


There are also agencies who match couples searching for a surrogate with potential surrogates. To find one near you, you should do an internet search, typing in “surrogacy agency” and your city or county into your favorite search engine.
Agencies typically have strict requirements for their surrogates. For example, they may require that you have at least one child of your own, have no complications in your obstetric history, have no criminal record, and not have had more than two c-sections or four vaginal deliveries., If you are negotiating a surrogacy arrangement with anyone other than long-time friends and family (and sometimes even then), you should thoroughly research the other party or agency. A surrogacy contract is a written agreement and can become the basis of litigation. You should know who you are entering a contract with. Furthermore, you want to be sure that the other party is not obtaining the child for illegal purposes (such as human trafficking). If the intended parents have a lengthy criminal history, you may want to avoid working with them.


If you are working with an agency, check the Better Business Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce in the area where the agency is located. You may also want to check with the Ohio Attorney General to see if any lawsuits have been filed against the agency by the state or other parties.
If you are dealing with private individuals, you may want to hire someone to perform a background investigation. Ideally, the intended parents will be very open about their life and background and might even agree to a background check. If they seem hesitant, then you may want to reconsider working with them.
You can find out how to perform a background check by reading wikiHow’s How to Do a Criminal Background Check.

, If you find a couple you are willing to act as a surrogate for, you will want to discuss a variety of issues before moving on to drafting a contract. Take time to meet face-to-face for these discussions. It is important to come to agreement on critical issues before starting the surrogacy. Give some thought to the following and be sure to discuss each with the intended parents:


Who will be responsible for every necessary or optional item during the pregnancy and childbirth. These could include medical bills, insurance premiums, uncovered expenses, maternity clothes, wages for time the surrogate misses work for obstetrician appointments, child care for any existing children of the surrogate for the time she is unable to care for them because of the surrogate pregnancy.
All parties should also agree on any optional testing that is to be done (such as amniocentesis), including when it should be performed.
All parties should agree with what should be done in the case of a complication or if a test indicates a birth defect. Discuss who covers any charges if a viable pregnancy or live birth does not occur, and whether any fees will be paid for the surrogacy in that situation.
Discuss the type of procedure that will instigate the pregnancy and who will donate both the egg and sperm. Also discuss the maximum number of attempts to achieve pregnancy.Decide on what clinics will provide all medical care and whether or not you should meet with particular doctors chosen by the intended parents.

, A surrogacy contract is complicated. Because there are so many technical details to cover, you should not attempt to draft it yourself. If possible, you should sit down with your own lawyer and review the contract.


If you go through an agency, the agency will probably draft the contract. You should still retain your own attorney to review the contract. Even the best, most ethical agencies will be focused on protecting their own interests, not yours. You should always have an independent lawyer review any agreement., You should check the contract to make sure that it contains all the provisions that you discussed with the intended parents, e.g., who will pay medical bills, lost wages to attend medical appointments, etc.

, This clause is particularly important when the surrogate and the intended parents live in different states.If a lawsuit develops, then the law of the state chosen in the contract will control the interpretation of the contract and any litigation.

, If you do not agree with something in the contract, then you should object to it before signing. The contract should contain the entirety of your agreement, so do not sign a contract even if you receive verbal assurances that the other parties will revise the contract at a later date. Instead, wait for the contract to be revised.


It is probably a good idea to put communications between parties in writing as often as possible as well. Email is a great way to communicate informally while at the same time retaining a hard copy of the communication.

, After the surrogacy contract is executed, it should be followed. If an issue arises that was not covered in the contract, then all parties should discuss it and attempt to come to an agreement. Once agreement is reached, reduce that agreement to writing and sign it as well.


If problems arise which cannot be resolved by agreement, then you should seek the assistance of an attorney.

Talk to your doctor about appropriate exercise.,
Walk every day.,
Exercise lightly 30 minutes per day.,
Listen to your body.,
Stay balanced.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Gain the recommended amount of weight.",How to Be Pregnant Gracefully1," Exercise is a terrific way for pregnant women to improve their balance and also strengthen their muscles that will be used during labor and delivery.However, there are some forms of exercise that are unhealthy during a pregnancy (such as the lifting of heavy weights), and some difficult pregnancies require bedrest. Speak with your obstetrician about what forms of exercise are appropriate for your body and your pregnancy., Walking is a great exercise for many pregnant women, especially in the earlier stages of pregnancy. It is low-key and generally fairly safe. Walking also helps improve balance and strengthens the same muscle groups that you will use during labor. If you take the time to walk 30 minutes each day, you will also feel more comfortable moving around in your changing body.Women in the final stages of pregnancy might need to avoid lengthy walking, however, due to back pain, foot pain, or poor balance. Women who need to be on bedrest also should not take walks., Doctors recommend that pregnant women have at least a half-hour of aerobic activity per day. This should not be hard, high-impact exercise: you do not want to dehydrate yourself, lose your balance, get fatigued, or limit the flow of oxygen to the fetus. But it is important to move each day in order to keep your joints healthy and to learn how to get by in a growing body. Indeed, many prenatal exercises reduce the severity and frequency of common pregnancy symptoms such as aches, pains, and trouble sleeping.Some excellent prenatal exercises include:


Swimming. Just don't hold your breath for long periods of time!Prenatal yoga. Yoga is a great way for many pregnant women to maintain their strength and flexibility during pregnancy. However, not every yoga move is safe during pregnancy. For example, hot yoga and poses that involve standing for long periods of time are not recommended. Join a specialized class designed for pregnant women that is led by an experienced professional.Indoor biking. Biking outdoors might be difficult for pregnant women because their balance has changed. A stationary, indoor bike, however, is a great way for women to get a good amount of cardio exercise in a safe, controlled environment., While pregnant, you might be more susceptible to joint pain, poor balance, dizzy spells, fatigue, and dehydration. Never force yourself to do something you are not comfortable doing. If you find yourself overheating, panting, or getting too thirsty, stop your activity and take a rest. Forcing your body to move when it is already exhausted is unsafe and might lead to falls, injury, or other accidents., Women who are pregnant have a tendency to lose their balance because of weight gain, rapidly changing body proportions, and loosening ligaments (a side effect of pregnancy hormones). Take proper precautions to keep yourself safe and moving gracefully and to prevent unnecessary falls. Some precautions include:


Do not stand on ladders, chairs, or step-stools.Keep both feet firmly planted on the floor at all times.
Wear stability shoes. Comfortable shoes with great traction and good arch support will help keep you upright and moving gracefully.
Lean against walls or heavy furniture for extra support. Don't be afraid to find stable objects around you to help keep you balanced. Lean against a wall or sofa when you have to.
Avoid standing for long periods of time. This is particularly hard on your joints and your circulation. Either sit down or walk around a little bit: do not stand motionless for more than a few minutes.

, To avoid unnecessary falls or aches while you are pregnant, stay away from high heels.Look for shoes that have a low heel (or no heel at all), good traction to prevent slippage, and excellent support. It is much more important for you to be able to move comfortably than for you to be at the height of shoe fashion.Remember that many women experience swollen feet while pregnant. You might want to consider buying shoes that are the next size up, looking for shoes that are extra wide, or finding shoes with flexible sides (such as shoes made of canvas) to accommodate this swelling.

, All pregnant women should gain weight--ideally 25-35 pounds. Some women lose weight in the very first few weeks of pregnancy due to morning sickness, but this weight should be regained shortly.Ideally, women who are quite thin should put on more weight during pregnancy than women who are on the heavier side. No matter what, pay attention to your weight to make sure that the pregnancy is developing normally. If your body is not putting on enough weight--or if you are gaining too much weight too quickly--there might be complications later.

Get strong, supportive undergarments.,
Buy clothing that expresses who you are.,
Wear loose clothing and accessories.,
Don't be afraid of your curves.,
Look for non-maternity clothing items you can wear during pregnancy.,
Buy a maternity band.,
Wear a single, dark color from head to toe.,
Accessorize carefully.,
Wear breathable fabrics.,
Treat yourself to some extra self-care.",How to Be Pregnant Gracefully2," Many maternity stores carry special bras and other undergarments to help support you as your body changes and as your breasts grow. Be sure that these undergarments are strong and supportive without being too tight. A good, supportive maternity bra will give you better posture and will reduce the frequency of back pains. A supportive bra will also make all of your other clothing look and fit better. However, a bra that is too tight might be uncomfortable or hurt your circulation.Talk to a clerk at a reputable maternity shop if you require assistance finding a well-fitting bra. They should be able to measure you so you can get the support you need.
Some women like wearing a sports bra after they have outgrown their regular bras but before they are ready for a maternity bra., Most maternity clothing is designed for feminine women. However, there are new companies emerging with comfortable pregnancy wear for women who identify as butch or masculine, for androgynous people, and for transmen.Do not let the limitations of traditional maternity wear limit yourself: true grace is being yourself at all times.

, Tight clothing and accessories are not recommended for pregnant women. They can lead to discomfort and to a poor fit as the pregnancy continues. Moreover, pregnant women are more at risk of unsightly and potentially dangerous varicose veins, which are exacerbated by tight clothing. Make sure you buy clothing that is loose and flowing. Stay away from tight clothes, belts, socks, and undergarments. Do not wear any slimming undergarments such as girdles or control-top pantyhose.

, As your pregnancy continues, there will be no way to hide your growing bust and belly. Nor should you: your body is something to embrace and enjoy. While your clothing will need to be loose and stretchy enough to be comfortable, there is no need for you to wear tents or muumuus. Try to find clothes that show your figure without cutting off your circulation.This could include:


Dresses made out of stretch jersey that fall below the knee
V-neck shirts and sweaters
Shift dresses that show off your curves
Skinny jeans with a maternity waist

, There are a number of clothing items that are loose or stretchy enough to be worn during pregnancy as well as in your day-to-day life after your pregnancy. Most of these items can be purchased at any clothing store--not just in maternity shops. This can give you more freedom to buy clothes you like and can enjoy instead of limiting yourself to traditional maternity options. By being creative and flexible in your ""maternity"" wear, you can be more fashionable and find clothing to suit your own personal style.Such items can include:


Leggings. Just make sure you buy a larger size and that you roll the waist below your baby bump!Anything with an empire waist. Empire waists are a great way to stay comfortable while pregnant, or to disguise the early stages of a pregnancy if you do not want to call attention to it.High-waisted tunics.Maxi dresses. Be sure that you buy one in a comfortable fabric, such as a stretch jersey.Wrap dresses and wrap shirts. Because you tie these yourself, you can adjust the waist as necessary as your pregnancy develops.Yoga pants. These provide you with a comfortable waist. Many women who have C-sections enjoy these pants because they do not aggravate the healing incision.Many of these items can be made yourself if you are an experienced sewer.

, Maternity bands allow women to wear the pants, skirts, and shirts they already own during pregnancy. By wearing the maternity band and leaving your pants or skirts partially unzipped, you can give your waist the room it needs while wearing your most beloved items of clothing. These bands can also help provide support to your belly as it grows, leaving you more comfortable.It is also possible for you to make your own maternity bands in order to create your own maternity wear.

, If you wish to appear slimmer during pregnancy, it is a good idea to avoid large patterns, horizontal stripes, or light colors. Wearing the same shade from head to toe in a dark color makes you appear more streamlined, even with a baby bump.If you are a fan of stripes, make sure they are vertical, not horizontal, stripes. That will help your body appear longer and leaner.If you like wearing patterned clothing, try to keep the pattern smaller and more contained. A floral cardigan might look quite nice, for example, but a paisley maxi dress will likely look garish and overwhelming., You can use accessories to draw attention to features of your body that you like, and to draw attention away from parts of your body with which you are less comfortable. In general, some tips for accessorizing in a fashionable, graceful way include:


Wear bright scarves. Many maternity clothes come in dark, non-patterned colors. A scarf or shawl is a great way to get some color and patterning in to your wardrobe. Scarves also do a good job at hiding extra cleavage as your breasts grow in size.Take off your rings. Many women experience swollen fingers during pregnancy. Take off any non-adjustable rings if you notice your fingers begin to get bigger: you do not want to have to cut off your rings to maintain your circulation.Wear shorter necklaces. Long necklaces and pendants might fit awkwardly over your growing bust and belly. Look for shorter necklaces that call attention to your face and neck instead., Many pregnant women are warmer than usual and may even experience hot flashes during pregnancy.Keep yourself cool by wearing loose, natural fabrics that breathe. This will keep you comfortable and also prevent you from sweating or becoming red and flushed.


Layering your clothing during pregnancy is also a great idea: you can always remove a layer of clothing if you begin to get too warm.

, Pregnancy can be tough on your body and self-image. Spend extra time pampering yourself with a new haircut, a spa day, or with scented lotions. Keep yourself feeling happy and relaxed: the most important part of looking good is feeling good. Do whatever it takes to keep yourself healthy and confident.

Be honest but discreet about pregnancy symptoms at work.,
Ask for help if you need it.,
Deal politely but firmly with violations of your privacy.,
Write thank-you notes.",How to Be Pregnant Gracefully3," During pregnancy, many women experience symptoms that lead to discomfort, including: nausea and vomiting, bleeding gums, hemorrhoids, yeast infections, stretch marks, and swelling.Most people will be sympathetic to your plight--especially if they have experienced pregnancy themselves. However, resist the urge to overshare information about your body in professional situations. Take a sick day if you need to, but do not tell all your coworkers and clients about just how bad your hemorrhoids have gotten.


Be sure to talk to your doctor about any sudden symptoms you experience.

, During pregnancy, you might not be able to stand for long periods of time or lift heavy objects. Feel free to ask a neighbor for help lifting a box or ask someone on the train for their seat. People will understand, and most people will be happy to help.Be sure that you express your gratitude to anyone who lends you a hand during pregnancy. Always be polite and kind--especially to those who have gone the extra mile to help you.

, Many pregnant women report being asked inappropriate questions or even being touched inappropriately during pregnancy.Strangers might try to touch your belly, or your boss might grill you about why you drank a cup of coffee that morning. Remember that your body is your own, and other people do not have the right to know your private, medical information (even if you do have a baby bump). However, social norms might make it difficult for you to draw firm boundaries. For example, you are probably better off not yelling at your boss. However, there are some tricks you can use to make sure that people do not violate your privacy. For example:


Be vague when asked an inappropriate question about your pregnancy choices. Bland cliches that do not directly answer their question, such as ""I'm just so happy to be a new parent!"" or ""It's really exciting!"", might help distract someone from prying further.Redirect the conversation. Tell them that you don't want to hog the spotlight with your pregnancy and ask them how their day is going. Getting them to talk about themselves is a great way to prevent them from prying into your life.Be honest when something makes you uncomfortable. Especially if you are touched without your permission, tell the person grabbing your belly that your personal space is important to you. Be firm without yelling, cursing, or being impolite. But remember that the person who touched you is the truly disgraceful person.
Practice using the following phrases: ""That's between me and my doctor;"" ""That's between me and my spouse/partner;"" ""Thank you for telling me about your experience, but everybody's experience is different;"" ""We haven't decided on a name yet ;"" ""We'll see how it goes."" These are great ways to disarm some of the most common prying questions.

, Many pregnant women have formal baby showers. Other pregnant women might be given gifts to help them prepare for the new baby. Whenever you are given a gift, write a personalized, effusive thank-you note to express your gratitude. Gratitude is one of the most graceful emotions you can express, and your friends and family will feel appreciated for the help they've given you.

Consume certain vegetarian foods that are high in needed vitamins and minerals while you are pregnant.,
Learn the foods that you should avoid as well.",How to Be a Pregnant Vegetarian1," You will need to consume up to 300 calories more of these minerals than you did before you became pregnant.;
,

You should be consuming up to 11 servings of pasta or bread and up to five servings of vegetables each day.






It is important to add plenty of fruit into your diet and plenty of milk or milk alternatives as well.






Beans are a vital source of protein and should be consumed often.






Adding omega-3 fats such as walnuts and tofu is important as well.







, It is important to avoid eating too many sweets while pregnant.

Not only are sweets unhealthy and devoid of nutritional value, but filling up on them will leave less room for the nutritious foods that are such an important part of a pregnancy diet. This is especially true of vegetarians, who often have to eat more servings of foods than non-vegetarians in order to meet their nutritional needs during pregnancy.






Avoid unpasteurized cheese and milk because of the bacteria that these foods contain. Pregnant women are at a greater risk of becoming ill as a result of consuming these bacteria.

Consider if you have room in the bra.,
Look for signs of a poor fit.",How to Buy a Nursing Bra," Work with a professional trained in measuring bra sizes or a lactation consultant. While you can measure yourself, you'll get more accurate measurements if someone else does it so you're not shifting and moving around during the measurement.Most lingerie stores or maternity stores offer free measurements.;
, You should get your first nursing bra measurements when you're seven or eight months pregnant. By this point, you'll probably need larger bras anyway since your breasts have enlarged. It's also a good idea to have a fitting done so you can buy one or two nursing bras before the baby is born. This way, you'll be prepared if the baby comes early or you don't feel like getting measured if you go past your due date.You can wear nursing bras throughout your pregnancy. These can offer more support for your changing breasts. If you don't wear nursing or maternity bras during pregnancy, you should at least avoid wearing restrictive bras with underwires. These can constrict your breasts as they enlarge.

, Your breasts may become engorged when your milk comes in (a few days after the baby is born). Your breasts may increase a cup size or two when this happens, but they'll go down in size once your baby settles into feeding.


Give yourself a few weeks or a month before going back for a measurement. You'll probably have your hands full with a newborn and this will give your breasts a chance to settle into a size.

, With the professional's help or on your own, wrap a soft measuring tape around your ribcage just below your armpit level. The measuring tape should be completely level and horizontal above your breasts. If you end up with a fraction of an inch measurement, round up to the next whole inch. This number will be your band size.For example, if the measuring tape wraps around and meets at 35.5 inches, your band size is 36.
You can keep an unpadded bra while you measure yourself or get measured by someone. Try to wear your best fitting bra so there aren't large gaps of material or tension.

, Wrap the soft measuring tape around the fullest part of your breasts, keeping the tape level and horizontal. Avoid pulling tight on the tape which could give you an inaccurate measurement. Subtract your band size from this measurement. The difference in size determines your cup size. For example, a difference of:0 to 1.5 inches = A cup
1.5 to 2.5 inches = B cup
2.5 to 3.5 inches = C cup
3.5 to 4.5 inches = D cup
5 to 6 inches = DD/E cup
6 to 7 inches = DDD/F cup
7 to 8 inches = G cup
8 to 9 inches = H cup

, It's a good idea to get several nursing bras. This way, you'll have one to wear, one to wash, and one as a spare. You may find that you need to change your nursing bra several times in a day because your baby spits up on you or you leak milk.


If you're shopping for a nursing bra while you're pregnant, you may only want to buy one or two inexpensive nursing bras, since your bra size could still change considerably.

, Most bras marketed as nursing bras will be made of a comfortable material that can expand. Many nursing bras even have spandex so they can expand. Consider your wardrobe needs and get a variety of nursing bra styles. For example, you may want:Fashion nursing bras
Everyday soft-cup nursing bras
Nursing sports bras
Nursing sleep or overnight bras

, Nursing bras can vary when it comes to fasteners, hooks and support. The cups should be flexible, but the band shouldn't stretch. Choose nursing bras that fasten in the back and have several adjustable hooks, the more the better. You should see side and under-cup support.An extra-wide back with lots of hooks can distribute the weight of your breasts which is great for support.

, Most nursing bras will have clasps at the top of each cup, near the strap. These can be snapped open or shut to provide access when nursing. Other bras have flaps or slits that can be pulled open or closed for easy access. The cups on sleep nursing bras can be pulled to the side for nursing access.Bras with the clasps at the top of each cup will offer the best support for your breasts.

, Practice opening and closing the nursing bra clasps with one hand since you'll only have one hand available when nursing your baby. If the nursing bra doesn't have clasps, make sure you can easily open the nursing flaps or pull the cups aside in order to nurse.


Avoid buying a nursing bra that you can't easily nurse in. If you struggle to open the clasps, you'll be less likely to wear or use the bra.

, Some women leak frequently in the early weeks of nursing. If you do or if you want to plan on wearing nursing pads, make sure there's a little space inside the nursing bra to place the nursing pads comfortably.


Keep in mind that you only need a little space. You don't want large gaps in your nursing bra, especially if you'll only use nursing pads for a little while.

, A nursing bra should feel comfortable. Beyond that, you should also look for pinching, tension, and stretching. Look at the bra's band. It should lie flat against your chest, not lift up towards your breasts. Your breasts should fill the cups. There shouldn't be large gaps or overflowing breast tissue.Adjust the straps while you're trying the bra on. If you've adjusted the straps, but the bra is still too tight or too loose, you probably shouldn't buy it.

When on a vegan diet, there are certain foods that you will have to exclude from your diet such as any source of protein that comes from an animal; this includes all dairy products.
If you are eating a vegan diet, you will likely need to take nutritional supplements to make sure that you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals your body needs to have a healthy baby. You will need to ensure that you are consuming adequate amounts of iron, B12 and calcium. Consult your doctor to see if there are any specific supplements you may need in addition to your prenatal vitamin supplement.

, If you are eating one of these diets, you will most likely be able to get all of the vitamins and minerals that you need from your diet with the possible addition of one or more supplements.

, You can also eat dairy products and all of the aforementioned foods included in the vegan diet. The only things excluded from this diet are meat and poultry. This is one of the best diets for pregnancy, as you can get your essential fatty acids from the fish you consume, as well as your protein.

Know that by eating a vegetarian diet, you are ensuring that you are filling up on some of the most nutritious foods available.,
Make sure to weigh the cons of a vegetarian diet during pregnancy as well.",How to Be a Pregnant Vegetarian3," A vegetarian diet can produce many positive results during pregnancy. Eating protein sources that are strictly vegetarian can be much easier on your kidneys than other protein sources. Many women also find that a vegetarian diet helps to ease tooth decay during pregnancy, which is a very common problem that pregnant women experience. A vegetarian diet will also lower your risk of hypertension, gestational diabetes and obesity.

, One of the main cons of a vegetarian diet during pregnancy is the extra effort it will take to make sure that you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals that your body needs in order to ensure that your baby is developing at a healthy rate. You will have to be vigilant about planning each of your meals effectively and obtaining all of the nutrients that your body needs in your meals. It is also important to make sure that you are using the correct supplements in order to obtain any nutrients that are not contained in the vegetarian foods you are eating.

Stop using the concealer if it causes skin irritation.",How to Avoid Skin Pigmentation During Pregnancy," The sun’s rays can be very harsh on the skin. Melanin (a pigment that determines skin color) is produced by the skin as part of the skin's defense mechanism against the sun. In order for the skin to protect itself effectively, it will produce more melanin.


Therefore, if you are exposed to sunlight, the skin will become darker as a result of increased melanin production.
Avoid going outside when the sun is at its hottest, usually between 11 am and 3 pm, as this is when your skin is most prone to pigmentation.;
, Even if you are inside your house, you should avoid sitting near the window for too long, as some of the sun's rays can get through and contribute to skin pigmentation.


Also be careful when sitting in the car, as the sun can penetrate car windows and affect your skin.

, Go for sunscreen with a minimum sun protection factor (SPF) of 30. Sunscreen should be applied every day, regardless of the weather. Even on a cloudy day, the sun’s UV rays can still affect your skin and initiate melanin production.


The SPF level is a measurement of how much a particular sunscreen will be able to protect your skin. This is because the sun emits radiation as well as heat. This radiation will not only cause skin pigmentation, but also sunburn, skin and eye damage, skin aging, and even skin cancer.
As a general rule, SPF 15 can protect your skin for 2 hours, SPF 30 for 4 hours, SPF 60 for 8 hours and so on., Shield your skin from the sun’s harmful rays by using an umbrella and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, long-sleeves, protective eye wear and more.


When choosing clothing, choose light colored materials. Dark colored clothing will absorb the sun’s rays and make skin more prone to pigmentation.
Choose clothing that is loose and comfortable. One thing that can aggravate skin pigmentation is friction. If you wear restrictive or tight clothing, it will cause friction that may lead to skin pigmentation.
Remember that umbrellas are not just for the rainy season, make it a habit of using an umbrella to protect your skin on sunny days.

, The focus of diet and lifestyle modifications in avoiding skin pigmentation during pregnancy is to lower the hormones that are mainly responsible for skin pigmentation – namely, estrogen which stimulates melanin production and melanin itself.

, During pregnancy, levels of the female hormone estrogen rise in order to help the body build tissues for both the mother and the fetus.


As you are trying to avoid excessive production of estrogen, it is best to avoid foods rich in estrogen such as tofu, flaxseeds, soybeans, soy yogurt, sesame seeds, multi-grain bread, hummus, garlic and dried apricots.

, The two main hormones produced by women are estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone acts as an antagonist to estrogen; meaning if one of these hormones increases, the level of the other hormone decreases and vice versa.


Increasing progesterone levels can help lower the excessive production of estrogen during pregnancy, thereby reducing melanin production, helping you to avoid skin pigmentation.
To increase progesterone levels, follow the steps listed below.

, An ideal progesterone level can be maintained by ensuring that there are adequate amounts of vitamin B6 in the body. B6 also helps to break down estrogen levels in the liver to create a hormonal balance.


Whole grains, walnuts, lean red meat, seafood, bananas, potatoes, beans, spinach and fortified cereals are foods rich in vitamin B6.
The recommended dose of vitamin B6 is 2 mg per day.

, Magnesium maintains hormonal balance and increases progesterone levels by breaking down excess estrogens.


Good sources of magnesium are raw plantain, whole grain cereals, black beans, halibut, spinach, pumpkin and squash seeds, okra and nuts.
For pregnant women, the recommended daily intake is 360 to 400 mg.

, Vitamin C is considered to be a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase is an enzyme responsible for the production of melanin. If melanin production is suppressed during pregnancy, then skin pigmentation can be avoided.


Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C include blackberries, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, grapefruit, lemon, mango, orange, melon, papaya, pineapple, potato, spinach, strawberries, tangerine and tomato.
Eat at least one portion of vitamin C-rich foods as part of every major meal. The recommended daily dose of vitamin C for women is 75 mg.

, Bile acids (acids that remove wastes from the liver) secreted by the liver pass through the intestines during the process of digestion. Fiber help remove estrogen from the body by binding it to the bile acids. In this way, excessive production of melanin can be reduced.


Foods rich in fiber are apples, figs, kiwi, legumes, beans, berries, peas, plums, mangoes, oats, peaches and sweet potatoes. The ideal daily intake is 21 grams.

, Studies show that Vitamin B9 or folic acid helps in preventing skin pigmentation. However, the exact mechanism is unknown.


It is observed that women with lower levels of folic acid in their bodies exhibit more skin pigmentation compared to women who have higher levels of folic acid.
One theory that explains this is that vitamin B9 or folic acid acts as an antioxidant agent. An antioxidant agent helps to fight free radicals in the body. These free radicals can damage the skin cells' DNA and lead to a number of signs of aging, which include pigmentation.
With increased levels of folic acid, these free radicals are being suppressed, leading to decreased pigmentation and healthier skin., The human body cannot produce folic acid by itself. Therefore, you need to acquire folate through your food. Though folate is best known in preventing birth defects, it can benefit the skin as well. Increasing your folic acid will decrease skin pigmentation.


The foods rich in folate or folic acid are dark leafy vegetables such as spinach, mustard and romaine lettuce, asparagus, broccoli, citrus fruits, beans, lentils, peas, avocado, okra, Brussels sprouts, seeds and nuts, cauliflower, beets, corn, carrots, celery, squash, and more.Eat 2-3 servings of high folate foods every day.

, There are also things that you can do to decrease folic acid in your body that you should be aware of. For example:


Some medications are shown to have negative effects on the level of folic acid. Such medications includes methotrexate, trimethoprim, and phenytoin (which are commonly used in cancer treatment). These drugs are known as antifolate drugs because of their action in inhibiting or blocking the action of folate acid.
Cigarette smoking is also known to deplete folic acid in the body. Harmful chemicals from cigarettes damage the body's cells and decrease their ability to utilize folic acid. In addition to this, cigarette smoking exponentially increases free radicals in the body. With increased free radicals, more folic acid is needed to neutralize their negative effects., During stressful conditions, progesterone is converted into cortisol thereby lowering the level of progesterone in the body.

, This type of makeup is an inexpensive way of hiding uneven skin tone caused by pigmentation. With just a small amount of concealer, you will be able to effectively even out your skin tone and make skin pigmentation less noticeable., The best way to hide skin pigmentation is to use a corrector or concealer with an orange tint.


It is not wise to use concealer that is more than two shades lighter than your skin tone since this will only make the pigmented area look grey and unnatural.
The concealer or corrector should be applied before the foundation.

, When using makeup, carefully read the label and check its expiration date. Never try to reuse expired makeup as this may only worsen your skin pigmentation.

, Discontinue use of makeup when you observe skin irritation, rash, blemishes, redness or any sign of allergy.

The egg is ready to be fertilized during the next 12 to 24 hours if it meets a male sperm cell. If it meets a sperm and gets fertilized, the egg implants in your uterus; in other words, you become pregnant. If the egg doesn't get fertilized during that 12 to 24-hour period, it is released along with your uterine lining, and you have your period.For most women, ovulation happens about halfway through the menstrual cycle. The average cycle lasts 28 days, but it can range from 24 or fewer to 32 or more. When you have your period, the cycle begins again.;
, When you have sex, sperm cells are ejaculated into the body, where they can live for up to five days.You can pregnant if you have unprotected sex during the five days before ovulation and up through the day you ovulate. This is considered your fertile time, and to avoid getting pregnant, you have to avoid unprotected sex during this window.


It sounds simple, but it's actually quite difficult to pinpoint exactly when this window ends and begins, since every woman's cycle is different.
The point of using contraceptive methods, natural or not, is to prevent sperm from meeting your egg cell during your fertile window.

, Natural contraception, often called fertility awareness or natural family planning, has two parts. First, you have to track your body's reproductive cycle well enough to pinpoint when your fertile window begins and ends. Second, you have to avoid having sex during times when there's a chance you could get pregnant. When used perfectly, this method is 90 percent effective. When used typically, it is 85 percent effective (one percent less effective than condoms).Tracking your body's reproductive cycle involves three daily tasks: taking your basal body temperature, checking your vaginal mucus, and recording your findings on a calendar. The combination of these tracking methods is called the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness. Over time, you can analyze this data and have a good idea of when your fertile window begins and ends.
The tricky part is figuring out exactly when you can and can't have sex. Most women avoid sex for a stretch that starts a few days before the fertility window begins and ends a few days after the fertility window ends to play it safe. If you want to keep having sex, you can also choose to use a condom or another contraceptive method during this stretch.
Tracking your cycle is not an exact science. Factors like weight gain or loss, stress, illness and aging can change your cycle drastically from month to month. For natural contraception to be effective, it's essential to use all the tracking methods as strictly as possible, and interpret the data over time.

, Your basal body temperature is your lowest temperature over a period of 24 hours. Your body experiences a slight rise in temperature just after ovulation. Monitoring your basal body temperature over time can give you an indication of when your peak fertility time is about to begin. Basal body thermometers are available in drugstores, and should come with a chart to help you track your temperature every day.


It's important to get a basal body thermometer, which measures your temperature's changes in small increments. A regular thermometer that you might use to check for a fever will not give you exact enough measurements to be helpful., To accurately track your basal body temperature, you must take your temperature at the same time every day. The most accurate way to do this is to take your temperature right when you wake up, before you get out of bed and start moving around. Keep the thermometer by your bed and get in the habit of taking your temperature first thing in the morning.


Basal body temperature can be taken in your vagina or in your mouth. Taking your temperature in your vagina will give you the most accurate reading from day to day. Whether you take your temperature orally or vaginally, do it the same way every day to ensure your readings are as consistent as possible.To take your temperature, follow the instructions that came with your thermometer to set the thermometer and then insert it in your vagina. When you hear it beep after about thirty seconds to a minute, write down the exact temperature on the chart that came with your thermometer or in a diary. Make sure you record the date along with the temperature.

, Before you ovulate, your average body temperature will range between 97.2 and 97.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Two to three days after ovulation, your body temperature will sharply rise between 0.4 and 1.0 degrees. This higher temperature usually lasts between seven and twelve days before dropping back to the lower temperature.Tracking this temperature spike from month to month will reveal a pattern, allowing you to begin anticipating when your body will next ovulate.

, You cannot rely on this method for accurate information about your reproductive cycle until you've taken your temperature for three months or more. If your cycle is regular, three months' worth of data should be enough to help you predict when your fertility will peak in the following months.If your cycle tends to be irregular, you may need to take your temperature for six months or more before you can rely on the patterns that emerge.
Note that illness, stress, drinking alcohol and other factors can also affect your body temperature. That's why it's important to use this method with other tracking methods to back yourself up in case the basal body temperature pattern is thrown off for any reason.

, After three or more months of tracking your temperature every day, use your findings to try to anticipate when you'll ovulate next. It will be difficult to know exactly when you're going to ovulate, but several months' worth of data can help you find a general window during which you will be fertile. Interpret the data in this way:


Look at your chart and find the day when your regular spike in temperature occurs each month.
On a calendar, mark the two or three days before this temperature spike as the days when you are likely to ovulate. Remember, your temperature doesn't spike until two to three days after ovulation.
To practice natural contraception, avoid unprotected sex for at least five days before ovulation is supposed to begin, up through ovulation day.
Using the temperature method with other methods will give you a more accurate idea of when you'll be fertile.

, Begin checking after your period begins to taper off. Cervical mucus, which leaves your body as vaginal discharge, changes in texture, color and smell throughout your cycle. By checking it every day, you can use the patterns you find to predict when your body is fertile.To check your mucus, wash your hands, then insert two fingers into your vagina and swipe.
Or you can use a cotton swab to swab a bit of mucus; however, you'll still need to touch it to examine the texture.

, These characteristics of mucus change from day to day as your hormone levels fluctuate. The presence of certain types of mucus will indicate that your body is about to ovulate or has ovulated. Here are the qualities mucus has at different times in the cycle:


During the three to five days after your period ends, you'll probably have little to no discharge. It's highly unlikely you'll get pregnant during this time.
After the dry period, mucus will be cloudy and a little tacky. It's improbable (but not impossible) that you'll get pregnant if you have sex during this time.
Following the tacky discharge, it will start to become white or yellowish and creamy, similar to lotion. You are more likely to become pregnant if you have sex during this time, but your fertility has not yet peaked.
Following the creamy discharge, you'll notice thin, stretchy mucus with the consistency of egg whites. It might stretch between your fingers without breaking. Ovulation occurs on or after the last day this mucus is produced. When you see this kind of mucus, you are extremely fertile, and the likelihood of getting pregnant is high.
Afterward, it will return to the cloudy, tacky stage for several days.
The cycle ends when your period comes.

, Write down the color and texture of your mucus every day. You may want to use the same chart you're using to track your temperature, so you have all the data in the same place. Remember to record the date as well. Here are examples of some detailed entries you might write:


4/22: Mucus is tacky and white.
4/26: Mucus is whitish and runny, like egg whites.
4/31: Period started; heavy flow.

, Start looking for a regular pattern so you can try to predict when you will be fertile in the coming months.


You are most fertile when your mucus has the consistency of stretchy egg whites. Err on the safe side by avoiding sex for a few days before and after your mucus takes on these qualities each month. You might want to stop having sex when your mucus changes from tacky to creamy.
Compare the data to your basal body temperature patterns. Your mucus will probably turn stretchy and wet several days before your body temperature spikes. Ovulation will typically happen between the change in mucus and the temperature spike.

, Aside from taking your temperature and testing your mucus, you can use a calendar to track your cycle and help inform your predictions about when you're fertile. Most women with regular periods have a cycle that lasts between 26 and 32 days, although there are some women with shorter or longer cycles. The first day of your cycle is the first day your period starts, and the last day is the beginning of your next period.For many women, the cycle changes a little from month to month. Stress, illness, weight loss or gain, and other factors can change your cycle.
In order for the calendar method to be useful, it should be used in conjunction with the other tracking methods.

, You can circle the first day your cycle starts each month, mark it with a dot, or use another way of identifying the first day of your period. At the end of each cycle, count the number of days your cycle lasted.


Track your cycle for at least eight cycles to start gaining accurate data about the length of your cycle.Keep a total of the number of days in each cycle and look for patterns.

, First, find the shortest cycle you've ever tracked. Subtract 18 from the number of days the cycle lasted, and write down the number. Next, find day one of your current cycle on your calendar. Use the number you wrote down to count forward from the first day of your current cycle. The day you land on should be your first fertile day.


To find your last fertile day, find the longest cycle among all the cycles you've tracked. Subtract eleven from that number of days, and write down the number. Find day one of your current cycle, and use the number you wrote down to count forward that number of days. The day you land on should be your last fertile day.

, You might be tempted to skip taking your temperature and checking your mucus, but the calendar method alone is not reliable enough to accurately predict when you'll be fertile. Use the calendar method to help reinforce the patterns you recognize from the other methods.There are too many factors that can affect the length of your cycle for this method to be completely reliable on its own.
If you experience irregular periods, this method may not provide useful information.

, Your window of fertility begins at the time when all the patterns align to indicate that you are about to ovulate. After using each tracking method for a period of several months, you should be able to have a pretty good picture of when your body will be fertile. You are probably fertile when:Your records indicate that your basal body temperature will spike in three to five days, when you will ovulate.
Your cervical mucus is white or yellow and creamy, just before it becomes wet, stretchy and similar to egg whites in texture.
Your calendar shows that your first fertile day has begun.

, For most women the window technically lasts for about six days: the day of ovulation and the five days before it.Some people prefer to play it safe by avoiding sex for at least a week before they predict ovulation will occur, and several days afterward. Others stop exactly five days before they think they'll ovulate. Once you have enough data at your disposal, the choice is yours to make.


You might want to be very cautious at first, as you are getting used to using natural contraceptive methods. Give yourself time to get to know your body before taking risks.
After using the  symptothermal  method for six months or a year, you may feel you understand your reproductive cycle very well. You can then narrow the time during which you avoid sex, resting easy that you can rely on your meticulous records.

, If you forget to track your temperature while on vacation, or haven't checked your vaginal mucus this month, do not rely on natural contraception to prevent pregnancy until you have at least two or three months' worth of careful records to fall back on again. In the meantime, use condoms or another form of contraception to prevent pregnancy.

Respect any changes in decisions your partner makes.",How to Be a Great Birth Partner," Know what to expect during pregnancy and during delivery. Reading about pregnancy and childbirth will help you support the mother and stay calm yourself.Check local bookstores and online marketplaces for books about pregnancy and birthing. Consult online reviews to see which ones other expectant parents found helpful.
Look for resources that cover subjects including pain management, presentation of the baby, timing, delivery methods, the involvement of health professionals, possible complications, and recovery expectations.
Ask your partner’s health care professional for recommendations regarding materials to read during the pregnancy.;
, Introduce yourself to the person who will be delivering the baby. Take this time to ask questions and get advice about being a birth partner.Ask questions about subjects that your reading material didn’t cover. If, for example, a book mentions the ring of fire but does not define what that is, ask the doctor, “What is the ring of fire and how can I help my partner get through it comfortably?”
Take the time to inquire about their specific care practices. Ask questions like, “What should we have ready to bring on the day of delivery?” and “What protocol do you have in place should something go different than expected?”
Have them show you around their office as well as the hospital or birthing center where the birth will take place. Ask them to familiarize you with the space so that you can easily navigate it when necessary.

, Your partner will likely go to a class or individualized training to get ready to deliver. If your partner is comfortable with it, ask to attend with them.Use the course as an opportunity to learn about what your partner will experience while giving birth. These courses typically cover strategies for calming your partner, coaching them during delivery, breathing effectively, pushing appropriately, and being supportive.
Speak with the instructor about what your partner should expect from you during the delivery. Ask questions like, “What actions should I expect to do during the birthing process?” and “What are some effective ways of communicating with my partner while they are giving birth?”

, Make sure you know what your partner wants come delivery day. Talk to them well in advance about where and how they want the birth to take place.Ask your partner if they intend on working with an obstetrician, a midwife, or another form of medical professional.
Check with your partner to see if they would prefer to deliver at home, at a hospital, at a birthing center, or at another type of location.Get clear instructions for how your partner wants to handle pain. Will they opt for an epidural? Do they want a natural birth? Have pain management instructions clear well in advance in case you need to relay this information the day of delivery.

, Discuss how your partner would like you to coach them. Do they want you to help guide their breathing and count during pushing? Do they just want someone to hold their hand during the process. Understand and respect your partner’s choice.


Practice conversations you may need to have with medical staff regarding her preferences. This may include who is allowed in the room, your partner’s pain management preferences, and what your partner wants during delivery.

, In some cases, hospitals require that a birth partner be registered in advance in order to be able to attend the birth. Sign up if necessary.Speak with your medical professional about if their facilities require registration. If they do, check to see how far in advance you should register, and if there is any information or documentation you need to supply to do so.
If your partner wants others at the hospital for the day of delivery, as well, ask the medical professional if they will need any sort of permission, as well.

, Voice your partner's preferences during delivery. Be alert, focused, and straightforward when communicating her preferences to medical staff.Be firm when you are sure about their preferences. The person delivering the child might not be your regular doctor or midwife, so don’t hesitate to let them know what your partner wants.
Communicate any changes in plan to the relevant staff person as soon as possible.

, Discuss with your partner what they would like to have at the hospital. Prepare a bag in advance so that it is ready to go when labor starts.Typical items include hygiene products like a toothbrush and deodorant, a change of clothes, comfort items such as music, a few snacks, and clothing and blankets for the new baby.Consider downloading a sample list from the internet and customizing it according to your partner’s preferences.

, Remember that you will likely be at the hospital for several hours and perhaps overnight. Prepare a few items for whenever you need to go to the hospital or birthing center.


You should consider packing personal hygiene items, a change of clothes, a camera, and any other items you would like to have accessible during or after delivery.

, Know how you are going to get to the hospital or birthing center well in advance. Plan 2-3 different routes so that you know multiple ways to get where you are going.If you are driving, have maps ready and memorized. Have multiple routes in place so that you are still able to get to the hospital if traffic is prohibitive on one.
If you do not have or plan on using your own car, find a reliable transportation option. Are there taxis in your area that you can take? Will your insurance help cover the cost of an ambulance? Is there a friend or relative nearby who can take you?

, Make sure someone can reach you to let you know if labor starts unexpectedly. Try to leave as many forms of contact with them as possible, including work and mobile phone numbers.


If you work or travel, make sure that you are accessible by phone, email, or other quick contact.
If you will temporarily be out of touch, check your messages regularly and notify your partner of where you will be, how to reach you, and when you expect to be available again.

, In the case of a situation that precludes you from attending the birth, appoint a substitute birth partner. Discuss this possibility in advance so that both you and your partner will know what to do in the event that you cannot attend the birth yourself.Talk with close friends or family members about filling in if you can’t make it.
Have a way to quickly contact your substitute birth partner, such as by phone call or text message.

, Breathing exercises are one of the most common and effective strategies you can practice for a smooth delivery before labor begins. Work with your partner to find the ones that help them the most.


Practice with your partner for 10 -15 minutes two to three times a week. Focusing on your routine exercises will provide some semblance of normalcy or familiarity during the birth process and can help you provide support to your partner.
When your partner experiences contractions, focus on the breathing strategies and talk them through the process.

, Panicking, losing your temper, or raising your voice may stress out your partner. Even if they resists your assistance or experiences volatile moods, it is crucial that you stay committed to helping them through the process and remain levelheaded.Don’t rush. Labor takes time, and there is no need to rush. Don’t hurry yourself to the hospital, and don’t rush the medical staff for care or attention.
Be prepared for the plan to change. Your partner may discover that they don’t like being touched during labor or the breathing exercises are not helpful. Go with the flow and listen to your partner’s wishes instead of forcing something on them.

, Your partner may reverse prior plans for pain management, birth attendants, or other delivery decisions. Confirm their new decision in a calm, brief discussion and relay them to the doctor if necessary.Do not attempt to force them to abide by prior plans if they clearly communicate a change of mind.
Know who to talk to about plan changes. If your partner decides on a different form of pain control, for example, let the delivery doctor or midwife know rather than one of the attending nurses.

Eat fish and seafood.,
Try more meats.,
Ingest more nuts, seeds, and grains.,
Eat various vegetables.,
Combine different ingredients.",How to Avoid Selenium Deficiency During Pregnancy1," Some of the best sources of selenium are fish and seafood. These are rich in selenium and will help keep your levels high. Include seafood at least two to three times a week to ensure you get enough selenium; However, make sure you avoid seafood that might contain mercury, such as King mackerel, shark, marlin, tilefish, orange roughy, swordfish, ahi (bigeye) tuna, and albacore tuna. Food sources rich in selenium are:


Fish, such as light or skipjack tuna, sardines, tilapia, anchovies, cod, salmon, sole, trout, and halibut
Seafood, such as shrimp, clams, and scallops;
, Meat and other animal parts are some of the best sources for selenium. Look for lean meats and eat meat or meat parts two times a week to increase your selenium. These meats include:


Lean beef
Lamb
Chicken
Turkey
Eggs
Organ meats, such as liver, kidneys, and sweetbreads (made from animal brains)

, Whole grains, seeds, and nuts are great sources of selenium as well. These can be incorporated into meals, added to snacks, or eaten by themselves. Make sure you look for unsalted nuts and seeds to avoid getting too much sodium every day. These foods include:Nuts, especially Brazil nuts
Seeds, such as mustard, chia, sunflower, flax, and sesame
Whole grains, such as brown rice and quinoa or breads that also incorporate the healthy seeds
Beans, especially lima and pinto

, There are a number of vegetables that are high in selenium. These will help improve your health while pregnant. These are also helpful if you are vegetarian or vegan but still want to increase your selenium. These vegetables include:Mushrooms, especially crimini and shiitake
Asparagus
Soybeans and tofu
Spinach
Cabbage
Swiss chard
Broccoli

, The best way to get your daily amount of selenium is to mix up all the different selenium-rich foods. Grab a handful of Brazil nuts (four or five) to get 300 to 375 mcg of selenium. Throw ¼ cup of sunflower seeds into yogurt to get about 19 mcg of selenium. Make three ounces of halibut, salmon, clams, or oysters for 40 to 60 mcg of selenium.Just have fun and switch it up. You will never get bored with the combinations if you keep changing them up.

Get the recommended daily amount of selenium.,
Avoid selenium toxicity.,
Take a selenium supplement.",How to Avoid Selenium Deficiency During Pregnancy2," Like with most minerals, there are specific guidelines on how much you should get every day. The recommended daily amount of selenium will change based on your age, gender, and if you are pregnant. While pregnant, your recommended daily amount is 60 to 70 mcg.


The amount you should have after you deliver and stop breastfeeding is 55 mcg., Even though you need lots of selenium to keep you healthy during your pregnancy, you can actually take too much. This is especially common when you take selenium supplements because they have such concentrated amounts. Your upper limit of selenium should be no more than 400 mcg per day. If you do develop selenium toxicity, you may experience:Upset stomach
Nausea
Skin rashes
Garlic breath
Fatigue
Irritability
Neurological (nerve) disorders

, One additional way that you can get your daily amount of selenium is through a supplement or multivitamin. This is effective if you can’t eat enough food per day that has plenty of selenium in it. Make sure your supplement is not more that 100 mcg a day. This will help you avoid getting too much when added with any natural sources you get. You can also get a prenatal vitamin that contains selenium as well.


Make sure you talk to your obstetrician before taking any selenium supplements.
Look for a supplement that uses selenomethionine or selenocysteine as its source of selenium."

Consider how selenium contributes to pregnancy.,
Recognize the risks of selenium deficiency.,
Have your selenium tested.",How to Avoid Selenium Deficiency During Pregnancy3," Selenium is a trace mineral that is found in the soil, plants, and animals. Selenium changes into antioxidants, which helps pull toxic free radicals from your body.It helps fight certain issues, such as thyroid disease. Your thyroid is very important to maintaining energy levels and supporting the development of a healthy baby. Selenium helps your thyroid function properly.Low levels of selenium may contribute to preeclampsia, which is a serious complication of pregnancy, typical your first, that results in high blood pressure and kidney damage and may lead to mother and fetal death.Thyroid disease is relatively common during pregnancy, which can be either the more common hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) or the also prevalent hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).Selenium can also help fight other conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, cognitive function diseases, and some cancers, including colorectal, prostate, lung, bladder, skin, esophageal, and gastric., There are certain groups of people who are more prone to selenium deficiency than other. If you fit into this category, make sure you have your doctor check you levels. These groups of people include:


Those who live in areas where the soil is selenium deficient, which causes the plants and animals in the region to have less in their systems so you ingest less
Those with kidney disease and undergoing kidney dialysis, since dialysis removes selenium from the blood
Those who have undergone gastric bypass surgery
Those with HIV/AIDs, which is likely due to the loss of appetite and poor food absorption
Those with Crohn’s disease, because the selenium gotten from food is not well-absorbed, If you are worried that you have a selenium deficiency or just want to be sure, have your doctor test your levels. This can be done with a sample of your blood or a sample of your hair. Your doctor will calibrate the results and let you know if your levels are normal or if you have a deficiency.


Selenium levels of 8 mcg/dL or higher are considered normal."

Know your legal rights.,
Consider parenting.,
Consider adoption.,
Get support.,
Remember that getting an abortion is an option.",How to Avoid Getting an Abortion1," In the USA, no one, not even your parents, can force you to have an abortion against your will. The choice is up to you, so don't let anyone pressure you into making a decision that you are not comfortable with.Forcing a minor to have an abortion is considered child abuse, which is illegal.
If you are being threatened or coerced into having an abortion, call the police.
If you want to have an abortion, that is your right as well, although some states require that you inform your parents and/or get their consent if you are a minor.;
, With help and support, parenting can be an amazing and wonderful experience. For some women, parenting is just the right choice, even if the pregnancy was not planned.Talk with the baby's father and your family to find out who is willing to help you raise your baby. This will be a much easier choice if you have support from your loved ones.
Come up with a plan for how you will afford to take care of your baby. Think about whether you will need to get a job and make childcare arrangements while you are at work. Also consider whether you may be eligible for any financial assistance programs. The United States government offers several programs that provide benefits like food, healthcare, childcare, and job training for low-income mothers.Think about your goals for the future and whether you will be able to accomplish them while raising a child. You may be able to make childcare arrangements that would still allow you to attend school, for example.

, If you don't think raising your child is the right choice for you, but you don't want to have an abortion, consider placing your child for adoption. There are loving families who will be happy to raise your child and give her a wonderful life.Start working with an adoption agency as soon as you decide to place your child for adoption. They will help you find adoptive parents and work out all of the details.
The laws regarding adoption are different in every state. In some states, you may be able to arrange for an adoption without an agency. In some states, the baby may be placed in foster care for a short period of time before being adopted. The waiting period before the adoption becomes official also differs from state to state.
There are three different kinds of adoption. With a closed adoption, you will not know who the adoptive parents are and they will not know who you are. With an open adoption, you and the adoptive parents will have each other's contact information. With a semi-open adoption, you and the adoptive parents will not have each other's contact information, but you may communicate with each other through the adoption agency.

, No matter what decision you make, it is important that you not feel that you are all alone. This will be a very stressful time in your life, so reach out for the support you need to make the right decision for you.


Talk to your parents and the father of the child. Know what kind of support you will have. If these individuals are not offering you the support you need, turn to friends or other relatives for emotional support.
Consider calling a pregnancy hotline if you need unbiased counseling about your options. The counselors can explain your choices, offer guidance, and refer you to local organizations that can help you learn to parent, arrange an adoption, or get an abortion.
Female health centers and pregnancy support centers are also great resources for pregnant women. Some of these facilities offer abortions, but they often offer counseling and help with adoptions and parenting as well.
Some religiously affiliated pregnancy help centers may pressure you to not have abortion, but others believe in reproductive freedom, so research them before you call or visit. Pro-life organizations will typically not provide you with any information over the phone and may offer you biased information in an effort to convince you out of having an abortion.The National Abortion Federation and Backline.org both offer unbiased hotlines that pregnant women can call to discuss their options, including abortion. You may also be able to get a referral to a reputable, unbiased healthcare provider.Even if you're not a religious, most churches will be happy to help you find adoption resources or talk to you about parenting. Keep in mind that most churches are against abortion, so you may not want to visit a church if you are still considering abortion as an option.

, Regardless of what opinions your friends, family, or religious institution hold on abortion, it is still a legal option for you. If you decide that it is the right choice for you in your particular situation, that is your right.

Stay away from parabens.,
Avoid polyethylene glycol.,
Don’t use products with aluminium.,
Take care with phthalates.,
Be wary of formaldehyde.,
Be careful with triclosan.,
Avoid plastic containers with BPA (Bisphenol A).",How to Avoid Toxic Personal Care Products During Pregnancy1," Parabens may disturb your endocrine system. Because of this, it is important to make sure that the products you use do not contain parabens. Unfortunately, parabens are found in 75-90% of all personal care products—from face powder to eyeshadow.


Read the labels on your personal care products before you purchase them.;
, Polyethylene glycol can harm you by removing the protective grease and oils from your skin and hair, and opens the way for other toxins. If toxins are allowed to get into your body, they may also affect your baby.Polyethylene glycol is commonly found in hair and skin products like hairspray.

, According to some research, aluminum may cause damage to the tissues and bones in the area where it is applied. It may also be linked to Alzheimer’s disease.Aluminium is commonly found in antiperspirants.

, This chemical is infamously known to influence the occurrence of allergies, diabetes, obesity, and asthma. It has also been linked to breast cancer. Look out for products that may contain phthalates like:


Hairspray.
Nail polish.
Perfume.

, Formaldehyde has carcinogenic influences, yet is an ingredient in numerous products. It can also be formed as a reaction to of water and a particular ingredient in a product. Formaldehyde has been found in:


Nail glue and nail polish.
Eyelash glue.
Hair products like hair gel.
Body wash and body soap.

, Triclosan may cause damage to your baby's nervous system, causing a low birth weight, and problems with the thyroid gland. Because fo this, it is very important to look out for this ingredient in products like:


Soaps.
Makeup.
Acne creams.
Deodorant.

, Choose the one that says it's “BPA free“. This chemical has a negative influence on the growth and development of children."

Use commercial mosquito repellent.,
Use natural mosquito repellents.,
Cover your skin.,
Apply mosquito repellent to your clothes.",How to Avoid Mosquito Bites During Pregnancy1," The most effective way to prevent mosquito bites while you are pregnant is to use commercial mosquito repellent. Commercial mosquito repellents that contain DEET and picaridin have been approved by the EPA and thus are considered safe to use for pregnant and breast-feeding women.Follow the directions for when and where to apply, how much to apply, and how often it should be applied. Only apply the repellent on exposed skin and on clothing, not on skin under clothing. Also, keep it away from the eyes and mouth, and use sparingly near the opening of ears.The commercial mosquito repellent that you use should contain at least 10 percent DEET or picaridin.
Some people are allergic to DEET, so stop using it if it irritates your skin.;
, There are some natural mosquito repellents that can increase your unattractiveness to mosquitoes when used on your skin. These include lemon eucalyptus oil, lavender, cinnamon oil, Greek catnip oil, thyme oil, soybean oil, citronella, and tea-tree oil.Most of these natural oils should be combined with water and then sprayed on your skin in a diluted form.
For pregnant women concerned about the communicable diseases that can be spread by mosquitoes, natural mosquito repellents should be used in combination with commercial products, not as your only protection.

, If you want to make yourself less attractive to mosquitoes you should try to cover up as much skin as possible. Mosquitoes are attracted to various scents released through your skin.If you cover it up, mosquitoes will be able to smell you less effectively.A few things that mosquitoes are attracted to are heat and carbon dioxide. Pregnant women usually give off more of both of these things.The color of your clothing may also matter. Mosquitoes have been found to prefer dark colors, so opt for lighter colored clothing when possible., In addition to wearing clothing that covers most of your skin, you can also apply mosquito repellents such as Picaridin and DEET to your clothing.This provides another layer of protection from mosquito bites.The best products to apply to your clothes are marked for that use and include the active ingredient permethrin. This is the only FDA approved chemical mosquito repellent approved for use directly on fabric, though should never be applied directly to skin."

Check up on her.,
Let her know how you can help.,
Encourage counseling.,
Listen to her needs.,
Avoid judging.",How to Avoid Getting an Abortion2," If you have a friend or loved one who is dealing with an unexpected pregnancy, it's important to recognize that she is going through a very difficult time. Be sure to call or visit her frequently to see how she is doing and find out if she needs your help and support.Be aware if she seems to be isolating herself from others. If she is, encourage her to spend time with you and other supportive loved ones. Consider inviting her to participate in a fun activity to get her mind off of her troubles for a little while.

, If you are very close to a woman who is dealing with an unexpected pregnancy, it might really help if you let her know how you would be willing to help her out if she decides to parent her child. When she seems ready, have a conversation with her about the contributions you would be willing to make.


If you are the father of the child, talk about your plans for the future. Share your opinions on the pregnancy and allow her to share hers as well.
If you live with the woman, talk about living arrangements and child care options.
Don't pressure her to make a decision. Instead just tell her you want to talk about these things so that she has all of the information she needs.

, If the woman is undecided on what to do about her pregnancy, encourage her to get as much information as possible and speak to a counselor. Talking to an unbiased expert can really help her make the best decision for her.If she needs help finding resources, help her. She may even want someone to visit the counselor with her for emotional support.
No matter what your views are on abortion, it's important to refer your loved one to a counseling center that will inform her about all of her options and not try to influence her decision based on their own beliefs.

, You probably want to help your loved one deal with this situation in any way you can. While your instincts are good, it's best to ask her how you can help first. This will ensure that she does not feel intruded upon or pressured.


If she is not interested in hearing other people's advice, respect that she needs to make her own decisions. If she asks for advice, offer your opinion, but be respectful if she disagrees with you.
If she wants to talk, let her talk. You can be supportive by listening closely and offering unconditional support.

, You may be feeling angry, sad, or disappointed that your loved one has found herself in this situation, but don't let her know that. It's important that you show love and support for her instead of judging her for her decisions.


Keep in mind that she is already dealing with a lot; the last thing she needs is criticism from her loved ones.
If you need to talk to someone about your feelings on her pregnancy, find someone else to talk. Avoid unloading all of your issues on the pregnant woman, as this will just cause her more stress.

Educate yourself.,
Have a plan.,
Consider abstinence.,
Use hormonal contraceptive regularly.,
Consider long-term hormonal birth control options.,
Use condoms.,
Use spermicide.,
Look into other barrier methods of contraception.,
Consider sterilization.,
Don't forget about emergency contraceptives.",How to Avoid Getting an Abortion3," Having medically accurate information about sex decreases the likelihood of unplanned pregnancy.Try websites like Scarleteen and Planned Parenthood to teach yourself in detail about contraception, responsibilities, pressure, and the emotional aspects of relationships. You should be able to understand your own anatomy, know exactly how to put on a condom, recognize warning signs of pressure and abuse, and know how to say ""no"" to a partner.


Consent needs to be clear and continuous. Get consent before engaging in a sexual act, and make sure you have it all the time. If you don't want to or change your mind, say no. If your partner becomes angry, disrespectful, or aggressive if you say no, this is a major red flag.

, No matter how you decide to go about preventing unwanted pregnancies, it's important that you have a solid plan. Think about what methods will be the easiest for you to use and the most effective. Remember that most birth control methods require consistent and correct usage.


Be sure to talk with your sexual partner about your birth control plan. Let him know that you expect him to play an active role in preventing unwanted pregnancies.
It is not acceptable for your partner to refuse to take part in your pregnancy prevention plan. If he refuses to wear a condom or use other methods of birth control, do not have sex with him., Abstaining from sexual intercourse is the only way to guarantee that you will not become pregnant. This is not the right choice for everyone, as it requires a lot of discipline.It is important to consider your situation, and only become sexually active if and when you feel ready for the responsibilities involved.


Keep in mind that penetration is not always needed to become pregnant. Anytime sperm comes in contact with the vagina, pregnancy is a possibility.
Having only oral sex will prevent pregnancy, but it will not prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
It's a good idea to have a backup plan if you are abstinent. Many couples become pregnant because they planned on being abstinent, but then had sex with no protection. Consider taking hormonal contraceptives or keeping a barrier contraceptive handy just in case your abstinence plan fails.

, Hormonal contraceptives work by releasing hormones into your body that prevent you from becoming pregnant. You need a prescription for hormonal contraceptives in the United States. These methods can be expensive, but many types are covered by insurance.The most common kind of hormonal contraceptive is the oral contraceptive or birth control pill. Some pills contain estrogen and progestin, while others contain progestin only. You must take the pill every day in order for it to be effective.
The birth control ring is inserted into the vagina for three weeks, then removed for a week and replaced with a new ring. The birth control ring releases hormones into your body that prevent pregnancy, but you must remember to remove and reinsert the ring on schedule.
The birth control patch is a small, flexible patch that sticks on to your skin and releases hormones into your body. You wear the patch for three weeks, then remove it for a week and replace it with a new patch. As with the ring, you must remember to remove and replace your patch on schedule in order to effectively prevent pregnancy.

, If you are worried about having to remember to take a pill every day or change a patch every month, there are other hormonal birth control options that may work better for you. A quick visit to your doctor can keep you protected against pregnancy for months or even years at a time.The birth control shot is a hormonal injection that is given at your doctor's office. It is effective for one to three months and you must remember to get each shot on time in order to avoid getting pregnant.
The birth control implant is one of the most effective kind of hormonal contraceptive because it works for years without you having to think about it at all. The implant is small rod that is implanted under the skin of your arm by your doctor. It slowly releases hormones that prevent you from getting pregnant for up to three years.Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are also highly effective and long-lasting forms of birth control. These are tiny devices that your doctor implants into your uterus. They release either hormones or copper into your body, which prevents eggs from implanting into your uterus. They prevent pregnancy for five to 10 years, depending on the type., Condoms are a simple to use and very effective at preventing pregnancy when used properly. Using condoms is also the only way to prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if you are sexually active. You should always use condoms even if you are using another birth control method.Male condoms are typically made of latex and they fit over the man's penis to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids during sexual intercourse.
Female condoms are also available. These work in a similar way as male condoms, but they are placed inside the woman's vagina. They are not quite as effective as male condoms.
Using condoms along with another birth control method will further reduce your risk of becoming pregnant.

, Spermicide is a chemical that helps prevent pregnancy by killing sperm. It is available over the counter at drug stores in a variety of forms, including gels and creams. Spermicide is not a highly effective method of birth control on its own, but it can further reduce your risk of pregnancy when combined with other barrier methods.Some condoms contain spermicide for added protection.

, You can also prevent pregnancy by using a diaphragm or cervical cap, which is placed inside the vagina before sex to block sperm from entering the cervix.You must see a doctor to be fitted for these devices, as every woman's anatomy is slightly different.
Diaphragms and cervical caps typically must be used in conjunction with spermicide to be effective.

, If you are absolutely sure that you do not want to get pregnant now or ever, you can consider seeing a doctor to have a surgical sterilization procedure. This will prevent you from getting pregnant for the rest of your life, so only use this option if you're sure you won't change your mind about wanting to get pregnant in the future.There are two different kinds of female sterilization, both of which can be performed as outpatient procedures. With tubal ligation, the fallopian tubes are tied closed, which prevents eggs from coming in contact with sperm. With transcervical sterilization, the fallopian tubes are irritated with an instrument, which causes them to form scar tissue that prevents eggs from traveling through them. This type of sterilization can take several months to be effective.
If you have only one sexual partner, he can get sterilized by having a vasectomy. This is an outpatient procedure that prevents a man's sperm from reaching his penis. It is highly effective, although not 100%.

, If your regular birth control plan fails, there are still ways to prevent pregnancy. Emergency contraceptives should be taken within five days of unprotected sex, but they are more effective the sooner they are taken.There are several different kinds of emergency contraceptive pills available, some of which can be purchased over the counter. These pills do not cause abortions if you are already pregnant; they prevent you from becoming pregnant.
Emergency contraceptive pills can be purchased at most pharmacies without a prescription, and they are also available at women's health clinics like Planned Parenthood.There is also an emergency copper IUD available. You will need to see a doctor to have this inserted.

Stay indoors.,
Use mosquito netting.,
Use mosquito deterrents.,
Avoid areas where Zika or malaria outbreaks are reported.",How to Avoid Mosquito Bites During Pregnancy2," The most effective way to avoid getting mosquito bites is to avoid being around mosquitoes. This means that in order to assure that you are not bitten, you will need to stay indoors in rooms that have screens on the windows or have closed windows and air conditioning. Keeping mosquitoes out of your home and staying in your home is the best way to avoid getting bitten.This is especially important at times of day when they are most active, at dusk and dawn.

, If you are staying somewhere that is not airtight, and thus mosquitoes can get into your home, then you should use mosquito netting to avoid getting bitten. A bed that is covered in mosquito netting can be very effective in keeping you from getting bitten while you sleep.If you are spending time outdoors, for instance eating a meal outside, consider covering the area you are spending time in in mosquito netting. A patio or tent that is concealed in mosquito netting will allow you to be outside, while protecting you from mosquito bites.

, There are a variety of products that you can use to keep mosquitoes at bay. The most commonly used product is citronella, which mosquitoes do not like the smell of.

If pain persists, use ice for about 10 minutes 3 times a day., Aloe vera applied to mosquito bites may work in order to minimize swelling. However, aloe vera can cause irritation if left on the skin for a long period of time, so use it sparingly if it irritates you.Aloe vera can be grown at home. If you are growing aloe vera you can simply cut off a leaf and cut it open to expose the gel inside. This gel is what should be applied to your bites.

, Avoid scratching or rubbing the bite if you can. If you can successfully avoid scratching your bites, they should clear up within a day or two. A bite that has been scratched excessively can open up, raising the risk of infection and additional pain.It can be very difficult to avoid scratching a mosquito bite that is very itchy.

Aim for 30 minutes per day.",How to Avoid Gestational Diabetes," The first step in preventing GDM is determining your risk factors for developing it. If it turns out that you are at high risk, then you and your doctor take steps towards lowering your risk and keeping you and the baby healthy.


Before talking with your immediate relatives about their diabetic history, it might help to know the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, is an autoimmune disorder, whereas type 2 diabetes is closely tied to lifestyle and eating habits.
Your risk of developing gestational diabetes increases if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. Talk to your family to see if this applies to you.;
, Besides heredity, there are a number of other risk factors in that you should think about and bring to your doctor’s attention.These include:


Being Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander.Being overweight before your pregnancy.
Being 25 years of age or older.
If you developed GDM in a previous pregnancy.
If you previously had large baby (9 pounds or more) or a stillbirth.
If you had abnormal blood sugar tests before, including glycosuria (sugar in your urine).A history of polycystic ovarian syndrome.

, There are steps you can take even before you become pregnant to manage your risk for developing GDM. Consult with your doctor before you get pregnant and ask them to help you put together a pregnancy plan to help prepare your physically, mentally, and emotionally.Have your blood sugar tested as early as 3 months before you plan to become pregnant in order to establish your baseline levels and to if you fall in a normal range.Plan to lose any excess weight before pregnancy. Weight loss is not advised during pregnancy, so if you are overweight and concerned about this increasing your risk for GDM, try to lose the extra weight (between 5% to 7% of your body weight if you are overweight) before you become pregnant., Meet with your Ob-Gyn early on in your pregnancy, and frequently throughout, in order to ensure the health of you and your baby


It is recommended that those at average risk for GDM have a screening performed during their second trimester -- between 24 and 28 weeks.If you are at high risk, your doctor may elect to test for diabetes during your first prenatal visit., Being a proactive and informed patient can help you effectively communicate your concerns to your doctor.


When you make your appointment, ask if the doctor will order any tests, including a blood sugar screening, and if you should follow any food restrictions or fasting before your appointment.Go to your appointment with a list of any medications or supplements you are currently taking, as well as a list of any symptoms, concerns, or questions that you would like the doctor to address.
Let your doctor know that you are particularly concerned about GDM, either because of your family history or other personal risk factors. Ask if they recommend any special diet, exercise, or testing plans for you to follow during your pregnancy. , During your doctor’s visit, you will likely be tested for GDM through an “initial glucose challenge test” and/or a follow-up “glucose tolerance testing.”


In the “initial glucose challenge test,” you’ll be asked to drink a syrupy, sugar solution and then, after an hour has passed, your blood will be tested to measure your sugar levels. If your blood sugar level is higher than normal, it only means that you are now considered at higher risk for developing GDM, and will need a follow-up glucose tolerance test to determine if you have GDM.However, if the value is above 200mg/dl. Then gestational diabetes is presumed. If the diagnosis is made early in pregnancy, then you probably have pre-existing diabetes, not gestational diabetes.
In the “glucose tolerance test,” you’ll fast overnight and then have your blood sugar levels checked. Then, you’ll drink a sweet solution (this time with a higher level of sugar in it) and your blood will be checked every hour for three hours. If at least two of the three sugar readings come back as higher than normal, your doctor will very likely diagnose you with GDM., Consult with your doctor to find a regular testing schedule and method that works best for you. Ask your doctor about what you should do to change your diet and exercise routines to help mitigate GDM during your pregnancy.

, It is important to maintain steady blood sugar levels if you are at risk of gestational diabetes. Fiber will help you stabilize your sugar levels. In a study of the diets of women before they got pregnant, those who increased their daily fiber intake by 10 grams reduced their risk of GDM by 26%.Try to include more high-fiber foods to lower your risk.


High-fiber foods include whole grains, bran, fruits (especially prunes), and vegetables (especially green leafy vegetables).

, Protein is an essential part of a healthy diet, and also provides a lot of B vitamins which can help prevent birth defects.Make sure that you are getting plenty of protein from lean sources.


Lean meats, such as chicken, are good sources of protein and safe for pregnant women to consume. Avoid fish as a lean protein source, as its high mercury levels can be dangerous for pregnant women
Very dark green leafy vegetables such as broccoli and spinach are good sources of protein as well as iron.

, Fruits are good for you, but sugary fruit juices should be avoided. Fruits are high in natural sugars which in and of itself is not a bad thing, but one small glass of orange juice can contain the juice of as many as 10 oranges and there may also be added artificial sweeteners.

, This means items such as sugar, flour, as well as starchy potatoes and pasta. These items are more likely to spike your blood sugar, so it is best to limit your intake of these items to small quantities.

, Your body releases insulin in response to high blood sugar, and eating large meals or having lots of time in between meals can cause a spike in blood sugar. That is why it is best to have a steady level of insulin in your system instead of extreme spikes and low points throughout the day.


Keep an eye on portion sizes and try to eat several small meals frequently throughout the day to maintain your blood sugar levels.For example, you could eat a 300 to 400 calorie meal once every three hours during the day so that you consume a total of five meals totaling between 1,500 to 2,000 calories.

, Exercising before and during pregnancy can help protect you from developing gestational diabetes. Research has shown that women who were physically active for 4 hours a week or 30 minutes a day, before and during pregnancy can reduce their risk of GDM by about 70%.Always ask your doctor about how much and what type of physical activity are right for you.

, Safe exercises to participate in during pregnancy typically include low impact exercises, such as walking and swimming.Avoid doing any type of exercise that is high impact or that has a higher potential for injuries, such as contact sports.


Parking your car at the far end of the parking lot as you run your daily errands is one way to squeeze in extra activity., Most doctors will approve of up to 30 minutes of exercise per day, for most or several days a week, for pregnant women.You can incorporate several short exercise activities into your day to keep the stress on your body low while still reaping the same benefits as 30-minutes of straight activity.
Make sure to monitor your heart rate while exercising and never exceed the recommended target heart rate for your age and weight.

Reduce your risk of sexually transmitted infections.,
Get quick treatment for infections.,
Quit smoking.,
Understand the other risk factors.,
Get treatment for symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy.,
Opt for medicine instead of surgery if possible.,
Report persistent abdominal pain.,
Have future pregnancies monitored early.",How to Avoid Ectopic Pregnancy," Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea or chlamydia may increase a woman's chances of having an ectopic pregnancy. If you reduce your risk of contracting one of these diseases, you may reduce your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy as well.Limit your number of sexual partners in order to reduce your risk of exposure.
Always use a condom during sex to reduce your risk of contracting a disease.;
, If you do get an STI, it's important to get treatment right away. The sooner you are treated, the less likely you are to develop inflammation that may damage your reproductive system and increase your risk of developing ectopic pregnancies.Common symptoms of STIs include abdominal pain, painful urination, vaginal discharge, abnormal vaginal bleeding, vaginal odor, and pain during sex.Some infections are asymptomatic. It's a good idea to get tested regularly if you are sexually active.

, Smoking may increase your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy. Quit smoking before you try to conceive in order to reduce your risk.The more you smoke, the higher your risk of having an ectopic pregnancy will be, so if you can't quit, even reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke may be beneficial.

, There are many other factors that may put you at a higher than average risk for developing an ectopic pregnancy. If any of the following risk factors apply to you, it is especially important that you see a doctor as soon as you have reason to believe you are pregnant, as you will not be able to distinguish a normal pregnancy from an ectopic pregnancy by using an at-home pregnancy test: Women who have had a previous ectopic pregnancy
Women who get pregnant while they have an IUD or after having a tubal ligation procedure (both of which are very rare)
Women who have structural abnormalities of the fallopian tubes
Women who have struggled with fertility problems, especially women treated with assisted reproduction technologies (IVF, ART, etc.)
Women who were exposed to the chemical DES (diethylstilbestrol) before birth (DES was last used in 1971, so this is becoming less common), It's important to get medical treatment for an ectopic pregnancy right away. The sooner you get treatment, the lower your risks will be of developing severe complications.Common symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include missing periods, pain in the low back and abdomen (can be on the right or left side), cramping, abnormal vaginal bleeding.
If your ectopic pregnancy ruptures, you may experience symptoms such as severe abdominal pain, shoulder pain, low blood pressure, faintness, and pressure in the rectum. This is an emergency situation that requires immediate medical care.
Early symptoms of ectopic pregnancy may be the same as the symptoms of a normal pregnancy, so it's important to see your doctor early to ensure that your pregnancy is developing normally.

, If you develop an ectopic pregnancy, you will need to either take medication or have surgery to remove the pregnancy. If medication is an option for you, it may be preferable, as it is less likely to cause damage to the fallopian tubes, which can further increase your risk of having another ectopic pregnancy in the future.Medication is usually only an option if the ectopic pregnancy is detected early. The medication used to stop cell growth is called methotrexate. If methotrexate is used, the patient will be required to follow up regularly for blood tests and close observation, so you must be able to commit to returning for follow up appointments.
Methotrexate can cause side effects, including indigestion, diarrhea, and nausea.
If you were given methotrexate, use birth control to avoid becoming pregnant again for at least three months. Exposure to methotrexate may harm your unborn child.Surgery is sometimes the best option, so always listen to your doctor's advice. Surgery is done laparoscopically (through tiny incisions) and only rarely through a laparotomy (large incision).

, If you have abdominal pain that does not subside after you are treated for an ectopic pregnancy, tell your doctor about it right away. This may be a sign of an infection, which could continue to increase your risk of having ectopic pregnancies if it is not treated., While there's not much you can to prevent another ectopic pregnancy, you can prevent a future ectopic pregnancy from causing serious complications. If you have had an ectopic pregnancy in the past, you should see your doctor for blood tests and ultrasounds as soon as you think you are pregnant again. This can help confirm early on whether your pregnancy is normal.Most women who have ectopic pregnancies go on to have normal pregnancies, so don't give up hope.

Use sunlight to your advantage.,
Get your morning caffeine fix.,
Use a shower cycle to wake up.",How to Have Lots of Energy After Having Little Sleep1," Sunlight and even other bright lights in your house can help signal to your body that it's time to get up. By getting into bright light just after waking up, whether by going outside or flooding your bedroom with light, you alert your body to the fact that it's time to start the day, giving you more energy for the morning., Caffeine can give you a boost of energy. It stops the cells in your body from accepting adenosine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that tells your cells to sleep. Caffeine tells those same cells to wake up, and it encourages faster brain function.Coffee, tea, and many sodas all contain caffeine. For instance, a cup of green tea has 24 to 45 milligrams of caffeine in a cup, while a coffee can have anywhere from 95 to 200 milligrams.Try not to drink more that 200mg (one to two 5-oz cups of coffee) each day.While this number can vary depending on your weight, sensitivity, and sex, but you should never drink more than 600mg a day (between four and seven cups). And avoid caffeine pills, which people often turn to when overtired. These can be very dangerous and even fatal.Because you build up a tolerance if you drink coffee every day, try to save it for the times when you really need it., A warm or hot shower can make you feel sleepy instead of awake. However, you can counteract the effect by using a cold-hot-cold cycle at the end. That is, when you're finished cleaning yourself up, switch the shower to cold for 30 seconds. Next, switch it back to hot for 30 seconds. Finally, go back to cold for 30 seconds. This cycle gets your blood pumping and increases your energy for the day."

Skip the sugar.,
Make hydration a priority.,
Try a piece of gum.",How to Have Lots of Energy After Having Little Sleep2," Instead of eating a ton of sugar, which is tempting to do when you're tired, try eating complex carbohydrates and protein. Sugar can give you a rush of energy, but then your energy will crash. Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, offer more sustained energy, especially when you pair them with protein.For instance, try some natural peanut butter on whole-wheat bread or a piece of fruit with a slice of cheese.

, Dehydration can lead to fatigue. Therefore, staying hydrated will help keep your energy up. Try sipping on water throughout the day to make sure you get enough.


The Institute of Medicine recommends that men drink 13 cups and women drink 9 cups of water every day.Other liquids can contribute to your water intake, such as juice and coffee. However, drinking too much juice can pack on extra calories and cause a sugar crash, so try to limit your intake. Also, though you can count caffeinated beverages, you shouldn't make them the majority of the liquid you drink in a day., Keeping something in your mouth, such as a piece of gum, can help increase your alertness. The best time for this type of trick is when you're in a meeting that you absolutely need to stay awake for."

In fact, a 10 to 20 minute nap is all you need; any longer, and you can go into deep sleep, leaving you feeling groggy.If you can't take a nap, try paradoxical relaxation. Take a moment to close your eyes. In your mind, focus on one muscle group, such as your shoulder and back muscles. Concentrate on what you're feeling in those muscles for about 15 seconds. Repeat with other muscles in your body. Doing so can give you some of the benefits of taking a short nap without having to conk out., Light not only helps you wake up, it can help you stay energized for the rest of the day. To help get over the slump of the afternoon, make sure you throw your curtains open, letting in plenty of natural light., Music can help increase your energy when you're sagging, according to one study. To help even more, tap along with the beat or hum, which ups your alertness.If lyrics distract you, try picking an instrumental piece that has energy.
As an added bonus, music can help ease tension., When you're sitting for long periods of time, you're going to feel more sleepy. Just getting up every hour or so and walking around can help boost your energy and keep you alert when you sit back down., Whether it's catching a few minutes talking with your coworkers or peers or pulling up a funny internet meme, a laugh can be good for you. It gets your blood flowing, leaving you more energized., Certain scents can help you stay awake. For instance, you can use scents such as peppermint, cinnamon, eucalyptus, and rosemary to help keep you alert. Try taking a whiff of essential oils or burning a candle in one of those scents; you can also try a scented lotion., Stepping outside, particularly in a green area, for just 20 minutes a day can boost your energy.

Stop nighttime activities.,
Bathe.,
Control the climate.,
Turn off the lights and electronics.,
Use aromatherapy.",How to Get Back to Sleeping Normal Hours1," One of the biggest issues that prevents people from falling asleep in timely manner is the fact that they don’t unwind before bedtime. Generally, you want to avoid any activities that stimulate your senses before trying to sleep — take some time to identify which activities energize you and which relax you. Some general guidelines include: don’t watch T.V., read something exciting (like a thriller you can't put down), use your smartphone or tablet, or play video games before bedtime.

If you choose to listen to music before bedtime, make sure it is rhythmically slower and utilizes soothing tones. Listening to high-energy music, like metal or rap, could prevent you from falling asleep when you want to.;
, If you need to clean up during the evening or nighttime, you are much better off taking a warm, soothing bath. Showers don’t really help people relax or unwind the same way a bath does and showering late at night may be the reason you have trouble falling asleep., Another factor that may be preventing you from falling asleep is the climate in your bedroom. Make sure your bedroom is cool and comfortable with plenty of airflow when trying to fall asleep.It is recommended you keep your room around 65°F (18.3°C) when sleeping.If you find that this is too warm or too cold for you, however, it's okay to try decreasing or increasing the temperature.
If you don't have a thermostat, try using a fan to cool down your room. The fan can also provide white noise, which helps some people sleep.

, Resting or relaxing in a dark place helps to prepare the body and mind for sleep. Make sure your room is free of light. T.V.s, D.V.D. players, computers and alarm clocks with lights could all contribute to your problems with sleep, so make sure to deal with these sources. Also, make sure you have thick, effective blinds or drapes to eliminate any outside sources of light from slipping into your bedroom.Exposure to light interferes with your body's ability to produce melatonin, which helps you feel sleepy and fall asleep.
Light emitted by the screens of smartphones, tablets, and other devices is stimulating and can make it difficult to fall asleep. Limit use of these items before bed.

, Evidence suggests that it may be easier to sleep in a fresh, clean, or nice smelling space. Try using a diffuser with essential oils, a plug in deodorizer, or spraying the room with a mild room spray to lighten up your mood and the ambience in your bedroom.


Avoid burning candles around bedtime, as this is a serious safety hazard if you doze off before extinguishing the candle.

Stay hydrated with plenty of filtered or bottled water, glass bottles are best as there are currently fears about chemicals found in plastic bottles seeping into the contents.;
, Acne treatments, antibiotic treatments and skin creams that contain derivatives of vitamin A should not be used during pregnancy. To cleanse your skin effectively, again consider a soft facial brush with a chemical free facial cleanser. Ideally you can make your own cleanser - oatmeal mixed with natural yogurt (1:1) can be very affective for most skin types. You could also try refreshing cucumber and pineapple pulp or moisturising crushed avocado flesh. Just apply and rinse as you would your usual cleanser. Avoid using soaps on your face as they may contain emollients that can block pores. If your skin becomes greasy during pregnancy try using blotting papers to soak up excess oils.

Try eating foods that have complex carbohydrates, lean-proteins, and unsaturated fats. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole-grain breads, cereals and pastas, as well as brown rice.
Lean proteins are found in low-fat cheeses, chicken, fish and turkey. Pay attention to how you prepare your lean proteins, as fried chicken or fish are not “lean”.
Unsaturated fats can be found in foods like almonds, peanuts, walnuts, cashews and pistachios.

, Your digestive system has more to do with your sleep patterns than you might think. Avoid eating late dinners or snacking after dinner. When your body is working to digest food, it is harder to relax and fall asleep. So cut out the nighttime food intake and you may be in a better position to fall asleep when you want to."

Devise a sleep routine.,
Exercise earlier.,
Free your mornings.,
Shift your daily routine forward.,
Stay awake.",How to Get Back to Sleeping Normal Hours3," Your goal is to fix your sleep cycle. With that being the case, you need to devise an ideal sleep routine that you are trying to achieve. Establish when you need to fall asleep, how long you want to sleep, and what time you have to get up in the morning. Once you have some target goals in mind, you can make adjustments as necessary to reach those goals. Once you have established and achieved an effective sleep routine, stick with it and don’t deviate from the plan.You should keep a sleep diary that tracks your habits and sleep patterns to help you devise a routine.Try moving up your sleep and wake up times incrementally over a few weeks. If you can go to bed 15 minutes earlier and wake up 15 minutes earlier every day over the course of a few weeks, you can gradually get back to normal sleeping pattern. This may be a more effective and usable strategy than trying to make drastic changes to your sleep patterns.

, Exercise is a necessary activity for health and happiness; however, you will want to exercise earlier in the day if you have problems with your sleep cycle. Working out in the evening or nighttime may boost your adrenaline levels, making it harder to fall and stay asleep. With this in mind, try working out in the morning or early afternoon., A major issue facing people who have trouble sleeping consistently and on a set schedule is the stress they incur in the mornings. We have all been there. When you know you have something important to do in the morning, you have a much harder time falling asleep. While it is not always possible, make every effort to clear your morning schedule of stressful or important events. This will help relax your mind at night, making it easier to fall asleep when you want to.


You can make simple changes to decrease your stress in the morning. Try laying out your clothes before you go to sleep. Put your coffee maker on an alarm so that it will make coffee automatically in the morning. Shower the night before or set out breakfast essentials that don't need to be refrigerated (such as a box of cereal, bowl, and spoon).

, If you can, push everything on your daily schedule forward to an earlier time. If you eat breakfast at 10am, bump it up to 8am, and so forth. Getting all of the daily activities you need to tend to out of the way earlier will free up more time to unwind and get to bed at a reasonable hour., Sleep is all about cycles and rhythm. If you find you are staying up far too late at night and sleeping in for too much of the day, pick a day, preferably when you don’t have anything to do, and just don’t go to sleep. By the time your desired bedtime rolls around again, you will be extremely tired and able to fall asleep."

Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals.,
Eat cold foods because they do not smell as strongly as hot foods.,
Stick to meals that are bland.,
Avoid fatty foods.,
Avoid foods that you know trigger your gag reflex.,
Stay hydrated.,
Drink ginger ale.,
Make a blended juice that is recommended for pregnant women.,
Up your intake of vitamin B6.,
Talk to your doctor about taking wild yam root.",How to Avoid Hyperemesis Gravidarum1," When you eat small meals throughout the day, your stomach has to produce less acid to digest the food. Less acid means your stomach is less likely to become irritated, so you are less likely to feel nauseous.Eating a large meal can also distend your abdomen, which can actually trigger feelings of nausea that could lead to vomiting.;
, You should generally avoid strong-smelling foods if you are concerned about hyperemesis gravidarum. Cold foods generally have less of an aroma than hot foods, so stick to cold dishes. While this might be frustrating, it is most likely worth it if you want to avoid becoming nauseous., Spicy food and oily foods can make your gastrointestinal system produce more acid. This is because the spices and oils from the food agitate the walls of the stomach, causing your stomach and pancreas to secrete more bile. Due to the excess production of these digestive acids, the vomiting center in the brain gets activated and can cause hyperemesis gravidarum.

, Fatty foods take a longer time to digest, which means that they slow down your digestive system and can increase the amount of acid your stomach is producing.More acid can mean that you will begin to feel more nauseous. Fatty foods include:


Fried foods, animal products like lard, commercially-baked cakes and pastries, vegetable shortening, and margarine., Some foods have stronger smells than others. Everyone is different, so you will have to keep track of the foods that smell a little too strongly for your taste., Nausea can be triggered by thirst and hunger, so it is important to stay hydrated if you are concerned about becoming nauseous. Drink your beverage of choice in small sips as chugging a bunch of water can also make you feel nauseous.If you are bored with water, you can add a small amount of fruit juice to the water to give it some flavor.
You can also pour a glass of water ( approx 300ml) and add pinch of salt, lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of sugar for a tart, yet sweet, drink.

, Ginger helps to combat Hyperemesis gravidarum. It increases the movement of the gastrointestinal symptom and stops the signals to the brain that are responsible for making you feel like vomiting., This drink provides you with nutrients to keep you healthy. The recipe can be altered if some aspect of the flavor or texture is not to your liking. In a blender, combine:


One cup of fresh apple juice, 1 frozen banana, 1 teaspoon of blackstrap molasses, 1 glass of yoghurt, 2 teaspoonfuls of nutritional yeast, 1 tablespoon of protein powder, 1-2 tablespoons of honey, 1 glass of low fat milk, 1 teaspoon of kelp that contains a mixture of minerals, and 3 tablespoons of nuts., You can take vitamin B6 supplements to potentially decrease your chances of vomiting.Again, it is always best to talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.The normal recommended dose is 50 mg a day.

, Talking to a doctor or specialist is always recommended before trying a new herb or making drastic changes to your diet. Wild yam root is thought to affect your estrogen levels and decrease the likelihood that you will feel nauseous. The root contains steroidal saponins that can affect your hormones.The dried herb generally comes in 2 to 4 gram capsules that can be taken daily with one cup of water.

Increase your physical activity.,
Reduce stress.,
Drink more water.,
Quit smoking.,
Cut back on alcohol intake.,
Lose weight.",How to Fight Fatigue1," Even though it's the last thing you feel like doing when you're tired and out of energy, getting frequent exercise is one of the most effective ways to overcome fatigue. Study after study has shown that people who exercise regularly are more active, energetic and, in general, healthier than those who don't.


You don't need to slog it out on the treadmill for an hour to enjoy the benefits of exercise - find an activity you enjoy that still gets your body moving - try a dance class, take up martial arts, or go on a bike ride with a friend.
Not only does exercise make you more energetic, it increases your overall health by strengthening the heart, lungs and muscles. It also makes you happier, as it triggers your body's production of ""happy hormones"" called endorphins.

Yoga is believed to be a particularly effective form of exercise for reducing fatigue. This is due to the fact that yoga, thanks to its calming, meditative nature, can increase mental energy in addition to physical energy levels.;
, Stress, anxiety and negative emotions in general can be a major sap on your energy levels. Therefore, in order to effectively fight fatigue, you will first need to minimize your stress levels.


If your stress tends to come from the workplace, see if you can delegate some of your heavy workload to your colleagues, or consider switching to more laid-back job.
If your stress comes from a demanding or difficult partner, sit them down and discuss what your needs are within the relationship - if he/she can't agree, consider taking a break and reassessing whether you want to be in this relationship.
Sometimes stress stems from a lack of ""me time"". If you feel this is the case, then make some time for yourself. Take up an activity like yoga or meditation which will help to clear your mind and reduce stress. If that's not your thing, just having a relaxing bath or spending time with friends and family can be enough., Dehydration is a common cause of fatigue and low energy levels, in addition to poor concentration. Without enough water in your system, blood flow to the essential organs (including the brain) is reduced, thus slowing them down.


Therefore, one easy step you can take to fight fatigue is just to drink more water every day. Although 6 to 8 glasses a day is a good guideline, it's also important to listen to your body.
One way to tell if you are dehydrated is to look at the color of your urine. If you are adequately hydrated, it should be a pale yellow or straw colored. If it's any darker, you are dehydrated.You can also increase your water intake by drinking herbal teas and eating fruit and veg with a high water content, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, watermelon and beets.

, In general, smokers tend to have less energy than their non-smoking counterparts. Cigarettes contain an abundance of harmful substance which affect your overall health and wellness.


More specifically, your body needs to combine oxygen with glucose in order to make energy, but the carbon monoxide in cigarettes depletes your body's oxygen levels, making it harder to produce energy.Therefore, if you're a frequent smoker who struggles with fatigue, your first step should be to quit smoking. It won't be easy, but your body will thank you for it! Find some helpful tips on how to quit smoking here.

, Although you may feel that having a glass of wine or beer in the evening helps you to unwind or maybe even fall asleep, it can actually leave you feeling more tired the next day.


This is due to the fact that alcohol prevents you from falling into a deep sleep, which leaves you feeling groggy and unrefreshed when you wake up, even if you had a full 8 hours sleep.
Therefore, you should aim to cut back on nighttime drinking, and limit your alcohol consumption to 3-4 units per day for men and 2-3 units a day for women., If you're carrying around an extra few pounds, you can find yourself feeling sluggish and drained of energy. Simply by losing a little bit of weight, you can increase your energy levels and improve your mood and quality of life.


Make sure you lose weight safely and healthily - you can do this by cutting back on your portion sizes (using smaller plates helps), eating a balanced diet, cutting out high sugar and high fat foods and getting plenty of exercise.
It's very important that you avoid crash dieting, as this can leave you feeling more fatigued than before. This is due to the fact that low-carb and other strict diets don't provide enough energy for your body's needs, in addition to depriving the body of important vitamins and nutrients."

Avoid anything that triggers your gag reflex.,
Eliminate environmental factors that can trigger nausea.,
Take pills with a lot of food or water.,
Avoid things that cause your stress or anxiety.,
Listen to your body and rest when you need to.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Lose weight before you become pregnant.,
Create a good exercise routine for yourself before you become pregnant.",How to Avoid Hyperemesis Gravidarum2," While smell is the largest trigger, simply being in a place where you know the smell was once can make you gag. Even thinking about certain food can make you feel nauseous. Keep track of what makes you feel nauseous and write them down. Avoid these things as much as possible.Smells are not limited to food. They could be the way the subway smells, sprays, chemicals, or stinky feet.

, Two common environmental factors that you should avoid if you are concerned about nausea is cigarette smoke and bright lights. Of course, you should avoid cigarette smoke as much as possible because it is not good for your baby when you inhale it, even if it is second hand. Stay away from people who are smoking and ask any family members or friends to avoid smoking near you. Bright lights can trigger nausea and vomiting, so keep the lights in your house dim if you can., When you take a pill, there is a chance that it will trigger your gag reflex, which in turn can cause you to feel nauseous. You will most likely take a few pills each day to keep your baby healthy.


When you take these pills, take them with a gulp of water, or put them in something like yogurt, which can be swallowed without chewing.

, Stress can trigger the vomiting center in the brain, so it is a good idea to stay as stress-free as possible. If you are feeling stressed or anxious, talk to a trusted friend or family member about what you are going through. Often, talking to someone can relieve your stress.You can also stress-free activities like:


Yoga.
Meditation.
Watching a favorite movie.
Gardening.

, Working yourself to the bone can make you really tired. When you are exhausted, it is much more likely that you will become nauseous. No one knows your body better than you, so listen to it—take breaks when you need to and don’t be afraid to simply rest when you begin to feel tired.

, Wearing tight clothing can make it difficult for you to breath. Shortness of breath can cause nausea so it is a good idea to wear loose clothing that is comfortable and will allow you to breathe as deeply as you like., Weight loss before pregnancy can also reduce the chances of hyperemesis gravidarum. Since high levels of estrogen play a part in hyperemesis gravidarum, it may help to reduce those levels. Women who weigh more generally have higher levels of estrogen, so if you are very concerned about hyperemesis gravidarum, you can try to lose weight before you become pregnant., A healthy mind can lead to a healthy pregnancy. Exercise causes your body to pump out endorphins, chemicals that make you feel happy. When you are happier, you feel less stressed. Stress can actually have an effect on your gastrointestinal system and can cause you to feel nauseous."

Prevent hyperemesis with a prescription for metoclopramide or ondansetron.,
Talk to your doctor about antiemetic drugs.,
Consider taking prednisolone if you have hyperemesis gravidarum.",How to Avoid Hyperemesis Gravidarum3," Drugs like ondansetron and metoclopramide are used to avoid hyperemesis gravidarum. These drugs are considered 5HT3 receptor blockers. These are the receptors in your body that get activated when your body wants to vomit. These medications block the receptors, thereby keeping your vomit triggers from being activated.Metoclopramide is generally prescribed as 5 to 10 mg taken every eight hours., Antiemetic drugs can decrease feelings of nausea or the desire to vomit. However it is recommended that you talk to your doctor about what medications might be right for you. Some antiemetic drugs that are used to combat nausea include:


Promethazine.
Chlorpromazine.
Metoclopramide.

, Prednisolone has been shown to have an effect on hyperemesis gravidarum. It can stop vomiting and can also help you gain back the weight that the condition has caused you to lose. Steroids decrease the stimulus to the brain centers that are responsible for vomiting.Prednisolone is administered three times a day for a period of a week depending on the severity of hyperemesis gravidarum and then reduced in stepwise fashion.

Get at least 7 hours sleep a night.,
Stick to a sleeping schedule.,
Make sure your room is comfortable.,
Don't drink caffeine for at least 5 hours before bed.,
Avoid using technology before bed.,
Take a warm bath.,
If necessary, take a nap.",How to Fight Fatigue2," It may seem fairly obvious, but if you're suffering from fatigue, the first and foremost step is to ensure that you are getting enough sleep every night.


It's estimated that two-thirds of people experience sleep problems at some point in their lives, and these sleep problems negatively affect their energy levels, mood and work performance the next day.Therefore it's important that you go to bed at a reasonable hour, to ensure that you get at least 7, and ideally 8 hours sleep per night.
If you have trouble getting to sleep (no matter how tired you are), there are several adjustments you should make to your night-time routine.

, Aside from getting enough sleep, it's important that you try to go to sleep and wake up at approximately the same time every day (even on weekends).


This helps to set your body clock to a regular schedule - for example, if you go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 6 am every day, your body will soon adjust to and accept this new schedule and you will naturally feel sleepy at 10 and awake and refreshed at 6.
However, if you follow an erratic sleeping schedule - waking up and going to bed at a different time each day - your body will be out of sync and you may have difficulty falling asleep at night and a hard time staying awake during the day.

, It's also important to make sure that your bedroom is a comfortable, relaxing space where sleep is the main focus.


Ensure that the temperature is comfortable for sleeping in - not too hot or not too cold. Invest in a fan or just open a window if your room is stuffy, as sleeping in a hot room is not conducive to good sleep.
Try to eliminate all sources of light - the window, electric lights and any blinking or LED lights on alarm clocks, televisions, or other electrical devices. If you don't want to turn them off, just cover them with a thick cloth.
Reduce noise levels as much as possible.Close your bedroom door and ask anyone still awake to keep the television/music turned down. If you find it difficult to drown out noise from the street, consider buying a white noise machine or just play some ambient music.

, Although a cup of coffee here and there can certainly help you to fight fatigue throughout the day, drinking too much or drinking it too close to bedtime can negatively impact your sleep.


Some people don't realize the effects that caffeine has on their sleep quality and generally energy levels. To figure it out, try slowly cutting coffee and other caffeinated drinks (black tea, cola and energy drinks) from your diet over a three week period to see if you notice any increase in your energy levels.
Even if you seem to have a high tolerance for caffeine and are not keen on the idea of giving up your morning coffee, it's a good idea to stop drinking any caffeinated drinks at least 5 hours before bedtime. Switch to decaffeinated versions instead., Although it seems like a nice idea to watch television, play a computer game or surf the net on your laptop or iPad to unwind before bed, these activities can actually do more harm than good.


The bright lights produced by these devices actually trick the brain into believing it's daytime, which prevents your body from producing the hormones (notably melatonin) responsible for inducing sleep.
In addition, watching action, thriller or horror movies/TV shows right before bed gets your heart racing, stimulating the body and brain and making sleep impossible.
Therefore, you should make an effort to switch off all technological devices at least an hour before bed and partake in a more relaxing activity instead. Try reading a book (although not from a backlit e-reader), meditating or listening to music.

, Taking a warm bath before bed is believed to be very effective at inducing sleep, for two main reasons:


Firstly, a hot bath helps you to relax and forget about the stresses and worries of the day - worries which are often responsible for keeping you awake at night. Secondly, the rise in body temperature (when you're in the bath) followed by the rapid drop (when you get out) mimics the body-cooling hormones your brain releases when you fall asleep.
Take a bath for at least 20 to 30 minutes before bed, and try to ensure that the water temperature is at least 100 degree F, or as hot as you can handle without scalding yourself! Keep in mind that a hot bath is not recommended for people with diabetes, gynecologic problems, low blood pressure, heart failure, varicose veins as well as during pregnancy.
Add some aromatic essential oils, such as lavender or chamomile to the water, light some candles and play some soothing music for extra relaxation value!

, If you're really feeling exhausted throughout the day, consider taking a short nap, as it can really work wonders for your energy levels. Keep it short and sweet through - 10 minutes to 30 minutes, max.


If you nap for too long, you may wake up feeling groggy and have difficulty sleeping that night. A short power nap, however, can boost energy levels and leave you feeling more awake and productive.
Also try following up your nap with a small cup of coffee and a quick snack for an added energy boost.

Make healthy food choices.,
Eat iron-rich foods.,
Eat Omega-3s.,
Don't skip meals or overeat.",How to Fight Fatigue3," Eating a balanced, healthy diet will provide you with more energy and prevent you from feeling sluggish and fatigued.


Therefore, you should increase the amount of healthy foods like fruit, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean meats in your diet.
On the other hand, you should reduce your intake of not-so-healthy foods such as those with a high salt, high sugar or high fat content., Fatigue is sometimes caused by anemia, which is a red blood cell deficiency often caused by a lack of iron in the diet.


Eating more iron-rich foods can help to restore the levels of red blood cells in your system, so try to eat more lean meat, tofu, shellfish, beans and seeds.
Alternatively, you could take an iron supplement, but speak to your doctor about this first.

, Eating omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to boost alertness and increase energy levels, in addition to numerous other healthful benefits.


Human bodies do not produce omega-3 naturally, so it's important to include omega-3 food in your diet. You can do this by eating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel and tuna.
If you're not a fish fan, you can also find omega-3s in walnuts and flaxseeds, or you could take a fish oil supplement., Your energy levels are closely linked to your blood sugar levels, which may spike or fall as a result of overeating or under eating.


Overeating will cause your blood sugar levels to spike, which may drain your energy and leave you feeling sleepy. Instead of eating three large meals a day, try eating six mini meals in order to spread your energy intake evenly over the day.
Under eating or skipping meals over the course of the day will cause your blood sugar levels to dip, leaving you feeling weak and out of energy. Always eat breakfast (even a cereal bar is better than nothing) and snack on a piece of fruit or low-fat yogurt when you feel peckish.

Be careful with medications.,
Cope with depression-related fatigue.,
See a doctor if you believe your fatigue may be a symptom of an underlying issue.",How to Fight Fatigue4," Certain medications may cause drowsiness and fatigue. These include:


Antihistamines, diuretics and many blood pressure medications, amongst others.
If you think your medication may be causing fatigue, speak to your doctor. He/she they may be able to switch your medication to a non-drowsy alternative., Sometimes fatigue is related to depression - either because the fatigue is a symptom of depression or because the depressed person finds themselves unable to sleep.


If you feel depressed, speak to a doctor and know that several effective treatment options exist, such as counselling or cognitive behavior therapy., Fatigue is sometimes just a symptom of a more serious underlying issue, such as diabetes, thyroid disease, sleep apnea, arthritis and heart disease.


If you think this might be the case, or notice any other symptoms, speak to your doctor immediately.
The sooner these issues are diagnosed, the sooner they can be treated."

Notice if you wake up with feelings of anxiety.,
Decide if the nightmares are interfering with your life.,
Identify if your nightmares give you physical symptoms.,
Eliminate other reasons for nightmares.,
Identify if you are at risk.",How to Diagnose Nightmare Disorder1," One of the symptoms and diagnostic criteria of nightmare disorder is waking up often from vivid nightmares. You may remember many details from the dream, and the dream may have been extremely long or feel like it was very long. The nightmares often have narratives and are very elaborate.In the nightmare, you may feel threats to your survival, security or self-esteem.
When you awaken, you feel alert and oriented instead of disoriented or confused.;
, When you have nightmare disorder, the nightmares usually feel real and you wake up with emotions from the nightmares, such as feeling scared, sad, disgusted, or angry.Generally, you will wake up feeling intense fear or anxiety. When you wake up, you may feel restless or upset because of your nightmare.You may vividly remember your dream, which makes you hyper aware of your surroundings.
You may be extremely alert and on edge when you wake up.

, If your nightmares are interfering with your everyday life, you may be suffering from nightmare disorder. Nightmare disorder causes problems with your work, social interactions, and other aspects of your life.For example, your child may have nightmare disorder if he or she is always disrupting your sleep because of nightmares.
Nightmare disorder may cause you to be so tired or sleepy that your work is impaired.
You may become afraid to fall asleep due to your nightmare disorder.

, If you have nightmare disorder, you may experience physical symptoms upon waking. You may be woken up from the dream with a start or even jerking awake. Because of your emotional response to the nightmare, you may have trouble falling asleep again.Upon waking, your heart may be pounding or you may be sweating.

, You may have nightmare disorder if your symptoms cannot be attributed to other conditions or reasons. Eliminating other possibilities for the nightmares makes the symptoms only due to the disorder.For example, you need to make sure that your nightmares are not caused by recreational drugs or alcohol.
Make sure you don’t have another mental condition, such as PTSD or delirium, or an underlying medical condition.

, Everyone has nightmares. However, nightmare disorder is more common in certain age groups than others. Children are generally the most common group diagnosed with nightmare disorder. However, teens and adults can have nightmare disorders, or children can have nightmare disorder throughout their entire lives.Nightmare disorder usually occurs in children between the ages of three and 18.

Take five deep breaths. Inhaling and exhaling can help the body relax. Place your hand on your stomach and try to breathe in a way that your hand rises and falls on your belly with your breathing.Focus on the present moment. This can help you take your mind off of any intrusive thoughts that are preventing you from falling asleep. Focus on the feeling of the sheets against your legs, the temperature of the room, any noises coming from outside, and the smell of your sheets or bed. Hyper focusing on the present moment can help lull you to sleep.Tensing your toes can actually relieve a lot of tension. If you're trying to fall asleep but can't, try pulling your toes inward, holding for a count of ten, and then releasing them and counting to ten again. Repeat 10 times.;
, If you've been trying to fall asleep for awhile and can't, it's best to leave the room and do something else for a bit. Reading a book, listening to soothing music, and other calming activities can help lull you to sleep. You should associate your room primarily with sleep, so make sure you go to the living room or somewhere else in your home and only return to your bed if you start feeling sleepy. Remember to keep the lighting dim and not do anything too stimulating. If you read a book, don't choose a page-turning suspense novel. Try a biography or something a little less exciting.

, If you're having trouble sleeping because you can't stop thinking about everything that's on your plate for tomorrow, make a to-do list. This can get distracting thoughts out of your head. Write down everything you need to do tomorrow on a piece of paper. Avoid using your smartphone, as the light from the screen will interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps you fall asleep. Purging distracting thoughts can help you fall asleep easier., Your room can have a dramatic effect on your ability to sleep. If you frequently struggle to nod off, an inhospitable sleeping environment may be to blame.


Watch the temperature in your room. The ideal sleeping temperature is between 60 and 65°F (15.6 to 18.3°C). If your room is hotter or colder than this, you may need to invest in a space heater or air conditioner.Bright lights can inhibit your ability to sleep. Use black-out drapes or a sleep mask to block out any light. Dim any clocks or appliances with bright screens before bed.Keep you sleeping and waking life separate. Try to avoid doing work in the bedroom and use it primarily for sleeping. If you make a habit of engaging in work in bed, your brain will learn to associate your sleeping space with ""go"" time. You may end up feeling energized when you get into bed.

, Body scan meditation is a meditation practice in which you try to be aware of different regions of your body. By hyper-focusing on one section of the body at a time, you can ease your mind into sleepiness.


Body scan meditation techniques vary in length. They can last from 10 minutes to three or five minutes. You start by focusing on a small part of your body, like your little toe, and then move on to focusing on an entire region of the body. You pay attention to sensations in that body part, then in a particular region, and then move upward. You go from, say, your toe to your foot to your lower leg and so on.There are many guided meditation techniques online that focus on body scan meditation. If you're trying to fall asleep, you may want to do a shorter routine of about five minutes; however, if your mind feels particularly busy and distracted, a longer routine may help., If you're having trouble falling asleep, sometimes something like chamomile tea or milk can help. Try having a drink of one of these beverages on sleepless nights.


There is still a great deal of scientific uncertainty as to warm milk's effect on sleep. It's believed that, while the physical effect of milk is limited, the beverage is comforting to some. The psychological soothing effect of warm milk may increase feelings of drowsiness, especially if you were given warm milk as a sleep aid when you were young.As with warm milk, there is still some confusion about the benefits of chamomile tea on sleep. The effects are likely more psychological than physical but as many find chamomile tea comforting, a cup of tea before bed can help you sleep. Just make sure to avoid caffeinated teas, which can affect the sleep cycle., Your body temperature dips naturally just before bed. If you take a warm bath or shower close to bedtime, this causes your temperature to increase momentarily and then decrease when you exit the water. This decrease in temperature mimics the natural bodily process that prepares you for sleep, which can help calm you down and promote feelings of drowsiness. For the best effect, hop in the shower about two hours before bed., If you're having trouble sleeping due to noise outside or loud neighbors, consider a white noise machine. This is a machine that generates white noise or soothing background noises to drown out unwanted sound. You can also download white noise apps on many mobile phones.

, Melatonin is the hormone your body makes that helps influence your sleep/wake cycle. Taking a melatonin supplement may help you feel sleepy and can be taken as a short-term solution. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking a supplement.

Purchase a supplement that is marked ""USP Verified,"" which means the dosage and ingredients are accurately listed on the package.

, If you want to work on improving your sleep long-term, establish a firm sleep schedule. Your body runs on a circadian rhythm that will adjust to set sleep/wake times. If you make an effort to fall asleep and get up at the same time every day, you'll end up sleeping and waking up easier.


Make gradual adjustments. If you normally fall asleep around 2AM and find yourself lagging in the morning, you can't immediately switch to going to bed at 11PM. Try to to go to bed 20 or 30 minutes earlier each night until you reach the bedtime you desire.Stick to the schedule even on weekends. While it can be tempting to sleep in on Saturdays, doing so confuses the body's circadian rhythm. This will make falling asleep Sunday night and waking up Monday morning difficult., Your body needs at least an hour before bed to wind down and relax. Choose calming activities to engage in an hour before bedtime.


Reading, doing crossword puzzles, taking a warm bath, or listening to music are all relaxing activities that can help you fall asleep.Many people watch television to wind down before bed. If you choose to do so, watch something that is half an hour or less to limit exposure to bright lights. Choose a relaxing, lighthearted program over anything heavy. Viewing something upsetting before bed can result in difficulty sleeping., Electronic devices, such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones emit ""blue light,"" which is stimulating and can interfere with your sleep. Try to avoid these devices before you go to bed or look into options that reduce the emission of blue light in the evening, such as programs like f.lux for your computer or ""Night Shift"" for your smartphone., Eating heavy foods before bed can result in an upset stomach keeping you up at nigh t;however, going to bed hungry can also be distracting. If you feel hungry before bed, choose a low-calorie healthy snack over something greasy or sugary. Healthy foods will fill you up, allowing you to fall asleep satisfied.Try a piece of whole grain toast with a little peanut butter. This is a satisfying snack that may also help you fall asleep, as the complex carbs will help your body deliver sleep-inducing tryptophan to your brain., If you have chronic trouble sleeping, your bedding might be to blame. Uncomfortable sheets of pillows can cause restless nights.


If possible, opt for all cotton bedding. These promote airflow and breathability, making them less likely to cause irritation.Avoid irritants. Check the labels of your sheets, comforter, pillows, and pillow cases. There might be a substance you're allergic or sensitive to in the fabric, which could result in difficulty sleeping.Pillows lose firmness over time. If your pillow is becoming increasingly saggy, replace it., Having an established workout routine can help regulate your sleep cycle. Just 10 minutes of aerobic exercise a day can improve the quality of your sleep. It also reduces the risk of sleep disorders like sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.


Exercise helps with sleep and it improves the overall health of your body and also helps manage stress. Incorporating aerobic activities, such as jogging or biking, a few times a week can help you fall asleep faster.Timing is important when it comes to exercises effect on sleep. Exercising too late in the day can result in an increase in energy, leading to difficulty falling or staying asleep. Aim to exercise in the morning or late afternoon., Nicotine and caffeine are both stimulants that say in your system for a long time. Smoking or drinking coffee too late in the day can result in trouble sleeping. Try to avoid coffee past early afternoon and if you smoke make an effort to quit. Tobacco can have other negative health effects in addition to trouble sleeping. While alcohol can cause you to feel sleepy, the sleep you have when intoxicated is of less high a quality. Aim to avoid drinking more than one or two drinks a night if you want better quality sleep. Alcohol also interrupts REM sleep., If you have a lot of stress in your life, this can keep you up at night. Make efforts to reduce your overall stress level if you want better quality sleep.


Start with basics. Make an effort to be more organized. Small changes, stuff like just keeping your environment neater, can have a dramatic impact on stress.Take breaks. Do not push yourself to work too hard throughout the day. When you need a minute, take 10 or 15 to unwind.Look into stress reducing activities. Things like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises can have a dramatic effect on your stress levels., If you often have trouble sleeping even after making certain changes, contact your doctor. Difficulty sleeping can point to a variety of underlying health concerns. A medical evaluation is necessary to rule out any serious health problems. Your doctor may be able to prescribe you medication to treat sleep disorders."

If you're experiencing a painful headache, try lying down in a quiet, dark room to relax and take the strain off of your eyes.If you're able to take a nap while you lie down you may want to do so. Napping can help relieve headaches, but napping for longer than 30 minutes may affect your ability to sleep at night.;
, Cold therapy is a long-standing treatment option for headaches and migraines.The exact mechanism through which cold therapy works is not well known, though some studies suggest it may involve cooling and slowing down the flow of blood to the brain.Place a cool compress on the back of your neck and/or on the part of your head where the headache is most painful.
Remove the cool compress after about 20 to 30 minutes. Wait at least 10 to 20 minutes before reapplying.

, Some people find that heat therapy is more effective than cold therapy for treating headaches and migraines. This may have to do with the muscle relaxation that is typically associated with heat therapy.Just make sure that you don't use a compress that's too hot or leave it on for too long, as this may lead to burns. It's also best to avoid lying down with a heat pack to avoid falling asleep and getting burned.


A heat compress on your neck may help reduce the symptoms of severe headaches.
You can also try taking a hot bath or shower to relax your muscles.

, Stress is often a trigger for headaches in many people. Practicing relaxation techniques can lower your stress levels and may help naturally reduce the symptoms of headaches.Take long, slow breaths deep into your diaphragm (below the rib cage).

Get a massage. A professional masseuse can help relieve tension in your muscles, leaving you feeling more relaxed and improving your circulation.

Try practicing yoga. Yoga can help relieve stress, improve circulation, and make you feel more relaxed.

, Some pregnant women may be reluctant to take medicine, as there are many medications that can affect the baby if taken during pregnancy. However, many doctors generally agree that certain over-the-counter pain relievers are safe for expectant mothers to take. Talk to your doctor about which medications can and cannot be taken safely during pregnancy.Tylenol and other acetaminophen-based medications are generally considered safe during pregnancy.However, make sure you avoid any medications containing codeine, as this may be unsafe for the baby.Do not take ibuprofen or aspirin during pregnancy.

, You should not consume more than 200 milligrams of caffeine per day when you are pregnant. This is roughly equivalent to one eight ounce cup of coffee. Many pregnant women choose to give up caffeine completely during pregnancy. If you decide to do this, you should give it up gradually. Going from a high-dose coffee habit to giving up caffeine cold turkey can cause withdrawal symptoms like sleepiness, depression, and an increase in headaches.Switch to a smaller mug if you use a larger mug to cut back more gradually.
Aim to decrease your coffee consumption by 0.5 to 1 cup of coffee less each day.
Mix your regular coffee grounds with decaffeinated coffee grounds so that your brewed coffee is at half strength.
Try switching to tea instead of coffee, as this may make it easier to decrease your caffeine consumption more gradually.

, Some people find that certain foods/drinks are more likely to cause a headache than other foods. While this won't necessarily apply to everyone, if you know you have certain foods that can trigger a headache, it's best to avoid them as much as possible.Some common headache-inducing foods include:


Chocolate.
Caffeine.Aged cheese.
Alcohol.
Peanuts.
Bread products made with fresh yeast.
Citrus.
Preserved meats (bologna, smoked fish/meats, hot dogs, sausages, etc.).
Yogurt.
Sour cream.

, Dehydration is a common cause of headaches.The best way to avoid dehydration is to drink plenty of fluids and eat foods with a high water content (like fresh fruits and vegetables) throughout the day. It's generally recommended that adults drink eight glasses of water each day, though a better measure of hydration is to look at the color of your urine. Clear urine is a sign that you're staying hydrated, while darker urine indicates that you need to drink more water.Try to drink water gradually throughout the day so that you never feel too thirsty.

, Managing stress can help prevent headaches, especially if you live a high-stress lifestyle or are prone to anxiety. Try avoiding stressful situations as much as possible and delegate stressful tasks to others as much as you can.Try to get more exercise, as this is a great way to relieve stress. Exercise can even block pain signals in your brain, making existing pain more manageable.Try relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation and meditation can help relieve tension and may reduce the frequency and intensity of headaches.

, Tiredness and lack of sleep are common causes of headaches, especially during pregnancy.Most adults need 7 to 10 hours of sleep each night in order to feel their best.If you're pregnant and you've been experiencing headaches, you may want to try increasing the amount of sleep you get each night.


Try to get to bed around the same time each night, even on weekends or days off.Do something relaxing before you go to bed.
Try making your bedroom slightly darker and cooler for a better night's sleep.
Turn off all electronic products at least 30 minutes before bed.

However, some people with high blood pressure also experience the following symptoms:


Dizziness.
Blurred vision.
Changes in your field of vision.

, Pre-eclampsia is a condition that may affect some women during pregnancy, usually starting during the second half of the pregnancy. Specifically, pre-eclampsia tends to set in after 24 to 26 weeks, with cases rarely occurring before the 20 week mark.Many cases of pre-eclampsia are mild, but without proper monitoring and treatment it may cause some serious complications during the pregnancy.See your doctor right away if you experience any of the following:.


High blood pressure.
Severe headaches.
Protein present in urine samples.
Fluid retention and swelling of the feet, ankles, hands, or face.
Difficulty seeing.
Pain below the ribs.
Nausea and vomiting.

Understand that nightmares are common in children.,
Determine if your child's nightmares are becoming worse.,
Decide if the nightmares are getting worse.,
Watch for a disruption of daily activities.",How to Diagnose Nightmare Disorder2," Children often have nightmares. They start in toddlers, but most commonly begin between ages three and six. Children will have nightmares connected to their age. This may include separation nightmares, nightmares about real threats, such as death or getting lost, or nightmares about scary content they have seen or read.Up to 50% of children have nightmares that disrupt their parents' sleep.

, Your child may have a nightmare disorder if the nightmares go from being a sporadic event to a common occurrence. If your child starts to have more nightmares than usual, this could indicate a nightmare disorder.Figure out if the dreams are repetitious and upsetting, or involve any kinds of psychological issues. This may point to a nightmare disorder.

, Your child will likely tell you what the nightmares are about. Pay attention to what your child dreams and decide if they are getting worse.For example, the content of the nightmare may escalate into more frightening or disturbing images as the child continues having the nightmares.

, Nightmares should remain dreams and not carry over into daily activities. However, your child may have a nightmare disorder if he or she develops a fear connected with the nightmares. The nightmare may lead your child to believe something bad will happen, which may impact you and your child's daily lives.For example, if your child dreams about getting lost, then he or she may be afraid to go away from you, go outside, or go anywhere unfamiliar.

Go see your doctor or therapist.,
Visit a sleep physician.,

Determine the severity of the nightmare disorder.,
Distinguish nightmare disorder from other sleep disorders.",How to Diagnose Nightmare Disorder3," If you think you may have a nightmare disorder, you should make an appointment with your doctor. Your primary care physician may refer you to a psychologist or mental health professional because anxiety often accompanies nightmare disorder., Another way to diagnose nightmare disorder is to see a sleep physician. Unlike a general physician or mental health specialist, a doctor who specializes in sleep disorders will be trained to specifically diagnose and recognize different sleep problems, including nightmare disorder.A sleep physician will do a thorough exam to make sure you don’t have any other sleep disorder that may be causing nightmares or that may be confused with nightmare disorder.
Make sure to see a board-certified sleep physician.

, When you visit your doctor, you will need to talk about your nightmares. You should be a specific as possible. This includes any details about the nightmares, such as scenes you remember, topics of the nightmares, dialogue from them, or any images.You should also tell your doctor how often the nightmares happen, along with when you first started having the nightmares.

, During the diagnostic process, your doctor will ask you for a complete medical history. This medical history will help your doctor rule out any other conditions or decide if the nightmares are a symptom or result of other underlying issues. You should make sure to tell your doctor about any other sleep disorders you have and any family history of sleep disorders.You should tell your doctor which medications you take. You should also share any experience with recreational drug use.

, Your doctor or sleep specialist may ask you to keep a sleep diary to help diagnose nightmare disorder. Usually, you will be asked to keep a diary for two weeks. This helps your doctor analyze your sleep patterns and diagnose any disorder.A sleep diary can help your doctor look at stressors or things that may be causing anxiety. It can also give your doctor important information that can help diagnose your condition.

, Nightmare disorders have varying severities. You may have a mild or severe disorder. A mild nightmare disorder occurs when you only have one nightmare a week. A moderate nightmare disorder occurs when you have nightmares multiple times a week. A severe case occurs when you have nightmares every night.The duration of the nightmares and disorder will also be diagnosed. An acute disorder is when you’ve had nightmares for a month or less. Subacute means you’ve had nightmares between one to six months. Persistent disorder means you’ve been having nightmares for over six months.

, Your doctor will make sure that you have nightmare disorder and not another sleep disorder. Nightmare disorder interferes with your daily life by disrupting your sleep and causing anxiety.Nightmare disorder should not be confused with sleep terrors, where a person moves around, screams, talks, or gets violent due to the nightmare.
Your doctor will also make sure you don’t have REM sleep behavior disorder, where you physically act out your dreams.

Don’t do work or other stimulating activities in bed.,
Go to sleep when you’re tired.,
Try cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT.,
Change the angle of the bed or your sleeping position.,
Consider using a CPAP machine.",How to Cure Sleeping Problems Naturally and Cheaply1," By setting a regular sleep pattern, we condition our body to be ready for sleep at the time we go to bed. If possible, it is best to work with your circadian rhythms (your natural sleep cycle), rather than against them, as they work from external cues such as light and activity.

Everyone’s circadian rhythm varies to some extent, but seek medical advice if your rhythm is severely impacting your day. Unless you're working a job with variable shifts or working more than one job, this should not affect your budget at all.;
, These can be a handy tool for relaxing your body for sleep, especially if you use them as part of a daily sleep routine.They can ease anxieties and tone down the volume of your thoughts as you try to go to sleep. While the best results might be achieved with a therapist, you can still get a lot of benefit for free by simply doing any of the following exercises:


Breathing exercises can vary widely based on the source. One breathing exercise is alternate nostril breathing, where you inhale through your right nostril while closing the left with your finger. You then exhale through the left and hold the right nostril. You inhale again through the left nostril, and switch back. Repeat until you feel relaxed (at least 5-10 minutes).Progressive relaxation is where you close your eyes, and feel each set of muscles one by one from head to toe, consciously relaxing each set one by one.Toe tensing is where sense your toes for 10 slow counts, tense them for another slow ten count and then sense them again, before trying to go back to sleep.Guided imagery is where you listen to an audio recording of someone describing calmly some physical environment, and inviting you to experience that in your mind. After a while, you should be able to do the imagery exercises without external audio, if you wish. However, the calming voice itself might help with relaxation., Working in bed can make you associate work with your bed, and so your brain may become alert at the stimuli of your bed. Talking with friends on the phone, playing games online, or any other activity that tends to wake you up rather than relax you should be avoided., This may sound obvious, but many people either stay up too late or try to go to bed when they're not tired.If you are too awake to sleep, try getting up and doing a relaxing activity, such as reading or meditation.Going to sleep when you're tired will help you develop a regular sleep schedule.

, You may need to see a therapist to implement a fully effective plan. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a treatment plan used to treat a wide variety of mental illnesses, including anxiety and depression, both of which can contribute to insomnia. Sometimes CBT is used to treat insomnia directly, by focusing on changing negative thoughts about sleep itself., If your sleeping problem is sleep apnea, after consulting with a doctor, you can try changing the angle of your bed. This will change the position of your body. This may allow you to breathe more freely. Changing the angle of the bed or your sleeping position is a cost effective way to try to address sleeping problems., If you continue to experience issues with sleep apnea after changing sleeping positions and/or bed angles, you may need to use a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine. The CPAP works to keep your airways open.


You will need a prescription from your doctor for a CPAP machine, and they can cost any where from $100 to $800.However, most insurance companies cover the CPAP machine."

Look into hypnotherapy.",How to Cure Insomnia," To help cure your insomnia, make your bedroom or sleeping area as inviting and calm as possible.Your environment should also be relatively quiet, although many people can get accustomed to some background noise. Focus on the comfort of your sleeping area and save your bed for only sleep, sex and light reading (not eating, studying, watching TV, texting on your phone or paying bills) as it can lead to higher quality and duration of sleep.If you live in a noisy neighborhood, consider wearing earplugs or buying a white noise machine. White noise (like the sound of static) drowns out other more distracting noises.
Make your bed with comfortable sheets that don't make you too hot or cold at night. In general, try to keep your room cool — around 60 - 65°F (though this may be too cold or impractical for some).Wait until you're comfortably drowsy to go to bed and don't try too hard to fall asleep. If you can't sleep, get out of bed after 20 minutes and do something relaxing.;
, For your body to think that it's time to fall asleep, your sleeping environment has to be relatively dark, although many people can get accustomed to some amount of light.Darkness triggers the release of hormones, such as melatonin, in your brain that initiate the ""sleep cascade"" and promote deep sleep. As such, close all your blinds and turn off all sources of illumination that your can see from your bed. Don't browse the internet on your phone while in bed, as the bright screen can make you more alert and less drowsy.


Use thick black-out shades to prevent light from coming in through your windows, or wear a sleep mask over your eyes.
Avoid bright (and noisy) alarm clocks and remove them from view. Once you set your alarm, hide your clock so the light and time don't distract you. Watching the time can increase anxiety and make insomnia worse., It's important to develop relaxing rituals in the latter part of the evening to prepare your mind and body for sleep. Work, school, exercise, paying the bills and preparing meals can all be stressful, so having activities to help you unwind before bedtime can help promote better sleep and either combat insomnia or reduce the risk of it developing. Various relaxation techniques are proven to calm the brain and body, such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing techniques.


Progressive muscle relaxation or PMR teaches you how to relax your muscles through a 2- step process: first, you intentionally tense muscle groups in your body, such as your neck and shoulders; next, you release the tension, focusing intensely on one body part at a time. Try this each night before bedtime.
Deep breathing techniques prior to bed can help you relax and get to sleep. Place a hand on your lower abdomen and breathe in deeply so your hand rises (called stomach breathing). Hold your breath for a count of three and then exhale fully and watch your hand fall.Do these 3x per night.
A warm bath can also help cure insomnia. Make sure the water isn't too hot and add a couple scoops of Epsom salts — it's rich with magnesium, which can absorb through your skin and relax muscles.Light some candles. Soak in the tub for 20-30 minutes while reading something light and funny.
Avoid doing anything too stimulating or stressful on the computer (or phone) and don't watch scary or action movies that get your adrenaline going., Don't eat right before bed because it can lead to a burst of energy (a sugar rush, for example) and increase your risk of painful heartburn — but going to bed hungry can also keep you up. A grumbling stomach and hunger pains distracts from sleep and helps to promote insomnia, especially if your mind is fixated on food. As such, don't go much more than 3-4 hours without food before going to bed.


If you need a snack after dinner, stick to healthy and light stuff, such as fruit, veggies, low-fat dairy and whole grains.
Some foods, especially poultry, contain amino acids (tryptophan and glutamine) that promote sleepiness. Thus, consider having a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread for an evening snack.
Avoid eating snacks, particularly spicy stuff, within an hour of bedtime. This strategy will let your GI system properly digest the food and allow for any energy rush to subside.

, Concerns with finances, work, school, relationships and your general social life often lead to stress, which can trigger short-term or long-term insomnia.Trying to reduce or manage your daily stressors promotes better sleep and help to cure insomnia. Don't be afraid to make significant life changes to free yourself from stressful situations, because insomnia is only one symptom of chronic stress — anxiety attacks, depression, headaches, high blood pressure and heart disease are others.


Be reasonable about your obligations and responsibilities. Many people get stressed because they are over-committed or over-scheduled. Don't promise what you can't reasonably deliver.
Feel free to reduce contact with people who bring you lots of stress.Manage your time better. If running late causes you stress, leave for work a little early each day. Plan ahead and be realistic.
Use moderate exercise to handle stress instead of binge eating. People who are stress tend to binge eat on ""feel good"" food, but this can lead to weight gain and depression. Instead, be active and go exercise when stressed out (see below).
Talk to friends and family members about stressful issues. Simply venting about your stressful issues can help. If no one is around, write your feelings down in a journal.

, Regular physical activity during the daytime can help regulate your sleep cycle at night, which is a good strategy for combating insomnia. It can give you a boost of energy and invigorate you initially, but the strenuous effort and increased breathing of oxygen makes you tired and sleepy at night. If you don't have a regular exercise routine already, strive for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity (walking, hiking, biking, swimming) per day.Establishing an exercise routine takes effort. Try to be active at the same time each day, either early in the morning, during your lunch break, or right after work before you eat.
Exercise also promotes weight loss, which can reduce annoying aches and pain, make you more comfortable in bed at night, and reduce the risk of snoring and other breathing problems.
Don't engage in vigorous exercise too close to bedtime because your body produces adrenaline and it will prevent you from falling asleep quickly. Make sure your workouts occur 5-6 five hours prior to bedtime., While alcohol may help some people fall asleep faster, it can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce the quality of your sleep. You may even find yourself waking up in middle of the night and struggling to fall asleep again. Cut down on the amount of alcohol that you drink, and stop consuming any alcoholic drinks at least an hour before you go to bed., Nicotine is a stimulant, and it can keep you awake if used too close to your bedtime. Nicotine is most commonly found in cigarettes. Since smoking is bad for your health, you should try to quit smoking entirely.If you are still using nicotine products, stop smoking or chewing nicotine gum a few hours before bedtime.
Nicotine is found in cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. There are also nicotine patches and chewing gums meant to help you quit smoking. These can all make it more difficult for you to sleep.

, Caffeine is a stimulant that can disturb sleep in people. The effects can last as long as 8 hours.Thus, as a general rule, avoid caffeine anytime after lunch.Caffeine increases the activity of brain neurons, which may cause your mind ""to race"" with more thoughts and ideas.
Coffee, black tea, green tea, hot chocolate, dark chocolate, colas, some other sodas and virtually all energy drinks are significant sources of caffeine. Some cold medications also contain caffeine.
Keep in mind that sugar (especially the heavily processed types) is also a stimulant and should be avoided for at least an hour before heading to bed.

, If some short-term sleeplessness has transitioned into full-blown insomnia (despite your efforts with lifestyle changes), then make an appointment with your doctor. Your doctor will try to determine if you have an underlying medical condition that's causing or contributing to your insomnia. If so, then treatment should focus on the underlying heath condition first and the sleeping difficulty should then fade away secondarily.


Common causes of insomnia include: chronic pain, depression, restless leg syndrome, sleep apnea (severe snoring), bladder control problems, arthritis, cancer, hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), menopause, heart disease, lung disease, and chronic heartburn.Ask your doctor if any of your prescription drugs can potentially trigger insomnia — problematic drugs include those used for depression, hypertension, allergies, weight loss and ADHD (such as Ritalin).
Check the labels of any medications you take regularly. If they contain caffeine or stimulants like pseudoephedrine they may be causing your insomnia., If your doctor thinks it's necessary or helpful, they may prescribe medication to help you get to sleep. Some drugs are better for short-term insomnia (recently acquired), whereas others are more powerful and better for long-term (chronic) insomnia. Most doctors don't prescribe drugs for insomnia in conjunction with different drugs to treat other underlying medical issues.Mixing different drug classes increases the risk of side effects (see below).


First-choice sleeping pills for short-term insomnia include eszopiclone, ramelteon, zaleplon and zolpidem.Additional prescription medications used to treat insomnia include diazepam, lorazepam, and quazepam.
Note that some insomnia medications can be habit-forming and may come with unpleasant side effects, including low blood pressure, nausea, anxiety, daytime drowsiness, and sleepwalking.

, Get a referral to a psychologist or therapist who practices CBT, which can be helpful in relieving insomnia. CBT is used to negate factors that exacerbate insomnia, such as negative thoughts, poor sleep habits, irregular sleep schedules, poor sleep hygiene and misunderstandings about sleep.CBT represents a good option if you want an effective medical treatment, but are not interested in sleeping pills.


CBT can involve sleep education, info on sleep hygiene, relaxation training, cognitive control, psychotherapy and/or biofeedback.
CBT promotes behavioral changes by getting you to keep regular bedtimes and wake-up times, as well as eliminating afternoon naps.
Your CBT therapist will work with you to help control or eliminate negative thoughts, worries and any false beliefs that are causing sleeplessness.
If you can't get a referral from your doctor, you should be able to find a list of CBT providers through your insurance.

, If you have chronic (long-term) insomnia that's not going away after implementing the above-mentioned advice, then get a referral from your doctor to a sleep clinic. Sleep clinics are run by doctors, nurses, psychologists and other health professionals with specialized training in sleeping disorders and remedies. You'll sleep overnight in the clinic while hooked up to various devices (such as a polysomnogram) that monitor your brain waves and level of consciousness.People with chronic insomnia usually don't experience much or any time in the REM (rapid eye movement) phase of sleep compared to people who sleep normally.
REM sleep should occur about 90 minutes after falling asleep — intense dreams happen in this stage.
People with insomnia also have difficulty initiating non-REM sleep to start with, but once there, often don't transition to deep non-REM and finally REM sleep.

, There are many plant-based remedies or natural supplements that act as mild sedatives and help to cure insomnia if there isn't an underlying medical condition. Natural herbal medicine is generally very safe in terms of toxicity if you follow instructions on the label. They also don't lead to the potentially serious side effects that many sleeping pills do. The most commonly used natural sleep aids are valerian root, chamomile, and melatonin.


Valerian root has a mild sedating effective on people, which leads to sleepiness.You can take it as a capsule or drink it as a herbal tea for 1-2 weeks at a time. In very high doses, valerian root can have a negative effect on the liver.
Chamomile flower is also a mild sedative that can calm the nerves, promote relaxation and trigger sleepiness. Chamomile tea is very popular and should be drank about an hour before bedtime.
Melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland in your brain. It's essential for circadian rhythm and triggering deep sleep at night when it's dark. Taking it as a supplement can potentially help with insomnia, although research is currently inconclusive., Aromatherapy is using the scents of essential oils and other plant oils to create a calming effect. Aromatherapy cannot cure insomnia or any of its root causes, but it can create relaxation and induce a better frame of mind to fall asleep and stay asleep. Common essential oils used for aromatherapy and recommended for relaxation include lavender, rose, orange, bergamot, lemon, sandalwood and others.It is thought lavender may stimulate the activity of brain cells in the amygdala, similar to the way some sedative medications work.


Breathe in essential oils directly from a piece of tissue / cloth or indirectly through steam inhalations, vaporizers or sprays.You can also mix essential oils into your bath water.
Start an aromatherapy session about 30 minutes prior to bedtime. If you buy a special vaporizer, let it run throughout the night.
Some candles are infused with essential oils, but never let candles burn unattended or while you're asleep.
Aromatherapists, nurses, chiropractors, massage therapists and acupuncturists are often the health professionals who practice aromatherapy.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within your skin / muscle in efforts to stimulate the flow of energy in your body and reduce a variety if symptoms.Acupuncture for insomnia is not well researched, but some people claim it can be very relaxing and calming, as well as eliminate pain. Based on the ancient principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture may work by releasing a variety of pain-relieving and ""feel good"" substances, including endorphins and serotonin.


Acupuncture can increase night-time melatonin production, which can help treat patients with anxiety-induced insomnia.
It's likely best to look into acupuncture treatment for insomnia if other methods (mentioned above) don't work.Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physiotherapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

, As a last resort for trying to cure your insomnia, consider hypnotherapy. Hypnotherapy involves changing your level of consciousness so that you're relaxed and very suggestible. Once in this altered state, the hypnotherapist can give you suggestions or commands that can help you relax, reduce anxious thoughts, change perceptions and prepare your body for sleep.This can potentially help all sorts of insomniacs, but it's important to understand it doesn't cure any underlying diseases or conditions that contribute to insomnia.


Get a referral to someone reputable who practices hypnotherapy and be sure to ask for their credentials and licensing information.
A growing number of physicians, psychologists, psychologists and counselors practice hypnotherapy.
Always take a friend or family member with you (at least initially) because people are very vulnerable once hypnotized.

There is a long list of conditions that can cause symptoms that mimic insomnia, from anxiety and depression, to hyperthyroidism, Lyme disease, and heart conditions.Your insomnia could be caused by obstructive sleep apnea, a common condition in people who snore. This condition occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat are relaxing so much that your airway narrows for 10-20 seconds, preventing you briefly from getting air. Your brain will wake you so you can get more air, over and over again throughout the night causing disrupted sleep.Go over your medications with your doctor, as some may interfere with your sleep. This includes mentioning anything herbal, alternative, or over the counter that you might be taking.Be sure to tell your doctor if you have any pain that is preventing you from sleeping.
Your doctor may recommend cognitive behavioural therapy, completing sleep journals, or relaxation training to sort out your sleep.;
, Though you may be tempted to take a quick nap during the day, and many people can do so effectively, napping may be counterproductive for the insomnia sufferer.If you must nap, maximize it at 30 minutes and don’t nap after 3 pm.
Stick to as regular a sleep schedule as possible, waking and going to bed at the same time each day, even on weekends.

, Sleep experts agree that your bed should be used only for sleep and sexual intimacy so keep the computers and TV out of your bedroom.Have black-out curtains to keep your room dark at night.
Keep your bedroom cool. Being too warm prevents you from falling soundly asleep. Studies have shown that wearing a cooling cap at night reduces time to fall asleep and increases length of sleep.Use a white noise machine or fan to drown out inconsistent environmental noises and create a comforting atmosphere.

, Both supplements are touted as facilitating sleep. Just be sure to not take them too early before bed (within 30 minutes is best) or for too many weeks without consulting your doctor.You should also consult your doctor if you are currently taking any medications. Herbal supplements are all natural, but sometimes they do interact with medications.
Melatonin occurs naturally in the body to regulate your sleep wake cycle and we generally lose melatonin as we age, hence the creation of a supplement. Its safety in long term usage is not known. Take 3-5 milligrams 30 minutes before bed.Melatonin can interact with anticoagulants, immunosuppressants, diabetes medications, and birth control pills.Valerian root is an herbal supplement with a mildly sedating effect. This root can be somewhat addictive. Try 200 milligrams 30 minutes before bed.Valerian root may increase other sleep aids' effects as well as the sedative effects of alcohol, benzodiazepines and narcotics and can interfere with other prescription medications., It is important to deal with your stress and get back to a regular sleep schedule. There are several things that you can do to counter nighttime stress, such as journaling about your stresses, developing a bedtime ritual, and practicing progressive muscle relaxation.

, Acupuncture helps decrease stress by regulating hormones, and decreased stress leads to a better sleep. Acupuncture may also assist the release of melatonin.Ear acupuncture in particular seems to be helpful for facilitating sleep.

, We tend to feel more tired when we are dehydrated because our blood thickens, forcing your heart to pump harder to circulate the blood throughout your body, and this extra work by the heart tires us out.Doctors recommend having 2 liters of water a day, or about 8 glasses. Soft drinks and coffee don’t count. You can also get water naturally through fruits and vegetables such as watermelon, celery, and broccoli.
You’ll know you’re getting dehydrated if your urine turns from a pale, clear fluid (as it is when you’re well hydrated) to a darker yellow.
Don't wait until you feel thirsty to drink. By the time your brain starts sending you signals, you’re already lacking fluids, hence the message of being thirsty. Drink regularly throughout the day to stay hydrated.

, Getting little bursts of carbohydrates and protein throughout the day will help you stay awake and alert. Plus, if you eat every 3-4 hours, you won’t have blood sugar crashes, which make you feel tired.Eating breakfast really is the most important way to start the day, so don’t skip it. If you find you’re often on the run to work or school and don’t have time for breakfast, get into the habit of preparing grab-and-go options.
Include fibre so you have the slower release of carbs that keeps you from crashing. Include popcorn, tortillas, or whole grain pitas in your meal and snack time, for example.
Small meal examples that work include low-fat yogurt with berries and granola, a whole grain chicken wrap with greens, or apple slices with some peanut butter.

, It is generally recommended that you avoid caffeine after noon. When you live with chronic insomnia, this might be really hard to do so try to minimize it to 200-300 milligrams, or no more than 2 cups of coffee.Decaffeinated coffees are not 100% caffeine free, so don’t be fooled.
Energy drinks may not be a good choice. They have up to 250 milligrams of caffeine per serving and can increase your tolerance to caffeine, meaning you need more and more caffeine to feel the effects. They also have a lot of sugar and don’t actually provide any more energy than a regular soda., Although alcohol is often associated with partying and fun, it is actually a depressant that will drag you down and make you even more sleepy, make you restless at night, and increase your night-time waking., Getting at least a 30 minute workout a day, five hours before bed, will increase your chances of sleeping better at night.Expending energy breeds energy. Exercise boosts your energy-producing mitochondria in your cells, fuels your circulation of vital oxygen, and releases neurotransmitters and the feel-good endorphins responsible for the “runners’ high.”Short bursts of activity throughout the day can help you manage the fatigue that might set in while you are at work or school. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk to school instead of taking the bus. Get up and walk around the office for a minute every 30 minutes.

, Dance around to music while you unload the dishwasher or put on music in your office, if allowed.

, Having a quick shower in the middle of the day or even just going to the bathroom to splash some water on your face can do wonders to wake yourself up., Even for a brief spell, taking a quick break to get some sun and fresh air can invigorate you enough to get through the rest of the day.

, If you find that your insomnia is affecting your work habits, try cutting out distractions at work so that you can really focus when you have the energy to do so. That includes self-distracting behaviours such as checking Facebook.Work with a clear goal in mind. Whether you’re trying to write an essay for school or prepare a presentation at work, having a focus and smart goals will then help you feel energized when achieve your goal. Have a task list and avoid straying from it.
Do the more mentally taxing work when you’re sharp and keep the menial tasks for when you’re more tired. You can still be productive filing or writing emails when you’re worn down.
Work standing up, if possible. It helps keep you awake and burns calories.

Use less or no caffeine.,
Decrease nicotine use.,
Decrease alcohol use.,
Don’t eat too much too late at night.,
Decrease screen time before bed.",How to Cure Sleeping Problems Naturally and Cheaply2," Caffeine is a stimulant, and people have differing sensitivities to it, based on a number of factors, including gender, amount of use, and whether or not you have an anxiety disorder.However, it is best for most people to avoid caffeine close to bed (at least four to six hours).

Caffeine use has been linked to increased anxiety, which can also disrupt your sleep. Cutting out caffeine should, if anything, save you money, assuming you replace it with water., Like caffeine, nicotine is a stimulant and so should be avoided before bed.Don't smoke 30 to 45 minutes before bed, and smoke less in the four hours before bed to help with going to sleep.However, to really improve your sleep quality, it is best to quit nicotine use altogether. While quitting nicotine use altogether will ultimately help your sleep, the side effects of nicotine withdrawal include insomnia and irritability, and so it may take some time to get the full effects of quitting nicotine.Decreasing or quitting smoking will certainly save you money as with perpetual nicotine the wallet certainly takes a hit.

, Although alcohol is a depressant, and may help you fall asleep easier, often you will not sleep as well, especially after large amounts of alcohol. It lowers the quality of your sleep, and if you use alcohol to go to sleep regularly, you may find it difficult to go to sleep without it.While there are some cheap alcoholic beverages, generally it costs less to drink something else, and so drinking less should save you money.

, While you can certainly eat something light before bed without impacting your sleep too much, it is best to eat heavier meals earlier in the day. Eating too much late at night can make it uncomfortable to lie down, and may cause additional sleep issues for those with heartburn.This is yet another cost effective way to try to decrease sleeping problems.

, Blue light can trigger the brain to become more awake. As screens typically have a lot of blue light, even if the room is dark, it will wake us up. It’s best to turn screens off and unplug an hour to an hour and a half before bed. This takes no money, only willpower.If you must use your screen shortly before bed, there are apps that decrease the amount of blue light that a screen emits. These apps should help you get sleepy even as you are using your phone or computer before bed. However, if you’re doing particularly stimulating activities on your computer or phone, such as playing an exciting action game, you may still find it hard to fall asleep. An app may cost anywhere from nothing to three or four dollars."

Change your diet.,
Increase your time in the sun.,
Stay hydrated.,
Exercise, but do it early in the day.,
Try homeopathic supplements.,
Speak with an alternate medical professional.",How to Cure Sleeping Problems Naturally and Cheaply3," Eating foods with more anti-oxidants, and avoiding junk food can contribute to better sleep. Try adding fresh fruits, lean meats, and beans to your diet. Add foods incrementally so that you can tell which foods are most and least helpful for your body. You should consult a doctor before significantly changing your diet.


This can be a tricky change to fit into a budget, as often the best foods cost more or take more time to prepare. However, try adding one or two good foods for sleep or decreasing any food you know impacts your sleep, and you can attempt this step without spending too much extra.Tart cherry juice can help with sleep, if you drink one glass a day, as it may increase melatonin., Spending around 10-15 minutes in the sun will help trigger the hormones that help keep you awake. Again, unless you do shift work, you should be able to do this without affecting your budget.Getting enough sunlight is especially important in the morning, as early morning sunlight will help to regulate your circadian rhythms.Conversely, exposure to evening sunlight can delay sleep, so be careful when taking late evening walks if you want to go to bed early., Drinking enough water is essential for the basic functioning of your body, and yes, even sleep. Getting enough water during the day will help you rest more soundly. It will also keep you from waking up thirsty. Unless you insist on bottled or sparkling water, this step shouldn't add much to your budget.While drinking water is important for sleep, be careful not to drink a lot just before bed, as it can cause you to interrupt your sleep with repeated trips to the restroom., Exercise can your body with normal functioning, and can give you more energy. It has been linked to better sleep, but if you exercise just before you go to bed you may have more trouble sleeping. Try exercising no later than 3 hours before bed.This is another cost-effective way to help your sleep. Even walking for 15 minutes a day can improve your overall health., While not a lot of scientific testing has definitively proven the medical benefits of many supplements, many people find that they add to their relief. Costs for supplements can vary widely from melatonin and valerian at the lower end at 4 to 8 cents a dose to L-tryptophan at the other end at a whopping 45 cents a dose.The following supplements might be helpful:Valerian root may help with sleep problems, but it can also interact with sedatives and some antidepressants.
Melatonin has also been thought to help with sleep, but should also be taken with care, as it can interact with some prescriptions.
Omega-3 fatty acids are thought to help with sleep as well, but can affect blood-thinning medications. Although it is commonly found in foods, the high amounts in supplements require extra care.
With 5-hydroxytryptophan it is especially important to check with a doctor before beginning it, as it can have serious contraindications with MAOI inhibitors and SSRIs.
Chamomile is a supplement that acts a sedative, and so can help with sleep. It is important to take care when taking in higher doses, as it can cause vomiting, and allergic reactions for those who are allergic to ragweed, daisies, or similar allergens., They may be able to best help with choosing the supplements that are right for you. They can take into consideration your age, health conditions, diet and other medications and provide a safe and healthy plan for you to follow as you address your sleeping problems. Make sure you consider the following when making a decision about alternative care:Your primary doctor may be able to provide a reference for an alternative provider.
Many states have certification programs for alternative health professionals, the requirements for which can vary.
Your insurance may not cover all alternative health providers.

Work to address or lower stress in your life.,
Address anxiety or depression.,
Talk to your doctor about chronic medical conditions.,
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about your current medications.,
Talk to your doctor about the effects of aging.,
Get medical advice for any sleep problems that are causing a significant impact on your daily functioning.,
Find a support group.",How to Cure Sleeping Problems Naturally and Cheaply4," Stress can significantly impact your sleep, as well as your health overall.While lowering the amount of stress in your life is not always possible, try to reframe the stress to make it more manageable. Breathing exercises, connecting with other people, and time management can all help reduce stress. This can be a fairly cost effective method, assuming you don't have to give up a source of income in order to lower your stress.Working to reframe your stressful thoughts can also help lower the stress in your life. For instance, instead of saying to yourself “I only got 6 hours of work done today,” say “I am proud that I got six hours of work done, and I accomplished a lot in that time.”Lowering the stress in your life can help you sleep better.

, While there are strategies for dealing with stress on your own, if anxiety or depression is impacting your life in detrimental ways, including interrupting your sleep, you may need to see a mental health professional. They can teach you techniques that you will be able to use long term and help you decide if you need medication.While this is often not the cheapest method of dealing with sleep problems, it can be cost effective if it helps you address the root of the problem rather than just dealing with the symptoms.

, Frequent urination, trouble breathing, and chronic pain can all negatively impact your sleep.Your doctor may be able to recommend some home treatment as well as focus on treating the underlying issues that are causing you to have sleep issues. If you have a chronic condition that is affecting your sleep, the costs can vary widely, depending on the condition, the severity, and the treatment plan.

, Medications can often have side effects that affect your sleep. If it is a medicine you take long term, be sure to see a doctor to see what you might do, such as adjusting the dosage, changing the time you take it, or trying some other home remedies to alleviate the side effects. Again, assuming that you don't have to change from a less expensive medicine to a more expensive medicine, this may be a cost effective strategy for dealing with sleep problems., Aging will affect the sleep cycle, and it might be necessary to make adjustments to your lifestyle to help with sleeplessness or other sleep issues. Talking to a doctor will help you make the right decisions for your body, your lifestyle, and your overall health., Some severe cases of sleep apnea, for example, may require surgery. Don’t underestimate the impact of your sleeping problems. If you are unsure whether you need a doctor, you may call a nurse’s line to assess the situation from home. Many insurance providers now provide this service for free., There are support groups available for many common sleep problems, including sleep apnea and insomnia.A support group can help re-assure you that you are not a lone, and help you find resources you may not have known about. Sharing common experiences can also lead to less anxiety, and may help with sleep as well. This can be an inexpensive way to deal with sleep issues, as support groups are often free to attend."

Get all the pets out of the room.",How to Sleep When You Are Not Tired," The temperature in the room should be slightly cooler than what's comfortable for you. A slight drop in temperature induces sleep. This will help a lot. But don't let yourself get too cold, especially your feet; cold feet can be disruptive to sleep, so put on some socks. You may wake up and have to take off those socks in the middle of the night, but that's better than letting those cold feet keep you awake.


It can take several hours for your body temperature to cool down after exercise or exposure to excessive heat, so make sure your body is at normal temperature when you get ready for sleep.;
, If you prefer a completely dark room, cover all lights such as digital alarm clocks, or any other electronic device in your bedroom that has a light on it. If you prefer to sleep with dim lighting, wear an eye mask or lower your lights until you are comfortable enough to sleep. Do not sleep with your lights on, as this disrupts sleep and makes it hard to become tired and relaxed.







, Consider putting on some white noise (sound machine, fan blowing etc.), which has been shown to make people fall asleep more quickly. Also, people find the ticking of a watch or clock soothing. If you prefer everything quiet, turn off anything that causes noise.









You can also consider wearing earplugs before you go to bed. It can take some time to get used to them, but they can help block out sounds you didn't even know were keeping you from sleeping. They can also be particularly useful if you share a bed with a partner who can wake you up.

, Keep your back straight, and make sure that your neck isn't resting too high or too low. Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as forcing your head to one side is hard on the spine and neck. If you sleep on your side, put a narrow pillow or rolled-up towel between your knees to keep your hips in a neutral position. Even turning from your right side to your left can help you fall asleep if you're feeling wide awake in the same old position.








, Swap your over or under-stuffed pillows for the ones you keep in the guest room. If your mattress is lumpy, flip it over or cover it with a foam pad or other blankets. The more conducive to sleep your bed is, the more likely you will be to feel ready for bed. We've all laid in a nice, cozy hammock in the sunlight and fallen asleep when we weren't even feeling particularly tired, haven't we? Well, a cozy bed can have the same effect.








, Go for a run, hit up the gym, take a long walk, or do some stretches to help you get your heart rate going before you ease into bed. This will work out your body and will make you more tired; doing this at least three hours before bed will keep your adrenaline from pumping right before bedtime and keeping you awake. If you work out shortly before bed, then you will feel more awake than ever.







, Though a glass of wine may initially make you feel drowsy, if you consume alcohol right before bed, it will disrupt your sleep cycle and make you fall into a less deep sleep. If you do like to have a nightcap, just have it 2-3 hours before bed so it doesn't keep you up. As for caffeine, you should avoid caffeine after 2-3 pm, or ideally even afternoon, because it can take up to eight hours for the caffeine to fully leave your system, which can definitely make you feel not so tired even when you want to fall asleep.







, Or snack on a variety of other foods that are rich in melatonin, which is known to help you feel sleepier and to help you drift off faster. Though you should avoid eating right before bed or you may be up with indigestion or general discomfort, eating some of these foods a few hours before bed can help you drift off:








Barley
Tomatoes
Rice
Sweet corn
Oats
Oranges
Bananas

, When you get in bed, curl your toes upward for a few seconds, relax them, and then repeat the gesture. This can help you relax your mind and your body, so performing a series of ten of these if you are feeling way too alert for your own good can help you fall asleep when you're not tired.







, Herbal tea, whether it's chamomile or peppermint, has been shown to calm your body and mind and to help you feel tired and relaxed. Have a cup an hour or two before bed - you don't want to drink too much liquid right before bed or you'll be more likely to have to get up to urinate. If you make drinking herbal tea part of your pre-bed routine, this will help you fall asleep even faster.








, Get a healthy dose of carbs, proteins, and fruits or veggies with your daily dinner. Avoid spicy or overly heavy meals that are rich in fat or sugars, or your body will be more alert and uncomfortable throughout the night. Just a healthy, balanced dinner will do the trick in making you feel more tired. Make sure to eat it at least three hours before bedtime so your body has time to digest the food. Here are some great dinner options that can help you feel tired while still feeling healthy:








Lighter pasta with cheese
Tofu with couscous
A glass of warm milk with oatmeal
A kale salad, salmon, and rice noodles

, This varies from person to person, but whatever that activity is, it should lull your brain, not engage it. Slow, calming music lends itself well to this. Reading something that is completely uninteresting to you is good as well. Some types of puzzles or games may work as well, such as Sudoku or Solitaire. Listen to a very dry podcast. Play tic-tac-toe with yourself. Organize that stack of paper on your desk. Do whatever you think is the most boring thing possible.








, Try abdominal breathing, yogic pranayam, or a one-minute breathing exercise. Close your eyes and focus on the breath falling in and out of your body. As you do this, picture each part of your body relaxing, one at a time. Focusing on your body will keep you from thinking about anything else from the outside world.








, For example, think of small, warm waves washing over your body at regular intervals to coincide with your breathing. Meditate to calm yourself and clear your head. Don't pick anything too exciting or thrilling, or you will start to work yourself up. Picture a calming beach, a gorgeous, lush forest, or a beautiful rose garden. Imagine yourself walking through it all.









Think of one of the most beautiful and calming places you have ever been to (a clear stream of running water in a field of wildflowers in the mountains, a peaceful lake, a beautiful beach with a slight breeze in the air). This should help you relax.

, Reading can help calm your mind and take your thoughts off of anything that might have been troubling you that day. Read something light and not too gripping, such as the local news, a paperback, or a piece of historical non-fiction. If you read a gripping thriller or an emotionally disturbing news story, that will keep you up even longer and will make you feel even more awake if you just can't stop reading.









Challenge yourself and read the most boring thing you can find, from your old chemistry textbooks to a dry report about the state of another country's economy.

, Put away the iPad, phone, computer with Netflix all queued up, and turn off that television. Your eyes should begin to start to rest and to stop seeing all of the images that will make you feel more awake, jumpy, and less able to focus. Stop being the person who drifts off while watching television or with a cell phone in her hand and get rid of all of those high-sensory distractions, which are guaranteed to make your mind feel more alert when it's time for bed.







, This rule is simple: if you've been lying in bed for more than fifteen minutes and are unable to fall asleep because you're not tired, then try something else. If you continue to lie there, your mind will continue churning, and you may even work yourself up and feel even more awake than you did when you first closed your eyes. Once fifteen minutes have passed and you're no closer to catching those z's, do something else that is not very taxing. Read a magazine. Pace around your room. Drink some herbal tea. Hum to yourself. Sit up and stare at your hands. Do something new and you will start to drift off.









Whatever you do, though, make sure to keep the lights dim - even reasonably dim if you're reading.

, Five minutes before bedtime is not the time to get into a big fight with your significant other or to call up your best friend and complain about all of the stress you're facing at work in great detail. If you live with someone and have to talk right before bed, make sure you don't bring up anything more intense than the type of herbal tea you're going to buy at the store tomorrow. Otherwise, the conversation will make you feel even more alert and awake, and it will take you even longer to fall asleep.









If you live with someone who loves intense conversations right before bed, reschedule them for two to three hours before bed instead, if you can.

, Another way to calm your mind is to go through everything you did that day, up to the most boring little detail. Start with how many blackberries you placed in your morning oatmeal and end with which quadrant of your teeth you decided to brush last. Try to break it down hour by hour and see how specific you can get and how many things you can end up remembering. Unless you're a superhero or an ER doctor for a living, chances are that this alone will be boring enough to put you to sleep.









If you've gone through your whole day and still feel wide awake, try going through your entire week. Surely that should be boring enough to make you drift off.

, If you want to feel tired when you want to go to bed, then you have to find a routine that helps you decompress and fall right into bed that starts at least half an hour before it's time to get some shut-eye. This can include some light reading, listening to classical music, reading the newspaper, or doing whatever light, low-intensity activities that may help you forget your problems and start to recognize that your body needs rest.








Once you find this routine, stick to it, and if you know you have to get to bed a little earlier one night though you're not tired, start the routine earlier and you can trick your mind into feeling tired a bit faster.

, You may not be feeling tired because you're trying to go to bed three hours earlier than you normally do - probably because you have to wake up earlier. If you want to make it easier for yourself to fall asleep, then you have to get used to falling asleep at around the same time every night and waking up around the same time every morning. That way, your body will get used to feeling more tired at the same time every night or more alert at the same time every morning.








, Even if you're not tired, then you can't watch TV in bed, do your homework in bed, talk to friends on the phone in bed, or do anything in your bed. It'll be easier for you to drift off when you close your eyes, because it'll tell your body that your bed is solely for sleeping









Find a space in your home or room that is designated for ""work only."" This will help you save the relaxing stuff for your bed.

, Once you roll out of bed, head for the window or the balcony as soon as you can. The bright light from the sun will tell your body's biological clock that it's wakey-wakey time, and this same clock will help you get to bed in about 14-16 hours, helping you stabilize your waking up and going to bed routine.







, If one of the reasons you don't feel tired when you go to bed is because you stay up for two hours worrying about your relationship, your health, your status at work, etc, then you need to work on setting aside a ""worry time"" earlier in the day so that there's nothing on your mind by the time you're ready to hit the hay. It may sound silly, but if you say, ""I'm going to worry from 5-5:30 PM every day"" and do nothing but worry, write down your worries, or say them aloud during that time, then you'll get them off your chest.









If you wait until bedtime to slow down and really think about your troubles, then yeah, you're bound to feel wide awake for a long time.

, Either of these will raise your body's core temperature some. After your shower or bath, move to your cooler bedroom. This will cause your temperature to drop, which is the cue that tells your body it is time to sleep.







, Another way to develop a healthy routine that keeps you from staying awake for longer than necessary is to stop letting your dog or cat share the bed with you. Though you may love nothing more than the feeling of this furry, cuddly creature sleeping beside you, studies show that people who sleep with their pets have a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep because those cuddly creatures can wake you up in the middle of the night.








You may think that having your dear pet next to you will help you fall asleep when you're not feeling tired, but it will actually make you even more awake.

Look into cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).,
Try hypnosis.,
Ask your doctor about biofeedback.",How to Cure Bruxism2," A major cause of bruxism is stress and anxiety. CBT is a psychological treatment that will help you manage stress issues by changing the way you think and how you act.A trained therapist will encourage you to talk about how you think about yourself, the world, and other people. The therapist will also get you to talk about how your actions affect your thoughts and feelings.

, Some sufferers of bruxism have found relief through hypnosis. In fact, one study reviewed the long term effects of hypnosis and positive results were still continuing 36 months after treatment.There are hypnosis recordings you can buy online to help cure bruxism., Biofeedback is a type of medicine that uses monitoring procedures and equipment to teach you how to control muscle activity in your jaw.

Massage your jaw muscles.,
Adjust your tongue to relax your jaw.,
Do the “fake drunk” exercise at least once a day.,
Do the “long surprise” exercise at least once a day.",How to Cure Bruxism3," Focus on releasing tension in your masseter muscle, which is your primary chewing muscle. It covers the sides of your jaws, just behind your cheeks.To massage your jaw muscles, place your hands on the notches just below your cheekbones. Your fingers should be about one inch in front of your ears.
Press this notch firmly and rub it. This is a sturdy spot on your face, so don’t be afraid to apply firm pressure inward and upward.

, Do this by positioning the tip of your tongue between your teeth. This will prevent your jaw from clenching or grinding., This is where you slur your speech as though you are sleepy or drunk.Begin by saying the sentence: “I am so relaxed I can hardly talk”. Then, say it again but this time slur each word. Try this again by mouthing the words: “I can talk”, slurring each word as you mouth the sentence.

, This is exercise will relax your jaw by spending long periods of time with your jaw wide open.Hold your mouth wide enough to fit two fingers between your teeth.
Try to hold your mouth wide in this position for about an hour.
If you catch yourself with your teeth together or your mouth closed, slowly stretch your mouth open again.

Talk to your dentist about getting fit for a mouth guard.,
Ask your dentist about a mouth splint.,
Keep in mind a mouth guard and a mouth split will not cure your bruxism.",How to Cure Bruxism4," Mouth guards will help to even out the pressure across your jaw and create a physical barrier between your upper and lower teeth. They will also protect your teeth from further damage due to grinding or clenching.Mouth guards are usually made out of bendy rubber or plastic. Your dentist can make a mouthguard that fits your mouth. But the downside is it will be expensive.Alternatively, you can go to your local drug store and pick up a cheaper mouthguard. Keep in mind a generic mouth guard it likely won’t fit your mouth as well as a custom guard.
Your bedmate will also thank you if you get a mouth guard, as it will reduce grinding noises you make at night while sleeping., Also known as an occlusal splint or a bite plate, a mouth splint is made of harder plastic than a mouth guard. Your dentist can make a splint so it fits exactly over your upper or lower teeth.Mouth splints are no more effective than mouth guards. But they tend to last longer, several years at least, than mouth guards.
A mouth splint will help to reduce grinding noises and will protect your teeth from premature wear due to grinding. But they are more expensive than mouth guards., These mouth pieces will reduce muscle activity in your jaw at night, but they will only control the condition, not cure it.Curing bruxism will likely require a combination of methods, such as stress therapy, medication, and the use of a mouth guard or a mouth splint.

Ask your doctor about muscle relaxants.,
Talk to your doctor about anti-anxiety medication.,
Ask your doctor about non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).",How to Cure Bruxism5," Your doctor may give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help your jaw muscles loosen up before bed.This is not an effective long term cure for bruxism and will likely only help you sleep better, not stop grinding your teeth.

, Some anti-anxiety medications like buspirone and clonazepam can work to stop bruxism. However, some anti-anxiety medications can stop working after a few months of use.Some people can develop bruxism as a side effect of anti-anxiety medication. If this happens, talk to your doctor about changing your medication. Never go off your medication without talking to your doctor.

, These drugs can help to reduce any pain or inflammation around your jaw due to grinding. But they will not cure bruxism or prevent bruxism."

Schedule monthly check ups with your dentist.,
Avoid chewing pens, pencils, and gum.,
Avoid consuming food or drink that contains caffeine.",How to Cure Bruxism6," This way, your dentist can catch any serious dental issues before they get worse, including bruxism.Teeth grinding can lead to a cracked tooth. If left untreated, the nerve in your tooth could die and a dental abscess could develop. This could then lead to root canal treatment, a serious and expensive procedure that could have been prevented if the cracked tooth was treated earlier.
Dental problems like a cracked tooth or missing teeth, can usually be treated with reconstructive dental surgery. In fact, these treatments can sometimes reshape the chewing surface of your teeth and stop teeth grinding.

, Chewing on non-food items like pens or pencils can lead to tension in your jaw and cause you to grind your teeth.Chewing gum will allow your jaw muscles to get used to clenching, and could lead to teeth grinding, or worsen your bruxism.

, This includes sodas, chocolate, coffee, and energy drinks. Not only will they interrupt your sleep pattern, they can make your stress levels worse. This will then lead to teeth grinding, or worsen your bruxism."

Stick to a regular sleep schedule.,
Turn off all electronics and distractions a few hours before bed.,
Set an alarm to remind you it’s time for bed.,
Do a relaxing activity before bed.,
Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.,
Try to wake up with the sun.,
Avoid napping after 3 pm.,
Keep a sleep journal.,
Take sleeping pills only when necessary.,
Be wary of over-the-counter medications that can lead to insomnia and sleep issues.",How to Avoid Sleeping and Yawning During the Day1," Create a sleep schedule where you wake up and go to sleep at the same time everyday, even on weekends or days off. Sleep requirements vary from person to person, but on average, you should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep to function at your best during your waking hours.Some people think getting just one less hour of sleep won’t affect their daily functioning or that they can make up for lack of sleep on the weekend or a day off. But any changes or shifts to your regular sleep schedule will only have a negative effect on your sleeping habits and lead to lots of yawning when you are awake.It’s a myth that your body adjusts quickly to different sleep schedule. While most people can reset their biological clock, this can only be done by timed cues, and even then, only by one to two hours per day at best. It can take more than a week for your body’s internal clock to adjust to traveling across several time zones or to switching to the night shift.
Extra sleep at night cannot cure you of your daytime fatigue. The quantity of sleep you get every night is important, but the quality of your sleep is more important. You may get eight or nine hours of sleep a night but won’t feel well rested if the quality of your sleep was poor.;
, Shut off your television, smartphone, iPad, and computer or keep all electronics out of your bedroom completely. The type of light these screens emit can stimulate your brain, suppress the production of melatonin (which helps you sleep), and interfere with your body’s internal clock.Another option is to shut down your computer on a schedule. This will automatically sleep your machine and prevent you from working on your computer too late or too close to your bedtime. There are sleep features on both PCs and Macs that you can activate. As well, if you want your computer to be ready to go in the morning, once you wake up, you can schedule a startup time too., If you tend to get wrapped up in evening activities or conversations and forget to stick to your sleep schedule, you can set an alarm on your phone or computer to alert you 1 hour or 30 minutes before bedtime.If you prefer to shut down all electronics a few hours before bed, you can use an alarm on your watch or ask someone you live with to remind you of bedtime 1 hour before it’s time.

, This could be a warm bath, reading a good book, or having a quiet conversation with your partner. Doing a restful activity will help to trigger your brain to start relaxing and shutting down.If you find yourself tossing and turning in bed in the dark, don’t lie there and stare up at the ceiling. Instead, do a relaxing activity in bed to calm down and get your mind off your inability to sleep. Doing a restful activity may in fact end up causing you to fall asleep., Use heavy curtains or shades to block the light from windows. Cover any electronic displays, like televisions or computers so the light does not glow in the room. You can also use a sleep mask to cover your eyes and create a dark space that will help you sleep.If you have difficulty sleeping due to loud noises outside your window or a loud sleep partner, consider investing in good earplugs, or a noise machine.

, You can also set a timer so bright lights come on in your room in the morning at the same time every day. Sunlight helps your body’s internal clock to reset itself each day.Sleep experts recommend exposure to an hour of morning sunlight for people who have trouble falling asleep., The best time for a nap is usually mid afternoon, before 3 pm. This is the time of day you will likely experience post-lunch sleepiness or a lower level of alertness. Naps taken before 3 pm should not interfere with your nighttime sleep.Keep your naps short, between 10 to 30 minutes. This will prevent sleep inertia, which is when you feel groggy and disoriented after a nap that goes on for longer than 30 minutes., A sleep journal or diary can be a useful tool to help you identify any habits that may be keeping you awake. You may be able to also pinpoint if you are displaying symptoms of a sleep disorder. Update your sleep journal with notes on:What time you went to bed and woke up.
The total sleep hours and quality of your sleep.
The amount of time you spent awake and what you did. For example: “stayed in bed with eyes closed” “counted sheep” “read a book”.
The types of food and liquids you consumed before bed and the amount of food and liquids you consumed.
Your feelings and moods before bed, such as “happy” “stressed” “anxious”.
Any drugs or medication you took, such as sleeping pills, including the dose and time of consumption.
Notice any triggers that start to repeat themselves in your sleep journal and see if there are ways you can prevent or limit these triggers. For example, maybe you often get a bad night’s sleep on a Friday after drinking two martinis. Try not to drink at all the following Friday and see if this improves your sleep.

, When you take sleeping pills for a brief period of time, and based on your doctor’s recommendations, they can help you fall asleep. But they are just a temporary solution. In fact, sleeping pills can often make insomnia and other sleep issues worse in the long term.Use sleeping pills and medications sparingly for short term situations, like traveling across several time zones or when recovering from a medical procedure.
Using sleeping pills only when necessary, rather than on a daily basis, will also prevent you from being dependent on them to help you sleep every night.

, Many of the side effects of these drugs can have adverse effects on your sleep patterns and daytime alertness. Common medications that can disturb your sleep include:Nasal decongestants.
Aspirin and other headache medications.
Pain relievers that contain caffeine.
Cold and allergy medications containing an antihistamine.
If you are taking any of these medications, try to reduce your dosage. Or research alternative methods to treat these issues so you can stop taking these over-the-counter medications.

Avoid hitting the snooze button on your alarm.,
Put your alarm clock on the other side of the room.,
Invest in a graduating-light alarm clock.,
Make your morning routine positive and consistent.,
Try waking up without your alarm.",How to Stop Oversleeping1," Though you may be tempted to sleep for just five more minutes in the morning for some extra sleep, hitting the “snooze” button on your alarm will in fact make you more tired. When you hit snooze, your brain goes even deeper into your sleep cycle. By the time you hit “snooze” several more times, and finally wake up, you will feel groggy and even more tired than if you got up with your alarm.If possible, get an alarm without a snooze button. Or disable the snooze option on your existing alarm.;
, Rather than having your alarm close to your bed, where you can easily hit the snooze button or shut off your alarm, put your alarm clock somewhere that forces you to get out of bed. That way, you will be forced to get out of bed in the morning to shut your alarm clock off.For example, you could place your alarm clock on a dresser that is on the opposite side of your room. Or, if you think you will still be able to hear it, you might even place your alarm in an adjacent room, such as a bathroom.

, These alarm clocks grow progressively brighter as it gets closer to your wake up time. This light will help you wake up slowly and hopefully, easily, without shocking your body with a sudden alarm. Graduating-light alarm clocks are also good for the winter, when the mornings are dark and it can be hard to get out of bed.You can find graduating-light alarm clocks at your local drugstore, or online.

, Stretch and get up, open the curtains of your room and let the morning light in. Treat the morning like a positive experience and commit to looking forward to your day.You may also start a routine of getting dressed and eating breakfast within a certain time. As you get ready, plan out your schedule and your tasks or commitments for the day.

, If you stick to a consistent sleep schedule and maintaining a regular sleeping pattern, you likely will be able to get up on your own, without an alarm and without oversleeping.Going to bed at the same time every night and waking up at the same time every morning will program your body to get used to a regular sleep schedule. Over time, your body will act as its own alarm clock, and you should be able to wake up on your own at the same time, every day.

See your doctor.,
Undergo a sleep study.,
Determine what type of sleep apnea you have.,
Ask about your treatment options.",How to Cure Sleep Apnea1," Sleep apnea can have many different symptoms, so it is difficult to diagnose based on the symptoms alone. If you suspect that you have sleep apnea, then see your doctor as soon as possible. Some serious symptoms to watch for include:Snoring or breathing interruptions while asleep, observed by your partner
Waking up gasping for air or choking
Shortness of breath upon waking
Having pauses in your breathing (noticed by your partner)
Feeling drowsy during the day, or like your sleep has not been restful or restorative
Any of the following health issues: hypertension, mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus;
, To diagnose sleep apnea, your doctor will consider your symptoms along with the results of a sleep study. You can undergo a sleep study in a clinical setting or at home. In both situations, your vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) will be monitored.



Clinical setting. If you decide to have a sleep study done in a clinical setting, then you will have to stay overnight at a sleep clinic. You will be monitored by medical technicians while you sleep.

Home-based portable monitor. If you decide to have a sleep study done at home, then you will need to use a portable monitor to monitor your vital signs., There are a three different types of sleep apnea: obstructive, central, and complex. Your doctor should be able to tell you which type you have by considering factors such as your medical history, medications, and sleep study results.



Obstructive sleep apnea. This is the most common type of sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea is when the tissues in your throat relax while you are asleep and block your airway.

Central sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is less common. This type of sleep apnea is when your brain fails to send a signal to your body to breathe.Complex sleep apnea. This form of sleep apnea is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apnea., After you have undergone testing and received a diagnosis from your doctor, you will be able to talk about treatment options. Your doctor will likely recommend some lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, as well as some special exercises and devices, including a CPAP, that may help. These are described later in the article.


In some cases, your sleep apnea may be caused by something that can be corrected with surgery, such as very large tonsils or facial malformations. Surgery to remove these obstructions may provide a long-term cure for severe obstructive sleep apnea."

Learn to meditate first.,
Wake yourself up by shouting out loud ""WAKE UP!"",
When you find some determination to actually stay in a dream rather than escaping it, you can move on to the dream spinning technique (spinning on the spot like a child).,
The last step and the most important part in fighting nightmares is facing your fear.",How to Control Dreams to Stop Nightmares," This might sound awkward and looking like a detour but the idea is to increase your awareness during the day so that you're much more likely to recognize a nightmare when it’s coming.;
, and blink hard, while imagining yourself lying in bed. Although you're not going to solve your nightmares for goods, this can quickly end a terrifying dream.

, Although sounds silly, this is a very reliable technique to change surroundings. In fact, if you focus on changing the setting into something else while spinning, most likely you’ll find out that the setting has changed into your desired surroundings after you stopped spinning. Another good way to change the setting (and ""escape"" from the nightmare) is using dream doors or portals - you just open a dream door and step through it, imagining first where would you like to be teleported.

, It is the only real element of your bad dream; all the rest (like danger, monsters etc.) are not. You can do it by challenging the threat (“come and get me”). Bad guys often transform into harmless creatures when courageously confronted in lucid dreams. Come to your demon and ask what he wants. In case of recurring nightmares, you will very likely put an end to your suffering.

Use earplugs.,
Find a source of white noise.,
Listen to music on your headphones.",How to Sleep when Someone Is Snoring1," You can buy earplugs at a pharmacy or department store. Using earplugs at night may block out some of the unwanted sounds.Earplugs come made from different materials, such as foam, rubber, and plastic. Make sure to follow the instructions on your package to figure out how to place your earplugs in effectively.
If you are prone to ear infections, ask your doctor before using ear plugs.
To reduce the risk of infection, always wash your hands before handling the earplugs and clean reusable earplugs regularly. Do not push them too far into your ears either. Also, make sure that you can hear smoke detector and carbon monoxide alarms while you are wearing the earplugs.;
, White noise is the kind of noise made by television static or a fan. See if you can find a source of white noise to help you nod off. You can turn on a fan, an air conditioner, or another electronic device that makes white noise. You can also invest in a white noise machine, which you can purchase online.If you can't find a source of white noise, you can find videos or audio clips online that play white noise.

, If you have headphones and a device like an iPod or iPhone, you can try listening to music. This will block out the sound of snoring and help you effectively nod off at night.Opt for slow, soothing music. Louder, faster music may make it more difficult to sleep.
If you have an account on a website like Spotify, see if you can find any playlists specifically designed to help with sleep.

Avoid eating foods that contain tryptophan during the day.,
Don’t consume caffeine four to six hours before your bedtime.,
Have a light snack a few hours before your normal bedtime.,
Avoid drinking liquids 90 minutes before your bedtime.,
Commit to exercising at least 20 to 30 minutes a day.",How to Avoid Sleeping and Yawning During the Day2," Tryptophan is a natural amino acid that your brain converts to serotonin. Serotonin is a chemical that promotes sleep. So avoiding foods that contain tryptophan can help you stay awake during the day. Foods that contain tryptophan include:


Dairy products
Bananas
Turkey
Yogurt
Whole-grain crackers
Peanut butter

, About half the caffeine you consume at 7 pm is still in your body at 11 pm. A known stimulant, caffeine can be found in coffee, chocolate, soft drinks, non-herbal teas, diet drugs, and some pain relievers. Limit how many cups of coffee you have several hours before bed, or try to eliminate caffeine in your diet all together.Alcohol also prevents deep sleep and REM sleep. It will keep you in the lighter stages of sleep, causing you to possibly wake up easily and have a harder time falling back asleep. Avoid consuming alcohol 1-2 hours before bed to ensure you get a good night’s sleep., A large meal before bed can cause indigestion, which will interfere with your sleep schedule. Stick to a light snack, like a piece of fruit, to keep your stomach from grumbling at night., Drinking too many fluids before bed can cause you to wake up to urinate. It takes about 90 minutes for your body to process the fluids you drink, so skip the big glass of water right before bed to prevent your bladder from waking you up., Daily exercise is proven to help people sleep. But a workout too close to bedtime might interfere with your sleep schedule. Try to get daily exercise about 5 to 6 hours before bedtime."

Think about any environmental problems that could be keeping you awake.,
Adjust your sleep schedule if you are doing shift work.,
Follow the rise and fall of the sun if you’re dealing with jet lag.",How to Avoid Sleeping and Yawning During the Day3," Changes in your living situation or even your sleep environment could lead to sleep problems. Did you just move into a new home? Are you sleeping in a new room, or with a new partner? Are you sleeping on a new mattress or pillow? These types of shifts, even if they are small, can affect your level of anxiety or stress. This will then impact your ability to get a good night’s sleep.If you think environmental problem are keeping you awake, think about adjusting your mattress with a mattress pad to make it more comfortable. Or keep an item from your old room in your new room. Create a sense of calm and security in your sleep environment to help you go to sleep.

, Working a different work shift or a rotating shift can wreak havoc on your sleep schedule, especially if you rotate shifts on a regular basis.Counteract shift work by adding 30 minute naps to your sleep schedule and lengthening the amount of time you allot for sleep. You should also use caffeine only during the first part of your shift to promote alertness at night and restfulness during the day. Try to minimize the number of shift changes you do to give your body’s internal clock more time to adjust to a new work schedule.
You may want to also talk to your doctor about a prescription for short-acting sleeping pills to help you sleep during the day.

, Adjusting to a new time zone can take several days or even a week. Eastward travel generally causes more severe jet lag than westward travel, as traveling east requires you to shorten the day and your internal clock can better adjust to a longer day than a shorter day.Decrease your exposure to light at bedtime and increase your exposure to light at wake time once you arrive. Spend a lot of time outdoors so your body gets used to the light cues in the new time zone.
Adjust your internal clock by getting a good amount of sleep 2-3 days prior to the trip. If you are traveling west, make minor changes to your sleep schedule by delaying your normal bedtime and wake time progressively by 20-30 minute intervals. If you are traveling east, advance your normal wake time by 10 to 15 minutes a day 2-3 days prior to the trip and try to advance your normal bedtime by 10 to 15 minutes.
Talk to your doctor about melatonin supplements to counteract jet lag. Melatonin is considered safe to use over a period of days or weeks, but its effectiveness on jet lag is controversial. Some studies find melatonin supplements before bed several days prior to arriving in a new time zone can help you fall asleep at the proper time. But other studies find that melatonin does not help relieve jet lag."

Check your current medications with your doctor.,
Get tested for sleep disorders.,
Ask your doctor about a sleep center.",How to Avoid Sleeping and Yawning During the Day4," Many medications have side effects that can keep you awake at night or lead to problems sleeping.Talk to your doctor if you take medication for asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Many drugs used to treat these issues contain steroids and a compound called “theophylline”, which is a stimulant that can keep you up at night.
If you are taking heart medication or medication for arthritis, you may experience insomnia and nightmares because of these drugs.You may also have a hard time sleeping if you are taking antidepressants. If you suffer from anxiety or depression, you may also experience insomnia or sleep problems.

, Speak to your doctor about specific symptoms or patterns in your sleep issues. If you feel irritable or sleepy during the day, have difficulty staying awake while sitting still, fall asleep while driving, and require caffeine every day to stay awake, you may have a sleep disorder. There are four main types of sleep disorders:Insomnia: The most common sleep complaint. Insomnia is often a symptom of another issue, such as stress, anxiety, depression, or another health condition. It can also be caused by lifestyle choices, like medication you take, a lack of exercise, jet lag, or your caffeine intake.
Sleep apnea: Occurs when your breathing temporarily stops during sleep due to a blockage in your upper airways. These pauses in breathing interrupt your sleep, leading to many awakenings throughout the night. Sleep apnea is a serious, and potentially life threatening sleep disorder. If you suffer from this disorder, it’s important to talk to a doctor and get a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine. This device delivers a stream of air to your airways while you sleep and can successfully treat the disorder.
Restless leg syndrome: (RLS) is a sleep disorder caused by an irresistible urge to move your arms and legs. This urge usually occurs when you’re lying down and is due to uncomfortable, tingly sensations in your arms and legs.
Narcolepsy: This sleep disorder involves excessive, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. It is caused by a dysfunction of the mechanism in your brain that controls sleeping and waking. If you have narcolepsy, you may have “sleep attacks” where you fall asleep in the middle of talking, working, or even driving.

, If your doctor refers you to a sleep center, a specialist will observe your sleep patterns, brain waves, heart rate, and rapid eye movement with monitoring devices attached to your body. The sleep specialist will analyze the results from your sleep study and design a custom treatment program.A sleep center can also provide you with equipment to monitor your activities while awake and asleep, at home.

Keep a regular sleep schedule.,
Turn off all electronics and distractions a few hours before bed.,
Set an alarm to remind you it’s time for bed.,
Do a relaxing activity before bed.,
Keep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.,
Wake up with the sun.",How to Stop Oversleeping2," Create a sleep schedule where you wake up and go to sleep at the same time everyday, even on weekends or days off. Sleep requirements vary from person to person, but on average, you should be getting between seven to nine hours of sleep to function at your best during your waking hours. However, some people need as much as ten.Teenagers generally need more sleep than older adults. Young bodies need a lot of rest while growing during adolescence.
Some people require more sleep than others. A very few people thrive on as little as six hours a night, while others require ten to be truly rested. Respect these differences; a person needed more sleep is not lazy or bad.
Some people think getting just one less hour of sleep will not greatly affect their daily functioning. Another belief is that sleep can be made up on the weekend or a day off. And once in a while is probably fine. But if this happens a lot, your regular sleep schedule will suffer, leading to oversleeping or being overly tired when you wake up.It is a myth that the human body adjusts quickly to different sleep schedule. While most people can reset their biological clock, this can only be done by timed cues, and even then, only by one to two hours per day at best. It can take more than a week for your body’s internal clock to adjust to traveling across several time zones or to switching to the night shift. Even then, some people adjust easier than others.
Extra sleep at night cannot cure you of your daytime fatigue. The quantity of sleep you get every night is important, but the quality of your sleep is more important. You may get eight or nine hours of sleep a night but will not feel well rested if the quality of your sleep was poor.

, This could be a warm bath, reading a good book, or having a quiet conversation with your partner. Relaxing hobbies or activities are also an excellent choice. Doing a restful activity will help to trigger your brain to start relaxing and shutting down.Playing on the computer or your device is not a good activity - your body is quiet, but your mind may be overstimulated and the light of the screen triggers the mind to be awake.
Likewise with television: this device triggers ""awake"" signals in the brain.
If you find yourself tossing and turning in bed in the dark, avoid staying there awake for prolonged periods. Instead, get up and do something calming in order to get your mind off your inability to sleep. Getting anxious about not being able to sleep, and dwelling on it will actually make it less likely you will be able to get to sleep.Again, do not turn on the television, gaming system, computer, or other electronic device.
Try things like reading, washing the dishes, knitting, running a load of laundry, doing origami, or the like.

, Put up heavy curtains or shades to block the light from windows. Cover any electronic displays, like TVs or computers so the light does not glow in the room. You can also use a sleep mask to cover your eyes to help you sleep.A cool temperature in your room when you sleep will actually help you get a better night's sleep. A drop in your core temperature, due to a cold sleeping environment, can trigger your body’s “let’s hit the hay” tendencies and help you get right to sleep.If you have difficulty sleeping due to loud noises outside your window or a loud sleep partner, consider investing in good earplugs, or a noise machine.

, Many of the side effects of these drugs can have adverse effects on your sleep patterns and daytime alertness. Common medications that can disturb your sleep include:Nasal decongestants.
Aspirin and other headache medications.
Pain relievers that contain caffeine.
Cold and allergy medications containing an antihistamine.
If you are taking any of these medications, try to reduce your dosage or stop taking altogether. These medications are not meant to be taken on an ongoing basis. Talk to your doctor about alternative methods to treat these issues so you can stop taking these over-the-counter medications.

Speak to your doctor about problems with oversleeping.,
Get tested for sleep disorders.,
Talk to your doctor about attending a sleep center.",How to Stop Oversleeping4," Your doctor needs to know if you are having chronic issues with sleep. It is a serious issue. If you constantly oversleep throughout the week, you may suffer from headaches or back pain. Oversleeping affects the neurotransmitters in your brain and lead to headaches. Back pain can be caused from sleeping on a regular mattress for a prolonged period of time.There are also psychological side effects of oversleeping, including depression, anxiety, and drowsiness. Your doctor can treat these side effects by suggesting adjustments to your sleeping habits, your daily habits, or by prescribing certain medications.

, There are many medical conditions and disorders that can interfere with sleep. Let your doctor know about specific symptoms or patterns in your sleep issues. If you can’t get up in the morning due to oversleeping, have difficulty staying awake while sitting still, fall asleep while driving, and require caffeine every day to stay awake, you may have a sleep disorder. There are four main types of sleep disorders:Insomnia: The most common sleep complaint and a major cause of oversleeping. Insomnia is often a symptom of another issue, such as stress, anxiety, depression, or another health condition. It can also be caused by lifestyle choices, like medication you take, a lack of exercise, jet lag, or your caffeine intake.
Sleep apnea: This occurs when your breathing temporarily stops during sleep due to a blockage in your upper airways. These pauses in breathing interrupt your sleep, leading to many awakenings throughout the night. Sleep apnea is a serious, and potentially life threatening sleep disorder. If you suffer from this disorder, it’s important to talk to a doctor and get a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine. This device delivers a stream of air to your airways while you sleep and can successfully treat the disorder.
Restless leg syndrome: (RLS) is a sleep disorder caused by an irresistible urge to move your arms and legs. This urge usually occurs when you’re lying down and is due to uncomfortable, tingly sensations in your arms and legs.
Narcolepsy: This sleep disorder often involves excessive, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. It is caused by a dysfunction of the mechanism in your brain that controls sleeping and waking. If you have narcolepsy, you may have “sleep attacks” where you fall asleep in the middle of talking, working, or even driving.

, If your doctor refers you to a sleep center, a specialist will observe your sleep patterns, brain waves, heart rate, and rapid eye movement with monitoring devices attached to your body. The sleep specialist will analyze the results from your sleep study and design a custom treatment program.A sleep center can also provide you with equipment to monitor your activities while awake and asleep, at home.

Start a sleep diary.,
Lose weight.,
Exercise every day.,
Quit smoking.,
Drink alcohol-free beverages.,
Sleep on your side.,
Avoid certain medications.,
Maintain a regular sleep schedule.,
Stop eating about two hours before you go to bed.",How to Cure Sleep Apnea2," Keeping a sleep diary can help you to determine if your sleep apnea is getting better or worse. To start a sleep diary, record as many details as possible about the quantity and quality of your sleep to help you monitor your condition. Some things to record in a sleep diary include:How long you sleep each night
How many times you wake up during the night and at what time
How you feel in the morning
Anything your partner noticed during the night — this is vital, as many people don't wake up enough to realize they have had an apneic (a temporary suspension of breathing) episode, but your partner may notice

, Being overweight is one of the main risk factors for sleep apnea. If you are overweight, then do what you can to get to a healthy weight (defined as a BMI between 18.5 – 25). Losing weight involves reducing the number of calories you take in while increasing the number of calories you burn. To achieve this ratio, you will need to eat less and move more. Some other things that may help you to lose weight include:Drinking more water
Keeping a food diary

Developing an exercise routine

, Exercise will help you to lose weight and it can also improve your lung function and strengthen your breathing muscles. It has also been shown to improve concentration, critical thinking, mood, and a number of other positive benefits. Try to incorporate moderate-intensity exercise five times a week for 30 minutes.Start with some light cardiovascular exercise such as walking, biking, or swimming. Even if you can only do 10 minutes at first, keep at it and increase the length and intensity of your workouts over time.
Include some yoga in your daily routine to tone muscles and improve your breath control as well.

, Smoking is bad for your lungs and it can contribute to all kinds of health problems such as cancer, emphysema, and high blood pressure. Smoking also triples your risk of developing sleep apnea, but you can eliminate this risk factor by not smoking.There are medications and smoking cessation programs that can help you quit. Talk to your doctor for help.

, Alcohol depresses your nervous system, which can interfere with normal breathing. To avoid this potential cause of sleep apnea, do not drink any alcoholic beverages. Instead, choose alcohol-free beverages, such as sparkling water, juice, and tea.If you are used to having an alcoholic beverage before bed to help you sleep, then try switching to herbal tea, such as chamomile. Chamomile can help to relieve anxiety and improve sleep.

, Sleeping on your side rather than on your back or stomach may help stop snoring and breathing problems associated with sleep apnea. Sleeping on your side or on your back does not cure sleep apnea, but it prevents it from happening as long as your stay on your side while you sleep.To make sure that you stay on your side while you sleep, you can use a wedge or place some pillows behind your back to keep you from rolling over during the night.
You can also sew a tennis ball into the back of your pajamas to prevent you from rolling onto your back. This, however, may lead to backaches., Some medications can make OSA worse. Specifically, benzodiazepines, opiates and other sedatives, and some antidepressants. If you have a new diagnosis of OSA and are already taking one of these medications, talk to your doctor about the risk/benefit of continuing.

, Having a regular sleep schedule may also reduce your risk of sleep apnea. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.For example, you might go to bed every night at 11:30pm and wake up every morning at 7:00am. Use an alarm and don't hit snooze!

, Heavy or spicy meals before bedtime may increase your risk of sleep disruption. To eliminate this risk, stop eating two to three hours before you go to bed.If you are hungry, try a light snack like a piece of fruit or a cup of herbal tea.

"
"
Use a CPAP machine.,
Wear a mouthpiece.,
Elevate the head of your bed or use a foam wedge.",How to Cure Sleep Apnea3," Constant positive air pressure (CPAP) machines are meant to keep you breathing normally throughout the night. CPAP machines send a puff of positive pressure into your airway at the end of each breath in order to keep the airway open throughout the breathing cycle. as a result, apneas due to the airway collapsing as occurs in OSA are prevented.Talk to your doctor if you are having problems using your CPAP machine. Do not stop using your CPAP machine without your doctor’s permission.
Using your CPAP machine may improve daytime sleepiness, blood pressure, glucose levels, and quality of life.If you do not use the CPAP machine regularly or use it for a while and then stop, you will lose any positive gains you made (such as improving your blood pressure).

, A dentist or orthodontist can make you a custom-made mouthpiece to keep your jaw aligned and your airways open as you sleep. While studies are very clear that CPAP is more effective than oral appliances,there is still strong evidence that oral appliances provide a significant treatment effect compared to nothing at all. Many patients find CPAP intolerable to use regularly but are able to wear oral appliances, and for these patients an oral appliance would be appropriate.


Keep in mind that mouthpieces require regular adjustments by your dentist or orthodontist or they may stop working. Keep track of adjustments and change every three months or so.

, If you do not like sleeping on your side, then try sleeping on your back in a slightly upright position. You can use a foam wedge to prop yourself up while you sleep, raise your mattress if you have an adjustable bed, or use bricks to elevate the head of your bed.Only a slight elevation of 2 – 3 inches is needed.
To use bricks to elevate the head of your bed, place them under the feet at the head of your bed. You can also use sturdy pieces of wood.

Eliminate sedative medicines.,
Try taking an allergy medicine before bedtime.,
Ask your doctor about modafinil.,
Talk to your doctor about other conditions.,
Add vitamin C. In a small study, vitamin C injections were shown to be an effective way to reduce the cell damage associated with sleep apnea.There is not enough evidence for use of vitamin C to be a conclusive treatment for sleep apnea, but you may wish to talk to your doctor about adding a vitamin C supplement to your diet.",How to Cure Sleep Apnea4," Sedatives depress your nervous system, which may stop your brain from telling your body to breathe. If you often use sleeping pills or other sedatives to help you sleep, stop using these medicines. Talk to your doctor about alternatives that will not put you at risk of sleep apnea, such as melatonin or valerian., If your airways are blocked due to allergies, then taking an antihistamine pill or using a nasal spray prior to bedtime may help to open up your nasal passages and make breathing easier. Make sure that you ask your doctor first before starting this treatment., Modafinil is an FDA-approved drug that may help to combat the daytime fatigue associated with sleep apnea. You need a prescription for modafinil and it should not be used as a replacement for other therapies. Modafinil should be used as part of a treatment regimen that includes using a CPAP device and other sleep apnea treatments.It should be used only after the patient has been consistently using CPAP correctly and its still having problems


Modafinil may cause weight gain.

, While OSA is a common cause of daytime sleepiness, there are other medical conditions that can cause daytime fatigue and sleepiness that often mimic the symptoms of OSA. This includes hypothyroidism, sleep disorders, depression, and a number of other things. It is important that your doctor rule out these causes through history taking and other tests.,


Consider taking 500mg of vitamin C daily as part of your treatment regimen.

Sing a song once per day.,
Hold a pencil between your teeth.,
Purse your lips.,
Blow up balloons.,
Run, jog, or swim to lessen sleep apnea.,
Gargle some water.",How to Cure Sleep Apnea5," Singing can help to improve muscle control in your throat and in the soft tissues in your throat. Toning these muscles can reduce your chance of sleep apnea. Try singing along to a favorite song once per day or more often to give these muscles a workout.

, Jaw muscles can also contribute to sleep apnea, so it is important to strengthen these as well. To strengthen your jaw muscles, hold a pencil between your teeth for about five to 10 minutes per day., The muscles in and around your mouth also play an important role in breathing, so strengthening these muscles may also help cure your sleep apnea.Try pursing your lips as if you are going to give someone a kiss. Then, hold your lips like that for about 30 to 60 seconds and release. Repeat this exercise a few times per day.

, Blowing up balloons can improve your lung capacity and give the muscles in your mouth and throat a good workout as well. Try blowing up a few balloons each day to strengthen your breathing muscles., There is some evidence that exercising can reduce the severity of sleep apnea.Even if you don't experience weight loss from your exercise, you may still experience some relief.

, Gargling water can help to tone the muscles in the back of your throat as well. Try gargling with water a few times per day to build up these muscles.You can also gargle mouthwash after you brush your teeth in the morning and at night.
This is not proven to help with sleep apnea, but it may be worth trying.

Cope effectively when snoring wakes you.,
Change how you think about the sound.,
Consider moving to a different room.",How to Sleep when Someone Is Snoring2," If you are woken up by snoring in the middle of the night, do not panic. Getting frustrated will make it harder to sleep. Instead, engage in some relaxing behaviors that will help you nod off again.Do not check the time on your phone. Not only could this potentially frustrate you, the bright light from your phone could wake you up more.
Instead, try closing your eyes and taking a few deep, soothing breaths. Channel the air into your lower abdomen rather than your stomach.

, If you think of snoring as an annoyance, it is more likely to bother you. Try to think of the sound as a soothing noise that can lull you to sleep. This may help you remain calm when you wake up in the middle of the night. Try to listen closely to snoring and pay attention to its rhythm. This can help you fall asleep.It may take some practice before this method works, so have patience. It may be awhile before you learn to embrace the sound of snoring.

, If you can't fall back asleep, try moving to a different room. If you have a guest room, sleep there. You can also try sleeping on the sofa for a night. If you're in a romantic relationship with someone who snores, it may help to arrange to sleep in different rooms at least some nights of the week."
"
Have the snorer sleep on their side or stomach.,
Discourage the snorer from drinking before bed.,
Use nasal strips.,
Raise the head of your bed.",How to Sleep when Someone Is Snoring3," Sometimes, shifting sleeping positions can help reduce snoring. If the snorer sleeps on their back, this can lead to an increase in snoring. Encourage them to sleep on their side or stomach instead and see if it makes a difference., Alcohol can relax the throat muscles, which can lead to an increase in snoring. Drinking in excess before bed can cause snoring or worsen the problem. Ask the snorer not to drink before bed, especially if you have something you need to do in the morning.If the snorer does drink before bed, encourage them to do so only in moderation. This can greatly reduce snoring.

, Nasal strips are strips of paper you fit over someone's nose before bed. For some, they reduce snoring. If snoring is becoming a problem, pick up some nasal strips at a pharmacy and have the snorer try using them at night.If sleep apnea is causing snoring, nasal strips will not be effective.

, Raising the head of your bed by about four inches can help reduce snoring. If you do not have an adjustable bed frame, try propping the snorer's head up with pillows."
"
Have the snorer use decongestants to address snoring.,
Encourage the snorer to talk to a doctor about quitting smoking.,
Have the snorer see a doctor to rule out underlying conditions.,
Explore treatment options with the snorer.",How to Sleep when Someone Is Snoring4," If the person snoring is congested, this can cause or worsen snoring. Have them try using decongestant sprays or medications before bed. Make sure to get sprays specifically designed for nighttime use. Sprays meant to be used during the day may not be as effective in combating snoring., If the snorer smokes, have them discuss quitting with a doctor. In addition to worsening snoring, smoking can cause a number of other health problems.A doctor may recommend things like nicotine gum or a nicotine patch to gradually ease your partner off tobacco. They may also recommend support groups in the area or online to help the person quit.

, Snoring may be caused by underlying medical conditions such a sleep apnea. If someone's snoring is chronic, you should see a doctor to rule out or diagnose underlying issues.The doctor may want to do X-rays or other scans to check for problems in the airway.
A doctor may want to conduct a sleep study. This can be done at home by your partner reporting sleep issues. The snorer also may spend a night in the hospital for doctors to observe their sleep.

, If the snorer is diagnosed with a specific condition, treatment for that condition can help with snoring. Treatments depend on the condition, but often involve the snorer wearing a sleep mask to help with nighttime breathing. If there is a problem with the snorer's throat or airway, in rare cases surgery may be used to correct the issue."

Make sure your environment is safe.,
Stick to a relaxing bedtime routine.,
Get enough sleep.,
Identify any triggers.",How to Cope With Night Terrors1," This is important for your well being. If you move around a lot during a night terror, you could fall and hurt yourself. Before bed, take steps to ensure a safe environment.You should close and lock all windows before bed so you do not wander out of your room.
Make sure to block off stairways.
Move anything off the floor that you may slip on if you get up during the night.;
, This can help you unwind before bed. If you have a routine, your body will learn when it's time to sleep at night. You will fall asleep faster, and higher quality sleep can reduce night terrors. Doing something relaxing can also help you fall asleep safe and comfortable. This may also quell your night terrors.Choose something that can help you relax. Try reading a soothing book, taking a warm bath, or having a cup of tea. It may be a bad idea to use your computer, television, or phone, as screens can make it more difficult to sleep.
Avoid doing anything that could scare you before bed. Do not watch anything scary on television or read anything disturbing.

, If you're not sleeping enough at night, this may increase your risk of having a night terror. Make sure you get 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep each night.Set a bedtime for yourself that will allow you to get this much sleep. If you have to be in bed by 11 each night to get your 7 to 9 hours, make sure to go to bed by then.
If you have a child with night terrors, be strict about his or her bedtime. Children actually need slightly more sleep than adults. Preschoolers need 11 to 13 hours, while elementary aged children need 9 to 11.

, This may help you figure out what you need to avoid before bed. Keep a sleep journal and note whenever you have a night terror. Figure out if there's any external cause that should be addressed.You may notice, for example, when you're not getting enough sleep, you're prone to night terrors. Certain stressors may also trigger your terrors. You may be prone to night terrors if you have a stressful day at work.
Once you've figured out what's causing your night terrors, you can take steps to reduce them. You can, for example, try to get more sleep if they're related to a lack of sleep. You can reduce a specific stressor in your life if it seems to cause night terrors.

Try a simple stretching exercise, with deep breathing, to warm yourself up.Stand with your legs hip distance apart. Breath in deeply and raise your arms to the ceiling. Roll your shoulders back and tuck your tailbone towards the floor.
As you exhale, lower your arms so they rest at your sides.
As you inhale, raise your arms to the ceiling again. Stretch as far as you can towards the ceiling.
As you exhale, lower your arms. Continue to raise and lower your arms, breathing deeply with each movement, for 10-12 breaths.;
, A warm beverage will increase your body temperature and gives you a sense of warmth. Choose herbal tea, with no caffeine so it won’t keep you up at night. You can also have a mug of hot water with lemon and honey to keep you warm.Avoid hot cocoa or hot chocolate, as the caffeine and sugar in the powdered mix will likely keep you up at night.

, Soaking in the steam of a warm shower or bath can warm up your body and keep your body temperature up for when it’s time for bed., Layer your clothing so you trap in your body heat as you sleep. Wool long johns, a flannel shirt or sleep set, long sleeve t-shirts and sweaters are all items you can layer on for warmth. Wearing layers, as opposed to one big, fluffy one piece sleepsuit, allows you to shed clothing throughout the night as your body warms up.Sleeping at a slightly cold temperature has been shown to lead to deeper, longer sleeps. You want to be careful not to warm your body up too much, as this could lead to fitful sleep or discomfort while sleeping. Wearing layers allows you to adjust your body heat as you warm up., Create a warm atmosphere on your bed with layers of blankets and comforters at the foot of your bed or on a chair by your bed. If you become cold in the night, you can then reach for a blanket or an extra layer.Place a blanket over your feet before going to bed to keep them warm. Your feet are often one of the first parts of your body to experience cold temperatures., If you decide to use an electric blanket, which uses electricity to warm up, be sure to unplug the blanket before you go to sleep or as you are dozing off. It is a fire hazard if left plugged in overnight. You should also avoid running the control cords for the blanket between your mattress and the box spring. The cord could become damaged by friction or heat from the electricity in the cord could become trapped, and lead to a fire hazard.If you decide to get a heated mattress pad, which uses electricity to stay warm, do not use an electric blanket. This could lead to overheating and is a fire hazard.

, If your home or apartment has a thermostat, check it to ensure the room is not set to a very low temperature, as this will make the room cold. The recommended temperature for the room is around 65 °F (18 °C).If you are sleeping with a partner, you may need to both agree on an ideal temperature for the room before bed. Try going several degrees above or below 65 degrees to determine your level of comfort and your sleeping partner’s level of comfort. Temperature regulation can be a subjective science, especially for sleeping. Play around with the thermostat to figure out the most comfortable temperature you both.

, Look for a hot water bottle at your local drugstore. Most hot water bottles are made with a liquid that can be heated in a microwave. You can also use a more traditional hot water bottle that uses boiled water. Simply boil water on the stove and pour it into the hot water bottle.Place the hot water bottle under your sheets or a blanket, by your feet. It should stay warm all night long, warming your toes and your body. By morning, it will cool to a tepid temperature.

, Wool is a great material for insulation and retaining warmth. Your feet are often the first body part that starts to feel cold and due to poor circulation, you may have a hard time warming them up with just a blanket.Get several pairs of high wool socks and keep them by your bed. You may reach for them in the night, in the event you can’t get warm.
You may also want to invest in house slippers to keep your feet warm throughout the day. Look for thick slippers with rubber soles to keep your feet cozy and give you traction when walking around your home.

, A good way to stay warm at night is to move closer to your sleeping partner and reap the benefits of natural body heat. If you have a pet, you may consider allowing them to sleep in your bed, if only to keep you warm throughout the night., Drafts are openings between doors, window panes, and sometimes even the slates in your floors, that let cold air into your room. If you keep getting woken up by cold air in your room, check for any drafts by your door, your window panes, or in the corners of your room. Block these drafts with a rolled up blanket or a long pillow. This will help to prevent cool air from circulating in your room as you sleep.You can also hang long blankets over your door and your windows to prevent any cold air from outside from coming in through small cracks into your room.

, If you continue to wake up at night shivering due to the cold room, try layering your blankets over your sheets, alternating between a thin layer and a thick layer, to create more warmth. Down comforters are great for retaining heat and keeping you warm, as are wool blankets.Down sleeping bags, made for camping, will also keep you very warm throughout the night. Look for them at thrift stores, Goodwill, or camping stores.

Run your wrists or the inside of your arms under cold running water for 30 seconds.",How to Sleep Comfortably on a Hot Night1," When you exercise, you raise your body temperature and retain heat. Exercising several hours before you go to bed will give your body time to cool down.You should also drink lots of water throughout the day to stay hydrated. You may also want to keep water by your bedside.;
, Eating a heavy meal or spicy food before bedtime may cause you to feel even hotter. Eat a light dinner at least two to three hours before bed and skip the spices and hot sauce.

, Drinking cold water not only slows digestion, it also slows down metabolism by constricting blood vessels and thereby decreasing hydration and ability of your body to cool off.Drink room temperature water instead.

, Don’t take a very cold shower, as this can have a rebound effect. Your body temperature may actually rise to counteract the cold water. Instead, have a medium cold, or tepid, shower.You can also soak your hands and feet in tepid water. Your hands and feet are your ""radiators"", or the areas of your body that tend to heat up. Cooling them down by soaking them will regulate your body temperature and cool you down.

, Heat rises, so find a spot that is low to ground, such as the floor of your bedroom, or that is low in your home, such as the bottom floor or the basement., Remove thick mattress protectors or pads, which retain heat, and any heavy blankets or duvets. Use lighter bedding like cotton sheets and lightweight cotton weave blankets on your bed.Straw or bamboo mats are also great for a cool night’s sleep. They do not retain body heat and will not warm you up. You can create a bamboo mat bed on the floor of your bedroom for an alternative spot to your regular bed.
Try Feel Drier® Moisture Wicking Sheets. They dry quicker, do not absorb the moisture like cotton sheets, so you avoid waking up in a puddle of sweat. Or try Feel Cooler bedding made with temperature regulating material that actually cools you off by absorbing some of your access heat.

, Stick your pillow cases, bed sheets and blankets in the freezer 30 minutes before you plan to go to bed. Once you place the bedding on your bed, they should stay cool enough for 30 to 40 minutes, just enough time to fall asleep.Avoid getting your bedding wet or sleeping on or in wet sheets or clothing. Don’t dip your socks in cold water and wear them to bed, or wear a wet t-shirt to bed. Bringing anything wet into the room, or wearing anything wet, will only trap dense humidity in your room and cause discomfort., An hour before bedtime, open the windows in the room to increase air circulation and cool down the room. However, you should close the windows before you fall asleep to avoid heating up the room with air during the night.While you sleep your body temperature dips to its lowest point at around 3 am. At 3 am, the temperature outside is also extremely low. If you are asleep with the windows open, the muscles around your neck and head can tense up involuntarily due to the sudden temperature drop and you can be woken up.
Keep the windows closed and the blinds or shades drawn during the day to avoid heating up the room.

, Though you may be tempted to strip down and go naked to stay cool, sleeping naked can make you feel hotter as it does not allow moisture to evaporate between your body and the sleeping surface. Go for cotton sleepwear, and avoid synthetic fabrics like nylon or silk, as they are not breathable and can make you feel hotter., Try DriNights performance sleepwear, it is moisture wicking and made out of the same type of material that is used in workout clothing. It is quick drying so if you sweat at night it keeps you drier by wicking the sweat away from your body and allow for your pj to dry quick. This gives you a cooler feeling and avoids the waking up from sweaty sticky sleepwear.

, Use a damp cloth or towel by your bedside to wet your face or arms throughout the night. But avoid going to sleep with a wet face or arms. Once you have wiped your body, dry yourself off with a dry towel before you go to sleep.You can also buy special towels that are made of hyper-evaporative material that retains water, but stays dry to the touch. They will cool you down without getting your skin wet., These areas are where your blood stream flows closest to the surface of your body. Running them under cold water for a minute will cool your blood down, making your whole body cooler."

Avoid consuming cannabis before bed.,
Avoid using prescription sleep aids.,

Sing.",How to Reduce Snoring1," Different types of snoring are caused by different things, and you will need to understand the root cause in order to find a solution. To start: ask your partner or your roommate whether you snore with your mouth open or with your mouth closed.


If you snore with your mouth wide open, your throat passage may be partially blocked. When you sleep, the muscles in your throat relax--and sometimes they relax so much that air cannot flow. You gasp for air, and this causes you to snore. A blocked throat passage can be a symptom of various health issues, from sleep apnea to a sinus infection.Closed-mouth snoring indicates that your tongue may be getting in the way of your windpipe, particularly if you are sleeping on your back.;
, If you sleep on your back, buy yourself a few extra pillows and prop yourself up in bed, rather than lying flat on your back. This will help keep your throat unblocked.


Consider raising the head of your bed. Some mattresses and bed frames are adjustable, allowing you to raise the headrest at the click of a button. If you own an adjustable bed, use it!
If you do not own an adjustable bed, you may consider raising the headboard yourself. Place a 2x4 plank or a brick underneath each of the two legs at the head of the bed. Make sure that the incline is not too steep that you slide out of bed, and make sure that the bed is stable before you try to sleep in it.

, When you sleep on your back, your tongue may rest against your throat, blocking your windpipe and causing you to snore.Experiment with side- and stomach-sleeping positions, and find what works for you. If you are comfortable, you will be less likely to roll back onto your back in your sleep.

, When you try to roll onto your back in your sleep, the tennis ball will wake you. Gradually, you may be able to train yourself not to sleep on your back., Alcohol is a muscle relaxant, and it can relax the muscles that keep your windpipe open, thus blocking your air intake. Your body overcompensates for the blockage by taking in too much air, which causes snoring.


Moreover, alcohol leads to less restful, more disturbed sleep.

, Marijuana, like alcohol, can relax your throat muscles and induce snoring. It also resembles alcohol in that pre-sleep use can prevent sleepers from dipping into restorative REM sleep, leaving them groggy and restless when the morning comes.


If you consume cannabis by smoking it, the smoke may also play a factor in your snoring problem. Regular smoking can irritate the skin in your nose and throat, which dries out your airways and makes a blockage more likely.

, Sedatives and sleeping pills can cause your throat muscles to relax in the same way as alcohol and cannabis, blocking your windpipe and inducing your body to snore.

, This, too, can relax your muscles to the point of snoring.

, Extra weight may add excess tissue to your neck. This tissue may constrict your windpipe, leading to the vibrations that we know as snoring. Losing weight can grant you many additional health benefits beyond the realm of snoring!

, Regular smoking can irritate the skin in your nose and your throat, which may obstruct your breathing. If you are a heavy smoker with a chronic snoring problem, consider quitting or moderating your habit.


Smoking can cause obstructions in your windpipe, swelling of the mucous membrane in the nose, swelling of the tissue in the throat, and blockage of the small vessels in the lungs.

, We snore when loose throat tissue relaxes and blocks our airway. A regular singing practice may strengthen the throat muscles and firm the tissue of your throat and mouth, making your throat less likely to close up at night.This may work particularly well for aging snorers whose throat muscles have weakened with time.
If you're not into singing, consider trying a few tongue and throat stretches. Stick your tongue out as far as you can, then relax. Repeat 10 times. Stick your tongue out again, and try to touch your chin. Hold. Repeat, but try to touch your nose instead. Repeat 10 times.

Take a nice warm bath or shower in the evening.,
Sleep naked.,
Sleep in varying positions.,
Use a suitable pillow.,
Reduce your light exposure an hour or two before going to bed.,
Add gentle sounds.",How to Sleep Better1," As well as relaxing you, afterwards your body will cool down, which helps you sleep better.;
, According to sleep specialists at the Cleveland Sleep Clinic, sleeping in the nude helps you regulate your temperature.Get a comfortable temperature using blankets or duvet (of suitable warmth), sheets, and pillows. It is usually best to be slightly on the cool side.


Preferably sleep with your arms and head out from under the bedclothes, unless the room is very cold.
Feeling too hot? Learn how to sleep comfortably on a hot night. Feeling too cold? Learn how to sleep when it's cold.
Keep an extra blanket right by the bed, just in case you get cold at night. Don't neglect your feet—cold feet can keep you awake!
If you prefer to wear pajamas because they're more comfortable, loose cotton pajamas are the best as they as a rule breathe more easily than other fabrics.

, Changing your sleeping position can make a huge difference in the quality of your sleep. When you go to sleep, or if you wake up in the middle of the night, make a conscious effort to follow these guidelines until it becomes habitual:


Keep your body in a ""mid-line"" position, where both your head and neck are kept roughly straight. This should help you sleep.
Avoid sleeping on your stomach. It's difficult to maintain the proper position, and it is more likely to cause aches and pains. If you wish to sleep on your stomach, put your pillow under your hips instead of under your head.

, If it's too thin, your head will tilt backwards, which is uncomfortable. Likewise, don't stack your pillows so that your head is propped at an angle.


Try placing a pillow between your legs if you sleep on your side. This will support your hips and make this position more comfortable.
Try placing a pillow under your legs if you sleep on your back.

, Bright light before bedtime can disrupt your body's internal clock. It's one of the primary clues to the body that it's either sleep time, or waking time.If your home is brightly lit late at night, turn off lights you do not need.
Stop watching TV and using your tablet or phone at least two hours before bedtime too. It is recommended to install 'f.lux' onto your computer, which stops blue light from the screen damaging your sleep
Eliminate all sources of light in your bedroom. This includes windows, LED clocks, computer lights, cable boxes, and other devices with lights (unless they're very dim). You can cover them with heavy paper, cloth covers, masking tape, or just unplug them. Not only will you get a good night's sleep, you'll save electricity.
If light still disturbs you or wakes you in in the morning, wear an eye mask. Sometimes lavender eye ""pillows"" can be more relaxing.

, Use a white noise generator that generates various soothing sounds—–surf, wind, steam—–these are sounds that have no shape, and they can help your brain to de-focus on right now.


White noise has been shown to not only help people fall asleep more quickly, but also it can disguise other noises that may wake you during the night.
White noise or natural sound machines are often wonderful. But if you cannot afford one, a fan can make soothing noise. So can a radio tuned to ""between stations"", where it creates static. Make sure that the radio isn't too loud.Repetitive or ambient music is very good for falling asleep. What's especially important is that there be no dramatic shifts in the dynamics of the music. Ambient music, such as that produced by Brian Eno, is ideal.Just be sure that the music stops or fades out in about an hour, or it could keep you from experiencing really deep sleep.
Turn your phone off, or to silent mode (if you use its alarm), so you will not be disturbed with texts, phone calls, and notifications. If you know that you have to be somewhere go to bed earlier.

Find a good place to nap.,
Choose a dark room.,
Make sure it is not too warm or too cold.,
Turn on soothing music.,

Nap for two to five minutes.,
Nap for five to twenty minutes.,
Sleep for twenty minutes.,
Sleep for fifty to ninety minutes.,
Be aware of the effects of naps of thirty minutes or longer.,
Turn off your mobile phone and any other potential distractions.,

Try the ""4-7-8 exercise"" to fall asleep quickly.,
Keep your eyes closed.,
Get up as soon as the alarm goes off.",How to Power Nap," In order to get the most out of your nap, you will need to find a place where you will not be disturbed by others.



Napping at work: A survey by the National Sleep Foundation found that about 30% of people are allowed to sleep at work, and some employers even provide a place for employees to nap.If your place of employment isn't nap-friendly, you can take a power-nap in your car.

Napping on the road: If you're driving, find a rest area to park in. Don't park on the shoulder. Always turn off the car and set the emergency brake. If it's nighttime, park in a well-lit area with plenty of people around and lock all of your doors.

Napping at school: If you have the time, and are allowed to, consider using the library as a good place to nap. It is usually the quietest place at school. Then after, you can also nap in your car, if you have one.;
, By blocking out the light, you will fall asleep faster. If you cannot get to a dark room, wear a sleep mask or at least a pair of sunglasses to provide some semblance of darkness.

, You want your napping to be comfortable, so look for a cool, but comfortable place to nap. Most people sleep best around 65° F or 18° C.If your napping place is too cold, have a blanket ready or a comfortable jacket you can put on. If your napping place is too warm, consider placing a fan in the room, if possible.

, Relaxing music can put you in the right state of mind. If you find music distracting, you can also try white noise. If you are in your car, you can turn your radio to the static between stations and use that.

, Strictly speaking, a power nap should be between 10 and 30 minutes.However, shorter and longer naps may also offer different benefits. Thus, you need to decide how long you have to nap, and stick with that amount of time.

, If you don’t have much time, but are so sleepy you cannot continue on with whatever you’re doing, a two to five minute nap, called a “nano-nap” can help you deal with some of that sleepiness., Naps between five and twenty minutes are good for increasing alertness, stamina, and motor performance. These naps are known as “mini-naps”. , This is what most people refer to when they refer to a “power nap”, and is ideal for most people. In addition to the benefits of shorter naps, a power nap can help the brain rid itself of unnecessary information stored in short-term memory, and can also improve muscle memory.A power-nap captures the benefits of the first two of the five stages in the sleep cycle. These first two stages take place in the first twenty minutes. In addition to making you feel more rested and alert, the electrical signals in your nervous system strengthen the connection between neurons involved in muscle memory, making your brain work faster and more accurately.
It can be especially useful to take a power nap if you are trying to remember a lot of important facts, for example, for a test.

, Known as the “Lazy Man’s Nap”, this long nap allows you to reach slow-wave REM sleep (commonly known as deep sleep).Meaning that you get to go through an entire sleep cycle.


If you have the time, and are extremely physically and mentally tired after pulling an all-nighter, for example, this nap could be useful because it gives your body enough time to repair itself.

, While there are benefits to longer naps, you also run the risk of developing “sleep inertia”, which is the heavy, groggy feeling you sometimes feel after napping., If you are using your phone as your alarm clock, turn on airplane mode so you will not be interrupted by notifications.


If background noise is unavoidable, or if you suffer from tinnitus, putting on headphones with soft, relaxing music may help. You can also try using ear plugs.

, Note when you will be available again. This will keep co-workers from accidentally disturbing you.

, This may sound counterintuitive since caffeine is a strong stimulant, but you will not feel the effects immediately, especially if you are taking a nap of less than thirty minutes. Caffeine has to travel through your gastrointestinal tract, and can take up to 45 minutes to be absorbed. Taking a “caffeine nap” in which 200mg of caffeine are consumed right before a 20 minute nap may improve performance and make you feel less sleepy once you wake up.However, if it is late in the afternoon you should probably skip the caffeine, as it may make it more difficult to fall asleep at bed time. You can also skip the caffeine if you are trying to quit caffeine.

, Once you are close to finishing your coffee (or your green tea, or your caffeine jello shot, etc.), set an alarm that will wake you up after the desired amount of time. Setting an alarm will help you relax, as you know you won’t sleep longer than you intend to.


Keep in mind how long you need to fall asleep. If you want to take a 20 minute nap, and you usually take about five minutes to fall asleep, then you will want to set your alarm for 25 minutes. If you fall asleep very quickly, you may only need to add an extra minute or two to your desired nap time.
If you're one of those people who has a habit of pressing the ""snooze"" button and going right back to sleep, put your alarm across the room, or as far away from yourself as possible if you’re in the car, so that it will not be easy to turn it off.

, If you are consuming caffeine, you can do this directly after finishing your caffeine, if you are not, you can do this directly after you have made yourself comfortable and set your alarm.

, If you are having trouble falling asleep try this exercise: Close your eyes, and exhale completely. Then breathe in slowly, to a count of four. Hold your breath to a count of seven; then, making a whooshing sound, breath out through your mouth to a count of eight. Inhale one breath in, and then repeat the cycle three or four times.The whole exercise only takes about 60 seconds, and should help put you to sleep quickly.


You can also try putting all thoughts out of your mind. Instead, try focusing only on your breathing. This is very similar to meditating, but can also help you relax so that you can fall asleep quickly.
Try counting down slowly from 100. If you forget what number you're on, simply start again at 100. This will help keep your mind off of thoughts that keep you awake.You can also try one of the commercially available power nap machines or CDs that play a special soundtrack designed to induce a sleep state.

, Even if you are unable to fall asleep during your nap, keep your eyes closed and meditate. Although you may not fall asleep, you can still help your brain recharge a bit. Additionally, incorporating short bouts of sleep into a daily routine (taking a nap every day after lunch, for example) can help you ""train"" your body to expect a nap during that time and you'll have an easier time falling asleep., Resist the temptation to sleep longer. Ideally, you will wake up feeling refreshed, but you may sometimes feel like you want to sleep more; do your best to resist this temptation as it can throw off your sleep routine, and you may wake up the second time with sleep inertia.


Follow up with physical activity. Get your heart rate up a bit by doing a few jumping jacks or push-ups, you can also try a bit of jogging in place.

Wash your face and expose yourself to bright light (e.g. sunlight), which can help you feel more awake, if you are still feeling groggy after your nap. "

, It's easy to get stressed out by little things if you lack perspective. When you feel yourself becoming stressed, try to take a few minutes to look at the big picture.Try to see the positive in stressful situations. For example, think to yourself, ""Yes, I'm feeling stressed, but this is an exciting challenge. I'll feel invigorated if I get through it.""
How important will your current situation be in the long run? Keep this in mind. While running late to a meeting is stressful, it probably will not cost you your career.
Work on adjusting your standards. High standards may mean you have unnecessary stress in your life. Try to loosen up a bit. Is it 100% necessary to always do your dishes before bed? Could you stand to leave dishes for a couple of days sometimes?

Encourage airflow with a fan.,
Make an ice towel.,
Flip your pillow over to the cool side.,
Place an ice pack on your neck or forehead.,
Mist your face and neck with a spray bottle.",How to Sleep Comfortably on a Hot Night2," Keep the bedroom door open and position the fan in a corner of the room so it faces your bed.Avoid pointing the fan at your face, your back, or too close to your body. Pointing the fan at your face can cause your neck muscles to stiffen and lead to allergies or illness.

, Before there was AC, people would suspend ice packs, ice towels, or cooling packs in front of fans to stay cool.To make an ice towel, hang a wet towel holding ice cubes from two chairs. Point a fan at the towel and at a wall or far away from you in the corner of the room.
Place a container under the towel to catch the melting ice water.

, If you wake up due to heat during the night, flip your pillow over to the other side. The other side will be cooler than the side you were sleeping on, as it has not absorbed your body heat during the night., You can buy cold packs in most grocery stores. Slip a cold pack under your neck, on your forehead, or under your arms, by your armpits. Cooling down the back of your neck, your forehead, and under your arms helps cool the rest of your body down as well.


You can also make your own cold pack at home. Place three to four tablespoons of dish soap in a resealable Ziploc bag. Place it in the freezer. The soap will not harden and it will hold the cold temperature longer than ice and/or the blue ice packs. Once you are ready to use it, place in a pillowcase or fold it in a towel and apply it to your neck or arms. Because the pack is not solid, it is versatile and comfortable on most areas of your body.
You can also Make a Rice Sock. Place it in the freezer and leave it there for at least two hours. When you turn in, bring the bag with you to use as a cool compress. Try placing it under your pillow so it's nice and cool when you flip it over.

Address any nasal congestion.,
Try taking a decongestant or antihistamine if you suspect that nasal congestion is causing your snoring.,
Use a humidifier to humidify your bedroom.,
Use a sinus/nasal rinse to flush out the debris and mucus that form in your nose.,
Consider using nasal strips to reduce noise levels while you treat your sinus problems.",How to Reduce Snoring2," If your nose is stuffy and you have trouble breathing, you may be snoring at night to overcompensate for the reduced airflow. If you suffer from a chronic sinus infection, speak with your doctor about treatment.

, Use these only as a temporary measure. Prolonged use of either can pose health risks.


Gargle with a peppermint mouthwash to shrink the lining of your nose and throat. This is especially effective if your snoring is a temporary condition caused by a head cold or an allergy.
Change your sheets and pillowcases often to remove bedroom allergens. Vacuum your floors, clean your curtains, and dust the place down. Many respiratory infections are caused by germs floating around in our living spaces.

, When you breathe dry air, your airways tighten, reducing the amount of air that can pass through your windpipe. If your bedroom is very dry, you may be snoring to compensate.

, Most pharmacies sell bottles of saline solution, and some of these solutions are medicated with decongestants to potentiate the effect. Use these nasal decongestant sprays sparingly, as they can dry out your nose with overuse.


Take a warm shower or bath before bed to keep your breathing channels from drying out. Hot, moist air will help drain the mucus from your sinuses and keep them unobstructed.
As noted before, raise the head of your bed or sleep on an extra pillow. This will help reduce the amount of mucus that drains and blocks your nasal passages.

, These sticky strips may make your snoring quieter, but they are not likely to actually fix the problem.Nasal strips are available at most pharmacies. Following the directions on the package and tape one of the strips to the outside of your nose. They work by lifting and opening your nostrils to increase airflow.

Be tactful.,
Bring it up sooner rather than later.,
Remember that snoring is a physical disorder with practical solutions.,
Remember that most solutions take time.",How to Reduce Snoring3," If you are speaking with a partner or a roommate about their snoring, try to approach the problem constructively. Offer to help. Suggest solutions, but do not demand change.


Be aware of deeper issues. Talking about the root causes of a snoring problem may inadvertently bring up smoking, drinking, weight, or other sensitive issues that may affect your relationship with your partner. Be aware of the territory that your conversation might touch upon, and be respectful of your partner's choices.
It is frustrating to be kept up all night by someone's snoring--but try not to be bitter. Keep your discussion light and upbeat, and make it clear that you are happy to be a part of the solution.

, Your partner's snoring may be a temporary side-effect of a sinus infection, or it may be a long-term frustration that festers under the skin of your relationship. It may feel better to clear the air and work with your partner to solve the problem together.


Timing is everything. Try not to confront your partner about their snoring in the middle of the night or immediately after they wake. You will be less frustrated if you wait until daytime, and your partner will be in a better state to deal with the problem.

, Whether you're a snorer or you live with one, there is nothing to be embarrassed or angry about. The snorer does not choose to snore.


If you regularly snore and your partner complains, take the issue seriously. Your snoring may not bother you, but over time it may cause unnecessary tension in your relationship.

, In the interim, if your partner snores, consider investing in a pair of earplugs to get a better night's sleep.


If you begin to use earplugs but do not bring up the snoring issue, your partner may be embarrassed. Use earplugs only as a temporary fix. Be proactive, but not passive-aggressive.

Determine whether your symptoms match up with obstructive sleep apnea.,
If you regularly take any prescribed medication, check the bottle or the packaging to see if snoring is listed as a side-effect.,
Ask your doctor if your age could play a role in your snoring problem.,
Ask your doctor if your body type could play a role in your snoring problem.,
Ask your doctor about using an anti-snoring mouthpiece if your snoring problem does not respond to sinus treatment or lifestyle changes.,
Consider sleeping with expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) valves in your nostrils.,
Consider anti-snoring devices only in extreme cases.",How to Reduce Snoring4," Frequent, loud snoring may be a sign of sleep apnea--particularly if your snoring is punctuated by pauses followed by choking or gasping. Sleep apnea causes shallow, interrupted breathing, and keeps people from slipping into the deep REM sleep that restores their energy for each coming day. About 1/2 of people who snore loudly suffer from sleep apnea.You may be suffering from sleep apnea if, in addition to snoring, you are abnormally sleepy during the day. Your reflexes and your concentration may be impaired.Bear in mind that some of these symptoms can sprout from many other roots.
Sleep apnea is treatable. Identify the symptoms and speak with your doctor.

, The drugs that you're ingesting might be making your snoring worse. If you are not sure, ask your doctor.

, Snoring tends to worsen as you age. Many of the above solutions still apply to elderly snorers.


As you reach middle age, your windpipe becomes narrower, and you gradually lose muscle tone in your throat. You may be able to reverse this effect by performing throat exercises.

, There is a strong link between snoring and diabetes: people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are nine times more likely to suffer from diabetes., These ""dental appliances"" are designed to prevent your soft throat tissues from relaxing to the point that they obstruct the airway.


Some devices bring your lower jaw forward, some lift the roof of your mouth, and some stop the tongue from falling back over your windpipe.Be wary about commercial sleep aids. Ask your doctor about the risks, costs, and benefits, and make an informed decision about whether an anti-snoring mouthpiece is right for you.

, These devices use the power of your breath to create a gentle pressure that helps keep your respiratory passages open.


Again, be wary about commercial sleep aids. Ask your doctor about the risks, costs, and benefits, and make an informed decision about whether an EPAP device is right for you.

, Before you purchase an expensive valve or mouthpiece, try to identify any habits or environmental factors that may be causing you to snore. Refer to the ""quick lifestyle fixes"" at the top of this page and try to solve the root cause of your snoring problem.

High protein foods like turkey, yogurt, soy beans, tuna, and peanuts contain tryptophan, which can help the body produce serotonin in order to relax. They also have natural, complex fats that can satiate your hunger.

, This includes coffee, black teas, cocoa, and caffeinated soda. Caffeine can keep you awake even if you drank it earlier in the day, as its effects can last up to 12 hours. This also includes other stimulants like those found in energy drinks even if they are not caffeine. Avoid tobacco products in the evenings as well.

, Highly recommended beverages include a warm glass of milk or chamomile tea. However, most herbal teas are fine, as long as they do not contain any caffeine.

, Ensure, though, that you drink at least two liters of water during the day.


A well-hydrated body will not wake you from thirst, but drinking a big glass of water just before bed might wake you to go to the bathroom at an inconvenient hour.

, Alcohol will make you feel sleepy, but it will also reduce the quality of your sleep as your body processes the alcohol and sugars. Alcohol tends to produce broken, shallow sleep (even if you don't notice the periods of waking during the night), which does not refresh."

Use your bedroom for bedtime.,
Make your bedroom a haven.,
Clean your room.,
Beautify your room.,
Maintain your mattress.,
Consider getting a new mattress.",How to Sleep Better3," If your body is used to doing all sorts of things in the room besides sleep it may not make a smooth transition to sleep when it is time.Your mind should associate your bedroom with sleep and perhaps soothing, relaxing activities.


Avoid: stressful work or homework, using the computer, watching TV, talking on the phone, eating, exercising, and generally anything that is stressful, energizing, very exciting, or keeps you from going to sleep on time.
Probably OK: reading, a relaxing project, cuddling with spouse, writing in journal.
Use your bed ONLY for sleeping.

, The more comfortable your bed and bedroom are, the more conducive they are to a restful sleep.

, Get rid of the cobwebs, dust the shelves, vacuum the floor. Empty the wastepaper basket. Remove dirty plates, cups, and water-bottles. A clean room sets the emotional stage for your room being a safe, healthy place, not a neglected dumping-ground to wallow in. Also, regular cleaning can alleviate allergies which can disrupt sleep. It also keeps pests like mice, rats, and cockroaches from invading your space.


Keep your bed clean. Wash the sheets and pillowcases every week, they smell great and you will feel more comfortable sleeping.
Don't clutter your room with things that can distract you from going to sleep. Tidy up. Throw out any rubbish and let fresh air in.

, An aesthetically pleasing room will make you happier than one that's displeasing. You do not necessarily have to have your room be a page from the Ikea catalog. But simple changes, such as getting rid of an ugly bedspread or repainting your walls can subtly shift your mood.


Make your room darker. Blackout drapes, shades, or blinds can avoid you awakening early.
Make sure your sleep temperature is restful. If you are sweating or freezing, you will not sleep well.

, Replace it after five to seven years of regular use. If you feel springs or ridges beneath the surface when you're lying on the bed, or you and your partner tend to roll over each other a lot at night (unintentionally), it's time to go mattress shopping!


You may also find that the mattress is to blame if you find yourself sleeping better in another bed.

, The newer types of mattresses that allow for adjustment or that mold around you may help you get a better night's sleep.


One type of mattress lets you adjust the firmness of your bed, individually, for both you and your partner. This is ideal if you can never agree on which mattress feels right. You may both have different needs, and trying to find one you will both like generally means finding a mattress that neither of you will get a good night's sleep on.
Another type of mattress uses memory foam, which moulds to the contours of your body as it warms up. This leaves no pressure points to cause numbness, irritation or other physical issues. This is especially useful for those with bad hips or other joints.

Go to bed and get up at the same time every day.,
Consider allowing less time for sleeping.,
Develop a sleep routine.,
Try deep breathing relaxation before bed.,
Exercise regularly.,
Consider taking a nap.",How to Sleep Better4," Varying your sleeping times by more than an hour can severely disrupt your sleep quality by breaking your circadian rhythm.


Use the same sleep schedule even at weekends. Even if you have to go to bed later occasionally, still get up at your normal time.
When your alarm clock goes off, get up right away every day. Don't lie in or snooze.

, Different people need different amounts of sleep. If you take longer than 30 minutes to fall asleep, or often wake up for long periods during the night, you may be allowing too much time for sleep. You need deep, continuous sleep, even if it's shorter, rather than shallow broken-up sleep.


So, if you normally allow say 8 hours between bedtime and getting up, try reducing it by 15 minutes - by going to bed later or setting your alarm for earlier. You may be more tired for the first few days, but that will help you sleep.
After a week, if you're still not going to sleep quickly and staying asleep, reduce the sleep time by another 15 minutes.
Continue reducing the sleep time by 15 minutes each week, until you are able to go to sleep quickly and stay asleep. (Waking up during the night is normal, as long as it's only for a few minutes.)
Then stick with this new bedtime and getting up time.

, Try doing the same steps each night before you go to bed, to ready yourself for sleep. Consistency is the key. For a truly soothing evening, try the following steps:


Put on some ambient music, and instead of incandescent lights, light several candles in your living room and in your bedroom.
Practice breathing exercises (see below) or meditation, focusing on relaxing your body.
When it's time, extinguish the candles as you make your way to the bedroom. Your home will get progressively darker until the last candle is extinguished.

, Find a comfortable position. Make sure your environment is relaxed. Not much light, calm music and a space where you know you will not be interrupted are ideal.


Clear your mind. Close your eyes and imagine all those problems that you keep in your mind everyday fading out with each breath.
Pull in the positive. Inhale positive images that makes you happy. While you do this keep, smile.
Focus on your breath. Feel the oxygen within your body. You should start feeling a relaxing sensation across your body and mind.
Try to maintain this for 10 minutes every night before going to sleep.
You could even add a few drops of lavender oil onto your pillow, which calms the nerves and helps you sleep.

, If you have a sedentary job, a lack of physical exertion may contribute to reducing the quality of your sleep. The human body uses sleep to repair and recover. If there isn't much from which to recover, your body's sleep cycle could be disrupted.Physical exertion (such as going for a run or a swim, or better yet, exercising regularly) can make for deeper and more restful sleep. To add more exercise to your day, take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk instead of catching the bus, and so forth.
Don't exercise less than 2 hours before bedtime. Exercise can greatly enhance and promote sleep. However, your body will be ""revved up"" some time after your workout. (The one possible exception may be gentle yoga).

, For some people (depending on work and your daily routine), a short rest in the afternoon can help alleviate drowsiness experienced during the day. Though naps are not for everyone - many people feel even drowsier after a nap.


When you feel the need for a nap (should your job allow), set your timer for 15 minutes. If you're ready for a nap, you'll be asleep in a minute or two. When the timer goes off, get up immediately! Have a glass of water, and jump back into work. You will feel much more refreshed—–even more so than if you had slept for an hour.

Perform a simple sleep test.,
Pay back your short-term sleep debt.,
Take a vacation for long-term debt.,
Prevent health problems by getting the amount of sleep you need.,
Recognize situations that change your sleep needs.,
Identify your sleep needs by age.,
Adjust your environment.,
Pay attention to your eating habits.,
Modify your activity throughout the day.,
Develop a relaxation routine before bedtime.,
Stick with your schedule.,
Talk to your doctor if you continue to have difficulty.,
Pay attention to changes in your sleep patterns.,
Review your medications.,
Take a sleep aid.",How to Know How Much Sleep You Need," It may take more than one night to determine the results of this test.The next opportunity that you have to “sleep in” for a few days is your chance to perform this test. You may need several nights in a row to get the best results.
Step one of the test is to go to bed at a reasonable time. If you are looking for a time when you can sleep in, then that probably means it’s a week-end or a series of days that you have off from your work or school. For the test to work, you have to resist staying up later than normal since you can “sleep in” the next day. Get accurate results from the test by sticking with a routine bedtime each night.
Next, do not set an alarm clock. Sleep until you wake up naturally. If you are like most people, you will probably sleep a long time that first night, maybe even 16 hours or more. This is because you are in a situation called sleep debt.
If you have a serious sleep debt, then you may have to deal with that before you can get the best results from this test. If your sleep debt is not substantial, then proceed with the test.
After the first night of longer than average sleep, continue with the same bedtime, and avoid setting an alarm. After a few days you will wake up at about the same time every day naturally. Now you know how many hours of sleep your body needs every night.
If you have gotten enough sleep, you should be alert and capable of doing monotonous activities without becoming sleepy.;
, Sleep debt occurs when you fail to get the amount of sleep your body needs, and it actually accumulates over time.You are borrowing minutes or hours every time you cut your night’s sleep a little short. This can occur in both the short term and over months.
Staying up late for work, play, or study, then getting up with an alarm clock because you have to, is a set-up for adding to your sleep debt.
Repay your short-term sleep debt by adding an hour or so to each night’s sleep, and take advantage of opportunities to sleep in or take a nap until you have paid back the amount of sleep you lost over a short-term.
This means that you need to keep track of the hours of sleep you lost, therefore you need to know how much sleep you need.

, Longer term sleep debt accumulations may take several weeks, or even longer to pay back and get back on track.Take a vacation with nothing on your schedule, then go to bed at the same time every night and sleep every morning until you wake up naturally.
Don’t beat yourself up for sleeping a lot during this vacation. Just pay back your sleep debt and get back on a regular schedule.
Once you have repaid your debt and you stick to a regular bedtime, you will reach a point where you no longer need that alarm clock in the mornings. This is provided that your bedtime is early enough to allow your body to get the exact amount of sleep it requires.
If you go to bed “early” for you, but you still are tired and have trouble waking up in the mornings, then try an even earlier bedtime. Not everyone fits in the realm of the number of hours considered normal. You may need to naturally sleep a little more. If earlier bedtimes do not help, then talk to your doctor.
If you have worked at paying back your sleep debt and you still feel overly fatigued and exhausted during the day, then you may have an underlying medical problem or medication that is contributing to the problem. Make an appointment with your doctor to evaluate your persistent tired and fatigued feeling.

, Understanding more about the symptoms associated with sleep debt is a great way to realize what happens when you deny your body the sleep it needs.A research study done by the University of Chicago followed a group of volunteers for six days that were only allowed to sleep four hours each night.
After only six days of accumulating a sleep debt, the people in the study experienced high blood pressure, increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, made only half the normal amount of antibodies to a flu vaccine, and developed early signs of insulin resistance, which is the first step in developing type 2 diabetes.
Other symptoms observed in people with short-term sleep loss include difficulty concentrating, slower decision making, worsened vision, difficult driving, irritability, fatigue, and problems with memory.
Researchers have also evaluated the symptoms developed in people that go for longer periods of time without getting enough sleep. These symptoms include obesity, insulin resistance, stroke, memory loss, and heart disease.

, Sometimes stress and physical changes can trigger the need for more sleep.Pregnancy is an example of a physical change that triggers an increased need for sleep, at least during the first trimester.
Other situations that may cause your body to need additional sleep include illness, injury, intense physical exertion, difficult emotional situations, and intense mental tasks.
Allow yourself a nap or a little extra sleep time at night to compensate for these stressors.

, Many professional resources publish charts that provide guidelines for the general sleep requirements divided into age groups.As we get older, the number of hours of sleep we need each night lessen. The extreme ranges include newborns that sleep anywhere from 11 to 19 hours each 24 hours period, with 14 to 17 hours considered the average range, to adults over age 65 that sleep from five to nine hours each night, with the average being seven to eight hours.
Several credible sites, including the National Sleep Foundation, provide recommended sleep guidelines divided into age groups. The charts include recommended number of hours, appropriate hours, and provide ranges outside of the number of hours indicated to fall in a category of “not recommended.”
Realize that every person is unique and has additional factors that may cause him or her to fall outside the recommended ranges without labeling it as abnormal. For example, some people may be on medications or have underlying diseases that cause them to sleep more than the guidelines suggest.

, Make the area where you sleep as comfortable and relaxing as possible.Start by controlling the temperature. Keep the bedroom at a comfortable and cooler temperature.
Use your bed for sleep and sex only. Avoid using your bed for other activities, such as studying, reading, playing video games, using any device with a screen, and watching late-night television.
Make sure your bedroom is quiet when it is time for sleeping, and as dark as possible. You may need to consider using window coverings to block out any light, and ear plugs or a fan to block out external noises.
Be sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and inviting. If you share the bed, be sure it is large enough to allow for both parties to be comfortable.
Try to avoid allowing children and pets to sleep in the same bed.
If you work a second or third shift, then follow the same guidelines. Try to keep as consistent a sleep and wake schedule as possible.

, Eating a healthy diet helps your body to function more efficiently in all areas including a healthy sleep cycle, but there are some specific things you can do to help improve your sleep quality.Avoid heavy meals late at night and just before bedtime, and avoid going to bed hungry.
Limit how much you drink in the evening to prevent frequent awakenings during the night to go to the bathroom.
Limit your intake of caffeine throughout the day, and try to stop drinking caffeinated beverages by 2pm each day.
Stop smoking or avoid smoking close to bedtime. Nicotine acts like a stimulant and can prevent you from falling asleep.
Avoid consuming alcohol close to bedtime. The initial response to alcohol is to feel sleepy, but in a few hours it changes and acts like a stimulant which can cause you to have trouble sleeping.

, This includes everything from exercise during the day to getting exposure to natural sunlight.Exercise according to the recommended guidelines, which include at least 150 minutes of aerobic activity each week. Keep your exercise routines during the daytime or early evening. Avoid exercising just prior to bedtime.
The link between proper exercise and sleep is well-documented. Studies have shown that moderate aerobic exercise, such as walking, can significantly reduce the amount of time that individuals with insomnia take to fall asleep compared to no exercise at all.Take advantage of daytime natural light exposure. Sunlight provides the body with important vitamins and helps to regulate a healthy sleep-wake cycle. Limit your exposure to light closer to your bedtime.
If you need a nap, do not nap too close to bedtime and try to limit the nap to 20 to 30 minutes in the mid-afternoon.

, This would include activities that take your mind off the stressors of the day.Some people like to read, others do crafts like knitting or painting. Consider taking a warm bath or shower, or listening to soothing music or nature sounds. Whatever works for you is great. If possible try to lower the lights during your relaxation time.
Develop healthy ways during the day to relieve stressors. Give yourself permission to take breaks throughout the day to relax, talk about something fun, and enjoy a laugh with friends. By managing your stress during the day you are helping to relieve that build-up of things to worry about just before bed.

, Go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, including weekends and holidays.Even if you do not feel tired or sleepy, try maintaining your scheduled bedtime. If you have difficulty falling asleep quickly for several nights then you may need to adjust your bedtime.
Some guidelines suggest that you not go to bed until you feel sleepy or tired, while others recommend sticking with that scheduled bedtime. By maintaining the bedtime routine and schedule, you may feel sleepy once you are in bed and you allow yourself to relax.
If you do not fall asleep within 15 minutes of going to bed, then get up. By doing so, you avoid adding worry about not being able to sleep to your stressors. Get up and move around or do something relaxing for a few minutes, then go back to bed.
Avoid watching the clock. Relax, think of positive things from your day or relaxing activities that you enjoy, and try not to think about going to sleep.

, There may be an underlying medical reason or medication that is contributing to your difficulty sleeping.Medical conditions can sometimes contribute to difficult sleeping. Examples of problems that may need to be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist include depression, insomnia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic sleep disorder, and problems with nightmares or other emotionally disturbing sleep problems.
Examples of other medical conditions that are commonly related to sleep problems include sleep apnea, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, chronic pain, restless leg syndrome, COPD and other breathing related disorders, allergies, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, GERD, and multiple sclerosis.
Some sleep problems are caused by disorders directly related to sleep. Examples of these disorders include circadian rhythm sleep disorders, delayed phase sleep problems, narcolepsy, cataplexy, sleep walking, sleep talking, REM sleep disorders, and shift work sleep disorder.

, Sleep disorders can occur from a wide range of both medical conditions, mental health concerns, and disorders of sleep.Symptoms of sleep disorders include excessive sleepiness during the day, lingering fatigue, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep, difficulty sleeping when you are tired and it is time for sleep, and abnormal sleep behaviors, which can include things like sleep talking and walking in your sleep.The length of symptoms associated with every possible condition that may be contributing to your sleep difficulty exceeds the capacity of this article.
Talk with your doctor sooner rather than later. It is not in the best interest of your overall health to delay addressing problems you may be having with your sleep. Your doctor will help you to get answers to all your questions as well as the proper treatment for the cause of your sleep problems.

, Many medications can cause either excessive sleepiness and fatigue or problems with getting enough sleep.Do not adjust your medications on your own. If you think a medication is causing or contributing to your sleep problem, talk to your doctor. In many cases, the dose can be adjusted or another drug can be prescribed in place of the medication that is causing the problem.
Hundreds of medications have excessive sleepiness as a listed side effect. That list is too lengthy to reproduce here. Everything from antihistamines, to blood pressure medication, to pain meds can cause problems with alertness and sleepiness. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you think one of your medications may be interfering with your sleep.
Medications can also prevent you from sleeping well. While this list is also lengthy, it is probably shorter than the list of medications that cause drowsiness. Still, many drugs can possibly disrupt your ability to get a good night’s sleep. Talk to your doctor if you feel any medication you are taking is preventing you from sleeping.

, If you continue to have difficulty establishing and/or maintaining sleep, there may be an underlying reason, such as depression, or you may just need to re-establish a healthy sleep pattern.Some agents are available over-the-counter that can help you to fall asleep easier. All sleep agents available without a prescription are intended for short-term use.
If your sleeping problem persists, talk to your doctor about prescription medications that may prove helpful.

Set a regular bedtime and wake-up time.,
Stick to that time every day.,
Nap smart.,
Find your natural sleep schedule.,
Establish a pre-sleep routine.,
Use your bed just for sleep.",How to Have a Good Night's Sleep1," For every single day of the week (weekends included), what time would be best for you to go to sleep and wake up? Keep in mind you want to squeeze in around 8 hours of sleep a night. If that means going to bed at 11, well, that means going to bed at 11.


The idea here is that you'll be training your brain (that's why it has to be an everyday thing). When 11 PM rolls around, you'll enter automatic shut down. And then when 7 AM comes up, up and at 'em you'll be! What times would be ideal for you?






Adults need 7 to 9 hours, on average; however, if you're under 18, you need at least 8.5 -- probably more.;
, Alright, so you've decided that you need to be up by 7 for work, so to get 8 hours of sleep a night you need to go to bed by 11. For starters, cancel all your late night plans, at least for the next two weeks or so. You must go to bed at that time and get up at that time. That's the only way it'll become easy to fall asleep and stay asleep.


Yep, weekends, too. If you spend two days waking up at 10 instead of 7, when Monday rolls around you won't feel so well-rested with that super early wake-up call. Again -- this is just until this pattern is established. You'll get some wiggle room in a bit.

, Alright, so going to bed at 11 and getting up at 7 might happen in a perfect world (or in that ol' philosophical vacuum), but your life is full of noise, friends, kids, and other things that are keeping you from having the schedule you'd like. So when you need a nap to hit that 8 hour mark, do so. But don't overdo it! You'll be up all night. You should get 15-30 minutes to feel well rested. Any more than that, and you could wake up during your REM (or rapid eye movement) sleep, which is when you're in your deepest sleep. If you wake at this time, you will feel very tired when you wake up and not want to get out of bed! So only get 15 minutes, 30 minutes at most!


Napping will be more beneficial to you that sleeping more when you finally do go to bed. Again, you want to keep to that schedule as much as possible. If you're running on empty, nap during the early hours of the day to catch up. Then, resume your schedule as normal.

, On the off chance you have the power to do whatever the heck you want and could sleep till the cows came home if it so compelled you without incurring any consequences (really irritating the boss, for example), experiment with your body's natural sleep rhythms. Don't set the alarm for two weeks and go to bed when you get tired (but within a similar time frame every day). What times do you gravitate to? When does your body cue you for sleep and wakefulness?


Everyone will be a little bit different. After a week or two, you may find that you naturally awaken at 8 AM (or 9, or 10). If you have the ability to do so, keep your schedule as close to your natural one as possible. It's what's best for you!

, Another way to cue your body for sleep is to do activities every night that wind you down and get you in the sleep zone. Experiment with a few -- what's the most relaxing for you?


Try taking a warm bath. Use calming scents, not invigorating ones.






Listen to calming music. This has the added benefit of drowning out the unwanted sounds of the city, too!






Read by soft light. Light is a huge no-no before bed, but if you keep it soft (more about this in a bit), that's fair game. Reading can adequately send you into hibernation mode (with the right book, of course).






Stretch. Loosening up your body feels good any time of day, but it especially feels good before bed. Take them slowly and only do what's comfortable for your level of flexibility.






Do a simple hobby. A simple one, that is. Anything that involves you going on autopilot and sitting in a comfy chair probably qualifies.







, Working in bed messes with your brain -- is it for work or relaxation? Climbing in may just make you run through your list of all the things you have to do. Make sure to keep everything elsewhere. Your bed should just be for sleeping.


Make your bed comfy! Invest in some good pillows, a good comforter, and make sure it's big enough for you to toss and turn as you need to. If a dog or child is taking up your space, assert yourself! You need to spread out."

Focus on something else before sleep.,
Listen to soothing music.,
Count sheep.,
Concentrate on your breath.,
Try other calming activities.","How to Sleep after Watching, Seeing, or Reading Something Scary1"," Before going to bed, try to focus on something less scary—happy even. This will get your mind off whatever it is that scared you and the distraction can help you get to sleep. There are lots of ways to distract yourself to sleep. Think of a happy memory. You may have a happy childhood memory or even a more recent memory that, if you focus on it, could help you distract yourself from whatever fear you are experiencing as a result of watching a scary movie, etc.
Find an object in the room where you sleep to focus on. In your mind, think about how you would describe this object to another person. What is its shape? How would you describe its contours? Does it remind you of anything? What? Where did you obtain this object? From whom? Simple chains of questions like this can get you thinking about something else entirely and soon you will forget whatever scary thing was haunting you long enough to sleep.;
, Whatever kind of music you find soothing, play it softly as you attempt to drift off to sleep. Music can be helpful in getting to sleep either before or as you go to sleep.If you associate silence with whatever scared you, concentrating on soothing music can help distract you enough to get to sleep comfortably.
If you play a musical instrument, try to concentrate on how you might play your chosen soothing music yourself. What key is it in? What is the time signature? Again, going through these kinds of questions can distract you from your fear, and the next thing you know, you'll be waking up!

, It might sound silly, but the same kinds of methods you might use to fall asleep when you aren't scared might help with falling asleep when you are. Counting sheep is simply imagining sheep in your mind's eye as you try to fall asleep, and assigning a number to each one. Mental exercises like this can help you get to sleep.You don't have to limit yourself to sheep — imagine the entire animal kingdom if it helps!
Let your imagination give detail to the animals you imagine, sheep or otherwise. Concentrate on their fleece/fur, hooves/feet, etc. Again, you are trying to distract yourself, so the more detail you imagine, the more likely you are to stop being scared and start falling asleep.

, One way people who meditate enter a tranquil state is by concentrating on their breath as they breathe.This can be an effective way to help you fall asleep as well.


One way to concentrate on the breath to clear your mind of fears and fall asleep is to count breaths. Count each breath you take after you breathe out and you might be able to enter a tranquil enough state to fall asleep in spite of your fear.
Another way to concentrate on the breath is by saying to yourself ""in"" and ""out"" as you breathe in and out. You don't have to speak out loud, but just to yourself say ""in"" as you breathe in, and ""out"" as you breathe out, and so on.

, In addition to deep breathing, activities like meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, or positive visualization can help relax you and calm your sympathetic nervous system, which is heightened due to the fear response. This is the system responsible for your flight or fight response, which can cause your heart rate to increase and cause body to release adrenaline, which will make it hard to sleep. These calming activities can help relax your sympathetic nervous system, which may help you get to sleep.

Try melatonin.,
Try plain antihistamine products that cause drowsiness.,
Tell your doctor if you are concerned that you might have a sleep disorder.",How to Sleep Better5," Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in your brain. The pineal actively converts serotonin to melatonin when it is dark, but when light is present it does not do so, and the melatonin oxidizes back into serotonin.


Consult with your physician about taking melatonin. Taking in the melatonin pills is a natural way to induce sleep, especially if you are physically tired at night but are still unable to fall asleep. However keep in mind melatonin is a hormone (like estrogen or testosterone) and just because it is natural does not necessarily mean harmless.

, These are safe when taken ""without extra ingredients""—–i.e. no pain relievers, decongestant, expectorant, etc., but only for a night or two, as tolerance to them quickly builds.They are not recommended as a long-term, ongoing solution––merely as a way to ""kick start"" you back into a good routine of regular bedtimes, relaxation techniques and managing stress.


Read the labels. Try half or less of the usual dose so that you don’t end up with a ""sleeping pill hangover,"" which will only make your sleep situation worse.
Be lying down in bed when your drowsiness kicks in.
If you use prescription drugs, advise with your doctor before taking anything else. Never thoughtlessly mix medications: with the wrong combination, you could end up mixing medications the way that will do you harm.
Be sure not to abuse any sedative. Do not take those in more than the prescribed dosage, neither beyond the recommended duration.

, Some of the most common sleep disorders are insomnia, narcolepsy and parasomnias. If you are indeed suffering from and are diagnosed with any of these conditions, your doctor will recommend treatment accordingly.

Avoid caffeine.,
Quit smoking.,
Get enough light in your day.,
Exercise.,
Keep dinner light.,
Check your stress at the door.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Have a Good Night's Sleep2," You may think that that can of soda at dinnertime is sufficient time for the effects to wear off, but science says it's not. It can last in your system for up to twelve hours.Heck, that means avoiding it at lunch! But at least science isn't taking away your morning cup of joe.


In case it wasn't implied clearly enough, having loads of sugar isn't great for your sleepiness either. Even if you avoid the soda, stay away from the overly sugary juices and caffeine free but not sugar free beverages, too.

, Not including the other obvious reasons you should quit smoking, nicotine can also interrupt your sleep schedule -- it's a stimulant. What's more, you may wake up in the middle of the night with a nicotine craving. That's no good for your sleep cycles, either., Whether that means going for your lunch in the park or just throwing open all the curtains, make sure your brain gets stimulated by enough daylight. The sun is a natural cue to your brain that it's time to wake up. Need an excuse to walk the dog? There you go!


Remove your sunglasses in the morning for an instant, ""WOAH, I'M AWAKE"" feeling. The more your eyes can soak in, the better. And if you've got a case of the winter woes, think of investing in a light therapy box. It causes your body to release melatonin the same way the sun does.That being said, you want a room that's dark at night. You may find investing in a good set of light-eliminating curtains blocks out that street light and cuts down on your falling-asleep time. Just make sure to throw 'em open in the morning!

, That doesn't mean you have to turn into an Olympic athlete -- just 30 minutes a day of aerobic exercise (the heart-pounding kind) can help you sleep better.Break it up into smaller chunks if that's better for your schedule; you'll still reap the benefits.


If possible, work out in the late afternoon, but before dinner. If you work out within 4 hours of going to bed, it could just rev you up., When you go to bed, you want to neither be hungry or stuffed -- either feeling can keep you awake. So if you tend to eat your dinner late, this is even more important. The alternative is going to bed later, but you don't want that either!


Rich, fatty foods are harder for the stomach to digest. The heavier the food, the more conscious of it you'll be, making it harder to fall asleep. And be wary of spicy foods -- heartburn is just as unpleasant at night as it is during the day, Spending the day frustrated, nervous, irritated or just plain stressed will seep into your night routine. If you have troubles sleeping at night, could this be a cause? What could you do to reduce it?



Manage your stress by taking time to do yoga, a relaxing hobby, or just five minutes to yourself each day to focus on your breathing. If it's a bigger issue, consider seeking professional help.







, There are a variety of problems that are sleep-related, and they're not always crystal clear. If you set up a routine and follow this page, but still can't sleep, you may be best in a doctor's hands.


If you have headaches in the morning or are constantly sleepy, that's a red flag. If you act out your dreams or get tingling sensations, those are signs, too. Anything out of the normal that disrupts your ability to sleep how you'd like may be grounds for asking a professional. Don't take yourself lightly -- your health is of the utmost importance.

If you wake up during the night, don't fight it.",How to Have a Good Night's Sleep3," The more time you spend in front of the TV, your iPad, or your phone, the more your mind will be thinking, ""Wait, is it still daytime?!"" Two or three hours before bed, disconnect. Your body needs to slip into nighttime mode, and these things prevent it.


When you go to read before bed, don't use a backlit product. Your bedside lamp should be fine, but that electronic glow won't do you any favors., If you live in the city, this may be particularly hard to do. If possible, invest in a white noise machine (or a fan that has a white noise setting), to drown out the stimuli. This works on kids and dogs, too!


The poor man's white noise machine is called a radio tuned to a non-existent station. Keep the volume on low and it should be adequately monotonous for you to grow weary and start dreaming. , Or too much of anything else, for that matter! Though alcohol is a depressant and can make you feel sleepy, it can wake you up in the middle of the night. Especially if you have to pee!Research says it disrupts slow-wave sleep. It can cause sleep fragmentation and actually lead to nightmares. Explains all those college episodes, huh?, Unfortunately, no one really agrees on an ideal sleep temperature because there are just too many variables -- the bedding, the sleep clothes, the individual person. However, they do agree that the room should be slightly cool. So whatever that means to you, turn down the thermostat to that. If you're cold, bundle up in the blankets!


Generally speaking, you'll be able to sleep best somewhere between 54 and 75°F (12 - 24°C). It all depends on your specific sleeping circumstance., Eating just before bed can cause a number of issues. Any discomfort, however slight, will decrease your chances of a good night's sleep. The sugar rush can also wake you up! (It's not great for your waistline, either.)


Alright, so you're a pretty big late night snack fan? Then keep it to carbohydrates and tryptophan. That means a small turkey sandwich or some low-sugar cereal or granola. Nothing too heavy!, As much as this article advocates setting a sleep schedule and sticking to it, if you do find yourself waking up at 3 AM and unable to sleep for at least 15 minutes, get up. Do something simple and relaxing and then try again. Your body may just need a small push in the right direction.


Agonizing over falling asleep won't help things. Clearing your mind is imperative to falling asleep, and adding worry about sleep on top of the day's trials is not the way to go. You'll get there eventually.

Leave your door open or closed — whichever makes you feel more comfortable.,
Leave a light on as you try to fall asleep.,
Find ways to self-soothe.","How to Sleep after Watching, Seeing, or Reading Something Scary2","


If leaving your door open lets in a little light or helps you feel less claustrophobic, for example, then leave your door open to help make your surroundings more comfortable as you try to fall asleep.
If closing the door as you fall asleep helps you feel more secure, then leave it closed as you try to fall asleep. Anything you can do to make yourself feel comfortable and safe as you fall asleep will contribute to your ability to fall asleep after seeing a movie that scares you, etc.

, Scary themes in film, television, etc. are often associated with the dark. If you leave a light on as you try to fall asleep, you can help mitigate your fears and fall asleep more easily. Too much light while you sleep, though, can actually prove detrimental to your health,so it's best not to make a habit of it.


Leave a night light or small lamp on. This may give you reassurance without providing too much light and keeping you awake.
A television can provide soft light as you fall asleep too, even if you mute the sound and simply leave the television on for the light it gives off.

, Think about if there are any items you have or rituals that you find comforting. A lucky rabbit's foot you can rub, for instance, or a favorite blanket or stuffed animal to snuggle. Try petting your dog or cat, or hanging a dream catcher. Or maybe you find the act of making a cup of sleepy time tea and sipping it calming and comforting. Identify these self-soothing behaviors (you may need to experiment a little) and use them to help comfort and calm yourself.If you are spiritual, you could keep something that is part of your religion nearby, such as beside the bed or under your pillow. Some items might include a rosary or crucifix, etc.

Read a book.,
Follow up a scary film with a comedy.,
Try crafting.","How to Sleep after Watching, Seeing, or Reading Something Scary3"," Books have a level of detail that makes it easy to fall into their stories and tune out the world around you in addition to your own thoughts and emotions — including fear generated by something scary — and the distraction from scary thoughts is not the only benefit reading before bed offers; there are several good reasons to read before bed in general.


Be sure the book you choose is not scary or you will defeat the book's purpose of occupying your mind.
Choose a book that is happy, funny, or complicated enough that you will occupy your mind effectively.
Consider a book that deals with a topic you find somewhat uninspiring—such as a school textbook or the like, as this alone might put you to sleep.

, Humor is a great way to occupy your mind when you are too scared to sleep. In fact, good humor, including laughter, is good for your health too.The media you expose yourself to before sleep can affect your dreams, so watching something less scary before sleeping can keep you from having trouble sleeping in the first place.
Even better, choose something you are familiar with already — something you have already seen, like a favorite film — to watch after something scary. This will not only interrupt the possibility of the scary media affecting your dreams and your ability to sleep, but it might be comforting to some extent as well because it is familiar.

, A great way to occupy your mind when you are having trouble sleeping is by crafting. The repetition that many crafts require might act as just the mind occupier you need. Some crafts include:


Crocheting
Knitting
Cross-stitch

Remind yourself that what scared you is not real, so it could never happen to you.,
Imagine that a character you admire is there to help you.,
Try to focus on the differences between where you are and the setting of the film or novel that has scared you.","How to Sleep after Watching, Seeing, or Reading Something Scary4"," Thinking about whatever has scared you (whatever was depicted in the movie, book, or otherwise) in this way can be very helpful to overcoming your fear and getting to sleep.


If the film or novel, etc. that has scared you is something that did actually happen, consider the likelihood that something this extreme could, in fact, happen to you. Chances are, it is quite unlikely that you will have a similar experience, particularly after just having been exposed to that situation in a film.

, This could be someone real or made up. For example, pretend a friendly dragon is guarding your door, ready to protect you.


You could even make up ways to make a scary scene in a book or a film look silly or funny, so that whatever has scared you doesn't seem so scary.
Imagine that you and an outrageous or awesome hero defeat whatever is scaring you in the most over-the-top way possible.
Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to get whatever is scaring you out of your head, but consider this: if an author or filmmaker can make these things up, then they are just ideas. Thinking of whatever has scared you in this way might help you overcome your fear.

, Chances are the differences are significant enough that you will be able to alleviate your fears and get to sleep.


For example in the film Paranormal Activity, the characters' bed is right next to the door. If your bed is on the other side of the room, could you experience the same situation?
If whatever has scared you is fictional, then chances are it won't even matter where the action takes place, because the story is made up. With this in mind, you may be able to come to the conclusion that you have nothing to fear.

Ask someone about their day.,
Talk to someone about your fear.,
Sleep with someone else.,
Seek professional help.","How to Sleep after Watching, Seeing, or Reading Something Scary5"," Talking to someone else about their day can distract you from your fears. If it's not too late, chat with or call a friend and say ""I saw a really scary movie today, and I'm still feeling scared. Can we talk for a while? What did you do today?"" Focusing on your friend can help distract, calm, and ground you. Ask your friend to talk about their lives, but to avoid scary subjects.

, Talking about your fears can help alleviate them because sometimes just discussing your fears out loud can help you discover how unnecessary they are.


Talk to a parent. You mother or father might be able to provide the comfort you need.
Talk to a friend. Friends make up an important part of our support systems, so they may provide just the outlet you need to overcome your fears.
Talk to your significant other. Few will be able to understand you and your fears as well as your significant other — husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. Talking to your significant other might also help you overcome your fears.

, You might feel more secure sleeping with someone else — a significant other, parent, friend, sibling, etc.


If you usually sleep with someone else, such as a significant other, ask them to hug you as you sleep for a comforting sense of security.
If you feel comfortable sleeping with a friend, this might also be helpful.
Depending on your age, you may feel comfortable sleeping in a bed with one or both parents or a sibling to help feel secure and overcome your fear.

, If you find you are getting scared easily and cannot overcome your fear even to sleep, you might consider speaking with a psychiatrist.


Speaking with a psychiatrist does have a certain stigma, but don't be too proud — especially if you are losing sleep.
A psychiatrist might be able to offer you medication that will calm you or help you sleep, though these medications should be neither expected nor abused.

Understand what can cause children to suffer from sleep problems and address these problems.",How to Observe Better Sleep Month," This article provides examples of good posture for effective sleeping. It also has great tips on creating a comfortable and peaceful sleeping environment.
, Observe ""Better Sleep Month"" by making a commitment to yourself. Getting better sleep creates a positive attitude, eliminates procrastination, the need to sleep or crash at work or school. Be honest - are you getting enough sleep, or not?, Sit down together and talk about how everyone feels about sleeping in general, and sleeping for each individual. To do this, you might want to look for materials online or in the library to share with your family. Good things to look for include information about:

The amount of time each person needs to sleep
Normal and abnormal sleeping patterns
The problems caused by sleep deprivation (which is accumulative)
The foods, drugs, drinks, and activities that can interfere with good sleep, etc., and the ways that you can replace these with substitutes that won't interfere with sleep.

, Set a time for each ""age group"" that the person belongs in, such as kid, tween, teenager, and adult/parent. Be sure that everyone stays on track with their own goal by not cheating or coming up with excuses like homework, partying, friends, and TV shows. The family may want to set curfews to help with getting ""settled in"" and prepared to go to sleep., And although there are a lot of studies about the minimum hours of sleep needed, we all vary and the best gauge of how much sleep we need is how we feel after sleeping - if we don't feel refreshed throughout the day, our length of sleeping needs adjusting up or down until we find the perfect length for our own body's needs. Make it a goal to find out and stick to your own sleeping needs., Psychologically, your mind should link the words ""bed"" and ""sleep"", and your bedroom should be a place of peace and calm. The wikiHow article on creating a Zen bedroom has some good ideas to help you create a sleeping ""sanctuary"". It is also a good time to assess whether your bedroom is geared to helping you sleep properly. Consider the following:

Is your mattress and bed support comfortable and not too old?
Are your windows adequately covered? Open windows let in a lot of light and can prevent you from sleeping properly. It can be helpful to get curtains or blinds for windows that don't already have them.

, Children can have problems with nightmares and sleep terrors.Ask the kids if they have had bad dreams to draw on paper what they think happened. Ask if they have problems or difficulties sleeping and think about ways to address their disturbances: Are their mattresses and pillows comfortable for them? Do they have nightmares if they think something is in their closet or under the bed? Is something bothering them from outside like a branch scratching the window or a light shining off a tree so it looks like a monster? Fix the problem by reassuring them that there is nothing to be scared of, and by making their room more comfortable and cozy-feeling."

Nap in the early afternoon.,
Keep it short.,
Set an alarm.,
Try a caffeine nap.",How to Nap1," The best time for a nap is between 12pm and 3pm, at which point your melatonin levels are highest and your energy level tends to be lowest.If you struggle with after-lunch drowsiness, grabbing a few minutes of nap can make you more productive and awake in the long-run, as opposed to gulping down an energy drink and trying to press on.


Try to avoid naps after 4pm, especially if you struggle with insomnia. Sleeping too late in the day can make it harder to get to sleep at night, when you want to go to sleep.;
, Grabbing 10-20 minutes of rest is usually best for a middle-of-the-day nap. More than that can leave you feeling drowsier than when you started, meaning you'll have to go through the whole waking-up process for the second time in the day. Alternatively, if you need a serious nap because you slept poorly the previous night, Try to aim for a full REM cycle of 90 minutes. Sleeping for 60 minutes can make you feel groggy for the rest of the day, whereas 90 minutes--a full sleep cycle--can leave you feeling refreshed.

, The idea of nodding off for too long can keep some people from actually falling asleep. Take the stress off and set an alarm, even if it's only 15 minutes from now, to wake you back up and get you back to whatever you've got to do. You can rest easy knowing you're not going to wake up when it's dark outside.


Use your phone to set a quick alarm, or get a coworker to cover for you and knock on your door in 15 minutes. Then return the favor.

, While it may sound counterintuitive to drink a cup of coffee right before you go to sleep, caffeine's got to travel all the way through your digestive tract before you feel that caffeinated jolt--a process that takes about 20 minutes--so some pro nappers swear by the caffeine nap, which times itself perfectly with your wake-up.


Down a quick cup of cold coffee just before nodding off and let the caffeine wake you up sharp and refreshed. It's still a good idea to set an alarm to keep yourself from sleeping too late.

Practice dream recall.,
Do reality checks.,
Recite affirmations.,
Picture your dreams.",How to Have a Wake Induced Lucid Dream (WILD)1," Encourage yourself to remember your dreams by writing them down. Keep a journal by your bed that is only for dreams. You can begin writing immediately, or you can take a minute to sit and remember the dream in its entirety before you begin writing. Practice both strategies to see which lets you remember more.Reread your dream journal frequently.
Check for ""dream signs,"" or repeated themes and objects in your dreams.
Memorize the places, objects, characters, and situations that recur in your dreams.
Write down your lucid dreams! If you manage to have a lucid dream, whether wake-initiated or dream-initiated, it is especially important to write it down.;
, Every hour or so during the day, ask yourself if you are dreaming or not. Even if you are sure you're awake, test it. Try checking the time, putting your hand through a wall, or looking in a mirror. Pinch yourself! Check for dream signs.Learning this habit will give you a tool you can use to affirm when you are dreaming.

, As you go to sleep, silently repeat a phrase about dream recall or about lucid dreams. You might say ""When I dream, I will remember my dream,"" or ""I'm about to dream,"" or ""I will be lucid in this dream."" Focus on this mantra alone while you repeat it in your head., After you have recited in your head, as you are growing sleepy, imagine a dream you recently had, or a dream you would like to have. Picture yourself in it doing something you would like to do, such as fly. Check for dream signs. If you enter a dream in this way, you are having a WILD.Try going back and forth between picturing your dreams and reciting your affirmation.
Be prepared to do this many nights without obvious results. Your initial goal should just be remembering your dreams.
Cultivating the habit of lucidity can take months, or longer if you do not normally remember your dreams."

Think about what you want to dream about ahead of time.,
Remind yourself you want to influence your dream before bed.,
Get enough sleep.,
Consider a smartphone app.",How to Influence Your Dreams1," You can have profound control over your dreams by mentally preparing before bed. If you want to dream about a certain person or topic, thinking about this before bed can influence your dreams.


A lot of people strive to problem solve in a dream. If you're unsure where to go with a project, you may want to use your dreams to seek out a solution. To do so, think of the problem before bed. Visualizing can be particularly helpful here, especially if the problem is not abstract. If it's a personal problem, imagine the person you're having issues with. If you're struggling with an artistic project, picture a blank canvas or blank page.If you want to dream about a certain subject or person, visualize. If you're striving to dream of a deceased relative, try looking at pictures of that person before bed. If you want to dream about a place, look up pictures of that place before bed. Daydream about the person, place, or subject you wish to dream about as you fall asleep. This can help steer your dream in the right direction.;
, Verbally or mentally reminding yourself you want to control your dreams is a huge help when it comes to influencing dreams. Before getting to bed, think or say to yourself, ""Tonight, I want to realize I'm dreaming. Tonight, I want to control my dreams."", Getting an adequate amount of sleep each night is vital to controlling the direction of your dreams. The stage of sleep known as REM sleep is where you tend to have the most dreams. Sleep deprivation results in a lower portion of REM sleep. Strive for 8 to 9 hours of sleep each night. This increases your ability to influence your dreams., Apps available for smartphones can be used to help you influence your dreams. If you're struggling to control your dreams on your own, consider investing in a smartphone app.


The apps work by giving you a choice of a variety of soundscapes. Options include things like ""Peaceful Garden,"" ""Space Shuttle,"" and ""A Trip to Tokyo."" Sounds usually start playing early in the morning, when you're most likely to be experiencing REM sleep. Some apps even detect your movement at sleep and begin to play your chosen sounds when you stop moving around as your body becomes still during REM sleep.Some apps have voiceovers that remind you that you are sleeping. They encourage you to take control of your dream, which can lead to lucid dreaming.Remember, not all apps affect everyone the same. Even if you use the app correctly, you may not be able to influence your dreams effectively."

Fly right away.",How to Fly in Your Dreams," Surround yourself with images of flight. Watch films of different kinds of flying: superhero-style flying, birds flying, and people flying with devices. Look at aerial-view images, and imagine you are flying over the scenes depicted. Look at images of space, and try to imagine flying effortlessly through complete emptiness.


Close your eyes and try to picture yourself soaring over the landscape beneath you.
Spend a few minutes every day imagining sensations related to flight. Imagine bouncing on a trampoline, rushing upwards on a roller coaster, and leaping from a diving board.
Play video games in which your character can fly. Playing video games might help you have lucid dreams, and even if not, the visuals will give you ideas for your flying dreams.;
, Remembering your dreams will help you build an awareness of them, which in turn will help you control them. As soon as you wake up from a dream, spend a few minutes remembering it and writing it down. Read your journal every few days, and take note of repeated themes.When you visualize flying, try to visualize flying over the scenes you most frequently dream.
Start in a position common in your dreams, and imagine floating or leaping into the air.

, During the day, whenever it occurs to you, check to make sure you are really awake. It may feel obvious that you are, but practicing the check while awake will help you perform it in dreams. You can only be fully lucid in a dream if you are sure you are dreaming. Check by trying to float, or fly.Other checks could be looking at a watch twice within a minute. The time rarely shows the same twice in dreams.If you haven't succeeded in floating yet, check to see if you can do something else physically impossible, such as pushing your fingers through a pillow.

, Once you have practiced visualization, remembering dreams, and checking reality, you can start focusing on a particular kind of flight. If you have flown before in your dreams, you might try to replicate that way of flying. Have you soared like an eagle? Floated like a bubble? Swum through the air? Imagine how you are going to fly, and where.


Don't set a timeline for your goal. It can take anywhere from a few days of to a few months to have your first lucid dream. Once you start trying, proceed calmly, and try one method at a time., If your goal is to float, to fly, or to soar in your sleep, repeat that to yourself after you have gotten in bed. Say ""I am going to fly in my dream"" or ""when I dream I will notice, when I notice I'll fly."" Recite your goal in your head, calmly and firmly. Alternate with visualization., Imagine yourself falling asleep and having a dream. Visualize yourself realizing that you are dreaming, perhaps by doing a reality check or noticing something strange in the landscape. Picture yourself flying, then, and imagine every detail you would see.Try going back and forth between picturing your lucid flying dreams and reciting your goal.
If you fall asleep doing this, you may increase your chances of having a lucid dream.

, Look around you for signs of dream strangeness. Do a reality check, such as looking at your watch or trying to float. Are you dreaming? If your reality check fails, tell yourself you are dreaming. Don't get overexcited, or you might wake up.

You might wake up very quickly after the first few times you become lucid in a dream. Practice staying in the dream by focusing on actions in the dream, such as swimming or, yes, flying.

, Notice where you are, and try moving through it. Doing something active is a good way of increasing lucidity, because you notice physical sensations. Try interacting with the landscape. Ride a bike, run, and try smelling and touching and moving things., Jump up in the air and see if you float. You can try jumping off things and flying away. Once you can float, try moving left, right, and in different postures. The trick is to expect it to work. Your first few lucid dreams, you might have trouble believing in your ""ability"" to fly. You might even float a little and then sink. This crisis of confidence is not unusual when you are not fully lucid.
Remind yourself that it is a dream, and that you can fly because it's your dream.
Don't be discouraged if the effort to stay lucid makes you wake up. A first lucid dream is a great sign of future flights to come.

, Once you are fully lucid (sure that you are dreaming, able to interact with the landscape, convinced you are able to fly), you should be able to fly however you want. Push off the ground toward the sky, or take a running start. If you are in a room, fly around the room and then go out the window. Try for outer space if you are feeling ambitious.You may run into repeated obstacles, such as trees or power lines. Each time you do, practice floating around them, or just go through them.If you start to fall, remind yourself that you can fly in your dream.
Remember, you might wake up, but you can't be hurt. It's a dream.

, To stay lucid, focus on your flight and on the landscape. If your mind wanders, so will your dream. Keep your eye on the earth or sea beneath you, or the stars all around you. Try to challenge yourself to notice everything you can about flying: how does it feel, what is the temperature, what color is the landscape, what does it feel like when you fly through a cloud?, If you have practiced lucid dreaming, are good at remembering your dreams, and are used to checking reality, you might be able to do a rarer form of lucid dreaming called wake-initiated lucid dreaming (WILD). This is when you fall asleep with the intention of going directly into a lucid dream. When going into a WILD, you attempt to stay relaxed and attentive enough to remain aware of the process of falling asleep.


Flying is typical in all lucid dreams, but it is even more typical in WILDs, which are often compared to out of body experiences., Set an alarm to wake you up 90 minutes before your normal wake time. Go to bed at your normal time, and get up when your alarm rings. If you had a dream, write it down. Stay up for another 90 minutes, then go back to bed. You can read your dream journal or read other texts about lucid dreaming during this time, if you wish.In bed, lie in a comfortable position and relax yourself with deep, slow breaths.Repeat your goal. ""I am going to go right into a dream,"" or some variation.
Imagine a recent dream. If you woke up from a dream, try to go back to it.
Morning naps of this kind are the most reliable trigger for wake initiated lucid dreams.

, Stay attentive to each part of the process of falling asleep, but don't try to rush it or control it. Keep your eyes lightly closed. Watch for any images that may appear, and play with them if you can. Feel your limbs grow heavy and your heart slow down., Sleep paralysis happens when your body is starting to fall asleep, and causes you to feel as if you are awake, in your own bed, but unable to move. Recognize the first signs of sleep paralysis to avoid becoming frightened when it occurs. Sleep paralysis can be unpleasant, but it's actually a helpful jumping off point for lucid dreams, if used correctly.


You might dream a scary presence into your room during sleep paralysis. Remind yourself that you are dreaming, and send it away.If you want to get out of the sleep paralysis, persistently move your fingers and toes.Float out of your body. If you go into a WILD from sleep paralysis, you can fly around your own room.

, You might enter a WILD just from watching the images that run across your eyelids. As you lie there watching your mind form pictures, start looking for details. If you see a scene, put yourself in the middle of it. Start flying or walking, touch things, and tell yourself you are dreaming.If you start waking up, just tell yourself that you can keep flying. It's your dream.

Just close your eyes and breathe deeply.,
Don't feel guilty.",How to Nap2," Whether you're at work or trying to nod off quickly in your living room, your nap will be more restful and you'll be able to fall asleep more quickly if you make your environment dark. Close the shades, turn off the lights, and curl up somewhere comfortable.

, No lights, no radio, no TV, no distractions. If you're only going to lie down for 30 minutes, there should be a big to-do about easing yourself into slumber by listening to NPR for 15 minutes. Create total silence and get right into the nap.


Hit the bathroom right before you take a nap. No sense in getting interrupted by nature 5 minutes into your break.

, If you have trouble getting to sleep quickly, consider playing some ambient drone music, white noise, or even turning on a fan to create a low-level hum that'll drown out the world. Do whatever will help you get into sleep-land that much quicker.


ASMR videos on YouTube feature soothing up-close whispering or background noises that some people find sleep-inducing. It's an easy and free way to queue up something that'll help you drift off, or at least relax you.

, Try to lie down completely. Even if you're at work or somewhere other than your bedroom, lay on a couch, or even create a soft surface on the floor that you'll be able to recline on and grab a few Zs. It'll be too quick for you to get uncomfortable.


If you're at home, get into bed or lay on the couch. The couch can be a nice alternatively, because it'll be easier to get up and out of, making it seem less like a return to sleep and more like a quick break in your day. It'll be easier to get started doing things afterward if your nap is on the couch.
If you're worried about getting in trouble at work, take your break in your car and put the seat back. If breaks are allowed, but napping at your desk is frowned upon, find somewhere private., Your body temperature drops off as you drift off to sleep, so Try to anticipate that you'll need a blanket or at least a long-sleeved shirt to stay warm enough to fall asleep. A nap isn't long enough to have to worry about repositioning and finding a blanket. Do it before you lay down.

, Don't worry about falling asleep deeply and whether or not you're going to get enough rest before your alarm goes off. That's the best way to have a terrible nap. Even if you don't ""fall"" asleep, closing your eyes for 15 minutes and relaxing is an excellent way to rejuvenate yourself. Don't worry. Relax.


If you're stressed about something and having trouble calming your mind, focus on your breathing. Try to think about nothing but taking deep, restorative breaths. Even if you don't fall asleep, deep breathing exercises are relaxing and effective.

, It's proven that napping periodically throughout the day can make you a healthier and more productive worker. Napping boosts creativity, memory retention, and productivity. Winston Churchill and Thomas Edison were famous nappers. There's no need to feel guilty about resting when you need it. Sleeping in the middle of the day doesn't make you lazy, it makes you proactive.

Meditate.,
Go for a walk after lunch.,

Avoid more eating and caffeine.",How to Nap3," Instead of napping, try giving your brain and body a rest without falling asleep. Create a quiet environment, sit on the floor, and center yourself with deep breathing. Instead of trying to sleep, Try to clear your mind. Focus on watching your thoughts drift through, passing into and out of your mind. Set an alarm like you would for a nap, and reenter the work world rejuvenated and awake without actually sleeping.

, If your energy levels tend to dip after lunch, you're not alone. Instead of trying to sleep, some people find it more effective to get some light exercise to refresh yourself. Instead of napping, pop outside the office for a quick walk around the neighborhood, or even just jog around the building really quickly to get your blood pumping. Getting out in the sun can reawaken you and give you a much needed jolt of energy.


Treadmill desks are increasingly common at some workplaces. If you've got a treadmill at home, set yourself up to walk 'n work.

, The middle of the work day might not be the best time for a whole campaign on Skyrim, but Luminosity offers brain-training exercises that some people find rejuvenating, providing a much-needed break and a good mind-jolt that can help you get through the rest of the day without sleeping. Likewise, crossword puzzles and Sudoku are time-tested brain teasers that some people need to shake up the routine monotony and wake back up.


See if someone else in your workplace likes the same game you do, like chess. Keep a board somewhere and have a game going regularly. Take quick 10 or 15 minute breaks to play a short while and pick the game back up later. It'll break up your routine and get your thinking.

, Trying to combat tiredness with empty calories and more coffee in the late afternoon can have the opposite effect, slowing you down and making you groggier. Despite the claims of energy drink companies as being the cure for your post-lunch dip, taking a quick nap is more effective than filling your body with empty calories. Try to avoid eating more if you're not hungry, and consuming more caffeine.


If you do need a snack, make it something high in protein, like some mixed nuts. Nuts can satisfy your hunger and give you something substantial to burn. Keep some nuts at your desk to munch on when you need a quick snack.

Set the journal close to your bed and keep a pen nearby so that you can quickly write down what happened in the dreams you remember when you wake up. If you leave it any longer, the memory quickly fades.
You could write your dream journal in a word processor on a computer, but it's recommended to write it in freehand. You'll spend more time putting pen to paper, making a larger connection in your brain between the dream and your recording of it.;
, Call this your target dream. Do this every night before you go to sleep. You are imagining the environment you want to experience when you fall asleep.


Draw pictures and write down directions, using lots of detail. In fact, put in as much detail as possible; get to the point where you think you may have too much detail. Even the smallest things are important.
The trick is to tell yourself what you are going to experience when you dream, so that you can become aware of your dreaming state while you dream.
Don't watch television or movies before you go to bed, or you may dream about what they involved instead of your target dream.

, Every morning, as soon as you wake up, write down your dream. Even if you didn't have the dream you anticipated having, write it down. See ""Tips"" below for recommendations on what to record.


Like an athlete practicing a routine, you are training your mind to recall its dreams. The more consistently you train your mind to recall its dreams, the sharper and more heightened your dreams will become.
Write down any parallels you remember between your target dream (the dream you wanted to have) and the dream you actually had. Be as specific as possible. Think about the similarities and differences. When interpreting the dream, keep in mind that dreams do not offer exact images or answers to your questions the way that your brain does in a waking state. Instead, the brain communicates by means of metaphors.

, Every night, right before going to bed, go through it as many times as possible to set it fast in your head.


After reading something one or two times, your brain thinks it knows what the words mean and gets lazy: it only processes the outline of the words and not their sense. Be sure to fully grasp the sense of your target dream so that you feel you know it inside and out before you go to sleep.

, Relax. Think of specific details.


Daydream about the images from your target dream as they appear in your subconscious. Your subconscious will generate a lot of images that have nothing to do with your target dream, so cycle through the ones that are irrelevant and try to focus hard on relevant images.
Imagine the sounds and dialogue in the background of your target dream; really try to hear them in your mind. Try to feel the sensations associated with your feeling, mood, etc.
If no sounds or images appear clearly, try reading through your target dream again in your dream journal.

, Do this in the first-person point of view, from start to finish. Imagine what it would seem like through your eyes.


Try to walk through the target dream in the exact sequence you expect it in your dream.
Think hard, but maintain a calm posture. Do not get tense. Just relax.

Go to sleep with these images and sounds in your head. Remember to record your dreams, whatever they are, when you wake up.

, A reality check is when you ask yourself: ""Am I awake, or am I dreaming?"" This will ultimately help you tell the difference between the dream world and reality when you are asleep.


Reality checks call attention to a fundamental difference between dreams and reality: in dreams, states are fluid; in reality, states stay the same. In dreams, text will change into different words; trees change color and shape; clocks tell time backwards instead of forwards. In reality, text stays the same, trees stay rooted in the ground, and clocks move clockwise.
A good reality check to perform, both in reality and dreams, is looking at text. Suppose a poster in your room says ""Justin Bieber."" Turn away for a minute, and look at the poster again. If it still says ""Justin Bieber,"" the reality check says that you're awake. If you turn away, then look at the poster and it says ""Selena Gomez,"" the reality check will tell you that you're dreaming.

, When you're having a dream and realize that you are having a dream, then you start to be able to control most of what happens in your dream.


When you make the leap and realize you're dreaming, try to calm yourself down. If you get too excited about finally being able to control your dreams, you might accidentally wake up from excitement.
Try small activities at first. Again, this is about staying in control of your excitement and not accidentally waking up. Even mundane things like cooking food, climbing a ladder, or skateboarding can be fun when you realize you're in full control.

, A lot of people enjoy flying, swimming deep into the ocean, and time travel. Try moving huge objects, passing through walls, or even telekinesis. The dreams that you can have are limited only by your imagination!

Get up early.,
Stay up for an hour to an hour and a half.,
Lie down and relax.,
Spend ten minutes or so thinking about your dream.,
Encourage hypnagogic imagery.,
Feel your body fall asleep.,
Enter your dream.,
Check that you're dreaming.",How to Have a Wake Induced Lucid Dream (WILD)2," Set your alarm an hour to an hour or an hour and a half before your ordinary waking time. Go to bed at your usual time. If you don't have an ordinary wake time, try to estimate how many hours you normally sleep. When you go to bed, set an alarm for that number of hours, minus an hour to an hour and a half. , When you wake up early, stay awake for 90 minutes. You can do what you want with this time, but there are certain activities that may help you have a lucid dream. Spending time reading about lucid dreams or reading your dream journal can be helpful. Some people report reading, writing, or meditating of any sort is effective, while others might eat breakfast or snack and have an ordinary morning., You can lie back down in bed or wherever you wish to dream. Try lying in corpse pose, or however you feel most relaxed. Take ten deep, slow breaths. Remember, your goal is to ease yourself into a dream while remaining conscious of the process of falling asleep., Once you have been awake for at least an hour, return to bed or to the place you would like to have your lucid dream. There, you may recite something to yourself such as ""I will have a lucid dream"" or ""I am about to enter my dream again."" Imagine a recent dream, or slowly invent a dream you would like to have. Picture it in layers, starting with the outline and filling in the details.Alternatively, try counting yourself to sleep. Say to yourself ""One, I'm dreaming, two, I'm dreaming, three…""Another method is to relax each part of your body systematically. Start with one hand or foot and slowly relax each muscle., As you start to sleep, you might see flashing and color. Watch it dimly, without focusing, as focusing might wake you up. Keep your eyes gently closed. Scenes may form. Let them go by you., As you drift off, your goal is to remain conscious of the transition to sleep. Be attentive to the auditory and physical phenomena of falling asleep. You may feel vibrations, which mean that your limbs are beginning to sleep. You may hear a buzzing.Keep your eyes lightly closed and continue to be attentive to images and sounds from within.

, As scenes form, try picturing more details, or interacting physically with the elements you are seeing. Imagine doing something active, such as riding a bike, climbing stairs, or swimming. Involving your senses in the dream will help you move from your physical body into your dream body., Perform a reality check, such as turning the lights on or off, checking the time, or pushing your fingers softly through something that should be solid. If the time is impossible to read or is inconsistent, or if you can't change the lighting, but can poke your fingers though your hand or the wall, you are in your lucid dream."

Notice the onset of sleep paralysis.,
Relax into it.,
Float, sink, or sit up out of your body.",How to Have a Wake Induced Lucid Dream (WILD)3," Sleep paralysis occurs when your body is starting to fall asleep, and causes you to be temporarily awake but unable to move. Recognize the first signs of sleep paralysis to avoid becoming frightened when it occurs. Sleep paralysis is unpleasant for most people, but it's actually a helpful jumping off point for lucid dreams, if used correctly.


Feel for buzzing, numbness, heaviness, or the sensation of falling. A feeling of heaviness or numbness moving up or across your body can also signal the onset of sleep paralysis.
Listen for unpleasant or repetitive buzzing or droning. This tinnitus-like auditory hallucination may mean you are falling asleep.You may hear words, such as your own name, inside yourself or very nearby. Try not to be startled., Welcome sleep paralysis as a platform for lucid dreaming. Embrace your awareness of your body's descent into sleep by noticing every stage. If you become frightened, remind yourself that it is sleep paralysis, and that you are falling asleep. It is common to hallucinate a presence during sleep paralysis, often a menacing or oppressive one.Remind yourself that you are dreaming, nothing can hurt you, and you are in charge.
If you are frightened, and embracing your dream isn't working, try gently wiggling your fingers or toes., Move from paralysis to lucid dream by moving dreamily. Instead of trying to move your limbs, which feel paralyzed, try instead to float out of your body, sink through your bed, or sit up out of your body.Alternately, tell the room around you to change. Say ""Now I am transporting to the beach,"" or some scene you frequently dream.


If there is a presence in the room, tell them you are dreaming and you want to be taken to the dream.Expect that they will take you, and they will.

Try to control sounds and smells when you're sleeping.,
Know that sleeping on your stomach can affect dreams.,
Use cheese.,
Learn how moods can affect dreams.",How to Influence Your Dreams2," The sound and smells of your sleep environment can affect your dreams. If you hear a movie in the background, for example, your dreams may take on certain themes of the film. Try to control your sleep environment as much as possible to influence your dreams as you choose.Avoid unwanted background noise. This might mean turning on a white machine. If you want peaceful dreams, consider playing soft, soothing music or other gentle sounds in the background while you sleep.Smells can also affect your sleep. If someone is cooking bacon early in the morning, you may dream of bacon. Try to fill your room with smells that remind you of what you want to dream about. For example, maybe you want to dream of childhood Christmases with your family and you associate the smell of pine with that time period. Try to get a pine-scented air freshener. Smell is very heavily linked to memory. If you're striving to dream of a certain person, dabbing some of the perfume or cologne they wore in life on your wrists before bed can help., If you frequently sleep on your stomach, understand this can affect your dreams. As your breathing may become short, you're more likely to have sexually charged dreams. If you do not wish to have an erotic dream, avoid sleeping on your stomach., Certain cheeses can affect dreams. If you eat cheese, you can use cheese to your advantage when it comes to influencing dreams.


One study showed some correlation between cheese and dream types with a variety of participants. Blue cheese tended to result in bizarre dreams. Cheddar cheese resulted in people dreaming of celebrities. People eating Red Lancashire cheese had peaceful dreams about past memories and events.If you use cheese to alter your dreams, take precaution. Cheese can sometimes cause indigestion, resulting in sleeplessness. If you choose to eat cheese before bed, consume a small amount., Your mood can have a profound effect on your dreams. If you are sad or depressed, the colors in your dreams may be muted or subtle. If you go to bed anxious, you might dream of disasters like tornadoes or floods."

Develop ways to check that you are dreaming.,
Stay in bed for a moment when you wake up.,
Consider keeping a dream journal.",How to Influence Your Dreams3," Dreams can sometimes be very close to real life. Therefore, it can be difficult to realize you are dreaming. Develop ways to recognize a dream from reality.


Time is one way to differentiate a dream from reality. Time is notoriously inconsistent in dreams. For example, a clock may say it's 8 AM and then moments later claim it's 2 PM. If you're unsure whether or not you're dreaming, try looking at a clock.Reading in dreams is often difficult. Many people cannot read in dreams. People who can read in dreams often report the text is gibberish, word salad, or hieroglyphics. Trying to read a book or magazine can help you recognize that you are dreaming., As many people want to influence dreams as a way to come to terms with a problem, it's important that you remember your dreams. Do not jump out of bed, as removing yourself from REM sleep can cause you to forget your dreams. Try to stay in bed for a while and remember your dreams. Start out by trying to recall the emotions that accompanied your dreams. This can help trigger your remembering other details., A dream journal is another way to help remember your dreams. Record your dreams in as much detail as possible after you get out of bed. Having a dream journal can help you revisit your dreams later to interpret their possible meaning."
"
Dream through your fear.,
Look past your hallucinations.,
Lie mostly still.,
Try different methods.,
Stay lucid.",How to Have a Wake Induced Lucid Dream (WILD)4," If you feel frightened by any of the hallucinations you have while entering a WILD, or if your dreams are frequently nightmares, you may be too fearful to take control of your dream and may instead wake yourself up. Train yourself in confidence while you train for lucid dreaming. Recite affirmations such as ""I am safe in my dreams"" or ""I choose my own dreams."" When you practice reality checks, remind yourself that you are safe: you are either safely awake, or safely dreaming.


If you run into something frightening as you fall asleep or dream, remind yourself that you are a trained dreamer.
Wake yourself up if you want. If you are in an out-of-control bad dream and your techniques aren't working, wake yourself up. Similarly, if you are too frightened by sleep paralysis, wake yourself up. Wiggle your toes and fingers, and try coughing, blinking, and making small movements., The visual and auditory hallucinations that occur when you are falling asleep lucidly can be captivating, distracting, and even frightening. You may find you wake yourself up by paying too much attention to flashing or swirling colors, sounds you hear, or phantom presences. Practice detachment as you fall asleep. When you see or hear something and you aren't fully asleep, give it a mental nod and relax further into your dream., You may find you wake up while attempting a WILD because of twitching, itching, or built up saliva. When attempting a WILD, lie mostly still. Lie in the position you would like to fall asleep in. Lie on your back, or lie the way you normally do when falling asleep. If saliva builds up, swallow it: you do this reflexively when you are asleep.If you have an itchy feeling early in your meditation, gently scratch it. As you progress, you will want to avoid waking yourself up with movements.
To avoid scratching, detach from the feeling. Imagine it is something else. Visualize the itch as a plant rubbing you, for instance.
Don't open your eyes. You may be tempted to check your progress by looking at a clock or looking around the room. Keep your eyes closed. Your ""dream eyes"" will open on their own., If you have been training for months without a lucid dream, try changing your methods. Adjust your sleep schedule and experiment with different wake up times. Try sleeping without an alarm on days you don't work.. If you have been trying many methods, every day and night, try using just one, or none at all, for a few nights. You may be trying too hard.

, It's easy to get excited in a lucid dream and wake yourself up, or get sucked into the dream's reality and lose lucidity. Focus on a lucid dream once you have it. Engage physically with your surroundings. Pick things up, move things, do physical activities, and look around. Remind yourself that you are lucid every minute or so.If you find yourself doubting, waking up, or losing control, focus on the dream.
The more you engage with the world you find yourself in, the more you can prolong your lucid dream.

Remember these conditions are rare.",How to Treat Itchy Breasts," Dry skin is a major cause of itchy breasts. Itching from dry skin often involves more areas of your body than just your breasts. Treating your current outbreak of dry skin can also help to prevent future problems.Dry skin can develop in patchy areas. The patchy areas tend to have flakes or the area may tend to peel. Areas of dry skin can feel tight or stretched, especially after exposure to water.
Patchy areas of dry skin appear darker or duller than normal skin tissue and may appear wrinkled when compared to the smoother texture of healthy skin.Dry skin on your breasts may tend to get worse in the colder and dryer months of the year.;
, Lengthy showers or baths and using hot water temperatures can cause your dry skin problem to linger, or possibly get worse.Bathe or shower in warm water and avoid prolonged exposure to hot water.
Use unscented soaps that have a high fat content or those that contain glycerin. Avoid perfumed products like bubble baths. Use a loofah sponge or gentle bath cloth and avoid scrubbing your skin harshly.
When showering, consider applying soap to your breasts only every two to three days. This will allow your body’s natural oils to be replenished.Pat your skin to dry off after bathing or showering and avoid harshly wiping with a towel. Apply an unscented moisturizer immediately after your bath or shower.
An alternative to applying a moisturizer after your bath or shower is to apply a bath oil product immediately before you get out of the shower. Let your body dry naturally without wiping harshly with a towel, especially around the areas of your breast that are the itchiest. Bath oil products are slippery so take precaution not to fall.
If you are an athlete or go to the gym regularly, take quick showers after your workout and bring your own soap.
Limit your use of antiperspirants and perfumed products due to their ability to dry the skin. Deodorant products are less drying to the skin than antiperspirants.

, This includes protection from the sun and harsh chemicals. Wear clothing that covers your breasts, or any exposed areas of your skin.Use a sunscreen product that contains a moisturizer.

, Choose products that contain at least one of the following ingredients: glycerin, urea, sorbitol, lactic acid, pyroglutamic acid, lactate salts, and alpha hydroxyl acid.Always use unscented skin care products that are designed for sensitive skin.Apply a waterproof moisturizer before you swim, such as a thin layer of petroleum jelly. Shower and apply a moisturizer as soon as possible after swimming.
Thick, creamy moisturizers, such as Eucerin and Cetaphil, may be more effective at moisturizing than thinner lotions. Petroleum jelly is also thick enough to moisturize your skin well, and is very cheap.

, You may be routinely exposing your skin to products that contain chemicals or additives that can worsen your condition.Choose laundry products that are labelled for use in people with sensitive skin. Select products that are dye- and fragrance-free.
Try using fragrance-free fabric softener. Fabric softener can help to reduce the harsh effects of washing clothes in areas that have hard water. However, many fabric softeners can trigger allergic reactions, so if switching to fragrance-free softener doesn't help, eliminate fabric softener altogether.
Rinse your clothes thoroughly by using an additional rinse cycle to be sure all detergents and unwanted chemicals are removed.

, Drinking plenty of water every day provides the fluids your body needs to stay healthy, including the largest organ in your body, your skin.Use a humidifier in the winter months to keep more moisture in your skin., Select bras that have less padding and are not made with stiff and scratchy lace. If possible, wear bras made of cotton. Go without a bra whenever you can.Wear tops, blouses, or dresses that are loose fitting and made of comfortable and breathable fabrics such as cotton.
Be sure your bra fits properly, including sports bras. Chafing and itching can be caused by bras that do not fit well.Remove your sports bra as soon as possible after exercising to reduce the moisture and sweat that stays against your breast tissue.
Do not sleep in a bra. Wear sleepwear that is comfortable, breathable, and loose fitting.

, Trying not to scratch an itchy area is a difficult thing to do, but important in preventing complications.Scratching the area causes the skin to become even more irritated, leads to more itching, and can possibly lead to an infection if the skin is broken.
Apply gentle pressure with the heel of your hand, gently massage the area, or place a cool cloth against the area to reduce the itching sensation.
Many people scratch at night without realizing it. Try putting band-aids over your fingertips when you sleep, or sleep with socks over your hands to help avoid scratching.

, You can buy hydrocortisone cream over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Apply the cream topically to your skin for minor itching. You can usually apply it 1-4 times per day.If your symptoms do not improve within a day or two, call your doctor.
Call your doctor immediately if you develop side effects such as redness, swelling, or pus discharge.
To apply, wash your skin gently and pat dry. Then apply the cream in a thin layer and rub it in gently.

, The most common places for fungal infections to occur on the body are in warm, moist places where there is little light. Armpits, the groin area, and under the breasts are common areas for fungal growth.The inframammary fold is the area under the breast. This area is well-suited for fungus to grow. The most common type of fungus that causes an infection under the breast is a yeast called candida.
This is the same yeast, or candida, that causes vaginal infections and yeast infections in the mouth called thrush.
There are no serious long-term consequences of a candida infection under the breast, other than a darkening of the skin which can be permanent, and the possibility that the condition will spread.

, The rash associated with a fungal infection under the breast can vary in appearance. The rash occurs in areas where the breast tissue folds against the skin of the upper stomach or chest area.Most often the rash will be pink to red in color, itchy, have areas that are growing outward, and contain small bumps, especially along areas where there are hair follicles, such as under the arm.
The rash is sometimes referred to as an intertrigo rash.Intertrigo is an area of the skin that is inflamed, and occurs in places that are warm, moist, and where two skin areas press against each other. The rash associated with intertrigo can be caused by a fungus, bacteria, or prolonged exposure to moisture.
There is usually an odor present. The odor is caused by persistent moisture and the breakdown of healthy skin tissue.

, Treating a fungal infection with associated intertrigo under the breasts can be accomplished by altering the environment that is promoting the growth of the fungus, and by using an antifungal medication prescribed by your doctor.To alter the environment, take steps to avoid the skin folds pressing against one another and prevent the accumulation of moisture.
Be sure you have a bra that fits well and prevents your breast tissue from resting against the skin of your upper stomach or chest area.
If needed, use a dry and clean cloth, or sterile dressing pad, placed at the base of your bra to absorb any excess moisture and prevent the skin layers from touching.
Wear a clean bra each day. Also wear loose fitting tops that are made of breathable fabric, like cotton.Remove your bra whenever possible. Place a clean, dry, towel or dressing pad between the skin folds.
For men, avoid wearing tight shirts and shirts made of fabric that causes you to sweat more. Consider wearing cotton undershirts to help absorb moisture.

, Be sure you thoroughly dry the area under your breasts after bathing.


It may be helpful to avoid dressing immediately after bathing. Take time to allow fresh air to access the affected areas of skin.
Lie back on the bed or stand in front of a fan to allow the skin folds to be thoroughly dried before dressing.

, 5% aluminum acetate is available over-the-counter as either packets or tablets that are dissolved in water to make a solution commonly known as Burow’s solution.This is a solution commonly used to treat skin irritations, and acts as a drying agent to help prevent the rash from spreading. As with all products, check with your doctor if you have any concerns about treating the area at home. Seeking medical advice is always an appropriate step.
Mix the packets or dissolve the tablets according to the package directions, and apply the soak topically to the rash area.
Soak a clean cloth in the solution and apply to the rash area for 15 to 30 minutes. Once you have soaked a cloth in the solution and applied it to the affected skin, do not re-use it.
Repeat the procedure three times a day. Once you have removed the cloth from the area, allow the area to thoroughly air dry before getting dressed.
Discontinue use if the area becomes more irritated, or if there is any sign of an allergic reaction to the use of the topical soak. Signs of an allergic reaction include a rash beyond the area being treated, hives, blistering, or excessive itching.
Continued use of the product beyond what is recommended in the product literature may result in excessive drying of the skin.

, Using antifungal agents that are available over-the-counter can help to treat the area. Common topical products available without a prescription include clotrimazole and miconazole cream.Stronger products used to treat fungal infections of the skin, including nystatin topical powder, require a prescription., If the topical approaches do not work within a few weeks, the condition gets worse, or the itching interferes with your daily routine, see your doctor.


You may need a prescription strength product, or possibly an oral medication in combination with the use of topical products., In some cases, either the mom or the infant may develop a candida yeast or fungal infection, and pass the infection back and forth until both parties are effectively treated.If breastfeeding, the rash from the candida will be along the area of the nipple on mom, and will be in the infant’s mouth, commonly known as thrush.Treat the thrush in the infant, and the subsequent candida infection on the breasts, by seeking medical attention. See your doctor or your pediatrician to obtain a prescription strength medication to resolve the condition in both mom and infant., To effectively treat breast eczema or an outbreak of psoriasis on your breast, you will likely need a prescription strength corticosteroid product.Topical corticosteroid products, including those available over-the-counter, should not be applied to your breast area without first consulting your physician., Psoriasis outbreaks occur anywhere on the body, including the breast tissue.Psoriasis patches appear as thick, silvery, sometimes reddened patches, that are itchy and often painful.
If you develop a psoriasis outbreak on your breast area, contact your doctor before you apply any medication. Be sure your doctor intends for you to apply medications you may already have on your breast tissue.

, Breast eczema outbreaks most often occur in the area of the nipple.The area often appears as an itchy, reddened area, and is sometimes accompanied by crusty formations and drainage from the sores.

, Due to the similarity in the rash associated with breast eczema and a more serious condition, Paget’s disease, a medical examination is warranted.


Take care to keep the area dry, and avoid harsh soaps or perfumed products.

, In addition to topical products, your doctor may prescribe oral medications to help treat any infection that may have started, as well as medications that can help control the itching.Topical products that may be prescribed include corticosteroids that reduce inflammation and promote healing, as well as newer agents, called calcineurin inhibitors. The newer agents are only used in people with severe and repeated flare-ups of eczema.
Examples of the newer agents include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. These agents help your skin to heal, and prevent further flares of eczema or atopic dermatitis. These medications alter the way your immune system works.

, With outbreaks of both psoriasis and eczema, regardless of where they form on your skin, scratching the areas can lead to complications.Scratching can cause the condition to spread beyond the immediate area, can cause further skin irritation, and possibly lead to infection.
Many people scratch at night without realizing it. Try putting band-aids over your fingertips when you sleep, or sleep with socks over your hands to help avoid scratching.

, This type of cancer is very rare. It occurs in only 1% to 4% of all types of breast cancer, and often presents with itchy breasts.Inflammatory breast cancer involves a tumor in the breast and is often accompanied by changes in the skin and breast tissue surrounding the tumor. The changes in the breast tissue appear suddenly.
The skin changes that occur include itching accompanied by pain, swelling, and redness of a specific area of the breast, located just above and surrounding the location of the tumor.
The breast tissue becomes dimpled, resembling the skin of an orange.Watch for other warning signs of inflammatory breast cancer including feeling a firm or hardened area under the skin, a feeling of warmth or heat to the touch, and a discharge from the nipple.
The nipple may also be inverted, or pulled inward.

, Paget’s disease is very rare, developing in 1% to 4% of all breast cancers. Paget’s disease is a condition that looks very similar to psoriasis or eczema of the nipple and may be itchy.The disease begins in the nipple or areola part of the breast, and often appears as a red, scaly, and sometimes itchy, rash. The nipple may also look flat or produce discharge.Most people with Paget's disease of the breast have at least one tumor in the breast, and about half of them have a lump that can be physically felt during a breast exam.
In 90% of women that have the tumor beneath the nipple area, the cancer has spread and is considered to be invasive.
Paget’s disease is diagnosed by tissue biopsy. It is sometimes diagnosed late since the symptoms present like common skin conditions.

, Keep in mind that both Paget’s disease and inflammatory breast cancer are very rare, developing in less than 4% of all breast cancers.


Seek medical attention as soon as possible if you have symptoms that may indicate the presence of either disease.
Most breast conditions that cause itching do not involve serious medical conditions.

Calm down quickly.,
Ground your senses.,
Learn how to breathe calmly.,
Don't dwell on your nightmares.",How to Cope with Nightmares1," When you wake up from a nightmare, chances are you will be in somewhat of a panic. Take the following steps quickly to help you break this panic and start to ground yourself:Sit up quickly after awaking from your nightmare.
Sit on the edge of the bed, with your feet on the floor.
Focus on your surroundings. Start naming the things in your room.
Calmly reassure yourself. Tell yourself you are safe and fully awake.
Try to sleep again. If you can't after fifteen minutes, do something relaxing until tired.;
, While you can reassure your mind that you are awake and safe, it is also important to reassure your senses and body as well. Ground each sense by taking the following steps:Taste. Try eating something strong, like a mint. Avoid sugar as it will affect sleep.
Touch. Touch something with a rough texture or cold temperature like an ice cube.
Smell. Keep a comforting and strong smell next to your bed such as coffee or cloves.
Sound. Choose a comforting sound or listen to gentle music.

, Calm breathing can help lower heart rate and reduce any state of panic or stress that a nightmare can have on you. By following the steps of this technique, you can greatly improve the speed at which you recover after a nightmare:Breathe in through your nose, with mouth closed, and hold for five seconds.
Exhale slowly. Mentally think of a word such as “relax” or “calm” as you exhale.
Hold for five seconds and then inhale again.
Practice this breathing throughout the day, before bed, and after any nightmare.

, Right after you wake up from a nightmare, try not to think about what it was you experienced. Sitting in bed dwelling on the nightmare will only increase anxiety, which will make it difficult to fall back asleep, as well as increase the likelihood of another nightmare.


Wait until the morning to analyze and examine your nightmares.
Get out of bed and ground yourself immediately. Try making a cup of tea and reading a calming book in low, soothing lighting.
Reassure yourself that you are safe, check that the doors and windows of your house are locked.
Remind yourself that although frightening, the nightmare is over and it was only a dream.

Journal your nightmares.,
Talk with trusted friends and family.,
Look for any causes of your nightmare.,
Visit your doctor.,
Try approaching your nightmares with art.",How to Cope with Nightmares2," When you are awake, during the day, write your nightmares down in a journal. Keeping a good record of the details, themes, images, and dialogues of your nightmares will help you examine them and possibly find any causes in your waking life.


Get as much detail as you can when you write your nightmares down.
Look for any relation to your waking life. For instance, having nightmares about someone yelling at you or hurting you might be related to a hostile work environment.
Writing down feelings, even if you cannot remember why you felt that way in the dream. Knowing that in your dreams you are feeling lost is important.

, Tell anyone you trust about your nightmares. The support of your friends and family can also help bring comfort to you and reduce the likelihood of nightmares occurring.Talking with others about your nightmares can help you recall details and come to better examine your dreams for any links to your waking life.
Only speak to people you trust and feel safe describing your nightmares with.

, Nightmares can be caused by a number of activities and removing or altering these behaviors can put an end to the nightmares. Examine your daily actions and look for anything that might be causing your nightmares, which may include:Extreme stress in your life. Any source of stress in your life can carry over into your dream life and cause nightmares. Look at your daily routine and see if any part of it is overly stressful. Try to improve that situation, making it less stressful, and see if your nightmares are reduced.
A traumatic event or PTSD. If you have experienced a traumatic event in the past, this may be responsible for your nightmares. Generally, nightmares stemming from trauma will have elements of that trauma within them and are often repetitive.
Stopping or starting a new medication. Talk with your doctor to learn more about any prescriptions you may have been given, or ordered to end, to learn if they might cause nightmares as a side-effect.
Abusing alcohol or drugs. Alcohol and drugs can interrupt sleep mechanisms and patterns, resulting in nightmares. Examine your consumption of substances such as these and their possible relation to your nightmares. Speak with your doctor for help ending substance abuse.

, If nightmares persist more than once a week or are preventing you from getting good sleep, call your doctor and schedule an appointment. Prepare yourself by expecting the following questions and procedures during your visit.When and how often do your nightmares occur?
How well are you sleeping? Do you often awake suddenly and have difficulty returning to sleep?
Does the nightmare cause intense fear and anxiety?
Have you recently been ill or under a great deal of stress?
Which medications are you currently taking? Do you use any drugs or alcohol? How often and how much? Do you use any alternative medicines or therapies?
You may be given a physical and a neurological/psychological examination.

, This may not be the best approach for people with severe trauma, such as PTSD without professional guidance. But for many, examining dreams through expressive art can help you examine, understand it, and express it enough to let it go. This includes:

Expressive art: Painting, sketching, sculpture
Music: Composing, music
Performing art: movies, dance, theater
Creative writing: poems, short story, novel, blog.

Learn what Imagery Rehearsal Therapy is.,
Write your nightmare down.,
Make your changes.,
Mentally rehearse your new script.",How to Cope with Nightmares3," If you have nightmares as a result of trauma or reoccurring nightmares, you may want to employ imagery rehearsal therapy. Imagery rehearsal therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of nightmares.Imagery rehearsal therapy involves the active rewriting of your nightmare.
Imagery rehearsal therapy has been proven effective and is a simple technique.
Talk with your doctor or therapist to learn how imagery rehearsal therapy can work best for you.

, Recall your nightmare while you are awake and write it down as if it were a story. Try to capture the narrative of the nightmare and any details you feel are relevant.Don't be afraid to recall your nightmare. Remember why you are revisiting it.
Be as honest and accurate as you can in your recollection.

, Take charge of your nightmare and rewrite any part of it you want. The main idea here is to transform the negative aspects of your nightmare into positive aspects. By restructuring your nightmare, you eliminate the original mental cause of the nightmare. Try changing the following aspects:


Change the ending to a positive one.
Change the overall theme.
Change the story line to take the dream to a better place.
Change any details you would like.

, Actively imagine the nightmare during the day, this time with the changes you have made. Rehearsing your nightmare in this way will help tell your mind that the positive new narrative you have crafted is to replace the old nightmare.Do this for at least once a day, for a few minutes.
Repetition of this re-imagining can help the effect.

Gather your supplies.,
Weigh the tray first.,
Put the bowl on the tray and fill it the brim with warm water.,
Submerge your breast in the bowl of water.,
Weigh the tray filled with water.,
Subtract the weight of the empty tray from the weight of the water-filled tray.,
Convert the weight of the water to the weight of your breast.,
Weigh the other breast.",How to Weigh Your Breasts1," The most accurate at-home method of weighing your breasts is to submerge them in a bowl of water filled to the brim set upon a tray. Your breasts will displace some of the water into the tray. You can then weigh the water-filled tray and subtract the weight of the tray. You're left with the weight of the water, which you then convert to the weight of breast tissue. This experiment can easily be performed at home with these supplies:


A kitchen scale. A regular bathroom scale won't be as accurate; you need a scale that measures down to fractions of an ounce.
A bowl large enough to hold one breast. Choose a medium or large-sized bowl that easily fits one of your breasts.
A tray to catch the water displaced by your breast. Make sure it's a waterproof tray large enough to hold the bowl, with sides high enough to hold the water without spilling any. A lightweight baking pan would also work.;
, You'll need to know the weight of the empty tray before it gets filled with water. That way you'll be able to subtract the weight of the tray and end up with an accurate number for the weight of the water your breast displaces. Set the tray on the scale and write down how much it weighs.

, The temperature of the water won't affect the experiment, but warm water will feel a lot more comfortable against your skin. Test the temperature of the water to make sure it's comfortable.


It's important to fill the bowl all the way to the brim for the most accurate measurement. If you don't fill it all the way up, your breast won't displace as much water, and you'll end up under-mesuring the weight of your breast.

, The positioning will be slightly awkward, but try to lower yourself over the bowl so that one of your breasts is fully in the water. The water level should come up to your chest and rib cage, the area surrounding your breast. Your breast will displace water that will drip onto the tray.Don't wear a bra, since this will affect how much water is displaced. A bra will add girth to your breast as well as absorbing some of the water.
Make sure the water is caught in the tray. If any spills, the measurement will be inaccurate.

, Place it on the kitchen scale and write down the weight. It should be significantly higher than the tray alone. For example, if the empty tray weighed 8 ounces, the water-filled tray might weigh 42 ounces.

, This will give you the weight of the water alone. For example, if the water-filled tray weighs 42 ounces, subtract the weight of the empty tray, 8 ounces, to come up with 34 ounces. This is the weight of the water your breast displaced.

, Breast tissue has a different density than water, so it's necessary to use a conversion method to figure out the weight of your breast. Multiply the weight of the water by .9 to find out how much your breast weighs. Using the example above, you'd multiply 34 ounces by .9 to come up with 30.6 ounces., It's common for each breast to be slightly different. Repeat the steps with your other breast to find out its weight. Be sure to fill the bowl of water completely to the brim to end up with an estimate as accurate as possible.

Make prevention a group effort.",How to Recognize Signs of Breast Cancer," Mark on a calendar when you will do your BSEs. Aim to do a BSE once a month, preferably five to seven days after your period has ended.Doing regular BSEs will help you get to know the ""normal"" feel of your breasts. Hang a BSE reminder in your bathroom or bedroom so you do not forget. Also, consider starting a journal to record your observations. Plan to do your BSE in a room with good lighting.;
, Stand with your hands on your hips and look at the mirror. Look to see whether your breasts are their normal size, color, and shape. If you have any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor:


Noticeable swelling yet you are not menstruating at the moment
Dimpling, puckering, or bulging skin
Inverted nipples
Nipples that have moved
Redness, rashes, or tenderness., Look for discharge from your nipples. If you have discharge, check its color (yellow, clear) or consistency (bloody, milky).Be aware of nipple discharge that happens when you are not squeezing your nipple. Also tell a doctor if you have clear or bloody discharge or discharge only from one breast., Lie down. Bring the pointer, middle, and ring fingers of your right hand together. Feel your left breast with the pads of your three middle fingers in a small, circular pattern.Your circles should have a circumference of 2 cm.Feel your breast from your collarbone down to your abdomen. Then beginning in your armpit area, move from the side to the middle. Repeat the process with your opposite hand to opposite breast. To ensure you feel the entire area, use a pattern like vertical rows. Next, stand up or sit down and repeat these steps. Cover your breast again. Many women prefer to do this last step in the shower.Feel for lumps or any other changes. You should report any detectable lumps to your doctor.
You should cover your breast with light, medium, and firm pressure in each circle. In other words, do a circle with light pressure and then repeat the same area with medium and firm pressure. You need to apply light pressure to notice tissue nearest to the skin’s surface. Medium pressure allows you to feel more deeply and the firmest pressure helps you to reach deep tissue near your ribs., Some studies show no increased detection of cancer from self-exams, but instead increased worry and biopsies. Talk with your doctor about BSEs — she may recommend you simply become familiar with your breasts so that if changes occur you will know., Early detection of breast cancer is vital. If you possess any high risk factors, be sure to perform regular BSEs. Seek a mammogram if you feel any lumps or are high risk and over age forty.

, Women are more likely than men to get breast cancer. Additionally, if you have had close relatives (e.g. mother, sister) with breast cancer, your chance of having breast cancer increases.There also are inherited gene mutations that predispose one to have a higher risk of breast cancer. These gene mutations are BRCA1 and BRCA2. Five to ten percent of breast cancer cases result from gene mutations.In the United States, white women are most at risk of getting breast cancer.Some ethnic groups are more prone to mutated BRCA genes. These include people of Norwegian, Icelandic, Dutch, and Ashkenazi Jewish descent., There are many traits of your health history that can impact your risk profile for breast cancer. Women who have had breast cancer in one breast are more likely to get it again. People who have undergone radiation to their chest area as a young child also carry a higher risk. Additionally, other medical facts, like your first period occurring at age 11 or younger, can increase risk. Starting menopause later than average is also a red flag. Taking hormonal therapy after starting menopause increases risk as does never having been pregnant., Obese people have a higher chance of getting breast cancer.Women who consume three alcoholic beverages per week also are fifteen percent more likely to get breast cancer.Smokers and particularly women who started smoking prior to the birth of their first child also have an increased risk for breast cancer., During your annual gynecological exam, your doctor will check your breasts for lumps or abnormalities. If she detects something irregular, she might recommend that you have a mammogram.


If you do not have health insurance or funds to visit a doctor, there are likely resources in your area to help you get preventative care. Planned Parenthood offers consultation services and can direct you to a mammography provider.If you do not know where to look for help, contact your local Department of Health or call the national cancer line at 1-800-4-CANCER. They can refer you to appropriate help for your situation. You could be eligible for cost-free or inexpensive mammograms.
See the official US government listing of low-income clinics: http://www.findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/Search_HCC.aspx.

, Once she turns 40, a woman should get a mammogram every two years until she is 74.The earlier you detect breast cancer, the easier it will be to survive. You may have heard that a mammogram is painful, but the pain is momentary and no worse than getting a shot. Plus, it can save your life.


If you are at high risk, talk to your doctor about how often you should get a mammogram. If you have a high risk and are under 40 years of age, it is possible your doctor will recommend a mammogram already.

, Paying attention and knowing your breasts well is the best thing you can do to detect symptoms of breast cancer. If you have any concerns about what you find in your BSEs, see a doctor immediately.

, Keep your friends and family healthy by arranging a party every year that culminates in everyone getting a mammogram together. This way you can remove the fear from the experience and help each other remember.


Consider saying: “I know a lot of women don’t get the mammograms because they’re scary and they can hurt a bit, but I’d love to find a way that we can make it fun. Plus, we’ll get some great girl time!”

Find out your bra size.,
Determine the weight of your breasts by cup size.",How to Weigh Your Breasts2," The diameter and volume of standard cup sizes can be used to calculate the estimated weight of breasts. If you know your typical cup size, you can get a relatively accurate picture of how much your breasts weigh.The issue with this method is that bras are not custom-made to fit the individual breasts of a woman. Two women who both wear a size 36B might have very different breast weights.
There is no common standard manufacturers use to determine bra sizes, so it can be tricky to know your true size. The best way to use this method is to try on bras in many different stores and figure out your average size.

, Once you're fairly sure where you fall on the spectrum of bra sizes, use the chart below to figure out how much your breasts might weigh. These weights were determined by calculating the volume of the breast using the average underwire size and cup diameter of common bra brands.



Bra sizes 32A, 30B, 28C = about .5 pound per breast

Bra sizes 34A, 32B, 30C, 28D = about .6 pound per breast

Bra sizes 36A, 34B, 32C, 30D, 28E = about .7 pound per breast

Bra sizes 38A, 36B, 34C, 32D, 30E, 28F = about .9 pound per breast

Bra sizes 40A, 38B, 36C, 34D, 32E, 30F, 28G = about 1.2 pounds per breast

Bra sizes 42A, 40B, 38C, 36D, 34E, 32F, 30G, 28H = about 1.5 pounds per breast

Bra sizes 44A, 42B, 40C, 38D, 36E, 34F, 32G, 30H, 28I = about 1.7 pounds per breast

Bra sizes 44B, 42C, 40D, 38E, 36F, 34G, 32H, 30I, 28J = about 2 pounds per breast

Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss breast weight.,
Realize that breast health is unrelated to weight.",How to Weigh Your Breasts3," Breast weight is not typically taken in the doctor's office, but if you have concerns, discuss the matter with your doctor and see if he or she can help you come up with a more accurate number. Your doctor will be able to address your needs and answer any questions you have about the health and size of your breasts.

, Breasts, like other body parts, are a little different on every person. Rather than comparing the weight or size of your breasts to that of others, the best way to stay healthy is to attend to the needs of your individual body by doing the following:


Get regular pap smears and mammograms according to the recommendations for your age group.Conduct regular self-examinations so you'll notice if something changes.Wear a bra that fits instead of one that's too constricting or not supportive enough.

Continue to breastfeed your baby even if Mastitis is present.,
Gently massage the breast before nursing and apply warmth to the breast.,
Focus on the affected breast when Mastitis is present rather than sticking to the rotating breast schedule.,
Pump the affected breast slightly before beginning to nurse.,
Express some breast milk with your hand or pump with a machine if your baby refuses the breast or will not empty it.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Avoid stress as much as possible.,
Eat nutritional foods and increase your fluid intake.,
Apply cold compresses to the breast.,
Insert a raw cabbage leaf into your bra to aid in soothing the tender breast and assist in unclogging the duct.

,
Eat raw garlic several times a day if it does not upset your baby’s tummy.,
Speak to your health care provider about taking Echinacea.,
Add extra vitamin C to your diet if your baby is not bothered by acids.,
Visit with your health care provider to determine if an antibiotic is necessary.,
Continue to take your antibiotics even if you are feeling better, otherwise, the Mastitis may return.

,
Take pain relievers that are safe during breastfeeding as specified by your health care provider.

,
Contact your health care provider if you fail to see any improvement after a few days, or if the discomfort and symptoms worsen.,
Understand that if you cannot bring the infection under control, there is the possibility that the infection can lead to an abscess in the breast.,
Speak to your doctor about continuing to nurse during the healing process if you had a procedure done.",How to Treat Mastitis,"


Some mothers mistakenly believe that they can pass the infection onto their baby via milk, so they try to limit nursing.
Fortunately, the infection is not passed on to the baby and nursing should continue. In fact, you should try to nurse more often than usual to assist in emptying the problem breast as much as possible.

, This will aid in increased milk flow.


Place warm compresses on the affected area. Use warm, damp washcloths or a heating pad if necessary.
Try standing under the warm water stream in the shower, directing the water to the affected area as best as possible. Adjust the temperature to be as hot as you can stand it.

,


Allow baby to start on the unaffected breast for a minute or two just to get the milk flowing to the breasts.
Switch your baby over to the breast with Mastitis. Allow baby to empty the breast as much as possible before switching back to the healthy breast.
Do this for every feeding until the Mastitis is gone, then switch back to alternating breasts as normal.

, This will relieve some of the hardness in the affected area and make it easier for baby to latch on.

, The flavor of breast milk can be slightly changed due to the infection and baby may not want to nurse from it.

, Your body is trying to fight an infection. Allow it to do so. Nap with baby as often as possible.

, Find ways to relax when not sleeping.


Read a book.
Watch a favorite television show or a movie.
Call a friend.
Take a stroll.

, Add vitamin supplements if you are not already taking them on a daily basis. These can help speed your recovery and lessen the severity of your symptoms.

, This will help bring down painful inflammation.

,, Garlic acts as a natural antibiotic and can speed healing.

, This is known to aid in the body’s ability to fight infection.

, Orange juice, citrus fruits, green peppers and broccoli are excellent immune system boosters.

, If your fever continues to rise or you feel worse as time goes on, chances are you will need an antibiotic treatment.;
,,, You may require a different medication or further assistance to rectify the situation.

, If this happens, your health care provider will have to drain the abscess or remove it surgically.

, The healing process takes approximately one week. Rarely, women are advised to stop breastfeeding all together due to complications.

Try medication.",How to Relieve Breast Engorgement," It is caused by an imbalance between milk supply and infant demand. In other words, your breasts are producing more milk than is being consumed by your baby.


Breast engorgement can occur in the early days of breastfeeding, as your body is establishing how much milk needs to be stored in order to feed your baby.
Breast engorgement can also occur when you are weaning off of breastfeeding, and even night-weaning. As you diminish your baby's consumption of milk, your breasts will take some time to adjust and to produce less milk.It can also occur when your baby is sick, as he or she will tend to feed less during these times.
Finally, breast engorgement is common in women who have chosen not to breastfeed, as their breasts adjust to the fact that they will not need to continue producing milk.;
, When your breasts first begin to make milk after you deliver your baby, they may feel warm, swollen, and heavy, even uncomfortably so.Symptoms of prolonged breast engorgement after the first 2-5 days include:


breasts that are swollen, firm, and painful
flattened, hard areolas (the darker part of the breast around the nipple). This can make it more challenging for the baby to latch on.
breasts that seem shiny, warm, hard, or slightly lumpy to the touch (in more severe cases)
a slight fever and/or enlarged lymph nodes in the armpits, If you find the soreness of your breasts is worsening, or you notice redness or lumpiness to the skin, or pain or burning when feeding, you may have plugged milk ducts or ""mastitis"" (an infection of the breast). Plugged milk ducts generally means symptoms of redness, lumpiness, and/or increased pain in the breast secondary to too much milk. It is basically a more serious form of breast engorgement, and you are also more prone to developing an infection in the breast when you have poor milk flow (called ""mastitis"").Plugged ducts can also occur for other reasons (where the duct is truly blocked by something else, other than just milk), but this is less common.
If you suspect you may have plugged milk ducts or mastitis (both have similar symptoms, but mastitis usually has the added symptom of a fever and/or chills), it is important to see your doctor promptly for treatment. You may need to take an antibiotic.
If you do not treat mastitis promptly, it can turn into an abscess that could require disfiguring surgery to treat.

, Breast engorgement results from over-production of milk or under-feeding by the baby. The easiest, and quickest, way to alleviate breast engorgement is feeding your baby from the breast that is engorged.Most doctors will advise a new mother to nurse her baby every 1 to 3 hours. Breast engorgement can be diminished if you follow this schedule.
Feed your newborn whenever he is hungry. Don't attempt to put a newborn baby on a feeding schedule.

, This allows maximum delivery of milk to your baby. Gently massage the sore spots to soften them. You can do this before and during feeding. A warm compress applied before breast-feeding can also help.Don't apply a warm compress for more than 5 minutes. If your engorgement is due to edema (fluid retention), using a warm compress for too long could make the problem worse.
Many women use a pump or their hand to ""express"" (remove) excess milk before beginning a breastfeeding session. This will make it easier for your baby to latch onto the breast, and will maximize the amount of milk he can drink (which will in turn reduce pressure and discomfort in your breasts)., This allows you to keep to your daily routine, and you can store this breastmilk in the freezer for another time.Your breasts will have gotten used to producing a certain amount of milk each day, so it is important to stick to your routine of emptying your breasts regularly in order to prevent them from becoming more engorged.
Oftentimes, pumped milk that is stored can come in handy at other times. For example, if you have to be away from your baby for any reason, someone else can feed your baby the pumped milk during your absence and it will ensure that he stays on the same breastfed diet.

, Taking a warm shower triggers something called the ""let-down reflex,"" which actually causes some of the excess milk to leak out. This, in turn, softens your breast and reduces discomfort.Allow the spray to start at the top of the breasts and adjust your body so it works its way down. You can also massage them at the same time. This will be a bit painful at first, but it will ease the tenderness and hardness in the breasts.
You can also fill two bowls with warm water. Place them on a stable surface, such as a table or countertop. Lean over and allow your breasts to soak in the warm water for a few minutes.

, Apply the compress several times for up to 15 minutes. Bags of frozen vegetables work well for this method. Make sure to wrap the compress or bag in a light towel to protect your skin., Cold cabbage leaves applied against your breasts is an age-old natural remedy that can reduce breast engorgement.


Place the cold cabbage leaves around your breasts and leave them against your skin for approximately 20 minutes at a time, as needed.Note that cabbage leaves should not be placed against broken or irritated skin, as this can worsen the condition. Only use this method if you have simple breast engorgement with no other complications.

, Tight-fitting bras can compress the lower part of the breast to the rib cage. This has the effect of trapping milk in the lower milk ducts and will aggravate the problem., You can get ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) over-the-counter at any pharmacy. These are safe to use while continuing to breastfeed your baby.Follow the directions on the bottle, and use as needed to reduce pain and discomfort in your breasts.

, Consult your family doctor or a lactation consultant (someone who helps mothers learn to breastfeed) if you would like additional support and guidance in how to manage breast engorgement.


If you have increasing soreness, hardness, redness, and/or discomfort in your breasts, especially if associated with a fever as well, seek help from your physician promptly. It could be an infection of the breasts (called ""mastitis"") from blocked milk ducts, which requires antibiotic treatment.

, If you have started weaning from breastfeeding, or have decided not to breastfeed in the first place, it will take your breasts a few days to adjust to this. Normally it takes between 1-5 days for your breasts to adjust to the reduced (or absent) demand for milk, and to begin producing less (or not producing milk altogether). Until then, here are some strategies to try:


applying cold compresses to the breasts
wearing a loose-fitting bra
trying cold cabbage leaves
pumping or using your hand to remove a little bit of the excess milk (note that it is important not to remove too much, or this will stimulate your breasts to produce more milk; however, a small amount is okay).

, Although a little bit of pumping if you are in a lot of pain can sometimes be of help, in general it is a bad strategy as it encourages your breasts to produce more milk. This can exacerbate the problem rather than solve it.


Whether you are weaning off of breastfeeding, or not breastfeeding to begin with, trust that if you give your breasts the signal ""less (or no) milk is needed right now"" by resisting the urge to pump, they will adjust to produce only the required amount of milk.

, These include:


Heat or warmth to the breasts, as this encourages milk production.
Stimulation or massage to your breasts, as this also encourages milk production., Use ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed to alleviate pain and discomfort in the breasts. These are available over-the-counter at any pharmacy."

Find out if they really and truly hate you.,
Dig into the reason they dislike you so much.,
Look back on your past few interactions.,
Address the problem head on.,
Not everyone is going to like you -- deal with it.,
Avoid the person to avoid the hatred.,
Move on.",How to Get Someone Who Hates You to Like You1," Hate is a strong emotion, one very few people feel casually. Do they actually hate you? Or are you giving yourself too much credit as a force in their life?That said, the following signs could mean there is some beef between both of you.


Intentionally making your life difficult.
Ignoring your words and conversations.
Talking trash about you behind your back.
Throwing cruel language and insults your way at every opportunity.;
, Just be straightforward and ask them. 90% of the jerks harboring hateful feelings won't have much to say back to you -- they're just angry people. When confronted, they'll stammer, hem, and haw, because there is no good reason to hate you. But, if they do respond, you'll have a chance to make things right:


If they are uncomfortable, just flash them your pearly whites and say, ""It's all right. Let's just try and be better friends in the future.""
If they tell you a reason why, say ""That's good to know. I'm working on being a better person, and not doing ________."" If you can give them a concrete step, like you're trying to make less of a mess in the work kitchen to be more respectful, let them know.
If their reason is unreasonable or dumb, just admit ""that not everyone's perfect,"" and move on. Don't waste any more breath trying to tame a jerk who doesn't want to be tamed.

, Did you blow them off? Forget a favor? Insult them casually? Maybe you've been a bit braggadocious lately without even knowing it -- complaining about a the maid being late when they can hardly afford a broom, for example. Really dive deep into your personal interactions with them (you're not perfect either!) and then try and make it right by bringing up any slights.

, Once you know what the issues is, you have to make an effort to fix it. Don't get snippy and fight them (""I was not rude to you, you were just being a sensitive wuss!""), smile, apologize when needed, and make a plan to do better next time. Tell them that you know you’ve had your disagreements, but that you just wanted to be straight with them and work things out. Most people will respect this. If they don’t, at least you tried to be mature about the situation.


Be direct without being pushy. For example, say one of your coworkers hates you because you backed into his car a few weeks ago. ""Listen, I'm really sorry about your car. I made a mistake, and I shouldn't have been so careless. I feel horrible, and I want to find a way to make it up to you.""
If you still don't know what caused the problem, say something like, ""Hey, I'm not sure what's up, but I've noticed that you're kind of upset with me. I hope I haven't done something to piss you off. What's up?""

, In fact, this is a good thing! If you're living your life and staying true to yourself, you're not going to get along with all six plus billion people on the planet. If you have tried everything else and the person still hates you, then that person kinda just sucks. There is no way you're changing that, and why would you want to? You can feel good knowing that you put in an effort to change their mind -- it makes you the much bigger person.Hate is an extreme, passionate emotion. If someone is so invested in disliking you, then they likely have other things going on in their life that have made them so angry and upset.

, This isn’t always possible, but put them out of your life if you can. Remove the problem from your life. There’s not benefit to having someone like that around, so block their calls, ignore them on your way in the door, and banish their existence from your brain. Most bullies and haters will run out of material once you stop interacting with them. Don't give the vampires any more blood to suck.

, Make friends with other people. Plenty of other people will like you, and some people will hate you. That’s just the way the world works. Move on and start fresh with someone new. Don’t let it grind you down, because that's what the haters want. You've already risen above them by trying to make things right. Leave the rest of the haters in your metaphorical moral dust.Haters gonna hate. Truer words have never been spoken.

The research found that you have a 24% higher risk of getting breast cancer if you smoke.
Former smokers have a 13% higher risk of getting cancer compared to those that never smoked.
Another study supports those numbers and adds that women who started smoking at an early age have a 12% increase in their odds of getting breast cancer. Women that started smoking before their first pregnancy have a 21% increase in risk.
This may all sound like risk factors that you can’t control based on your smoking history, but you can control what you do now to decrease your odds. If you are a smoker, take steps to quit.

, Being overweight has been shown to increase your risk of breast cancer.The odds of breast cancer are even greater if the weight gain, or obesity, developed after menopause.
Women that gained their weight after menopause have a 30% to 60% higher risk of developing breast cancer.Oddly, women that were overweight or obese before menopause have a 20% to 40% less likely to develop breast cancer compared to women of healthy weight.
The reasons behind the weight changes and timing are not entirely clear but are thought to be related to hormonal fluctuations.

, There are many benefits to being physically active, one of which is tied to reducing your risk of breast cancer.The general guidelines for physical activity include 150 minutes each week of moderate aerobic activity.
If you are already exercising, the suggested amount of vigorous activity to reduce your risk is 75 minutes each week of aerobic activity in addition to strength training at least twice weekly.
Start exercising now. Some research suggests that women that have maintained an inactive lifestyle for many years may be at greater risk., The longer you breast-feed, the more you reduce your risk.While the reduction in risk is relatively small, it is still a way you can improve your odds against developing breast cancer.You can reduce your risk by 4.3% for every 12 months you breast-feed. That includes one child or several.

, There is an increase in the risk of breast cancer in women that take hormone therapy for the symptoms associated with menopause.Research suggests that taking combination hormone therapy, meaning you are taking both an estrogen product and a progesterone product or that both types are contained in the same pill, increases your risk of breast cancer.Work done shows that the increase in risk also includes more cases of invasive breast cancer leading to more cancer deaths in women that take combination hormone therapy, even for a short time.
The other type of hormone therapy contains estrogen only. This form also increases your risk but only if you take the hormone therapy for an extended amount of time, such as 10 years or more. If you do not have a uterus and take estrogen alone, it may actually reduce your chances of breast cancer.
The good news is that once you stop taking hormone therapy, your risks drop back to normal in about three to five years.
If you feel you need hormone therapy to control menopausal symptoms, talk to your doctor about reducing your dose. This is one way to limit your exposure to hormone therapy.

, Exposure to high doses of radiation to the chest area has been linked to an increase in the incidence of breast cancer.Some diagnostic testing equipment, such as computerized tomography, known as CT scans, use high levels of radiation.
While diagnostic testing is critical in determining the source of medical problems, talk to your doctor about other methods that might work as well as CT scans in order to limit the exposure of radiation to your chest area.
Be sure to wear the recommended protective equipment if you work in an area that involves radiation treatments.
Some jobs require exposure to environmental pollutants such as chemical fumes and gasoline exhaust that can also be dangerous. Be sure to understand the proper steps to take in order to keep yourself protected from exposure to environmental pollutants.

, There are many benefits to eating a healthy diet, including controlling your weight which is a way to reduce your risk.


A diet that is rich in fruits and vegetables may be helpful in preventing breast cancer although study results are inconclusive in showing a clear protective effect.
A slight improvement in breast cancer survival has been noted with a consistent diet that is considered low-fat.
The benefit of the low-fat diet was reported as significant in the survival of women that were already diagnosed with breast cancer.The dietary changes included steps such as eliminating butter, margarine, cream, oils included in salad dressings, and fatty meats such as sausages.

, Genetics play a significant part in your risk of developing breast cancer.Estimates suggest that between 5% and 10% of cancers develop due to genetics.
Even though the family history is important, the majority of women that develop breast cancer do not have a family history at all.
Depending on your personal family history, your doctor may recommend that you have the blood test to determine if you are carrying the identified genes.
The most common genes that have been identified as contributing to breast cancer are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. 45-65% percent of people who inherent these genes develop breast cancer prior to age 70.
Ask for a referral. If your doctor is not able to perform the genetic testing, ask your doctor for a referral to a geneticist that can review your family history and make specific recommendations regarding the possible need for the genetic testing.

, Several variables increase the odds of developing breast cancer that are related to age.First of all, just aging is considered a risk factor. The older you get, the greater the chance of developing breast cancer.
Beginning your period before 12 years of age is a risk factor for breast cancer later in life.
Experiencing menopause at an older that average age is considered a risk factor. The average for menopause is about 51 years of age.

, Some relationships have been established that may increase your risk based on pregnancy.Women that have never been pregnant are considered to be at an increased risk.
Delivering your first child after age 35 is considered to increase your risk of breast cancer.

, Breast cancer is a complex disease that make it impossible to predict those that will or will not develop it, even when all risk factors are considered. Additional factors that have been identified as contributing to the chance of getting breast cancer include the following:A personal history of breast cancer.
Radiation treatment or exposure to the chest area as a child or young adult.
Having dense breast tissue. A certain kind of hormonal replacement therapy (Duavee) may decrease this risk.A personal history of ovarian cancer.
Getting pregnant for the first time after the age of 30.
Never getting pregnant.
Taking a drug called DES, or diethylstilbestrol, which was prescribed to prevent miscarriage during the years between 1940 and 1971.
Being exposed in the uterus if your mother took the same drug while pregnant with you.

, Early awareness and rapid treatment are key variables in improving your odds of a total recovery should you develop breast cancer. Understand the signs and symptoms in order to monitor yourself for changes. The signs and symptoms of breast cancer include the following:A lump or thickening that you can feel, and it feels different than the tissue around that area.
The lump or hardened area of tissue can be anywhere in your breast, including deep within the tissue and up against your chest wall and in the area under your arm.Bloody drainage or discharge from your nipple area.Change in the size of your breast.
Change in the shape or appearance of your breast.
Dimpling of the skin of your breast.
Redness or a pitted appearance of the skin anywhere on your breast, similar to the skin of an orange.
Swelling, warmth to the touch, or a redness or darkening of the breast tissue.A painful spot or area that persists.
A change in your nipple including an inverted nipple.Peeling, flaking, or scaling, of the areola, which is the darker colored area that immediately surrounds your nipple, or anywhere on your breast.

, Knowing what is normal for you is important in detecting changes early.The effectiveness of breast self-exams have been studied. The results show no difference in the early detection of breast cancer identified in women that performed breast self-exams as compared to those who did not.
The research also showed that more false alarms leading to biopsies and additional testing occurred in the group of women that performed the breast self-exams.
It is very important for you to know what is normal for you. Many women still choose to follow the recommendations provided to perform breast self-exams. Self-awareness by the established steps for self-exam, use of your own method, or routine observations of your breast and nipple tissue, is important in detecting early changes that may be significant.
Anything that changes from what is normal for you warrants medical attention as soon as possible.
Review the recommended method for breast self-exam. Follow those guidelines or develop your own method to routinely monitor for changes using a schedule that you can keep up with.
If you choose to perform breast self-exams following published guidelines, then know the most recent recommendations for how to do it., Keep in mind that you should perform the exam lying down as opposed to standing.The breast tissue tends to spread out more evenly, allowing you to perform a more thorough exam.
Position yourself flat on your back and place your right arm beneath your head.
Use the pads of the three middle fingers of your left hand to examine your right breast.
Use circular motions, about the size of a dime, and overlap your circles to cover all the tissue of your right breast.
Follow an up and down pattern while incorporating the circular motions.
Use lighter pressure to feel the tissue closest to the surface, medium pressure allows you to feel a little deeper, and firm pressure helps you feel the tissue closest to the chest wall and the ribs.
Use the dime-size circular motions with each of the three levels of pressure in a methodical up and down pattern to cover the entire breast. Examine tissue up to the neck and collar bone area, include the middle part of your chest where your sternum or breastbone is located, and include your underarm areas.
Switch arms and hands, and repeat to examine your other breast.
It is normal to feel a ridge along the lower curved area for each breast. If you are unsure of something you are feeling, check to see if the same thing is felt at the exact same place on the other breast. If you feel the same thing in the same place on both sides, then it is probably perfectly normal.

, Stand in front of a mirror in an area with good lighting and press down on your hips.Pressing down on your hips alters the position of your chest wall and helps to make any breast changes more obvious.
Look for any changes in size, shape, or contour of your breasts. It is not uncommon for one breast to consistently be slightly larger than the other.
Next look for changes in skin color or texture, such as redness, dimpling, and scaly, flaky skin, especially around the nipples.
Slightly raise one arm and feel under your arm for any abnormalities, lumps, or changes. Raising your arm only slightly helps to make any changes more noticeable to touch and gentle pressure.
Do breast self-exams with implants. It is possible to effectively perform breast self-exams with implants.
Talk to your surgeon so you know where the edges of your implants are located.

, Breast tissue is naturally lumpy.Lumpy breasts are usually nothing that indicates a problem, especially if the consistency of the lumpy feeling is the same throughout the breast and both breasts feel the same way.
If you notice a lump or hardened area that feels different than the rest of the lumpiness in your breast tissue, contact your doctor as soon as possible.

, Many women have developed unusual lumps in their breast tissue in their past.Most cases resulted in a thorough exam that resulted in finding an actual lump but it was benign, or was not cancer.
If you had a lump in the past and it turned out to be benign, do not assume that this new one will also be benign. See your doctor for an examination as soon as possible.

, Liquid that leaks from your breast is alarming but is not usually a sign of anything serious.Squeezing your nipple can result in some leakage. This is almost always completely normal.
See your doctor if your nipple is leaking liquid without squeezing.
If the drainage is occurring from only one breast, have your doctor examine you.
Drainage that is bloody or clear warrants seeing your doctor for evaluation.
There are reasons other than cancer that can cause your nipples to leak, most often being the results of an infection. Any leakage from your nipple should be examined by your doctor.

, See your doctor immediately if you notice any potential symptoms in your breast.Even if you have had a recent exam and/or a recent mammogram, any changes you notice should be examined by your doctor immediately.
Breast cancer cells divide more rapidly than the cells in normal tissue. Once you become aware of an abnormal area or change in your breast tissue, seek medical attention as soon as possible.

, Having a mammogram is an essential part of early detection.According to the American Cancer Society, the scientific evidence supporting the use of mammography to detect early breast cancer is stronger than ever.
A mammogram is not 100% perfect. Even a mammogram can miss small growths that are cancerous and the test may identify some areas that turn out not to be cancerous.
The American Cancer Society recommends that women 40 years of age and older have a yearly clinical breast exam by a doctor and a yearly mammogram.
This recommendation holds for the duration of life provided there are no health conditions that place the person at risk or make it necessary to perform mammograms on a case-by-case basis.
Examples of some medical conditions that might need special consideration include women with congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and moderate to severe dementia.
Women in their 20’s and 30’s are recommended to undergo routine clinical breast exams. They rarely undergo mammograms unless advised to do so by their doctor.
Depending on your personal risk factors, your doctor may advise that you have more frequent clinical breast exams and mammograms.

, Depending on your age and risk factors, you will likely be advised to have a clinical breast exam every one to three years.A clinical breast exam is done routinely during your regularly scheduled gynecology appointments.
Your doctor or other qualified healthcare professional that is performing the clinical breast exam will visually examine your breast for abnormalities in size, shape, condition of the breast tissue, and the nipple area.
The doctor will then use the tips of his or her fingers to gently feel all around along the entire area of your breasts.
The doctor will be checking for any abnormalities within your breast tissue such as lumps or hardened areas. If any lumps or hardened areas are located, the doctor will further press on your breasts to determine if they are connected to deeper tissues.
The areas under both arms will be examined in the same manner.
During the clinical breast exam, ask questions so you can improve your ability to perform a similar self-exam at home.

, Some women with combined and more serious risk factors may need frequent and more intense screening.Talk to your doctor about your lifetime risk and recommendations. As new scientific information becomes available, the associated recommendations sometimes change.
The current, 2014, recommendations include the use of both mammogram and MRI studies to be done each year in women that are considered to have a lifetime risk of greater than 15%.
Many variables go into the assessment to determine your lifetime risk. Talk to your doctor to be sure you are properly evaluated and comply with the screening procedures recommended.

, An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a tool that identifies abnormalities in the breast that may have been missed in a mammogram.Only women determined to have a higher lifetime risk are recommended to undergo both an MRI and a mammogram. You still need the mammogram because it can detect abnormal areas that the MRI screening might miss.
A breast MRI is done by lying face down on a platform in a standard MRI tube or tunnel-like device.
The platform that you lie on contains special equipment that allows your breast tissue to be exposed through openings as opposed to compressing the tissue which happens with the mammogram. The platform has the sensors needed to perform the imaging study.
It usually takes about an hour to perform a breast MRI. It is important that you remain perfectly still during the procedure.
A breast MRI requires an injection of a contrast material injected through a catheter into a vein of the arm just before beginning the procedure.
Breast MRI is expensive so it may be helpful to go to a doctor or clinic that is accustomed to working with moderate to high risk women so they can take the best approach with your insurance company or third party payer.

Smile.,
Use a comfortable level of eye contact.,
Tilt your head towards the other person.,
Give a quick eyebrow flash.,
Mirror their positioning.,
Don't assert your dominance.",How to Get People to Like You1," The absolute simplest way to get people to like you is to smile genuinely. People crave being around others that are fun and happy because it's contagious -- you'll make them feel good just by being present. Smiling is the first indicator (and the most obvious) that you are a person they probably want to be around. Smile and you're in.


Remember, if you act like you are happy, you'll probably feel happier. Don't force a fake smile -- others will be able to detect it -- but do know that if you're in not so great of a mood, sometimes faking it can fool your mind into feeling better.;
, This one hopefully comes naturally. Eye contact is one of the simplest ways to show someone you're paying attention. When you're watching TV, you look at it, right? So when you're talking to someone, shouldn't you do the same thing?


Too little eye contact can be seen as rude. Where else are you looking at? What is distracting you? Why isn't the conversation at hand good enough to warrant your attention? If this is a problem of yours, simply be aware of it. That's all you need to change it!
Too much eye contact can make the other uncomfortable. It may come off as you staring the person down. If you're aware that intense eye contact is a problem of yours, make it a point to fidget once in a while. Odds are the conversation also involves hands, food, or some other thing to draw your attention away -- but only briefly!

, The science behind this one is that evolutionarily, tilting our head exposes our carotid artery, telling the other person that we aren't looking for a fight.Somewhere in the depths of our brains, it cues us that the person we're talking to isn't a threat and that we can proceed comfortably.


Tilting the head avoids a ""squaring off"" stance. It's softer, has a sympathetic flair, and tells the other that your focus is on them -- something everyone absolutely adores to have. So the next time you're unsure what stance to take, tilt away. It's a catch-all, really.

, This may be one of the non-verbal cues you're not even aware of. So maybe you already do it! A common sign to show friendliness (and, again, that you're non-threatening) is to do a quick eyebrow flash -- just moving them up and down slightly and quickly. It's generally done upon approaching a person and can be seen from far distances.Combine this with a smile and you have the basic set up for any likeable, approachable human. But keep the eyebrow flash to the initiation of a conversation -- it's not something to be used at random intervals, like the head tilt may be.

, If you find yourself in the same body position as someone else, odds are you're probably on similar trains of thought.You probably do this with those around you more often than you realize. The good news here is that you can use it to your advantage! People like people who are similar to them, and this is one very easy way to do it.


If you're talking to a person and they're in a similar body position to you, you're likely to feel like they're on the same page as you are -- and are thus understanding and relate-able (score). Do this in conversation but don't draw attention to it -- if it's too noticeable, it'll seem contrived and unnatural.

, Many books you read will tell you to square your shoulders, throw your chin up, and always keep a firm handshake. While these are definitely good ideas and have their place, in some situations you may not want to come off as strong. Keep these confidence indicators, but throw in a few I-clearly-respect-you signals to even the playing field.


Whomever you meet, showing a little deference won't hurt you. If you're meeting someone and about shake hands, step forward to them and lean in a little (alluding to a bow). Tilt your head, keep an open body position (not always crossing arms and legs, namely), and lean to one side or the other. Showing you're relaxed and interested in the other person will cue them to like you regardless of the conversation level.

Lend a helping hand to your so-called ""enemy."",
Make them help you.,
Make an effort to have regular conversations.,
See them outside of your normal hater-habitat, like work or school.,
Be friendly with their friends.",How to Get Someone Who Hates You to Like You2," You don't want to -- no one wants to help out a jerk -- but you should. Find ways to be supportive and helpful around this person, in ways that make the most of your own strengths. Just do small things without calling attention to the favor. You're not ""winning them back"" or courting them, you're just being a good person. Be casual kind: don't make a big deal of it or ask for thanks, just get it done.


If they don't have any lunch at lunch time, offer to give them something of yours.
If they make a joke that they and their friends find funny, laugh.
If they respond with anger or hatred to your kindness, just smile and walk away. It's a defense mechanism for the hurt and lonely -- not true hatred.

, Studies show that this is even better than helping the other person out.And you get free labor! Keep the request small and manageable, or honor them with a bigger collaborative task if you're feeling bold. They'll feel good about helping you out, which makes them feel good about you. Its the best kind of reverse psychology, and is the result of something called ""cognitive dissonance.""


Trying to win over someone by harming yourself is pointless. If they're going to screw it up, intentionally, then screw them. You'll find plenty of other friends who aren't so cruel.

, Make the first move in order to fix any broken friendship. Invite them for tea, go see a movie, go on a double date, or just stop by their desk. Get out there and talk to each other. Most people only hate others because they don't know or understand them. Granted, the first few conversations will probably suck, since they ""hate"" you, but they will melt. Even the hardest hearts want a friend.""How was your day/weekend?"" is the simplest, but most effective token of friendship you can offer, and you can use it anytime, anywhere.Ask questions about them instead of talking about you. He already hates you, so giving him more of you isn't doing you any favors, right? But people love to talk about themselves. Focus on listening, getting to know where they come from so you can become a better friend.Find shared interests. Solving the hatred isn't necessarily enough -- not if you want to ever be friends with someone. Try to find something that you can talk about together. Maybe you both like the same sport, or riding motorcycles, or dancing, or collectible cookie jars., Get them to go out with you somewhere, usually as part of a group. More likely than not, they will not accept an invitation just to hang with you -- and you're not going to have a great time with someone who hates you. But, in groups, a casual setting is the perfect place to strike up conversations that lead towards friendships.

, Once his or her friends realize you're not the second coming of Satan, it's going to be a lot harder to hate you. You aren't stealing friends, by the way (and you thought he hated you now!), you're just being your friendly, personable self. Whether you notice or not, his friends get to work on the hater for you.

Ask people about themselves.,
Ask for a favor.,
Talk about what interests the other person.,
Be empathetic.,
Flatter them.,
Embarrass yourself.,
Touch them.,
Make them feel good.",How to Get People to Like You2," Be interested in them. What conversation is better than with a person who is genuinely interested in what you are saying? If you are in a conversation and hear yourself saying ""I did this, I did that,"" stop yourself. Ask the other person's opinion. Conversations are two-way streets!


It is always better to mean what you are saying. People know when you have false humility. Setting out to show interest in people about whom you really don't care just for the sake of gaining popularity doesn't work in the long run, so become the sort of person who is truly interested in others! If a particular topic is really difficult for you to feign interest, steer the conversation in a different direction.

, This one may sound kind of funny if you're not familiar with it -- it's a technique known as the ""Benjamin Franklin Effect."" Basically, you ask for a favor, the other person does it for you, you thank them, and they end up liking you more. You'd think that the person having something done for them would like the other, but it's not so. So the next time you feel the need to borrow something, don't hesitate to ask!


The idea here is that everyone likes being useful and everyone prefers to have someone indebted to them -- instead of having debts to others. They gain a sense of power and purpose from you, causing them to like you more.Just don't do it all the time -- too many favors and you become pesky.

, If you know their hobbies or passions, ask! This will usually get them going non-stop and take the heat off you! They will go on and on feeling like you two are having an epic conversation when really you've been resigned to nodding because you can't get a word in edgewise. If you can remember something they mentioned in passing, they'll be doubly impressed.


Take opportunities to use their name. People love hearing their name. As Dale Carnegie puts it, to them it is the sweetest sound in the entire language.It validates them and subsequently they feel reassured and happier. If you can slip it in, do so.

, Pretty straightforward and logical, huh? But oddly enough, even though humans (on some level) know this, it's so much easier not to do it. We're all concerned with me, me, me and waiting for the next time we can add to a conversation. To amplify your likeability, turn the spotlight over to the other person. Focus on understanding them.


A simple turn of phrase can do the trick. Let's say someone is explaining to you a recent problem of theirs. Your automatic response is, ""I understand how you feel."" That should seem fairly harmless, right? But you've just put the focus on you and your abilities -- and what's more, the other person may be thinking, ""No. You don't."" Instead, opt for something less clichéd (and thus more meaningful, even if it is ultimately self-serving) like, ""So you feel like X, X, and X."" Just reiterating what they're saying will make them feel paid attention to and, well, good.


, Another one that seems really obvious. Unfortunately, paying others compliments sometimes can be awkward (lots of people don't know how to handle them!) and seem as if you have ill motivations (a relationship, for example). For starters, get over yourself. Everyone loves it. Well, a genuine, well-timed one, at least!


Make sure your flattery is purposeful and appropriate. If someone clearly had a rough night and still has the grime on their skin from the floor of a neglected public bathroom, don't tell them how beautiful they look. Compliments need to be genuine in order to be appreciated and taken seriously.
Telling a guy that you like his tie is well and good, but what would he say back? ""Thanks, it was made by children in a far away factory and I had nothing at all to do with it?"" Okay, so he probably won't say that, but you get the point. Compliment him on his awesome Powerpoint presentation, his sense of humor, something that matters to him or something that he actually worked on. He'll love the validation.

, Once we reach the ripe ol' age of about 5 1/2, we start realizing that society is looking at us 24/7 and certain behaviors are viewed as just wrong and welcome in scrutiny. Since humans can't stand scrutiny, we avoid it like the plague. Unfortunately, those embarrassing moments still happen to all of us, so when we see it happen to someone else, we feel their pain. And that person? We like them more for it.When you see someone, let's say, caught with their pants down, there is an automatic reaction on both of your parts. The pant-less probably laughs (hopefully), turns a little red, maybe cracks a joke, shakes their head, face-palms, and tries to go about their day with a shred of dignity. What have they done? They've shown you that they are human. They brought down a peg and acknowledged it by their behavior. That's likeable. They're real.

Let's say the same situation happened again, but with a different person. This time they keep a stoic face, situates their drawers back up, gives a terse nod, and goes on their way. Not at all endearing. Their behavior didn't accept their embarrassment and therefore there's nothing to relate to, to sympathize with, or to find charming. Not likeable in the slightest.



, Straight up, if you want to feel a connection with a person, you touch them. Obviously every relationship is different and thus different levels of touching are good -- but in general, it's effective at establishing a bond.The slightest one will do!


Imagine greeting someone briefly as you walk by with a quick ""Hi."" It was a fleeting moment where it seemed as if you didn't have time for the other person. Now, imagine the same scenario where you walk by quickly, give a short hello, but you lightly touch their shoulder. Bam! Physical connection. Focus. You're on their radar -- like, like, and like.

, Another big duh, huh? The overarching theme of this article is really just making the other person feel good. It's how you do it where the options come in. Every person is a bit different, but we all share similar qualities. We all want attention, to be happy, and to feel like we're cared for and useful. And for those people that gives us those things, we like them.


It's best to use a number of tactics to accomplish this. Just flattery, or just asking for favors, or just smiling won't do it. You've got to sprinkle them all in. If you keep the focus on them, that should prep you for action -- asking questions (attention), complimenting (building them up), looking for advice (making them feel wise and purposeful), and showing empathy (being cared for). When they feel good about themselves, they'll feel good about you.

Spend time with people who improve your image.,
Dress to impress.,
Do something to be remembered.,
Stay under control.,
Know your audience.,
Practice basic rules of hygiene.,
Like yourself.,
Use your sense of humor.",How to Get People to Like You3," Unfortunately, all humans look for quick, go-to signals to jump to judgments of the people they meet. No, it's not always accurate, but we all do it because it's easy and relatively painless. We see a situation and we assess it on its outward appearance automatically. If we don't like it, we write it off. So when you're being judged, know that it's not just you, it's what you come with.


This is sort of a nice way to say...well, that you're judged by the people around you, too. If your friends are all smelly trolls but you're not, you risk being lumped in the smelly troll category, regardless. This is especially true for Facebook -- the prettier your Facebook friends are, the prettier you seem to be.No, it's not right, but it is real.

, You know how they say ""dress for the job you want, not the job you have?"" It's like that. Dress for the image you want people to see, not how you feel or what you are. People are easily fooled by clothing. ""The clothes make the man,"" right? How many more figures of speech do you need?


In a recent study, wearing brand names was shown to heighten one's perceived status. Quality of clothing didn't matter, but slapping on a luxury label made participants view the wearer as high-status and, on a related note, more likeable.It's another cue that humans jump to for a quick answer to a person. It may not be fool-proof (or the right thing to do), but it's easy.

, This one can't get super specific because whatever you do has to fit your personality, but having a ""thing"" can make you likeable. You'll be memorable, have a concrete identity (or so they think), and people will be able to get a grip on you. ""Hey! That's the guy with the parrot! I love that guy!"" Something like that.


If you've ever worked in the restaurant industry, you may have a story that relates to this phenomenon. Think of the customer that always tips in $2 bills. After a visit or two, the waiters are fighting over him. Why? He has a thing. He's easily remembered, distinguished, and interesting. He's liked., Quite obviously, people don't like to be around loose cannons. When they don't know what to expect, they get uncomfortable and tense. Try to keep a laid back, calm, and happy attitude, even when something doesn't go your way. People you don't know well may easily get turned off by displays of difficulty, neuroticism, and unwarranted insecurity.


That's not to say to hide your emotions! No, no, no. You want to be genuine. If something upsets you, let it upset you. If people don't like it, well, they won't like it. But before you start going off, choose your battles. Is it worth the judgment? If so, proceed. If not, reassess your reaction to the situation at hand.

, Different age levels, groups, and types of people are looking for different things in friends and partners. The older you get, the less phased and dramatic your network should become. Because of this, different personas may be more effective on different people. Know who you're dealing with and what they're looking for.


Things are different in middle and high school than they are in the adult world. It pains wikiHow to say it, but at these ages, you may be better liked if you're a little mean and selfish. A recent study showed that an individual's popularity rose when they were a bit of a bully.This is because at that age, other kids look to strength as an example of what's good, not knowing that that's not how things work. In short, kids are mean.

, No one will want to be around someone who stinks, literally and metaphorically. So, take regular showers or baths, wash your hair, shave if you need to, brush and floss your teeth, comb your hair, use breath mints or minty gum, clip/clean your nails, use deodorant, change clothes, clean your hands, etc. Pretty doable stuff!


Think of this as an investment into yourself. The time it takes to look good (and feel good!) will warrant you benefits in the future. Not only is it good for getting people to like you, but it's good for your health, too.

, Straight up, if you don't like you, why should anyone else? That inner negativity will seep through your day-to-day actions and people will see it. And why not like yourself? You're awesome. At least as awesome as the people around you.


Don't try to be someone you're not; it'll show if you try. Know who you are, and adjust these tips to your personality. It pays off in the long run, even if you march to the beat of your own drum. Any changes you try to force will just wear away with time, so it's best to be natural from the get-go.

, Chances are you have one, so use it! If you can make a person laugh, you're in! Just be careful to make the jokes appropriate to the setting. Offending people is not the goal here -- making them smile is.


If you don't think you're funny, don't worry about trying to be funny. You probably have a sense of humor that's a bit different from the norm. Maybe you're sarcastic, maybe you're quirky, maybe you're ridiculously smart -- any of those can be turned into comedic moments. Take what you have in your kit and run with it. It can be morphed into hilarity.

, When you enter, smile to your classmates and start a conversation with them to show them that you really want them as your friends. A friendly smile or a small confident can show them that you are interested in becoming friends. Another good thing to do is try to relate to them. Don't lie, because they will catch on and will know you as a liar.

, Don't take the seats at the back so that no one would see you or notice you. You have to sit in the middle with the others so you can start a conversation with them easily. Being in the middle will allow you to talk to the most amount of people. Something that can make you more noticeable is your fashion sense. try to keep up with the latest trend but still remain yourself. Be careful not to be noticed as someone who is unhygienic and dirty. This will turn people off.

, When you first start a conversation with a classmate, make sure to keep the topic positive. Something as simple as where you were born or the sport you enjoy can engage them and help you get to know them better.

, It is scientifically proven that smiles will increase a happier mood. If your teeth aren't the whitest, you should probably look into a better toothpaste or a teeth cleaning. If you have braces, then be sure to pack something to clean your teeth after each meal. But most of all, Be happy and smile!

Ask her out.",How to Get to Know a Girl at School You Don't Know," One benefit of being in school together is that you will most likely see the girl on a regular basis. The best way to initiate a relationship is to start saying hello when you see her. Get in the habit of being friendly and greeting her when you see her.It’s impossible to get to know someone if you never talk to them. And you usually won’t have an extended conversation on the first try. Start small with consistent greetings and build up to talking for longer.
A good addition is to greet her using her name when you see her. Using someone’s name creates a stronger bond of acquaintance, and you will make her feel valued.;
, School is regimented into chunks of time, so you have to work with that. A great opportunity that you may have is walking to class together. If you have the same class or classes that are in the same direction, you can ask to walk with her.


This gives you a chance to talk a little bit but it’s a short amount of time so it might not get awkward. Talking for three minutes in the early stages of a friendship makes it easier.
If you are able, you may even walk out of your way to have some time with her. You don’t want to be late to class, but if you have time it might be worth it to walk extra.

, You may feel too shy to start talking to her out of nowhere, but writing a brief note is easy. You can write something simple like “Hey Devon, I hope you have a great day today!” This simple note will show her that you are interested.If you never see her, or you are too shy to hand it to her yourself, you can always get a mutual friend or one of her friends to give her the note.
This is a fairly low-commitment way to show a girl that you are interested. If she wants to respond, she can easily write you a note back, but if she doesn’t want to talk you won’t be rejected to your face.
Notes are a great way to start talking more often, because you don’t need to have as much face to face time. Passing notes to each other for a while is less pressure than sitting and talking at first.

, If you have class together, and you are allowed to pick your seat each day, you should do your best to sit by her. This will give you the chance to have a few moments of small talk throughout class.


You could say hi at the beginning of class, make a brief comment in the middle, and tell her goodbye when class is over.
If there is ever a chance to work with a partner on homework or a project, take the chance to ask if she would like to work together. Even if you don’t know each other yet, it is a low pressure and structured way to spend time with her.
Don’t talk to her during class if your teacher is strict because getting her in trouble is not a good way to make her want to get to know you.

, When you are in class with her or you see her in the hallways or around school somewhere else, ask her to help you with something simple. Maybe you could ask to look at her notes for a class, ask if she has a pen you could borrow briefly, or even ask her an answer on some homework you had.Rather than trying to start a conversation with no real purpose except talking to her, asking for a small favor will get her invested in you right from the start. It also makes it so your interaction has a clear ending, so once it is over you can say “Thanks. See ya later!”
The range of simple favors you can ask is almost endless, but do be careful that you don’t ask something too extensive. You don’t want the favor to inconvenience her. An example of a favor that might be too much is asking her to buy your lunch.
If she completely ignores you or says she doesn’t want to help, this is probably a sign that talking to her further is not in your best interest.

, On some of the occasions when you say hi to her, give her a simple compliment. Don’t over-exaggerate the compliment. Giving her a compliment will show her that you are interested in her a little more than other people.For example, if you are in class with her, say, “Hey that was an impressive answer you gave today.” Compliments that focus on more than just looks are often appreciated.
Give the compliment in a friendly, light-hearted way and not in an intense or over enthusiastic way. You don’t want the compliment to come on too strong or sound insincere. For example, don’t say, “Great job cheerleading last night. I couldn’t stop staring at you!”
Don’t overdo it on the frequency that you compliment her. Say something genuine every few days rather than multiple times in one day.

, You can ask simple questions like, “What are you doing this weekend?” but it is also good to ask deeper or more interesting questions like, “Where is the coolest place you have traveled?” or “What famous person would you want to have dinner with?”You can use questions to move from acquaintances to friends by slowly increasing how personal your questions are. At the beginning, you can ask fun ones like the ones above. Later, you can ask things like, “What are some things that scare you?” or “What makes you happy?”
Ask her what things she likes to do outside of school. Ask her what she thinks of recent news or topics that are going around. Ask her if she has thought about what she wants to do when she graduates from school.
Asking good questions helps you learn more about her, but it also sets you apart from other people because it shows you are interested in her thoughts and not just interested in her beauty.

, Getting to know someone requires that you pay attention to them when they talk, and eye contact is a good way to show you are listening. Eye contact also shows confidence. A decent rule is to keep eye contact 50% of the time. Too much will come across too strong.Make eye contact while she is talking to you as well as when you are talking to her.
Eye contact is not the same as staring. Let your eyes bounce from hers to something else in the distance and back. Also, do your best not to stare at her body while she is talking as this can make you seem aggressive.

, After you ask her some good questions and listen to what she is saying, you can show her that you care about her thoughts by remembering what she tells you. If she says she is visiting her grandparents over the weekend, ask her on Monday how the visit went. If she tells you she is in a play, ask her how rehearsals are going.


This is another point where the opportunities are endless. If the girl plays sports or is on an academic team, ask her how a recent competition went. If she tells you a band that she loves, listen to some of the music and talk to her about it.
When she tells you something, write it down so you can reference it when you forget later on. This will help ensure that you remember exactly what she actually told you about.
If she tells you about a TV show she likes or an upcoming event of some kind, you could watch it or go to it and then that will give you something else that you can talk about.

, Ultimately, if you want to get to know a girl better, you need to find a way to spend some time with her outside of school. You don’t have to ask her on a “date,” but you need to ask her if she wants to do something together. It could be going to a sporting event, going for a walk at the park, or getting ice cream.


Knowing when to ask a girl out is never easy. You may only need to talk to her a few times for her to be ready, or you may need to be friends for a month. Pay attention to how she responds to you as you talk and then put yourself out there.
Make sure you are both clear on whether or not what you are doing is a date. You can ask her specifically if she wants to go on a date, or you can leave it more general and ask if she wants to hang out. Either way, you should clarify before you meet if it is a date or not.

Make your home a fun place to hang out.,
Have a party for your friends.,
Be the planner in the group.",How to Get People to Hang Out with You1," People want to go where they know they’ll have a good time, so make your space the place they want to be. Have plenty of things for your guests to do. Don’t limit yourself on activities that you think will result in fun times.


Write down a list of ideas of fun things to do, or surf the web for interesting social activities. Store that list of activities in a place that's easily accessible for a rainy day. You never know when you'll need to host a day of fun.
Cater to your friends' interests. For example, if you know your friends love good food, consider having a themed dinner party.;
, Supply different types of party games designed for social interactions, like Twister. Keep refreshments such as drinks, snacks, and light appetizers readily available for your guests. Have a playlist of music ready to go for any social occasion, but encourage your friends to bring playlists of their own to share.


See if one or more of your friends wants to help with the party planning. That way, you can hang out while also planning a great social event.
Be inclusive when it comes to inviting people to the party. Since you want to find more people to hang out with, it's better to invite more people instead of being exclusive.

, Oftentimes, people are less likely to want to hang out if there’s no one taking the initiative to plan outings. Instead of waiting for people to call you, organize activities and outings that will interest your friends in participating.


Pick your friends’ brain and ask what they’re interested in doing. They may have recommendations for things to do. That can relieve the planning pressures.
When your friends see that you are taking their preferences into account, they'll be more likely to want to hang out in the future.

Join social activities.,
Meet people online.,
Stretch yourself.",How to Get People to Hang Out with You2," Sometimes, changing up your normal routine has the potential to open up your surroundings and the people that you’re around. Trying new activities has the potential to turn into new hobbies. New hobbies bring new opportunities to make new friends.


When you spend time doing something you love, you're more likely to meet people with similar interests who want to hang out. For example, if you discover you like trivia, join a trivia team; you'll quickly get to know your teammates, and you'll have a built-in hangout session every week.Consider joining a club or sports team that meets weekly. This regular social time will put you more in the mood to make new friends.

, Dating sites paved the way for meeting people online, but you can use them even if friendship is what you seek. Choose a dating site conducive to friendly matchmaking and create a profile to share your interests. Be as open to meeting others as you'd like them to be when they come across your profile.


For a less personal experience, try a site that hosts meetups among people with common interests. You can meet up with people to play a sport, take a hike, discuss politics, and so on.
Try putting your Facebook friendships to the test by organizing a meetup among people you already know. See if people want to have a picnic, play a game of pickup kickball, or meet up in a smaller group for coffee.

, Embrace hobbies and interests that are designed for socialization such as joining the local sports league or hanging out at the gym, bars, clubs, and so on. Shy away from solitary hobbies such as reading or going for a walk. Being around more people increases the likelihood of meeting new people who share similar interests.

Strike up a conversation with someone who looks interesting.,
Make the interaction personable.,
Be genuine.,
Ask the person to hang out sometime.",How to Get People to Hang Out with You3," It can be challenging, and sometimes awkward, to walk up to a person and start a conversation, but taking that first step is a great way to make new friends. In most cases, the person you're talking with will be happy to chat.


If you see someone that you’re interested in chatting with, politely greet the person. Start talking about the activity that the two of you are partaking in at that moment, such as watching your kids at the park or waiting in line for coffee.
If the person seems interested, keep the ball rolling. Talk about anything and everything. General topics such as movies, tv, books, sports, and so on are generally fun to talk about with anyone. Mention your favorites and be sure to ask them about their favorites. Keep the conversation light, open, and fun.

, It may be difficult to relate to someone that you just met, but making the effort to be personable allows your potential new buddy to be comfortable around you. Comfort creates openness. Creating an atmosphere of comfort can decrease the awkwardness of talking to a stranger and can make interaction a pleasant experience.


Practice good, active listening skills. Once your potential new friend begins to open up, actively listen and ask questions. Listening will help you pay attention to important details that will help with putting you on the right track towards developing a friendship.
Don't put too much pressure on the interaction. If the other person doesn't seem to be interested in talking, don't push it.

, Start things on the right foot by being genuinely interested in whomever you’re conversing with. The only connections that will work are the ones you really care about. Being yourself is key when it comes to making friends.

, If all goes well, it's fine to take it to the next level and see if the person wants to hang out again. You can exchange numbers and make a concrete plan for spending some time together.


When you ask the person to hang out, have a low-key activity in mind. For example, if you met waiting in line for coffee, ask if the person wants to have coffee with you in a few days. That way, you'll both be in your comfort zone when it's time to hang out.
If the person shies away from hanging out, try not to take it personally. Not everyone is open to making new friends on the spot.

Make sure your friends offer emotional support and guidance.,
Determine if you have a good balance of give and take.,
Decide if your friends bring out the best in you.,
Determine if you can communicate effectively with your friends.,
Consider if you trust and respect your friends.",How to Choose the Right Friends1," Good friends will be willing to support you on a consistent basis, through your high points and your low points. Your friends should offer to support you during any difficult emotional times and be there for you in a real, genuine way. They may also offer guidance and advice when you need it.You should consider if you feel supported by your friends and if so, in what ways. Maybe you remember a time where you were going through a rough break up and your friends checked in on you every day. Maybe your friends also tried to distract you from your emotions by taking you out for fun outings or by spending time with you one on one.
Good friends may also offer good advice and guidance during a confusing or hard time. Your friends should only offer advice when you ask for it and be willing to support you, even if they do not agree with your decision at the time. They may not like your decision to move away for school, for example, but they should still try to support you the best they can, as a friend.;
, Good friendships also have a good balance of giving and taking, where you feel mutually supported. You should try to cultivate friendships where there is a balance of give and take, and where you do not feel you are giving or taking more than the other person.Some people are natural givers, where they will do anything to help someone and support them. Some people are also natural takers, where they will take up someone else’s time and energy to fulfill their own needs. You should look for friends who can maintain a balance between these two extremes.

, Your friends should also encourage you to develop into the best version of yourself you can be. They should help you focus on how you can be yourself and achieve your goals. Your friends should act as your own personal cheer squad, where they proudly encourage you to go after what you want.For example, maybe you are determined to get into medical school. Your friends may encourage you by asking about your studies and by helping you prepare your applications. They may also help you relieve the stress of the applications by taking you out to dinner and celebrate you when you get into school.

, Another key aspect of a good friendship is positive communication, where you can share your thoughts and feelings without limits. You should be able to be yourself around your friends and feel you can share your opinions with them. You should not feel you have to censor yourself or keep quiet about your thoughts around your friends.

However, you should also feel comfortable being called out or challenged by your friends. Strong-willed friends with strong opinions can help you cultivate a better sense of self-control and learn better from your mistakes.You should not be turned off by friends who challenge your opinion or call out a comment you make that seems problematic.
Good friends will be willing to tell you when you are right and when you are wrong, as this will lead to healthier and more honest discussions. You should be comfortable doing this around your friends as well, as you should feel you can express your opinions, even if it seems counter to what your friends have to say., Good friendships are built on mutual respect and mutual trust. You should feel you can trust your friends with private information and trust that they will support you, even when you’re not around. Good friends will stand up for you and support you in company of strangers and other friends.You should also cultivate respect for your friends. Though you may not share all the same interests or preferences, you should still respect their choices and the way they conduct themselves around others. You do not necessarily have to be into the same things, but you should show respect and consideration for each other.

,
Give preference to the other person’s convenience when you schedule.,
Forgive others if they are unable to reschedule.",How to Cancel Plans with a Friend," The best way to avoid inconveniencing your friend is to give them plenty of time to make an alternate plan. Most resentment comes from cancelling at the last minute, when friends have already changed their day to accommodate your plans., Reaching a person directly is essential when cancelling friends, so that no time is wasted. If they don’t answer, leave a message and follow up with a text or email.

, Friends can often tell when someone’s not being honest, so tell the truth whenever possible to avoid the knock-on effects of little white lies.Sometimes, you may need to tell a little lie. For example, if you’re having bladder problems or you’ve learned that the person’s ex-boyfriend will be at the occasion, you may want to spare your friend a reaction. Leave those lies for times when you really need them. In most cases, you can come clean later and your friend will understand.

, Be sincere, and recognize that someone has blocked out time for you and you may be wasting their valuable time.You needn’t apologize more than once or twice unless you feel the message has not been delivered.

, If you leave them with extra tickets, take the burden to find someone else to buy them.

, Your friend won’t feel as though you are trying to avoid them and you can choose a time that is convenient for both of you.

, Relationships become strained when one party starts cancelling with regularity. A cancellation is more likely to be fine if it’s only done on very rare occasions.

, Suggest several times that will definitely work for you.

,, For example, if you need to cancel lunch plans, you might suggest that you’ll take them out at their favorite lunch place or cook them lunch soon.

, If they seem put-off, they may be hurt by your cancellation. It may take time and several un-cancelled plans to build up trust again.

Watch her for a while.,
Start finding out more about what you have found out about this girl.,
Start talking with her.,
Make contact.,
Remain independent.,
Question your own motivations regularly.",How to Befriend a Popular Girl," Get to know her likes, dislikes. Observe the clothes that she wears, the shoes, the way that she styles her hair. Find out what sports she participates in, if any, and any other after-school activities she is involved in. Learn whatever you can about this girl.;
, Once you know more about her likes, you can start cultivating these too. For example, can you buy some of the outfits she wears? Not the same, mind you, but similar, and of the same quality and style? Can you become involved in some of the activities that she is doing? This will not only get you ""in-the-know"" so that you can have genuine talks with her but she'll also be likely to bump into you during these occasions.

, This may feel bewildering but you've got to start somewhere, right? Talk about things you have in common. Some of those things in common should be well known to you by now, and your involvement in some of her interests will help a lot. Be very careful about gossip; until you know this girl really well, you don't know who she knows or cares about, even quietly and off-the-side. Even popular girls have soft hearts for lame ducks here and there for one reason or another, so don't screw up by dissing anybody.

, If you seem to really hit it off, exchange cell numbers or screen-names for instant messaging. Do not overwhelm her with messages, however. Take it slowly, occasionally sending her a bit of interesting fashion or entertainment news, for example. Or alert her to an upcoming cool party or even in your area and let her know you're thinking of going if the weather is good etc.

, Popular people do not like clinging people; they like loyal, devoted, and imitating people but they don't like to be responsible for their close set of friends. Be devoted, interested, and keen, but do not be a barnacle. Let her know you're busy sometimes and that there are other friends that you've got lined up to do things with. Be elusive and hard-to-find sometimes. That is tantalizing, especially to someone who is used to being fawned on. If you have friends from several ""cliques"", try to hang out with all of them regularly, especially at times when she can see you. This will give her a clear indication that you hold your own and are definitely worth knowing.

, It is important to always ask yourself why you seek friendship with a popular person. If it is because you are genuinely fascinated by this person and really think that they'd make a great friend, that's fantastic. But if you think being friends with someone popular will solve your own personality issues and internal fears, insecurities, and unhappiness, then think again. These issues will only be magnified by catapulting yourself into the limelight of the popular crowd because you will be forced to behave in ways that can increase your insecurities, including making you feel uglier, fatter, less intelligent etc. Deal with any underlying personality challenges more constructively if this is your real motivation, by doing such positive things as getting counseling, joining an acting class, improving your knowledge etc., to gain confidence, rather than seeing popularity as a panacea to your problems."

Focus on making friends in person, rather than just online.,
Take a new class or join an interesting club.,
Volunteer for a cause you believe in.,
Turn an acquaintance into a friend.",How to Choose the Right Friends2," Finding friends on social media can be a positive thing, especially if you are shy and struggle with meeting new people. But cultivating friendships in person can often lead to deeper and more meaningful connections. You should try to seek out others in person and build friendships by spending time together in real life, rather than just online.If you are shy and find it hard to make new friends, you may start by communicating with others on social media. You may start conversations on social media or follow certain users to connect with them that way. Over time, you may feel comfortable taking the online conversations into real life and spend time hanging out one on one.

, You can also expand your friend circle by putting yourself in new, exciting situations. Maybe you take a class on a hobby or activity you’ve always wanted to get better at or join a club that focuses on something you are passionate about. You could then connect with others who share similar interests with you and build meaningful friendships with them.

For example, you may have an interest in video games and want to connect with others who share your interest. You may join an online video game group and play with new people. You could then build friendships over time and spend time doing other things, like hanging out one on one or going to see a movie together that you will both enjoy.

, You can also meet new people and build positive friendships by volunteering for a cause or an organization you believe in. Volunteering is a good way to meet people who share the same beliefs and goals as you, which could then lead to strong friendships.

For example, maybe you want to volunteer at an event for your local Women’s Shelter. You may spend time volunteering with a group of people who are all supporting a cause you believe in. You may connect with certain individuals and spend time after volunteering talking over a cup of coffee or a drink. This could then lead to a friendships with someone who you know shares the same values and beliefs as you.

, You may have a work acquaintance that you would like to turn into a friend or a mutual acquaintance with your partner that you would like to get to know better. Turning an acquaintance into a friend can be a good way to transition an existing relationship into a more meaningful one.You can try to turn the acquaintance into a friend by inviting them out for coffee or for dinner one on one where you can get to know each other on a deeper level. During the meeting, you should ask thoughtful questions and be a good listener to show the person that you can be a good person to get to know and hang out with.

Avoid friends who belittle you by talking down to you or by putting you down with negative comments. These actions can be harmful to your self-esteem and your self-worth, leading to friendships that can be toxic and unhelpful.A negative friend may talk down to you by telling you that you are “worthless”, “stupid”, or “dumb”. They may also constantly tell you you are wrong about things and that you do not know what you are talking about.
They may also put you down in front of others to make themselves look better and focus on the things you are bad at to make you feel diminished. You may leave your hang outs with negative friends unsettled and feeling low.

, You should also stay away from friends who are only takers and do not give you any encouragement or support. Friends who use you are only interested in their own personal gains and wins. They may show no interest in your own needs and fail to show up when you need them.

For example, maybe you win a big writing prize and feel your writing career is finally taking off. You may share this news with a friend, think she will be happy and supportive of your success. Instead, she may act jealous or disinterested in your news and instead focus on her own goals and needs. She may also try to use your success for her own gain and disregard your needs in the process.

, You should also try to rid yourself of friends who are always harping on about the negative aspects of a situation, as this can end up draining you of your energy. You may have friends who only view things from a negative point of view and refuse to focus on the positive aspects. This may then lead you to also adopt a negative point of view and put in you in a permanent state of negativity.You may try to cheer up friends who are negative, to no avail. You may also feel you are responsible for making your negative friends feel happy and productive, leaving you with little time to focus on your own needs and goals. Avoiding negative friends will allow you to spend time on your own development and not use all your energy on someone else’s issues.

Understand it may not be what you think it is.",How to Tell if She Is out of Your League," One criteria often used to judge ""leagues"" is a person's monetary worth. Of course, plenty of poorer people date richer people, but more often than not, people tend to date and marry within their social or economic class. Therefore, if she has a lot more money than you do, she may decide you're not in her league.Use visual clues to help you decide her socio-economic status. If she's wearing designer clothes, expensive jewelry, and a high-end handbag, those are good indicators she has some money.
If you know the woman, think about the people she's dated in the past. Has she dated people who had a significantly different income than she did? That can also help you judge.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't approach her if you think she's richer than you. For one, she may have just figured out how to appear richer than she is. For another, you should let her decide what makes you in or out of her league.;
, Another criteria that people use to judge ""leagues"" is looks. For example, if she is much more conventionally attractive than you are, she may consider herself out of your league. Just like economics, people often tend to end up with people who are similar to themselves as far as attractiveness goes.You may find it easier to judge her looks than your own. However, to truly gauge whether you are in her league, you need to be honest about your own looks. Are you just an average-looking person, while she's got exceptionally good looks? Then she may be out of your league.
If you're not sure how to judge your looks, ask a good friend to help you figure it out, someone who will be brutally honest with you. Just be sure you can take it.
Even if you're average or below-average in the looks department, you still shouldn't count yourself out. Let her do that for you after you approach her. Plus, she could come to find you more attractive over time if she enjoys your personality.

, In addition, education and intelligence is another important part of considering if someone is out of your ""league."" In other words, if she has a doctorate and you barely finished high school, that may not be a good match because you may not have the same pursuits.Of course, education and intelligence are not the same thing. You can be incredibly intelligent and only have a GED. Nonetheless, if she's smart and sharp, she's going to probably want someone who can keep up with her.

, If she's very into healthiness and you're not, that could be a barrier. You should be able to tell on some level. If she's muscular or is obviously abstaining from unhealthy foods, that's a good indicator that a healthy lifestyle is important to her. It's not that you are less worthy if you don't enjoy the same type of lifestyle. It's just that you may find that your two lifestyles aren't compatible.

, While having different beliefs from someone doesn't constitute a ""league,"" it is an important part of attraction and connection. In other words, if she's religious and you're not, that could be a significant barrier.Other barriers could include the issue of marriage (Do you both want it?) and kids (Yes or no?).
You may also have issues based on what kind of life you want. For instance, if she wants a fast-paced urban life but you prefer suburbia, then you may not be compatible.

, Money, looks, education, and social status do obviously play a role in choosing a mate. However, many other factors can make you more attractive to a woman, including being a competent person or having a warm personality. In other words, don't dismiss your other good qualities just because you've judged her to be ""ahead"" of you in certain areas., One of the first steps to flirting is to flash her a big, genuine smile. You can even do it across the room. Besides engaging her, it makes you appear like a happier person. It also makes her feel like she's winning something because a smile from someone else registers as a reward in the brain.Starting a conversation with her is really the only way you'll be able to tell if she considers you in her league or not.
It's often easy to tell if a smile is genuine. Try to make it reach your eyes. You can also show your teeth.

, If you want to show someone you like them, you can't be timid about it. Many people have a hard time telling when someone is flirting with them because it is so subtle and because not everyone flirts in the same way.Therefore, to make sure she knows, you have to be confident and use confident body language.Start by looking her in the eyes. Looking down or away from her doesn't show her you're interested. Obviously, you don't want to stare, but try to catch her gaze and hold it for a few seconds.Other confident gestures include standing up straight and not fidgeting.

, Open body language includes keeping your limbs apart. You don't want to cross them, as that sends a signal that you're not approachable. Crossed arms and legs are like a big ""X"" over your body telling others to stay away.In addition, try to angle your body so it's pointing in her direction. Doing so signals that you're interested in her. You should also pay attention to how you move your head. Tilting it towards her indicates interest.

, When you're talking to her, one way you can show you're interested in her as more than a friend is to lean towards her. You don't want to make her uncomfortable, however. If she leans back, take a step back, as that indicates you're invading her personal space in a way she doesn't like.Also, try not to employ this method with a woman you just met if you're alone with her. If there's no one else around, that can seem like you're trying to come on too strong.
You can also try touching her arm or her shoulder while you're talking. Doing so can indicate you're interested in her.

, While fidgeting with your glass or watch isn't seen as confident, playing with your hair can be construed as flirtatious. You may also want to such your stomach in, so your gut isn't sticking out as much. You may find you don't even have to think about doing these things, but employing them is a sign of flirting., You're never going to be able to tell if she's out of your league or not if you don't talk to her. You may feel awkward walking up to her, but all you need to do is get a conversation going. You don't have to actually hit on her. Opening a conversation is much more effective than a pickup line at gauging someone's interest.Pick something simple to start the conversation. Ask her about what she's drinking or the music playing. You could say something like, ""Isn't this song great?""
You can also try to get her to put the spotlight on herself, so she's not judging you. You could say something like, ""What an interesting drink choice. What do you like about it?""

, Another way to break the ice is to ask a small favor of her. You don't have to ask her to run out to the corner store for you or anything like that. Rather, just ask her something small, such as asking her to pass a straw.You could also say something like, ""Would you mind moving your bag so I can sit here?""
Also, give her your name and ask for hers in return.

, While wildly different people do get into relationships, most people find partners who are similar to themselves. Education, socioeconomic standing, and beliefs all play a part in finding a good match.The principle of ""matching"" does apply to looks, too. However, if you're compatible in other ways, looks may not matter as much.
Try drawing her out a bit to find more about her. Once you do, you'll be able to assess whether she's out of your league, or whether, in fact, you're out of hers.
For example, ask her about her educational background just as a point of interest, such as, ""So where did you go to school?""

, Complimenting her shows you have an interest in her, especially if it is specific to her person. Making it specific shows you've paid attention to her, and it will come off as seeming more real.You don't have to stick to her looks. If you've been talking to her for a few minutes, you could comment on her wittiness or the fact that she has a great laugh.

, Laughing when she cracks a joke shows you're listening, and it can you that you like her. You don't want to laugh too much, as you may come as fake. However, laughing when she says something truly funny or even mildly humorous will show her you have a good sense of humor.Also, don't be afraid to crack a joke, especially one at your own expense, as it shows her you don't take yourself too seriously.

, When you see her drink is getting low, order her another. If you see she's shifting back and forth on her heels, ask her if she wants to sit down. By anticipating her needs, you'll show her that you are a genuine, caring person and that you're the kind of person she wants to get to know more., By opening the conversation, you've invited her to determine if you're in her league or not. One way to tell if she's interested is to watch her body language. Her body language will say much about what she's thinking, even if she doesn't want to verbalize it. For instance, she may try to create more space between you two by stepping back.She may also lean away, look away, or pull a bad face.
You may also notice she has ""closed"" body language, where she crosses her arms or legs and turns away from you. She may also use her purse as a shield, of sorts, holding it in front of her body.
If she shows signs of nervousness, such as rubbing her eyes, scratching her nose, or rubbing the back of her neck, that could also be a sign she isn't interested in you.

, On the other hand, she may be giving you signs that she likes you with her body language. For instance, blushing is often a sign that someone is attracted to you, as is giving you coy glances.Of course, the opposite rules apply for open body language than that of negative body language. She'll likely turn her body towards you and lean towards you if she likes you. She'll also leave her arms and legs uncrossed as a sign of openness.

, If she keeps the conversation going, she's likely interested in you, especially if she turns the questions on you. If she seems interested in the conversation, she may be interested in you as a date.It's fine to answer her questions, but if you really want to charm her, keep turning the conversation back to her. People like talking about themselves.
On the other hand, if she's giving you one-word answers and seems more interested in her phone than you, she's giving you a clear indication she'd rather you back away.

, One way to gauge her interest is the direct approach. You can simply ask her on a date to see how she responds. She'll certainly let you know one way or another whether she thinks you're out of her league or not.You could simply say something along the lines of ""I've been enjoying our conversation tonight. Would you like to have coffee with me next week to continue the conversation?""
If you're shy, you can beat around the bush a little by asking in an indirect way. For instance, you could say something like ""I heard there's a great movie at the independent theater this weekend that I'm going to try to catch. What are you doing this weekend?""

, If she says she has a boyfriend or girlfriend, that's a clear sign she doesn't want to be with you. She may or may not have a significant other, but many women use this excuse when they are feeling unsafe or they don't know how to tell someone ""no.""If she tells you she's dating someone, it's time to back away. She has set her boundaries.

, If she's clearly rejecting you, don't keep pushing. Just let her go. She has a right to say ""no,"" and you have to respect that right. Even if she's not saying ""no"" with her mouth, respect her boundaries if she's clearly saying ""no"" with her body language.

, Sometimes, a woman may not feel like chatting with a random guy, even if she's at a bar. Her rejection of you may have nothing to do with her ""being out of your league."" In fact, even if you're showing interest, she may feel like you're out of her league for whatever reason.Remember, relationships are based on all aspects of your person, not just good looks.
Even if she is rejecting you outright because of your looks, think about it this way: you wouldn't want to be with a person who won't take the time to see beyond your good looks.

Know that you're in love.,
Consider his feelings.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Love Him1," Saying ""I love you"" is a big step, and before you say those magic words, you need to make sure you mean it. You may be feeling infatuated, obsessed, or smitten with your boyfriend, but how do you know that what you're feeling is truly love? Here are some signs that you are truly in love:


If nothing feels as good as it does when you're with your significant other. If he has a way of putting you at ease and making you feel amazing for who you are.
If you can't imagine your future without him.
If you can be yourself completely around him.
If you are realistic about who your boyfriend is. If you are able to accept his flaws instead of thinking he's absolutely perfect, this is a sign that you may be in love.;
, Though you're not a mind reader, you may have a sense that he also loves you, or you wouldn't consider telling him such big news. You won't be able to know if he loves you for sure until you tell him, but there are a few things you can consider to get a better sense of how he feels. Here are some signs that he may share your feelings:


If he's always complimenting you, telling you how amazing you are, and saying that he's never met a person like you, then he may be falling for you.
If he can't keep his hands off of you and always wants to be around you. Make sure he is feeling love, not lust -- it's easy to confuse the two. If he's addicted to your mind and your personality and not just your body, then he may be falling for you.
If you often catch him staring at you with a dopey, sweet expression. Bonus points if he blushes and turns away when you catch him.

Identify the group that you want to fit in with.,
Be mindful of the social norms at your school.,
Observe your group to find out what they value most.,
Do physical things which show that you have similar values.,
Introduce yourself to the group with confidence.,
Join a sports team or club that your group is a part of.,
Tell jokes and smile a lot.,
Give sincere compliments to members in your group.,
Keep the focus on the members of the group.,
Nod, repeat words back, and use others' names frequently.,
Disagree politely, but don't tell others they are wrong.,
Stand out.",How to Fit In," Most likely this will be the popular ""in""-crowd, but think of specific words that describe the group.This will help you better visualize and organize the things you will need to do to fit in.


Use this template: The popular kids are __________. They are best described as __________. They are good at __________, and they like to __________ in their spare time. This sentence may look like this: ""The popular kids are football players and cheerleaders. They are best described as energetic, active, physical, and attractive. They are good at playing sports and socializing with others, and they like to party in their spare time.""
Or, your template may look like this: ""The popular kids are choir members and acting students. They are best described as intellectual, funny, charismatic, and quiet. They are good at putting on a show, entertaining others, and making people laugh, and they like to watch movies in their spare time.""
Popular groups vary from school to school. At your school, athletes may be the most popular. At another school, the environmentally aware may be the most popular. Don't just assume that popular people all behave and show interest in the same things.;
, Your desired group is likely appealing because they have strayed from certain behaviors and interests that may not be the most popular among your peers.


The target group may be Vegan, and in your school, being ""cool"" may mean not eating animals or animal products.
You will have to decide if the norms the group abides by are things you are actually willing to sacrifice or pursue. Maybe you love eating T-bone steaks and scrambled eggs too much to try to follow that norm.

, Look for favorite band T-shirts, instruments, or sports equipment they carry. Eavesdrop a little and find out what topics they discuss most.



Be careful while listening to conversations; you don't want to be too apparent, otherwise you may be branded as nosy.
You most likely won't have to follow every social norm to gain acceptance. For instance, your group may be Vegan, but being Justin Bieber fans may be the most important aspect of the group's identity.

, For example, if your group is big on school plays, buy a ticket to a performance and greet them if you see them there.


If your group loves reading Harry Potter, bring a Harry Potter book to school and read it in class. If they like wearing specific colors, try wearing those colors too. Similarity tends to be the first stepping stone on the path to developing friendship.
Imitation is very important when it comes to being likable. This doesn't mean being a robot or clone, but showing others that you aren't so different. Mimicking is actually something that a lot of people do naturally, and people tend to act more favorably to those who copy them.Be honest in your actions and interactions. If doing something feels wrong to you, don't do it to fit in. Remember there are multiple things that people value, and a particular norm or interest may not be that important to the group.

, Now that you have a rough idea of the group's interests and characteristics, try to make them aware of your presence in a self-assured, non-timid manner.


Remember, confidence doesn't mean abrasiveness. Try not to be too forceful or assertive when making acquaintances. This may be off-putting to more reserved individuals.
On the other hand, try not to be too shy or bashful if approaching extroverted, socially outgoing people. In this instance, introducing yourself in an enthusiastic, slightly loud manner may do the trick.
Instead of approaching the whole group at once, try to catch an individual from the group instead. You could try saying this: ""Hi! My name is Cody. I think you and I might have English together 2nd period. You're Astor, right? Yeah, I really like Mr. Morgan's anatomy class too.""

, Spend some time with group members outside of the classroom and in more casual settings where your personality can really shine through.


Try out for the cheerleading squad or join the homecoming committee. Find an organized but laid back event where you can socialize and joke around with your peers.
Fitting in isn't just about showing similar interests, but bonding. If you can, find an activity that requires group problem solving and teamwork (sports are especially ideal). People tend to bond easily to others who are united in a common goal., Smiles are the universal sign of acceptance and tend to be contagious.Joking is very important in social circles. Smiling and laughing is a universal trait among all people, regardless of their interests.Humor hasn't just been proven to make oneself feel good, it has also been shown to spark positive feelings in others. People prefer others who make them feel good.Using self-deprecating humor is a great way of showing others that you don't take yourself so seriously. Say things like, ""I'm so stupid, I tried to do my own hair this morning and I ended up looking like Cruella Deville."" Being able to laugh at yourself puts others at ease with themselves.
Try to avoid humor that mocks or disparages others unless it is done in a playful atmosphere. Playing ""the dozens""with your friends can sometimes be a bonding experience so long as the focus is on humor and not on hurting feelings. Avoid playing insult-based games with peers whom you are not very familiar with, as this can come off as plain rude and offensive.

, Saying flattering things to people tends to make them like you more.


Make sure that your compliments are genuine. Saying random, insincere compliments can actually have an opposite effect and make people feel insulted.For example, instead of saying something generic like, ""Hey Deb, you're hair is so beautiful,"" try saying, ""Hey Deb, I really love how soft and healthy your hair looks. You have no split ends!""
Avoid over-complimenting a person. This is similar to being insincere in that it can make a person feel as though you are complimenting for shallow reasons.

, It's okay to talk about yourself once in a while, but for the most part, people love when others make them the center of attention.This is different than putting people on the spot in public. Don't randomly shine the spotlight on members of your group in front of others, as this could be embarrassing or insulting to quieter individuals. Instead, shift discussion to the other person when talking or interacting exclusively.
Saying empathetic statements is a good way to shift focus onto others. Saying things like, ""I understand how you feel,"" or ""So you liked the concert last night?"" are good conversation prompts to get others talking about themselves.Pepper in some personal info and opinions in between empathetic statements. This helps establish similarity and shows the other person you are actually listening.

, These are all reassuring behaviors that make others feel comfortable in your presence.


Nodding is another behavior that others tend to imitate. Studies have shown that nodding while listening to something makes you more likely to agree with it.If you nod while you talk to others, chances are they will nod back and agree with what you are saying.
Repeat words back in paraphrases, not word-for-word. Paraphrasing what others have just told you shows that you are actively listening to them, but repeating things word-for-word can come off like ""parroting"" and can insult the other person.Names are central to our identity, and hearing our names makes us feel validated as people. As a result, people are more likely to like you for saying their names., You will often have differing views on certain issues, but there are proper ways to convey your disagreement. Saying someone is wrong is often unnecessary and can be deeply insulting.


Instead of saying ""James, you are wrong for favoring capital punishment,"" ask ""Why do you believe in capital punishment?"" Listen to what they have to say, then seek to understand why they feel that way. Ask, ""Why do you believe that? Why do you feel it's right?"" Identify a common ground you share with them and then use that as a starting point to explain your position.For example: ""I hate crime too, and I think punishments are warranted, but...""
This is known as the ""Ransberger Pivot,"" and it works because it increases the chances of persuading others by sharing common ground first.Instead of flat-out disagreeing, you can correct others without them losing face.

, Now that you have gained acceptance by your peers, define yourself in a way that is unique but still in line with your group's identity.


Just because you want to fit in doesn't mean you can't excel. If you're the starting point guard on the junior varsity basketball team, wear your letterman jacket with pride. People are drawn to others who are talented but humble. Show pride but don't be cocky.
Being different is just as natural as wanting to fit in. Trying to satisfy one by ignoring the other will most likely have bad consequences, so find a good balance for yourself. Embrace what makes you different as well as what makes you similar.

Pick the right place to deliver the news.,
Pick the right time to tell him.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Love Him2," Though the place you chose won't affect how your boyfriend feels about you, it could help you deliver your message in a way that makes your boyfriend feel more comfortable. Telling him in the right place can also help set the mood. Here are some places to consider:


Pick a place that is special to both of you. It could be where you had your first date, your first kiss, or where you had an incredible conversation. It doesn't even have to be that romantic, as long as it means something to both of you.
Pick a romantic location. Tell him in a dimly-lit restaurant or a rose garden. The danger of picking a public spot is that it may make the situation more difficult if it doesn't go as you planned.
Tell him while you're going for a walk. Take a stroll through a beautiful part of your neighborhood. Stop him and tell him when it feels right.
Tell him when you're on vacation together. This is the perfect opportunity to take your love to the next level.

, Though timing isn't everything, picking the right time to tell your boyfriend you love him can help him be more receptive to your news, and can help you feel more comfortable about delivering it. Here are some things to consider when you're choosing the right time:


Pick a time when both of you are in a good mood and free from stress.
Don't tell him you love him if he has a big exam the next day, or he may have his mind on other things.
Tell him in the evening. Everything is more romantic in the dark.
Tell him at a time when you feel good about telling him. Remember that it has to be the right time for you, too.

"

Start with the right body language.,
Tell him you love him.,
Wait for his reaction.,
React appropriately.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Love Him3," Your body and face should tell your boyfriend how you're feeling before you say a word. You can already let him know that something is about to happen with the right look and the right gesture. Here are a few things you can do:


Maintain eye contact. You should stare him in the eyes without being too intense. Make him feel important.
Turn your entire body toward him. Let him know that he has your undivided attention.
Touch him lightly. Put your hand on his knee, graze his shoulder, or rub his back.

, Now that you have all your ducks in a row, there's no more holding back. You've been planning to share your feelings, and now's the time. You can make him feel comfortable by making small talk or laughing a little, but cut to the chase.


Relax. Take a deep breath before you give him the news. Tell yourself that you'll be relieved once you tell him.
Be direct. Don't beat around the bush. You can be cutesy or funny later, but love is a serious matter. Just say, ""I want you to know that I love you."" You can also say, ""I've fallen in love with you.""
Don't look away when you say it. The look in your eyes will show him your commitment.

, After you've given him your big news, take a minute to let him say something. Though you may be dying to say more about your feelings, remember that you've just told him something very important, and that he needs some time to consider it. Now, one of two things will happen:


In the best-case scenario, he will tell you that he shares your feelings and that he has been waiting to tell you how he feels.
He could also say that he is overwhelmed and needs some time to think about it.
The worst-case scenario is that he will be completely thrown off and tell you that he didn't think your relationship was so serious. If this happens, don't despair! You'll work through this.

, Whatever his reaction, your effort doesn't stop after you told your boyfriend that you love him. Once he tells you how he feels, you have to know what to do next to make sure the relationship is as strong as it could be.


If he tells you he shares your feelings, hug him, kiss him, and celebrate your love!
If he says he needs some time to think about what you've said, give him space. Don't pressure him or get upset. Respect that he needs more time to make a decision and don't ask him any questions or you could make things worse.
If he says he doesn't share your feelings, don't despair. For one thing, if you're really sure about your feelings and fairly certain about his, this probably won't happen. But if it does, be proud of yourself for opening up and doing something brave, and work on moving on.

Watch how she acts around you.,
If you guys weren't really friends before you liked her, the girl will probably not say or do anything that will let you know.,
Think about who you've told before.,
If she knows and doesn't like you she will probably still talk to you, and maybe avoid eye contact, she will still maybe want to be friends.

,
If she knows and does like you back she will talk to you more, walk near you, sit next to you, make eye contact, twirl her hair, or give you compliments.,
You may want to avoid her for some time to see if she eventually talks to you but you are making one of the biggest mistakes you can.",How to Tell if a Girl You Like Knows You Like Her if You Haven't Actually Told Her So," If you guys were friends before, if she knows you like her there may be more awkward silences. She may also avoid you a bit, even if she is interested, because she's not quite sure what to do. And if you guys are still friends, well then, great. Take it up from there.;
, Girls can be annoying that way. She may talk to you more, or completely ignore you. Basically, any drastic change in behavior is a good sign that she knows.

, If you told any of her friends or any of your friends that you both have in common that you like her, chances are she knows.

,, She may also be secretive about who she likes.

, You should talk to her more and that way she might be the one to say, ""I like you"" first.

"
"
Have confidence.,
Find out what classes she's in.,
Be inviting.,
Hang out outside of school.,
Find out what you have in common.,
Be truthful in your friendship.",How to Befriend a New Girl at School," Look yourself in the mirror and say that you are the most confident person out there and that you can do anything to get that girl's attention. Remember that the new girl is probably just as shy as you are and will be happy to have someone introduce themselves.


Say ""Hello"" first. Go up to the new girl and say hi to her. Ask what her name is and tell her yours.;
, Give her advice when it comes to certain teachers, and make sure she knows where all her classes are. Offer to give her a tour of the campus.

, The first few weeks are often hard, so try to make the new girl feel as welcome as possible. Invite her to sit with you at lunch, introduce her to your friends, and help her out with any other questions she has. Offer to exchange phone numbers or email addresses.

, Invite her to your house to do homework, or go out to dinner and talk. Get to know her, and let her get to know you.

, Not every new girl that comes your way will be the perfect match for you and your friend group. If you and this girl hit it off, awesome. If not though, don't stress about it. Just because you do everything right in welcoming her doesn't mean that you'll have compatible personalities.

, Don't force commonalities between you and this new girl. Remember that a friendship based on lies is doomed to fail.

Ask a small favor.The easiest way to begin a conversation with someone you want to talk to is to ask a favor.,
Ask a question about something the teacher said.,
Make her laugh.Girls love guys with a sense of humor, so try to make her laugh.,
Ask for her opinion on something related to class.You’re looking for anything that begins a speaking relationship with her, so make her feel like you want to know what she has to say.,
Give her a compliment.,
Choose the right time for your icebreaker.,
Move the conversation away from the classroom.,
Have a friendly, approachable demeanor.,
Find out what she’s interested in.Once you’ve broken the ice, you want to get to know each other.,
Share you interests with her.,
Get to know her friends.The best way to spend time with someone is to have friends in common with her.,
Make plans for future conversations.,
Talk to her outside of the classroom.,
Don’t be over-eager.,
Ask for her phone number.,
Ask her to hang out with you outside of school.",How to Talk to a Girl in Class," You don’t know this person yet, so you don’t know what you have in common. Asking a favor is a neutral way to enter into conversation without boring them with something they don’t care about.


Make sure it’s a small favor that won’t put her out.
For example, ask to borrow a pen or read their class notes to see something you missed.
If you don’t have your textbook, ask to look on with her. That way, you can sit closer to her, too!;
, Since you don’t know her very well yet, you might not know what she likes. The only thing you know for sure that you have in common is the class you’re in with her. Even if you understood the class lecture perfectly, ask her to clarify something the teacher said.


As opposed to asking a favor, which can result in a very quick interaction, asking someone to explain something to you will probably result in a longer conversation.
Keep the conversation going by asking follow-up questions.
If she didn’t understand either, show solidarity! Let her know that you’re in it together, and that you have something in common.

, Make eye contact with her when somebody says something silly, or roll your eyes when the teacher assigns homework. Make sure you’re not disrupting class, though, or drawing the teacher’s attention. Getting in trouble will not impress her!

, Ask her something related to class, like what she thinks is going to be on the next test, or how many hours she’s planning on putting into preparation for a presentation.


Don’t talk over her when she gives her opinion. Let her talk for as long as she wants, and show interest in what she has to say.

, Giving compliments is a lot trickier than it sounds. You may think “who doesn’t like getting a compliment?” but you should always be respectful of girls when complimenting them. Always complimenting girls on how pretty they are sends the message that you only like them for their looks, and most girls don’t like to be made to feel that way.Compliment her on something she actually had to work for, rather than something she was born with. This might be related to her appearance or not.


Compliment her on her hairstyle on a particular day instead of her eyes.
Compliment her on an outfit she put together.
Tell her you liked her answer to a question in class.
Congratulate her for doing well on a test if you see she got a good grade.

, Don't bother her with questions or favors if you see that she's concentrating on something or she's late and has to run to her next class. If you have a class with her, you're going to see her every day, so wait for a time when she seems relaxed and in a good mood to break the ice with her.

, Since you know you have at least your class in common, that’s a great way to start getting to know each other — by talking about the work, the teacher, your classmates, etc. But over time, you want to get to know other parts of each other, too, so talk about things that have nothing to do with class, or even school.

, Don’t try to hard to be “cool.” What you think looks “cool” might come off as distant or condescending. It’s much easier for a girl to talk to a guy who’s just being himself — open and honest.


Smile and laugh easily — girls love guys who enjoy themselves.
Face your body toward her when you’re speaking to her.
Don’t be afraid to make eye contact with her when you’re talking.

, Try to find out what she’s interested in. Ask what her favorite classes are, whether she does any after-school activities, and what she likes to do in her spare time.


Try to steer conversations toward topics that interest her.
This will make her look forward to talking to you, since she’ll know you enjoy listening to her talk about something she loves.

, You want her to get to know you, too, so talk about the things that are important to you. If you just let her talk about herself all the time, then eventually, you’ll stop liking her because you’ll feel like the friendship is all about her. It’s important to maintain a balance, so you’re both sharing parts of your life with each other equally.


Be open and honest. Don’t just talk about the things you think she wants to hear about — talk about the things that are actually important to you.
Use your discretion. There are some things that you shouldn’t talk about with someone you don’t know very well, so start with topics that are harmless and light.
Try to keep a balance between how much you talk and how much she talks.

, Hanging out in a group with mutual friends will be less nerve-wracking than talking to each other one-on-one, and you’ll be more relaxed and at ease, making her like you more. People’s friends are very important to them, so she’ll like you more if she sees that you get along with her friends.


Talk to her friends even when she’s not around. You don’t want people to think that you’re using them just to get to a girl.
Make real friendships with them, not hollow ones. If you like this girl, you’ll probably like the people she chooses to surround herself with, too.

, The best way to make sure you’ll get to talk to her again is to make a plan about how you’re going to do it! If you’re talking during a set period of time — lunch break, for example — then you can say that you had something you wanted to tell her that you’ll tell her next time you talk.


For example, say “remind me to tell you about what Mr. Smith said in class last week! It was so funny!”
Tell her you’ll see her at a different time — for example, “I’ll see you in English,” or “are you eating lunch in the courtyard today?”
Ask her if she’ll be at mutual social events: “Are you going to Becky’s party this weekend? I can return your notes then.”

, Sit with her at lunch, or talk to her between classes if you see her hanging out by her locker. The more she sees you and talks to you outside of the classroom context, the more she’ll see you as a friend instead of just as a classmate.

, You want to show interest in her, but you don’t want her to think you’re stalking her! Play it cool — don’t be around every single corner she turns. Try to get into a routine where you talk to her at the same times every day — for example, between two particular classes, or at lunch, or before or after school. That way, you can be confident that you’ll see her every day and not feel like you have to chase her around.


From time to time, you might even skip talking to her for a day or two. Give her a little time to miss hanging out with you, and she’ll look forward to your company even more.

, When you’re talking to somebody outside of school entirely, you’re on your way to being more than just classmates. However, a good, neutral way to ask for somebody’s number is to say that you want to ask a question about class.


Use the number to ask questions about class at first, so she doesn’t feel like you tricked her into giving you her phone number.
Send text messages instead of calling her for a conversation. You won’t be as nervous, and she won’t feel as much pressure.
After sending a couple texts about homework or due dates, begin sending messages every once in a while about annoying things your parents say, or something funny you saw at the mall.

, Depending on how old you are, your parents might not allow you to hang out with girls one-on-one, but you should invite her to hang out in groups with mutual friends. If she’s not close with your group of friends, invite some of her close friends as well. Make sure she feels comfortable accepting your invitation and hanging out.


Choose a public place like the mall or the movies.
Get some food, like pizza or burgers.
Make sure to pay attention to her and talk to her, even though there are other people around.

Notice if she glances at you constantly or tilts her head when she speaks to you.,
Look for nervous gestures like playing with her hair or her jewelry.,
Notice if she blushes when you talk to her.",How to Tell if a Girl Likes You in Middle School1," Most girls will stare at the guy they are interested in. Bolder girls will hold your gaze when caught glancing or staring at you. But shy girls may suddenly turn their heads away and act as though nothing happened. So notice if she tend to stare or glance at you during class or in a big group of friends.If a girl tilts her head and smiles when she speaks to you, this could be a sign of interest. Smiling at you and moving her head to one side could mean she’s trying to flirt with you.;
, If she displays nervous gestures around you, like playing with strands of her hair or fidgeting with her necklace, this could means she is nervous because she is interested in you., Blushing is a natural phenomenon, after all, and an involuntary sign that someone is embarrassed or nervous. If she turns red in your presence, this may be a sign she is nervous because of her feelings for you."
"
Ask a friend to talk to her.,
Notice if her friends giggle or act nervous in front of you.,
Talk to her friends about her.",How to Tell if a Girl Likes You in Middle School2," Maybe there is a good friend of yours who is also friends with your crush. Or someone in your class who is known to be a good messenger between nervous girls and nervous guys.Using a friend to find out if a girl likes you is a good way to avoid an awkward first conversation with her. It also gives you a chance to work up the courage to talk to her about your feelings once you know through a friend that she is interested in you.Look for someone in your grade who gets along well with the girls and the guys in your class. You want to be sure the messenger you send will be able to talk to her about your feelings, and not embarrass you in the process!

, No matter how shy the girl you are interested might be, her friends will likely know how she feels about you. So, pay attention to how her friends act around you. If they giggle nervously or glance quickly from her to you, these may be signs that she is interested in you., Ask them if she is single or interested in anyone in your grade. But don’t be too aggressive with your questions, as you don’t want to freak out her friends. If she is into you, her friends will likely indicate to you that you stand a good chance with her."
"
Say hello to her and have a casual conversation.,
Pay attention to her in a group.,
Don’t be afraid to flirt.,
Be brave enough to ask her out.",How to Tell if a Girl Likes You in Middle School3," A girl is more comfortable and open with someone she knows, even in passing. So don’t be afraid to say “hi” in the hallway between classes or strike up a conversation during lunch.This will also keep you on her radar and remind her you are someone worth getting to know better.
Use her name when you speak to her and use open body language like eye contact, arms by your sides, and smiling.
This doesn’t mean you need to hound her with conversation every time you see her. A wave or “hello” in the halls is a casual way to focus her attention on you.

, If you are already friends with her, you may find yourself hanging out together in a group of friends. Take the time to talk to her one on one in the group and listen to her when she speaks. This will allow you to note her body language and attitude towards you. It will also show that you are interested in her, despite the other friends surrounding you., Compliment her outfit or her hairstyle when you see her in the halls. Tease her about her texting habits, if you are both already friendly. Joke around about mutual friends you have or interests that you both share. Flirt with her in a way that is casual and friendly, rather than intense or creepy. If she responds with a compliment, a joke, or even blushing, she is likely flirting back, a sure sign she is interested in you., Perhaps the most certain way to know for sure if she likes you is to bite the bullet and ask her out. Many girls appreciate someone who can be honest and confident enough to express their feelings and make a move.


Write a note about your feelings and pass them to her via a friend in class. Or ask her if she has a date for the upcoming dance or any plans after school.
While you could easily text her and ask her out, talking to her in person shows you are willing to express your feelings to her face to face."

Consider why they need to know.,
Be mature.,
Prepare yourself.,
Map out possible questions and answers.,
Pick a time.,
Tell them.,
Introduce them.",How to Start Talking to Your Parents About Your First Relationship," If your parents won't benefit from knowing, why tell them? Is it because you want to bring the person home? Is it because you're bad at keeping secrets? Whatever the reason is, consider whether they really need to know. Parents can and have forced break ups, is them knowing really necessary? Think about it before continuing.;
, If you approach your parents giggling or smiling, they'll think that you're immature. This isn't great for you as many parents won't let their child date because they think that they're not mature enough. By showing your parents that you're mature enough to openly talk about a relationship, they'll realise that you're mature enough to handle a relationship. If it helps, practice being mature in front of a mirror.

, Before you just approach your parents about something like this, you need some form of preparation. Whether you're writing out what you're going to say or just telling yourself ""I'm ready"", with no preparation the conversation will just fall apart, leaving you looking like a fool. Preparation will also make you look mature because your parents will see that you've thought long and hard about your relationship and their feelings.

, Well obviously, if you tell your parents that you're dating someone, they're going to have a load of questions for you. Be sure to prepare yourself for this too, you don't want to cave in under all the pressure. Nobody knows your parents like you do, therefore nobody knows what questions they'll ask. This step is all independent work, don't listen to your friends on this one. While you're the only one that knows what your parents will ask, there are some basic things that all parents ask. These are:


""How long have you been dating?""
""What is his/her name?""
""What class/year are they in?""
""How do you know them?"" A pathetic one, yes, but all parents ask it. Don't answer something pathetic like ""School"". Your parents want to know everything about how you met. An example of a good answer would be ""Well we always hang out, they're in my class too. We've been close friends for quite a while now. A friend introduced me to him/her and we've been close ever since"".

, You can speak to one parent or both at the same time, it's whatever is easier. Note that you shouldn't just tell one parent, the other will get to hear eventually and feel angry that you never told them. A good time to catch parents would be when no other siblings are around and when they're in a good mood. Don't tell them after a huge argument and never shout it in the heat of the moment. Don't tell them when they're tired either, it'll just wind them up. If it helps, go for a walk and tell them on the way. Although it's more pressure, they'll see how much it means to you.

, You should have planned how you're going to break the news a few steps back. Ask your parents how they feel about teen dating. Ask them to give a detailed answer, stating what they believe is wrong and what the believe is right. The same way you're making it clear to them about dating this person, they need to make it clear to you about how they feel about it. After they've told you, they'll probably finish with ""why?"". Now's the time to tell them. Don't rush to answer all the questions, wait for them to ask. Who knows, they might even just laugh it off.

, From going all formal and having them over for dinner to a quick flash of a Facebook profile picture, your parents will probably appreciate knowing what the person looks like and who they actually are. If you're showing them a picture, avoid ones where the person is drinking alcohol or smoking, cuddling you or just being plain silly. A good mature picture will do the job ten times better. However, if you show a photo of you and your date having fun and being happy, your parents might notice how much you like them.

Let go of your fear.,
Talk to her.,
Make small talk!,
If she sits next to you or nearby you in class, try making audible but quiet comedic remarks to her.",How to Talk to a Girl You Would Like to Date but Are Too Afraid to Approach1," Getting rid of your fear to talk to her is the most difficult part, but just remember:


We are all equal, we all get nervous, and we are all human.
Most girls aren't mean or rude, so if they don't want to talk to you, they won't hurt your feelings
It's better approaching her and knowing the outcome, than never doing it and being left wondering what would've happened.;
, Find some natural reason to introduce yourself. A good conversation starter is just getting to know her if you don't already. If she's talking to a friend, listen (but don't stalk!) their conversation a bit, and then jump in with a witty comment like, ""Hey, you like Harry Potter too!"" If the girl is not talking to anyone, comment on her outfit or the book she is holding or the class she's in. Then start the conversation!


If you've talked to her before, and she knows who you are then it shouldn't be too difficult. If not, all you've got to do is introduce yourself and have a conversation.

, Making small talk is a great way to get a feel for if the girl likes you or not. Making small talk could be as easy as asking about the weather, a homework assignment or commenting about a school event. Based off her reaction and response length, you can get a pretty good idea if she is interested in you.


For example, if your school football team won a sectional title, you could say ""Hey, did you see the game last night?"". This will open up for a great conversation. If the girl says she didn't see the game though, don't press her with details about what happened and give her a play-by-play synopsis. Instead, turn the conversation toward her and ask her if she plays or follows any sports.

, For example, in class if your teacher is handing out a writing assignment, say something funny like ""Geez, I'm scared. This looks like a lot of writing."" Make it loud enough for her to hear. If she engages in conversation about your comment, that's great news! It means she was actually listening to you. If she doesn't, this could possibly mean that you were too quiet and she didn't hear you, or she was surprised you were talking to her. Keep trying though, and sooner or later she will respond.

"
"
Make her a mixtape.,
Write a poem.,
Write her a song.",How to Tell an Emo Girl You Love Her1," Find some emo songs that you think she will like, and burn them onto a CD for her. Don't just throw the songs haphazardly on the CD—spend time arranging them until you find the perfect order with the smoothest transition between songs (pay attention to genre, rhythm, lyrics, etc).


Consider putting a recording of you talking in between songs or at the end of the playlist. Tell her how you feel about her. If you want you can give a sentence or two explanation of why you chose one or two of your favorite songs on the list.
Include a note. If you don't want to record your voice, give her the CD with a piece of paper listing all the songs and the artists. On the back of the paper, write her a short note explaining that you love her.;
, Some emos are into poetry. Try writing her a poem that expresses your feelings about her. If you know her well, try to reflect that in the poem by telling her why you feel the way you do. Then, give it to her the next time you see her.


If you want, you can keep your identity a secret. Put the poem in her mailbox or school locker when she's not around, or put it in an envelope and give it to a friend to give her. However, if you do this, realize that you may never know if she loves you back.
Write multiple poems. If you want to wait a while and gauge her reactions, write her a series of poems. Use one or two of the same verses from the previous poem, so that she knows it's definitely the same guy. Then write a couple of different verses, too. With the last poem, write a couple of stanzas about who you are.

, If you're musically talented, write the emo girl a song telling her that you love her. Then, record yourself playing and singing it and email it to her or send it to her in a message. If you're feeling really daring, you can also find a way to perform it for her!

Have reasonable expectations for middle school dating.,
Ask people out with confidence.,
Don't be afraid to talk about the way you feel.,
Take things very slowly.,
Treat your relationship as a learning experience.,
Have a relationship to make yourself happy; not anyone else.,
Avoid the drama queens and kings.,
Don't neglect other, more important things.,
Don't tolerate disrespect.,
Keep things in perspective.",How to Survive Middle School Dating," It's important to remember that, compared to the relationships you'll have late in life, dating in middle school isn't that big of deal. This doesn't mean that it's impossible to meet the person you'll marry in middle school or that it's impossible to have your heart broken. It does mean that, in a few years, you probably won't still be thinking about your middle school relationships. Here are just a few things to keep in mind:


No middle schooler is an expert at dating yet; almost no one knows what to do and mistakes are common.
Most middle school relationships don't last beyond middle school.
You can't drive yet and you probably don't have much money, so going on ""real"" dates is difficult.;
, If you want to date in middle school, it's not usually enough to just wait around for someone to ask you out. If you want romance, you need to go get it! This can be scary, but for many people, it feels worse to stay silent and wonder what would have happened if you had spoken up.


Asking someone out in middle school shouldn't be a big, dramatic production. If you have a crush on someone, just find them when no one else is around and ask something like, ""Hey, do you want to come hang out at my house over the weekend?"" If they say yes and you have a good time together, you can tell them you like them.
If you ask someone else and get a ""no,"" don't feel too bad. This doesn't mean you've done anything wrong — there are lots of reasons why someone may not want to date. For example, the person you ask out may just not want to date in middle school (which is perfectly OK).

, Talking about your emotions is one of the hardest but most important skills you can learn for grown-up relationships. Being in a relationship with someone may make you feel ways you're not used to. For example, when you get your first boyfriend or girlfriend, you may find yourself feeling jealousy for the first time. The important thing is to be open about the way you feel. Closing yourself off from your friends, family, and especially your partner is a good way to put stress on your relationship.

, You may not like to hear it, but you're not an adult yet. Don't try to make your relationship more mature than it needs to be. While every situation is different, you should always date someone because they are fun and they make you happy. You shouldn't date because you want to get to grown-up experiences like kissing, making out, and having sex as quickly as possible. For now, concentrate on having fun together with your partner — the rest can come later.


It's A-OK if all you do with your boyfriend or girlfriend is hold hands or hug. Don't let gossip at school make you feel like you're ""falling behind."" You're definitely not.

, In middle school, no one has the experience to really ""know what they're doing"" in a relationship. For this reason, you and your partner will probably make lots of mistakes. Don't get too hung up on these; you're learning from each one. When you get into more mature relationships later, you will have a better idea of how to date and what you do and do not like in someone.


For example, if you date someone who frustrates you by never responding to your texts, in the future you can try to date someone who values communication.

, As a general rule, don't worry about what other people think when you're dating in middle school. Trusted friends and family members can offer good advice, but you should be dating mainly for your own satisfaction. For example, don't choose your partners or change your behavior to fit in with popular kids. Relationships require a lot of effort, so why would you get into one to make someone else happy?


This advice is also true when you're not with someone. Don't feel pressured to get into a relationship because some of your friends are in one. There is no shame in not having a boyfriend or girlfriend (especially in middle school)

, Almost every middle school has people whose social lives seem to dominate every conversation. These people may seem to act like they are in a trashy reality show — they constantly seem to be getting into drama. They will most likely have boyfriends and girlfriends, but they may often get into big, showy conflicts with each other. Stay away from these people. They may seem popular, but it will be hard to find examples of good relationships among them.

, If you get into a relationship in middle school, there's a good chance that it's your very first one. Since you don't have much experience, it may seem like your new relationship is more important than anything else you have to worry about. It isn't. While relationships later in life can become this important, you have more important priorities in middle school. Here are just a few things that you should concentrate on more than your middle school relationship:


Your own happiness
Your health
Your schoolwork
Your hobbies
Having good relationships with your friends and family

, Just because middle school relationships aren't a big deal doesn't mean that you can't get hurt. Never let your partner treat you in a way that hurts your feelings or makes you feel less important than you are. Stand up for yourself — let your partner know that things like lying, name-calling, and cheating won't be tolerated.


If your partner won't stop after a few warnings, don't hesitate to break things off with him or her. Don't cling to a bad relationship because you're afraid you can't get another — there will be many, many opportunities in your life.

, It may be hard to hear this, but middle school relationships aren't usually very important to people later in life. For most people, the relationships that come in high school, college, and beyond have much more of an effect on life. So, try to treat middle school as a ""test drive"" for what will come later. You can learn a lot from middle school relationships, but the best relationships of your life are ahead of you, so don't get too wrapped up in them! Things like breakups may seem huge today, but you will laugh at how small they were in just a few years.


Try to avoid using the word ""love"" to describe your relationship. This word can make it seem like you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. Since most middle school relationships don't last forever, this is just setting yourself up for hurt later.

Get into conversations.,
Become friends with her.,
Text her.,
Make sure that the two of you are compatible.,
See if she wants to hang out in a group.,
Make sure she isn't already interested in or dating someone.,
Play it cool, but don't make her think that you aren't interested.,
Invite her to hang out one-on-one.",How to Talk to a Girl You Would Like to Date but Are Too Afraid to Approach2," Casually talk about stuff she likes and dislikes. Start by just having conversations with her. Ask her about her siblings or other little things. For example, ""How are Jimmy and Sarah doing?"" or, ""That blue shirt brings out your eyes."" Girls like it when you remember little things.


Find out things you have in common, like a favorite band or sport. That will give you a common subject to talk about.
If you go to school together, walk up to her in the halls and say hello after you've talked in class a couple times. You will make a good impression if you do nice things, like holding a door for her to go through or tying her shoe if you notice it has come undone.
Do not go out of your way to do these things all the time. She will think it is weird instead of sweet.

, Many guys prefer to cut to the chase, but if she is worth asking out, it is worth building a friendship. If you ask her out without getting to know her first, she might turn you down just because she doesn't know enough about you to say yes.

, Text or chat with her for long periods of time. Girls love it when this happens. After you've texted her for a while and you think she's good enough friends with you, try to ask her who she likes. Make sure she asks you too, otherwise it will most likely end up being a different guy. Also try to make it late—that's extra cute!

, Do you have common interests? Are you around the same age? If you are going to date this girl, make sure that she is someone with whom you actually want to spend a lot of time. It is easy to build up unrealistic fantasies in your head, but it isn't always easy to gauge whether you would truly be happy with someone. try talking about what motivates her and by so doing you will create a bond between you too.

, Ask her and some of your other friends if they would like to go somewhere such as the mall or movies. Eventually if you two are comfortable with each other you could ask her to hang out at your house with a group of people. A group of people will make it seem less awkward.


Don't ask her specifically to something and build it up. Instead, arrange something with a group of friends and say she is welcome to come along. That way, if she can't make it, no harm done and you can recover from the rejection without problems. Experienced daters have all been rejected at one point or another so don't dwell on it.
When inviting her out, it has to be something fun that isn't a big deal for her to join in on. You want to avoid the awkward staring at your hands/feet mumbling about ""what she is up to that weekend"".

, If she is already dating someone, then that is her business, and you need to respect it. If she's obviously interested in someone else, then it might be worth your while to win her over—but do not get your hopes up. although if she is dating someone keep hanging out with her, if you don't she will likely forget about you; if her boyfriend starts to think you like her or trying to steal her just tell him ""we have a lot of fun together and she is a good friend but i wouldn't date her if you were.."" then just wait for them to break up(young relationships don't last long). if they do not break up after a while tell her how you feel about her and after a while she might break up with that other guy and start dating you.

, When you two start hanging out a lot, people will start talking and wondering if you two are dating or if you have a ""thing."" If people ask you about it, just say, ""we like hanging out,"" or, ""we have a lot of fun together."" Never say, ""we are just friends."" This will give her the wrong impression.

, Ask her if she would like to hang out sometime, but don't make it sound like a date. As you spend more time with her, invite fewer and fewer people, so that eventually you can just say, ""Want to hang out this weekend?"" If she says no thanks, don't drop it yet. She is likely not comfortable enough with you, but she may come around if you keep talking to her. You could explain that it wouldn't be a date, just going to the movies as friends, or hanging out and going swimming.

"
"
Aim to ask her out somewhere you feel comfortable.,
Know that you don't need a large romantic gesture to ask someone out.,
Prepare what you want to say if you feel nervous.,
Have a specific date in mind.,
Go ahead and say it, even if it feels awkward.,
Be honest.,
Relax and go slowly.",How to Talk to a Girl You Would Like to Date but Are Too Afraid to Approach3," You want to find a place that is quiet, somewhat secluded, and easily accessible. Most importantly, do it in a location where you feel relaxed and confident. The better you feel about things, the more relaxed and assured you will be when you finally ask her out.


Make sure she is in a good mood as well -- if she had a terrible day or seems cross, wait until she is in a better mood.
Whenever possible, ask her out in person. It may be harder and more nerve-wracking, but you're more likely to succeed and can gauge her response in person.

, Movies and TV have conditioned many people to think that the only way to get the girl is a big, expressive moment. But that couldn't be farther from the truth in the real world. Simply pulling her aside after class or work, catching her on her way out the door, or sitting next to each other on the bus is enough. It is not what you do that really matters here, it is what you say.

, Don't try and over-rehearse the conversation, as you cannot predict what she is going to say. However, practice keeping it brief and saying what you want to say quickly and easily. 1-2 sentences should suffice. Some ideas include:


""I've really enjoyed spending time together, and I'd love to take you on a date.""
""Would you want to go out with me on a date this weekend?""
""Let's grab dinner sometime, just the two of us?""
""I really enjoy your friendship, and I'd like to try taking things a step further.""

, At the very least, be ready to offer one or two days that work for you. Asking with specifics is a much better way to gauge her answer. If she wants to go on a date, have a suggestion ready:


""Great! How about dinner on Thursday?"" or ""There is a great play Saturday at 8 I was interested in, want to join me?""
Have at least one back-up date in case she is busy, or ask her when a good time is if that fails too.

, And the end of the day, you just have to blurt it out. It is not easy, but it is the only way to do it. Keep it short and to the point. ""I really like you, and I'd love to go out on a date sometime,"" should suffice. Remember why you want to talk to her, and know that any answer is better than sitting and waiting for one.


Count to 3 and make yourself ask when you get to zero.
Avoid talking too much beforehand. Say hello, ask how she is doing, then get right to the point. The longer you wait, the colder your feet are going to get.
Once you know you want to ask her out, you need to go ahead and do it.

, If she is going to ditch you because of a little initial awkwardness, is she worth dating? Just be yourself and put yourself out there, even if you are nervous, awkward, weird, or uncomfortable. Do you best to launch into the conversation.


""I'm a bit nervous to say this, but...""
""I know I seem kind of awkward, but I want you to know how I feel.""

, Take as much time progressing the ""dating"" relationship as you did progressing the 'friend' relationship. You don't need to dive into anything.

"
"
Get to know her.,
Avoid pickup lines.,
Wait until you're alone together.,
Let her know that you love her.",How to Tell an Emo Girl You Love Her2," The more you know about an emo girl's true self (rather than the image she projects), the more likely she is to understand that you truly love her. Spend lots of time hanging out with her, and always be supportive when she needs you. Showing her that you're always there for her will help her be less scared when you tell her that you love her.

, Emo girls are very wary when it comes to love, and they are not likely to trust you at first sight. Avoid cheesy pickup lines that could be used on any girl, as this will make it look like you're just trying to get some. Emo girls are good at picking up sensitive emotions, so even if you feel awkward, just say what you feel. She will appreciate the honesty and be more likely to respond positively.

, An emo girl has a reputation to uphold, and it may seem like you're attacking her if you tell her in front of bunches of people, no matter how close you are. Tell her in a private place that's not a bedroom (so it doesn't just look like you want to hook up). Be ready for rejection at first, and don't get mean or upset if she says she's not interested—emo girls are in the habit of rejecting people who try to get too close for fear of getting close.

, Be ready to answer her if she asks why you love her. Emo girls are used to being judged and used, so know enough about her that you can say more than ""I love you because you're pretty."" This may make it seem like you're just trying to get a pretty girlfriend. This is especially scary if you're not an emo yourself, as commenting only on her looks may make it seem like you'll want her to change her style in the future.

Assess the seriousness of the relationship.,
Decide what the occasion warrants.,
Consider an experience gift.,
Set a budget for a purchased gift.,
Take note of their interests.,
Solve a problem.,
Slip questions into conversation that will give you more ideas.,
Go shopping!,
Wrap your gift.,
Add a card.",How to Pick the Perfect Gift for Your Boyfriend or Girlfriend in Middle School," If you just started dating, you don’t want to give a huge gift. If you’ve been dating for a while, giving just a card will come across as rude or uncaring. Determine what the last gift-giving occasion was for the two of you. What did you receive from them? Let that help you gauge the type of gift you should give.


If the last thing they gave you was a cool book, you could give them a book or movie in return, but you probably shouldn't give them a nice watch or piece of jewelry.
If the last gift you received from them was incredibly thoughtful, like a photograph in a frame, or homemade cookies, you should go for a similarly thoughtful and personalized gift, and not something impersonal, like a gift card.;
, Giving a birthday present is very different from giving a Valentine's Day gift. If you are giving a gift because of an accomplishment (they were just in a play, they made a team, etc.) that may be cause for a different type of gift. Take stock of the situation and decide if you should purchase a sweet or romantic gift, a ""thinking of you"" gift, a fun gift, or something similar.


A birthday gift will most likely be opened in front of an audience. Birthday gifts are normally not as romantic or deeply personal as a Valentine's Day or anniversary gift.
If the gift is for an accomplishment, consider the accomplishment. Flowers are appropriate for many performing arts occasions, while nice pens or certificate holders may be more appropriate for an academic achievement.

, Regardless of how long you’ve been dating, an experience gift could be one way to show you remembered and that you care without having to decide how big of a purchase you should make. These can be as simple as going bowling or mini golfing if that is something they love to do, or as elaborate as going to see their favorite band in concert. Science even says that recipients value these gifts more, because they can look back at the memories with fondness for a long time to come. , Based on what you decided in Step One, and if you decided an experience gift wasn’t right for you, set a budget for your gift. This will help narrow down your options and guide your decision-making. Are your parents willing to help? Did they tell you how much they would give you? Or are you paying for this out of your allowance or with money from a job? Have that number in mind going forward.


Don't forget your budget will need to cover the gift, materials to wrap the gift if you don't have those at home, a card, and any batteries or other necessary accessories for the gift.
Don't worry too much about having a small budget. You can always make your gift extra special by creating all or part of it yourself, like baking something or creating a scrapbook or picture frame. If your gift is exceptionally thoughtful, they won't even notice if it cost a little less.

, A great source of inspiration could be their general interests. Use this information to decide what gift to give. By using this method, you can be confident they will like their gift. Look in their locker for ideas—what posters or photos do they display? Those could be clues as to what else they may like.
Are they in clubs? Do they always talk about certain topics? Use all of this information to decide what gift to give.

, One way to get a gift they are sure to love is to solve a problem for them. This could be a gift that they’ve been meaning to purchase for themselves but always forget, or it could just solve one of life’s little annoyances or make a task easier for them. Are they always complaining about needing something for their locker? That is something they will appreciate, and it shows you listen.
Have you noticed their wallet is falling apart, or they are always losing their pens? A new wallet or a cool set of pens with something to hold them in would solve those problems!

, Leading up to the occasion, listen intently in conversations and ask follow up questions that would give you additional gift ideas to consider. When done naturally, they won’t even notice you are asking because you are thinking of what to give them!


If you are talking about bands, you could say, “If you like them so much, why don’t you have any posters or t-shirts?” They may say they want them, or they may say they don’t like the band that much, or some other reason they don’t want the merchandise.
If a topic comes up briefly in conversation, you can ask for their opinion, “My family likes to go bowling a lot. Do you like to go bowling, or do you like mini golf better?”

, This is the fun part! Now that you have your ideas, ask your parent or friend if they can take you to a store to buy your gift. Have several solid ideas before you go, so if the store doesn't carry one item, or if you find it is out of your budget, you still have another option. Once at the store, look for your gift and make your purchase!


Don't forget to purchase any batteries or secondary items they may need for their gift to work. It's no fun to get a gift you can't use without buying extra parts!
If you are looking for something very specific, check online-- just make sure you have your parent's permission to use a credit card and make a purchase.

, Now that the gift is purchased, decide how you'll want to present it to them. Taking the time to nicely wrap a gift shows that you put time and effort into their gift, even before they unwrap it.


A gift bag may fit better in your locker if you need to give your gift at school. It also can fit better in a backpack and is easier to use than wrapping paper if you are worried about how well you can wrap.
Use ribbon or bows to make the package look prettier. They can be purchased in any color, so it can even be customized to your significant other's favorite colors!

, Many people keep cards as momentos. A card is a great place to briefly write why you gave them a present (""Happy Birthday!"" or ""Congratulations on your leading role!"") and let them know why you chose that gift or what they mean to you.If it is an experience, like a nice dinner out or going to see a movie, still give them a card explaining what their gift is so they understand you didn’t forget and even after the date is over they will have something to keep to remember it by.
You can buy your card at a store, or you can make one yourself. Even if you aren't very crafty, you can make one using a computer and fun pictures.

Dress well.,
Stop viewing this person as your crush.,
Be enthusiastic, pleasant and confident.,
Be positive from the outset.,
Let your date talk about themselves more than you talk about yourself.,
Be thoughtful and considerate.,
Tell your date what a wonderful date you've had together.",How to Start Dating Your Crush," Stay within your usual style but ensure that it's neat, clean and fresh-smelling. Even go so far as to iron your clothes, it's a novelty not much attended to anymore but screams stylish and attentive to the small details. It'll be a great way to impress your crush-turned-date.


Ensure that your hair is neat or casually styled messy.
Don't overdo the clothing. This person has said yes to dating you because he or she already likes the way you're presenting yourself.;
, Now that he or she is a date, start using this term instead. This helps you to accept the transition from dreaming about the person to actually spending time with him or her. Watch out if you don't make this transition, as you could be setting the poor person up for a fall when he or she doesn't live up to your expectations born of dreaming.

, Tell yourself the date is going to go well and act in this fashion. You've been crushing over this person for ages, now it's time to actually get to know him or her, so see this as a great opportunity, not a scare-fest.

, Always speak positively about people you know that he or she can relate to. This reveals that you're no gossip and that you're a supportive kind of person. And aim to keep the conversation as positive as possible. You and your date can carry on together with positive comments, while negative things are usually a conversation stopper.


Crack some jokes if you're comfortable doing so. Ensure that they're genuinely funny and avoid any jokes that require the debasing of others.
Be self-deprecating. You could even mention some funny facts about how things were for you when you were crushing on your date and how great it is now that you're actually dating.

, This gives them power to speak comfortably and freely about themselves which they will enjoy. Ask plenty of questions to encourage your date to talk and tell more about themselves. This is both polite and an important part of replacing your mysterious fantasies with the actual facts.

, Offer a drink or bite to eat. This will show that you care about him or her. Be certain to ask in a sincere way.

, Lead up to asking for a second date, or for hanging around together a whole lot more. If things have gone well, your date will likely say yes.

Take a break from your ex-boyfriend.,
Think about what went wrong.,
Make a game plan for addressing the problem.,
Work on yourself.",How to Make Your Ex Boyfriend Want You Back1," You may be dying to be back with your ex-boyfriend, but the worst thing you can do is hang around him incessantly, call him, or wink at him in class until he gets the picture. If you're always around, he probably does get the picture, but it won't be one that he likes. Instead, you should take a breather and stop hanging around him, at least for a few weeks or longer.


You can decide whether you want to cut off contact completely, or if that's impossible because of school.
Stop calling or texting him. Even if you think of something funny that reminds you of him, it's better to hold off.
Try to avoid seeing him at all, even when you're hanging out with mutual friends. If you do catch yourselves at the same party, you don't have to be rude to him, but you shouldn't spend too much time talking to him.
You don't have to be rude to take a break from your ex. If you do run into him, you don't have to run away, but you don't have to linger and talk about nothing either.;
, While you distance yourself from your boyfriend, you'll be in a good position to reflect on the problems in the relationship. If you want to get your man back, then you have to figure out what it was that went wrong, so you don't do it all over again. The problem could be simple, or it could take a bit longer to figure out. Here are some of the things that could have gone wrong:


Maybe you were too jealous or controlling, and he couldn't handle it anymore.
Maybe you didn't spend enough time together.
Maybe he felt like you weren't caring or affectionate enough.
Maybe he felt like you were too clingy and were always around.
Maybe there was a situational change, like one of you having to move to a different town, or maybe he was leaving for college in just a few months and wanted to break it off.
Maybe you were just always fighting and didn't get along.

, Once you figure out what went wrong in the relationship - which could be a combination of problems instead of just one - it's time to think about how you can make things different next time. You don't want to make your ex-boyfriend want you back if you'll just run into the same problems and drama all over again.


You need to work on making some big changes, whether it's controlling an aspect of your personality that led to the downfall of the relationship, or to think about how you can change the dynamics of the relationship if it started again.
If the problem was that you were jealous, you need to think about how you can be less jealous.
If he thought you were too bossy or controlling, you need to tone down that aspect of your personality.
If you fought all the time, you can think about how you can be less combative.
If the problem had to do more with him, then you can think about how you can be together again without this issue -- maybe he'll be willing to change. But if he's not willing to change and you know this will be an issue long term, then you should consider whether or not it's worth it to get him back.

, Take some time to work out whatever problem may have ended your relationship, and just spend time enjoying your own company or hanging out with friends. Make a list of three flaws that you'd like to change about yourself, and slowly start to address them. It takes a lifetime to grow as a person, but even taking small steps to become your ideal steps can help your relationship.


If you have some quality ""me time,"" your ex will start to wonder where you are. If you're busy focusing on yourself, that will make him think about you even more.
Spend time with your girlfriends, working out, or pursuing your favorite hobbies.
Take some time to work on yourself, but not too much time. If you spend months addressing your issues and completely fall out of the picture, your ex may have moved on.

Get out.,
Find venues where people hang out and talk, as opposed to venues where people go to be distracted or shop.,
If you are in high school, make friends with some guys from a public school through competitive extracurricular activities or common interests.,
Remember that your boys school will probably have a sister school who will be invited to mixers and sports events.,
Try not to dress too much like a kid who goes to an all boy school.,
Talk to the girls you see.",How to Meet Girls While Going to an All Boys' School," The key to meeting girls is getting out. Don't be overly involved in your school's activities.;
, In other words, a relaxed local cafe would be more advisable than a mall or movie theater. Independent theaters and small scale concerts are exceptions (and quite advisable venues).

, They will have more female friends than you (female friends to whom you will be a novelty), or they will at least have a better idea of what girls in the area do for fun.

, Try to attend all these events.

, This would include popped collars, golfing clothes, excessive khakis, etc. However, some girls may like this.

, This is really important. Most of the time they are not going to do the work for you.

Let your ex see you having a great time without him.,
Make him jealous (optional).,
Make him jealous on social media.,
Start hanging out with him a bit.,
Let him see how you've changed.,
Read the signs.,
Slowly start to date again.",How to Make Your Ex Boyfriend Want You Back2," After enough time has passed and you feel that you both got some perspective, you should start giving your ex the opportunity to see you having a great time. Starting going to the parties where he goes, or run into him with a friend at his favorite coffee shop or bar. Don't be too obvious about it, but let him see you with your other friends and remember how much fun it is to hang out with you.


If you know you'll see him, look your best without being too obvious that you're dressing up for him.

When you do run into him, greet him with a smile and a surprised look -- you were so busy having fun that you didn't even think about the possibility of him being around.

, This doesn't work for everyone, but if you think that having your ex see you with another guy, or just flirting with a group of guys, will make him want to be around you even more than go for it. This doesn't mean you should get another boyfriend just to make him jealous. Just let him see you flirting, tossing your hair back, or even getting on the dance floor with another guy or two.


Don't go too far with this one. If he thinks you're actually dating someone else, he may back off. Or who knows -- that might make him want you even more.

, Without being too obvious, post some photos of you having a great time with your friends, you at the beach, or even you hanging out with a few guys. This will make your ex remember how great you look and feel sad that he doesn't hang out with you anymore. Don't post anything too often -- just once or twice a week to remind him of how amazing you are.


Pick a time when you know he's likely to be online -- if you know his schedule, you'll have a sense of when he's most likely to look at your pics.

, Start making your relationship a bit more friendly. Move on from the casual hello to a short conversation, and then even stick around and chat with him for ten or even twenty minutes. Make sure you always say goodbye first, though, and don't make him linger longer than he wants to. This will make him even more sad to see you go. Then, wait for him to ask you to grab a coffee, or be bold and ask him for a drink.


Don't give him any sign that you want to date him again. Just be really amazing and friendly, and he'll want to be with you again.

, As you start hanging out maybe once, or twice a week, let him see that whatever quality he didn't like about you or your relationship is no longer there. If he thought you never listened to him, give him a chance to talk more. If he thought you were too clingy, let him see how independent you've become.


Don't be too obvious about it. Don't say, ""Don't you see how I'm no longer jealous when you talk to other girls?"" Instead, just don't look jealous when he talks to other girls, and he'll figure out the rest.

, If your ex wants to get back with you, you'll know. How did you know that he wanted you the first time? It's likely that he'll be sending similar signals your way. If he flirts with you, tells you that you look nice, lightly touches you, or just always asks what you're up to or if you're seeing anyone else, then yeah, he probably wants you back.


Look at his body language. Does he make eye contact, try to stand close to you, and does his face light up with you walk in the room? If so, then he may want you back.
If he just wants to keep you in the Friend Zone, then he won't act affectionate or loving towards you.
Check out his Facebook or try to find out if he's seeing someone from mutual friends without being too obvious about it. He may be seeing someone else and is just talking to you to be nice or because he wants to be friends.

, If your ex starts to flirt with you and picks up on the fact that you want him again, he may just ask you out again if he's feeling it too. Or if you think he's liking hanging out with you again, you can just be bold and tell him how you feel, and then start dating him again if he feels the same way.


This time, take it easy. Don't see him more than a few times a week. Work on building a solid foundation instead of jumping right in where you left off.
Unless one problem in the relationship was your independence; you should be more independent than last time. Don't build your social schedule around your boyfriend's, and spend more time with friends or just doing your own thing.

Don't make the same mistakes.,
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.,
Start fresh.,
Don't forget to be yourself.,
Know when it's not working.",How to Make Your Ex Boyfriend Want You Back3," Remember that reflection period after your break up? Well, it should come in handy now. When you're with your boyfriend again, remind yourself of what went wrong and try to prevent it from happening. If the problem was that you fought too much, then remind yourself to calm down when you have the urge to pick a fight. If your problem was that you were mean to his friends, try to be nicer, this time -- your man should be worth it.


If your ex is the one making the mistakes, gently remind him that whatever he's doing caused the same problem last time.

, Though you should avoid making the same mistakes, if you're constantly obsessing over not making them, you won't be able to enjoy the relationship. Just have fun and try not to think about it too much unless you're having a conflict. If you're so worried that you'll lose him again every step you take, you won't be able to live in the moment.


If you're insecure about the relationship ending again, your ex will be able to tell, and that will make him feel more uncertain, too.

, Don't think of this as Part Two of your relationship saga -- think of it as two people starting completely over while being better equipped to deal with any challenges that come their way. Though you can't completely forget the past, there's no need to dwell on it or rehash it. Of course, if any fond memory of the past comes up, you should talk about it, but think of everything as starting anew.


You're starting over, and this time, you're just going about it with more foresight.

, It's important to work on yourself to improve your relationship as long as both people are doing the work. But you shouldn't change yourself completely just to fit some image of what your ex wanted from you. You should only change if you want to change, not just for him. Remember that he liked you for a reason originally, so if you change too much, he may not be able to recognize the girl he fell for.


There's a difference between addressing your flaws and being a new person entirely. It's okay to address your flaws, but not to completely transform for the sake of a relationship.

, If you'd been back with your ex for a while and something just isn't right, then it may be true that you did break up for a good reason, after all. Some couples thrive on the drama of breaking up and getting back together, but there's usually a reason why two people can't stay together, and it's that they just aren't right for each other. If the same problems are creeping up again, or you or your ex just aren't happy, then it may be time to take the relationship off life support.


Be honest with yourself. If you've tried everything and it just isn't working, then it may be time to let go for good.
Be proud of yourself for working hard to get your ex back. At least now you know that it wasn't worth it after all -- it's better to know the truth than to wonder what could have happened if you fought for his heart again.

Build trust with her.,
Be open and honest.,
Spend quality time with her.,
Let the relationship progress slowly.,
Pay attention to her discomfort.",How to Make Your Girlfriend Feel Comfortable1," Make sure that she knows that she can trust you with her secrets, because you can keep them. Tell her some of your secrets too, so she knows that you trust her. If she confides in you, keep whatever is shared between the two of you, so that she can feel safe telling you her feelings and thoughts in the future., Allow yourself to be truthful about your feelings and needs. If you do this, your girlfriend will feel more comfortable coming forward with her expectations in the relationship, and this can strengthen the trust between you both., Just like getting to know her, the more time you spend with her, the more comfortable she'll be around you. This doesn't mean spending every second of the day with her, but could mean simply going on a date once a week, hanging out at school, eating lunch together, and engaging in other fun activities.

, If you want to slowly and carefully build a healthy relationship, you can start with a low-key date, such as at a coffeeshop. If you want something a bit more engaging, try a round of bowling or mini golf. Avoid the movies for a first date, since this typically leaves little time for conversation before or after the movie., If something is bothering your girlfriend, it is likely that you will pick up on a change in her tone or behavior. Ask her what is wrong, and try to address the matter right away. Feel free to ask her specifically what you can do to make her feel better. She will likely have a simple request or resolution.

If you show that you can not only solve the issue but also avoid making the same mistake in the future, she will greatly appreciate your presence in her life. Your goal is to become a calming and reliable person for her, so go out of your way to ease any of her pain.

Get to know her.,
Don't embarrass her.,
Address any problems or arguments right away.,
Respect her boundaries and physical comfort level.,
Ask for permission before getting physical.",How to Make Your Girlfriend Feel Comfortable2," Usually, the more you know someone, the more comfortable you are around them. Get to know her well, and let her get to know you well. This will make your relationship more comfortable for her.

, There's nothing more embarrassing for a girl than when her boyfriend tells everyone that she's ""his,"" followed by an offensive term, or that he'll ""get her in bed tonight."" Don't say these things to or about anyone. It's okay to compliment her beauty, but don't make sexual references when you're talking about her looks, as this is embarrassing for girls. Keep your intimate relationship details private, unless she tells you otherwise. Avoid teasing her in front of peers, and never ignore her., Communication is everything, so if you have an issue with something your girlfriend said or did, it is important to discuss this with her rather than give 'the silent treatment' or treat her in another immature way., It is possible that your girlfriend is uncomfortable around you simply because she's afraid that you'll force her into doing something she doesn't want to do. This may include anything from kissing, smoking, doing drugs, touching, or having sex to getting tattooed or drinking alcohol. Make sure not to pressure her into doing anything that she may not be ready to do!, Never assume that someone is okay with getting physical, even if they had expressed interest at an earlier time. Ask, ""Can I give you a hug?"" Check in with your girlfriend frequently during sexual activity. Ask, ""Is this okay?"" and ""How does this feel?"" If you show that you care and respect her, then she will give honest answers and the trust in your relationship will strengthen."
"
Introduce her to your friends.,
Ensure that your friends are nice to her.,
Prioritize your time with her over other friendships.,
Avoid flirting with her friends!",How to Make Your Girlfriend Feel Comfortable3," Show your enthusiasm for having her in your life by helping to form these connections. Say, ""This is an old friend of mine and I am really excited for you two to meet. I think you'll hit it off.""

It is also helpful to connect people through what they may have in common. For instance, say, ""This is my friend, Joe, who loves soccer almost as much as you"" or ""I went to high school with Maya, she has three dogs, so you two can obsess over your love of animals.""

, It's always a little uncomfortable for a girl to hang out with her boyfriend's friends (unless she knows them), so make sure that your friends are treating her right. They shouldn't be flirting with her, calling her names, or commenting on her body. This will make your girlfriend feel very uncomfortable in their presence. Do not let your friends use sexist language about other women, as this will make your girlfriend wonder if they speak that way about her behind her back.


If your friends do something to upset your girlfriend, confront them as soon as possible. Pull them aside and say, ""I felt offended by the way you spoke to my girlfriend"" or, if you need to be more direct, ""I know you thought that was funny, but that wasn't cool."" Be firm, but understanding, and keep the conversation focused on how you feel, rather than take an accusatory tone.

, She'll feel like you are disinterested in her if you spend more time with your other friends than her, and could even suspect that you're trying to cheat on her. Don't send off the wrong signals! Be sure to treat her like a queen so that she feels secure in the relationship., This will make her feel insecure about your relationship together, and will create an awkward feeling between her and her friend. She should never have to choose between you and her friends."

Compliment the special guy.,
Treat him to something you know he likes.,
Be generous with your affection.,
Look your best.,
Flirt with him.,
Stroke his ego.,
Show your affection through touch.",How to Make a Guy Feel Special1," Men like feeling like they've affected their partner in a positive way. If your guy goes out of his way to do something for you, don't let it go unnoticed! Compliment your special man. Let him know you notice his efforts and that he means the world to you.


Try to be genuine with your compliments. It's usually easy to tell when a compliment isn't sincere, so don't risk having this happen between you and your man. Giving him just a few genuine compliments is better than giving lots of forgettable ones.
Another way to compliment your man is simply to give him your attention. Focusing on him (especially when you're talking with each other) shows that he is important to you.;
, No one knows your special man better than you, so pick a fun activity that you're sure he loves. He will definitely appreciate your gesture. If you're feeling especially generous, you can even treat him to an entire night that's all about him. For example, you might try cooking him dinner — his favorite meal would be a good choice. You can put on his favorite songs while you eat together, then watch his favorite film together after that. Little details like this can really make him feel special.


Turning a small gift into a surprise can make it even more amazing. For example, try slipping tickets to his favorite sports team into his hands when both of you are having dinner. The gifts can be inexpensive, but with the effort that goes into planning a great surprise, they’ll make him feel like a million bucks.
If you treat your man to a night out, don't be afraid to pay — it's not a guy's duty to pay for his lady every single time. This being said, you don't need to spend a lot of money to make him feel special.

, Tell your special guy that you love him. Treat him to lots of hugs, kisses, and snuggling — whatever you know he likes. Remind him that he's the perfect one for you and that you couldn't ask for anyone better. If he knows you're being sincere, this will make him feel special.


If you're trying to make your man feel special, try not to be overly critical. If he makes a minor mistake, let it go. Bringing it up during a romantic day together can kill the mood. On the other hand, if he does or says something that's cruel or seriously disrespectful, you don't need to stay silent just because you were trying to make him feel good.

, A good relationship is about much more than physical appearances, but it doesn't hurt to look amazing! Your special guy will be proud to be around such a great-looking partner when both of you go out together. Dress up, smell great, and you'll look fab in his arms. Each time one of his friends or colleagues drops his jaw in awe of you, your man will be proud that he's dating a girl who’s as gorgeous and awesome as you.

, Guys love to feel loved and desired. One great way to do this is to flirt with him as if you were just getting to know each other — even if you've been together for years. There are lots of ways to do this. You can compliment his looks, give him little shows of affection and then play ""hard to get,"" or even gently tease him. Again, however, being genuine is crucial.


Need some flirty ideas to get you started? See our article on flirting for easy instructions.

, Men love it when their partner makes them feel strong and important. You can do this by giving him chances to ""prove himself."" It may sound silly, but even asking your man to help with things you could probably do yourself can work here. For example, getting him to help change the light bulb or open a jar of pickles can make him feel like a valued provider.


Some men may not pick up on your gesture right away, so give him a compliment as he finishes the task. Even something as simple as ""How strong!"" accompanied by a kiss on the cheek can get the point across.

, Subtle touches can be better for communicating your love than words. Start by touching him casually whenever the opportunity presents itself. For instance, if he says something you disagree with, you can shove him playfully and say ""Shut up!"" As you spend more time together, touch him more often and in more intimate ways. Touch his shoulders and chest if you're standing up. Touch his leg if you're sitting down. Let your hand linger for a few seconds before taking it away. Start hugging him to greet him and say goodbye. Finally, if you're ready to move into serious territory, you can kiss him.


Whenever you touch, make sure you really mean it — a forced, insincere touch won't make him feel special.
The ""limit"" on your touching should be whatever you and your special guy are comfortable with. Don't feel pressured to move too fast. Stick to physical shows of affection that don't leave you uneasy and allow your relationship to progress naturally.

Consider the health of your bladder.,
Find a solution for slackened vaginal muscles.,
Think about surgery to enhance sexual satisfaction.,
Reflect on your motivations.,
Consider Gender Confirmation Surgery.",How to Decide if You Need Vaginoplasty1," You should know that vaginoplasty can treat a prolapsed bladder. The muscles of the vagina play a crucial role in holding pelvic organs in place. When your vaginal muscles slacken, they may not do so effectively, and one of the potential consequences is a cystocele, or prolapsed bladder. This is a condition, fairly common in women, in which the bladder sinks into the vagina. If you have a prolapsed bladder, your doctor may recommend vaginoplasty as a solution.Cystoceles are divided into categories based on severity. In Grade 1, or “mild” cases, only a small part of the bladder descends into the vagina. These cases may not need any treatment at all, unless they cause troubling symptoms.
In Grade 2, or “moderate” cases, the bladder descends far enough into the vagina to touch the vaginal opening. In Grade 3, or “severe” cases, the bladder descends so far that it actually begins to protrude through the vaginal opening.
If you are considering vaginoplasty for a prolapsed bladder, understand that less invasive treatments may work for you, especially if your case is not severe.;
, Some women who don’t have bladder pursue vaginoplasty as a solution for vaginal muscles that have become extremely weak. If your vaginal muscles have slackened to the point at which medical problems might result, your doctor may suggest vaginoplasty. Depending on the severity of your condition, this surgery might seem like a good option for you.There are many reasons that vaginal muscles can weaken over time. Childbirth is a common factor, as is going through menopause.
Women can also experience weakened vaginal muscles as a complication from a previous surgery. Weak vaginal muscles can also be hereditary.
Talk to your doctor if you are experiencing problems such as vaginal pain or incontinence. Make sure to discuss your options outside of surgery.
Non-invasive options include using a pessary to hold the pelvic organs in place, taking estrogen replacement therapy, and doing Kegel exercises to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor

, Sex is an important part of a healthy lifestyle for many women. If your vaginal muscles become very weak, you may struggle to achieve orgasm or feel that your orgasms are less satisfying. Vaginoplasty tightens the muscles of the vagina, allowing them to contract more effectively.Vaginoplasty can improve your sex life. However, this is not the main reason to seek surgery.
Typically, enhanced pleasure from vaginoplasty is a side-effect from having the surgery for another medical issue. It is an important benefit of this surgery.
Increased sexual pleasure can lead to greater self-confidence and reduced levels of stress. Talk to your doctor about your individual issues.

, Many women worry that their vaginas are too slack or “stretched out” as they age or after they have children. This is normal. It’s true that both age and childbirth can weaken the muscles of the vagina and make you feel a little “looser,”, but in most cases, this is not a severe medical issue.The rise of “vaginal rejuvenation” as a cosmetic procedure has made many women feel that their vaginas need to be improved with surgery, but for most women, this is simply not the case.
Many times, the problem effects your self-esteem more than anything else. Work with your partner to revive your sex life.
Don't worry about what other people think. Having surgery because someone else says that you should is not a great reason.

, If you are in the process of transitioning from male to female, you might want to consider surgery. To finalize the physical transition, many people choose to have a penile inversion vaginoplasty. Talk to your doctor about the process.Make sure that you discuss the physical preparation for this surgery. You will need to be on hormone therapy for a period of time before having the surgery.
Many doctors will recommend an extended course of counseling. This ensures that you understand the emotional connotations of having this surgery.

Be yourself.,
Be confident.,
Stand up for your man.,
Give him your support when he's down.",How to Make a Guy Feel Special2," Nothing makes a guy feel special like showing him your true self. This is especially true if you don't normally show it to other people. Be silly, be strange, be wild — whatever you feel like being! This shows how comfortable you feel around him, which in turn will make him lower his guard as well.


Timing is important here. While you should start to lower your guard once it's clear that you like each other, you shouldn't immediately start launching into your most bizarre habits. This can be confusing. Instead, introduce these things gradually so you both have a chance to get used to each others' true selves.

, Ironically, believing in yourself can make your special guy feel more valued. Don't feel nervous or pressured to make your man feel special. Instead, stay relaxed and casual. Be friendly and act genuinely interested in what he has to say, but don't, for instance, force yourself to laugh at a joke you don't find funny. Try to keep eye contact with him when you're having a conversation. Smile when he makes you feel good. These simple gestures show him that you're confident in your own skin and confident loving him.


On the other hand, avoiding eye contact, staring at your feet, or nervously hanging on his every word will get the opposite result. Guys sometimes aren't the best at reading other peoples' emotions, so being nervous, timid, or quiet can make it seem like there's something wrong with him.

, Guys are often pressured to act strong and hyper-confident, so being able to take some of this burden off his shoulders can be greatly appreciated. For example, if someone in public disrespects him or is rude, you don't have to meekly stand by and wait for him to handle it. Feel free to stand up for him with your words and actions. This will make him feel like you are willing to go out of your way to protect him, which shows how much you care about him.

, Guys sometimes don't get lots of opportunities to express anxieties and feelings of vulnerability. They often feel pressure to act like nothing ever worries them. They may even have been taught that showing vulnerability (through fear, crying, etc.) is a sign of weakness. You know better, so make sure he knows that you’ll always be there for him. Let him know that, around you, he doesn't have to be strong all of the time. Offering a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on when things are not going well for him can make him feel like the most special guy in the world.


Some men may not take every opportunity to share their fears and anxieties with you. Try not to feel unwanted if he pretends that everything is fine when it's obviously not. Offering your help (even if he declines it) shows that you care about him and are always eager to help him. Be ready to support him when he does ask for your help.

Understand the risks of undergoing surgery.,
Recognize the possibility of long-term side effects.,
Be prepared for permanent changes in sensation.,
Think about the recovery process.",How to Decide if You Need Vaginoplasty2," As with any surgical procedure, vaginoplasty has certain risks. For example, general anesthesia is something to discuss with your doctor. ""Going under"" during surgery carries its own risks.Depending on your specific situation, you may need general anesthesia for your surgery. As with all surgeries done with general anesthesia, there are major risks. In rare cases, people undergoing surgery experience mental confusion, lung infections, strokes, heart attacks, and death.
There are certain factors that increase your risk of complications. These include smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol use, and certain medications.
Make sure to discuss your options with your doctor. In some cases, local anesthesia may be an option.

, In some cases, vaginal surgery creates more problems than it solves. Some women experience persistent pain and discomfort, either all the time or during sexual intercourse. Ask your doctor specific questions about your specific condition.Ask about your prospects for a successful surgery. Make sure you clearly explain your ideal outcome, and ask your doctor if this is possible.
Talk to your doctor about how the surgery will affect your sex life. Specifically ask if orgasm will still be a possibility.
Beware that infection is a possibility. If you undergo vaginoplasty, your surgeon will prescribe antibiotics to minimize the chance of developing an infection, but in a small number of women, infection can still occur.

, Ideally, vaginoplasty improves sensation and sexual function, but sometimes this does not occur. Some women report a decrease in sexual sensation. This is usually due to the normal scarring that occurs as a consequence of the surgery.Ask your doctor if there are ways to reduce scarring. Don't be afraid to meet with more than one doctor.
Think about how a change in sensation might effect your sex life. Is this something you are prepared for?
Talk to your partner about possible changes. Weigh the pros and cons of surgery.

, For most, the recovery process is fairly straightforward. However, it does take some planning. Know that it will be several weeks before you are back to full strength.You will need to remain at the surgical center for at least several hours after the vaginoplasty. Most doctors will keep you overnight.
You might experience severe pain and discomfort for several days. Ask your doctor about medications and other methods of managing pain.
You will not be able to use tampons or have sexual intercourse for 4-6 weeks after your surgery. Your doctor will examine you before you are cleared to resume those activities.
If you are undergoing gender confirmation surgery, the recovery process may be more intense. Talk to your doctor about how long you will need to plan to take off work and whether you will need help at home.

Discuss your options with a gynecologist.,
Consider your future reproductive plans.,
Discuss your plans with a therapist.,
Gather financial information.,
Make the choice that feels right to you.",How to Decide if You Need Vaginoplasty3," No matter what your reasons are for pursuing surgery, you should discuss all of your options with a gynecologist. Your gynecologist can judge whether less invasive treatments might work (either as short-term fixes or long-term solutions) and make a final recommendation about vaginoplasty. He or she can also make sure you understand the risks and have realistic expectations about the results.Get a second opinion. If your gynecologist recommends vaginoplasty, consider seeing a second specialist. Don’t worry about offending your gynecologist; a good physician should understand – and even encourage – the desire to get a second opinion.
Ask for recommendations. Friends, family, and even coworkers can point you in the direction of a trustworthy physician.
Don't be afraid to ask questions about alternative treatments. It is unlikely that a doctor will pressure you to have surgery unless it is medically necessary, but be prepared to be your own advocate.

, If you plan to have children, it’s usually advisable to hold off on vaginoplasty. Unless you have a major medical complication, like a severe prolapse, ask your doctor for other treatment options. Additional vaginal births will stretch your muscles again, and undo some of the surgical results.Talk to your partner about your family plans. Have you discussed whether or not you will have children? Now is a good time to have that talk.
If your doctor deems surgery a medical necessity, consider alternatives. You could later pursue surrogacy or adoption.
Make sure that you discuss your reproductive plans with your doctor. That information could influence his recommendation.

, If you are having trouble deciding, speak with a therapist. This is a good idea especially if you are considering vaginoplasty for sexual reasons or because you think it will increase your confidence or self esteem. A therapist can help you sort out your reasons and decide whether vaginoplasty is worth the risk.Some experts recommend that you consult a therapist even before you talk to a doctor. A good counselor can help you find your true motivations.
Many women pursue vaginoplasty for cosmetic reasons. Your therapist can help you figure out the root cause of your desire for surgery.
A therapist can also help you manage your expectations. You can also use this resource post-surgery, if you decide to have a vaginoplasty.

, Many insurance companies consider vaginoplasty a cosmetic procedure. For this reason, many plans will not cover the cost of a vaginoplasty. Talk to your insurance provider about your specific coverage.If your surgery is a medical necessity, ask your doctor for advice. The hospital might have experience in these sorts of matters.
Decide if you can pay out of pocket for the surgery. The cost is generally between $4500-8500.
Talk to your doctor's office about payment plans and estimated costs. Then look at your budget to determine if the cost will work for you.

, Take your doctor’s advice into account, but know that unless there is a serious medical condition related to your vaginal muscles, you are really the only individual who can decide whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Make the decision that feels best to you. Once you have made your choice, move forward with confidence.Think about what is best for your body. If you think the surgery is worth it, go for it.
Don't rush the decision. This is not a choice to be made on impulse.

Flirt.",How to Meet Older Boys in Your School," Are you mature and sensible enough to be hanging out with the older boys? Are they going to find you immature? Are you going to find them hard to say no to, and difficult to handle? Be realistic about the value of meeting older boys at this time of your life because you need to be around people who get you, not try to use you or laugh at you.;
, Is this something you've actually thought through or are you doing it because your friends think it's a cool idea or you've got a notion it might make you look better than them? Your reasons for wanting to meet older boys must be based on sound reasons, such as perhaps wanting to be with someone who isn't going through the dramas of your year or someone who is less likely to act immaturely around you.

, If you're thinking about guys who are three or five years older than you, forget it now! Don't aim for trying to pursue anyone more than a year or two older than yourself. While you're a young teen, there is a lot of difference between the teen age-groups, even year by year, and you don't need to feel pressured to grow up faster than you should be. There is plenty of adulthood ahead of you for testing the intimate relationship waters.


Think about where you expect to be five years from now. Still hanging out with this so-called cool older guy or getting on with your life uninterrupted by the drama of him going away to college or working while you're still at high school? Think things through, you're worth the effort.

, Be honest with yourself. Are you mature or is this just a flight of fancy? Talk to your friends and ask them what they think about your maturity and ability to handle mature conversations and issues.

, If you have an older sibling, she or he might be the right person to introduce you to some of their male friends whom they trust to spend time around you. Already vouched for, these guys might be more interested in you thanks to your sibling's relationships with them. However, don't push your luck here––your older sibling might just put you in your place and demand that you don't hassle out their friends.


Hang around with older siblings and friends who have older friends, on weekends and after school. At least you'll know someone and can make it seem natural that you ""just happen"" to be around.

, This might be a school musical or play, a sports game, a debating team, a language club or some other activity. With something in common together, there is an increased chance that you'll get to talk to the older boys without having to appear lacking in knowledge or worldliness.

, This could be a sports game, an assembly, a school competitive event or even house choir. Make a beeline for sitting near the older boys you've got an interest in.

, When you connect with an older guy, take care to avoid being stuck for words. Find a subject to talk about, look at what they are doing (don't stalk them) and ask them about it. Don't ask stupid questions, remember he is older than you and will be looking for maturity. Try a simple greeting to begin with, everyone likes a friendly sweetheart!

, Not stupidly and don't overdo it, smile normally and make sure you say something (it might be a bit strange if someone you don't know just randomly smiled at you).

, Don't stare at him; make eye contact that includes looking away at natural pauses, then meeting his gaze again. Don't give out mixed emotions either; an older boy won't be interested in drama from a younger fan.

, Just a cool friendship or something deeper? You might be better off gaining a ""big brother"" type friend than getting involved in a relationship that could end in tears due to the different stages of life you're both working through. Be very sure about what you actually want by this stage.

, But wait a while before starting to flirt with this boy, only when you know he's likely to respond in kind and is worth your effort. Flirting is only okay after you have gotten to know the person.


A flirty conversation might do the trick but you could also hold their hand and smile and laugh at the same time, what a combo! You could also speak softly close to them and look closely at them. If they look uncomfortable then just stop.

Make the decision that feels best to you.",How to Decide if You Need a Hysterectomy1," For women with sexual and reproductive health problems, a primary care physician and/or gynecologist who listens to you and pays attention to your concerns is crucial. You do not want to be rushed into the operating room by a doctor who does not take the time to hear about all of your symptoms and consider less invasive treatment options.;
, Watchful waiting is an option with some conditions, especially if you are close to menopause. Some conditions resolve as your estrogen levels reduce over time. Ask your doctor if watchful waiting is an option with your condition.If you do not have cancer or an emergency hemorrhage, and your symptoms are mild to moderate, rather than severe or devastating, consider adopting a “wait and see” approach. This is often an effective strategy for women who have only mild symptoms and may still want to try to have children.

, Unless you have cancer or emergency hemorrhaging after a cesarean section, you can try other treatments first. Depending on your specific problems, these treatments might include pain medication, hormone therapy, and more targeted surgeries. For most conditions, there is no reason to rush; try these other options first.


Your insurance and physician will likely require that you try some other treatments prior to considering surgery.

, If less drastic treatments do not relieve your symptoms, get a second opinion, even if you like and trust your doctor. It’s always a good idea to protect yourself by making sure that your doctor isn’t missing anything.


If you are worried about offending your doctor, try to let go of that concern. A good doctor will understand (and even encourage!) your desire to get a second opinion.

, If you have a spouse or partner, talk openly about the consequences of a hysterectomy — especially the loss of fertility, the recovery time, and, if your ovaries will be removed as well, the abrupt transition to menopause.


Talk openly about the alternatives as well — what might it be like to live with your symptoms for a while longer? It’s vital that your significant other understands the issues involved and agrees to support you either way.

, Deciding to have a hysterectomy is a major, life-changing decision. If you are feeling very distraught about the decision, you may wish to discuss it wit ha therapist.

If you decide to have a hysterectomy, a therapist can also help you deal with the emotional and sexual impact of the surgery.

Ask your doctor about dilation and curettage for polyps.",How to Decide if You Need a Hysterectomy2," Uterine fibroids are benign growths inside the uterus. These benign tumors are muscular and grow within the wall of the uterus. There can be a single tumor or many. They can be as small as an apple seed or grow larger than a grapefruit.A hysterectomy may be necessary to remove large fibroids.


Uterine fibroids may have a negative effect on your ability to become pregnant. Uterine fibroids may also cause excessive bleeding.
Uterine fibroids may cause anemia due to excess blood loss during your period. As a result, you may require iron supplements or a blood transfusion., If you are diagnosed with cancer of the uterus, cervix, or ovaries, then your physician may recommend that you have a hysterectomy. A hysterectomy will help to remove the cancer cells in your reproductive organs, which may improve the effectiveness of other treatments.

, Endometriosis causes the tissue that grows inside the uterus to begin growing on the surrounding tissues in the abdomen, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, the area between the vagina and rectum, the outer surface of the uterus, and the ligaments that support the uterus. A hysterectomy may be required to stop the excess tissue growth.Tissue may also grow on the cervix, vulva, bladder, bowel, and in abdominal surgical scars.
If left untreated, endometriosis may cause lesions, inflammation, pain, scar tissue, infertility, and bowel problems.

, Abnormal vaginal bleeding is often the result of an underlying medical condition. Some causes of abnormal bleeding include fibroids, cancer, infection, changes in hormone levels, endometriosis, Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS), Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), sexual abuse, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes.


Depending upon the underlying condition and whether it can be controlled with medication or lifestyle changes, your physician may recommend a hysterectomy to prevent excessive blood loss each month., Uterine prolapse means that the uterus or womb has sagged or slipped out of its normal position. After diagnosis, your physician may recommend a surgical option of either a hysterectomy or uterine suspension. In a uterine suspension, the uterus is put back in place and suspended with a sling like apparatus or reattached to the back of the uterus.When a prolapse happens, the uterus may even drop partway through the vagina. This creates a lump or bulge.

, Adenomyosis affects the inner lining of the uterus, also known as the endometrium. Adenomyosis can cause severe menstrual cramping, lower abdominal pressure, bloating, and heavy periods. The condition can affect the entire uterus or just one spot.


Even though adenomyosis not life-threatening, the condition can have a negative effect on a woman’s quality of life. Hysterectomy is one of the options for treating adenomyosis.Hysterectomy is often the best choice for this condition, but it can be delayed if you wish to have more children.

, A hysterectomy may be necessary to remove polyps if they are too large to be removed using dilation and curettage. Polyps can develop in the lining of the uterus and cause irregular bleeding. Polyps are not often cancerous and can often be removed through the vagina when they are near the opening of the cervix.If your doctor has recommended a hysterectomy to remove polyps, ask if performing a dilation and curettage may be possible instead.

See if uterine artery embolization would help.",How to Decide if You Need a Hysterectomy3," A myomectomy removes fibroids using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, the surgeon removes fibroids from the uterus through the navel or through the vagina and cervix. Both approaches are less invasive and less expensive than a hysterectomy.

, Hormone therapy may be a short-term option for treating uterine fibroids, but surgery is still required. Your doctor may recommend medications to shrink the size of uterine fibroids in preparation for surgery. The fibroids will grow back if they are not removed.Some hormone medications block the production of estrogen, which can reduce symptoms. Other medications can be included to control pain and other symptoms.

, Endometrial ablation is a technique that removes the lining of the uterus, but also causes infertility. There are some variations on this method as well, including thermal balloon ablation, cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation.


All forms of ablation cause infertility but are much less invasive and have faster recovery time than a hysterectomy. They each have success rates between 80 and 90 percent.Be aware that this procedure is not a substitution for sterilization or contraception. Pregnancies absolutely occur after ablation, but they cannot be carried for long.

, Uterine prolapse may respond to Kegel exercises because they help to strengthen the pelvic floor if they are not severe.All women should start doing Kegel exercises when they reach their 40’s or after having their first child.


Kegel exercises improve the strength of the pelvic floor, reduce the possibility of leaking urine while laughing or sneezing, and increase the strength of orgasm contractions.

, A pessary device may also be useful for a uterine prolapse. A pessary device is a plastic device that is placed in the vagina to help support the uterus and bladder without undergoing any surgery.Your physician may also recommend a pessary device if you have urinary incontinence from bladder weakness.You can remove and clean a pessary device.
A pessary device may cause you to produce more vaginal secretions.
Some pessary devices can be left in place during intercourse, but most cannot. Ask your physician about your options.

, Ask your doctor if birth control pills might improve your condition. Birth control pills can be used to help reduce large amounts of blood loss during your menstrual period. They may be used to treat endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain as well., If a hysterectomy has been suggested to treat abnormal bleeding, ask your doctor about other treatments that might solve the problem. Other treatments that may be used to treat abnormal bleeding can include a dilation and curettage (D&C), hormonal medications such as progestins and oral contraception, or placement of a progesterone intrauterine device (IUD) to decrease the rate of bleeding and reduce pain.A progesterone IUD can prevent hysterectomies in many patients.

, Uterine artery embolization (UAE) reduces the size and blood supply to fibroid tissues growing in the uterus. Once the blood supply is blocked, the fibroids will shrink and die. Although this procedure is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time than a hysterectomy, it also causes infertility.There is also a chance that it will trigger premature menopause, and it can be very painful for a day or two following the procedure.

Be prepared to give yourself time to recover.,
Know that your menstrual periods will stop after a hysterectomy.,
Keep in mind that you can still have sex.,
Consider the emotional repercussions.,
Be aware that you may have some weight gain after surgery.",How to Decide if You Need a Hysterectomy4," If you choose to undergo a hysterectomy it is important to understand the recovery period. There are several things that you will need to keep in mind as you recover from the surgery:You may experience burning or itching around the incision or a numb feeling around the incision and down one leg. This may be present for up to two months after surgery.You will be able to resume eating your normal diet after the surgery as long as you are able to tolerate it.
You will be able to shower or bathe but should keep the area clean and dry otherwise.
The area around the incision can be itchy. You can use lotions or creams to help relieve the itching.
It is important to increase your activity level each day as long as you feel capable and aren’t in pain.
Make sure to speak with your doctor about when you’ll be released to drive. Do not drive when taking pain medication.
Avoid lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds for four weeks after surgery.
Avoid any vigorous exercise for four weeks after surgery
You should be able to go back to work between three and six weeks afterward.

, However, if the ovaries remain then you will continue to experience some hormonal changes to your body, including bloating and other symptoms that were normal for you while menstruating. You might even experience light vaginal bleeding for about four to six weeks after surgery.If the ovaries were also removed you’ll experience more sudden symptoms of menopause. You experience hot flashes, emotional ups and downs, vaginal dryness, irritability, increased number of headaches or insomnia. Your physician may prescribe hormone replacement therapy initially to help your body ease into menopause more naturally as it would have if your ovaries had been left intact., A hysterectomy will not affect your ability to enjoy sex. Your sexual desire and drive should not change unless the ovaries are also removed, which will put your body into menopause right away. Removing the ovaries will decrease sexual drive and increase vaginal dryness.Even though a hysterectomy should not affect a woman’s sex drive, some women find that the emotional aspects of undergoing a hysterectomy have an effect on sexual desire and drive.
Your physician will advise you to abstain from sexual intercourse, using tampons, or douching for four to six weeks after surgery or until you have fully healed.

, The emotional effects of this surgery will vary from woman to woman. You may feel freer and no longer worry about an unplanned pregnancy, or you may grieve the permanent loss of your period and ability to bear children.Both of these responses are normal.


If feelings of sadness continue for longer than two weeks after surgery, talk with your surgeon or primary care physician.

, Some women also discover that they gain weight after a hysterectomy. Along with this, you may have more trouble sleeping and be more irritable after the surgery. However, with good nutrition, exercise and stress reduction techniques you can often alleviate these symptoms."

You are likely in the early stages of perimenopause if the length of your cycle is changed by about seven days.If your periods have two months between them, this is an indication you are in the late stages of perimenopause, just before menopause.Menopause is complete when you haven’t had a period for 12 months.;
, You may begin to notice the occurrence of hot flashes, or a sudden sensation of heat over your body that triggers sweating, increased heart rate, and skin redness, lasting one to five minutes.This is a normal part of the hormone changes leading up to menopause.


Hot flashes may end with a cold chill.The intensity varies as much as the length, and can contribute to sleep discomfort., Also accompanying the changes in estrogen and progesterone hormone levels during perimenopause are mood swings, although these can also be due to lack of sleep caused by hot flashes.Women can become irritable or depressed.


Mood swings can also be caused by or mid-life stressors like children leaving home, aging parents, and changes within marriage. More rarely, they can be caused by thyroid issues., Because estrogen levels drop during perimenopause, the lining of your vaginal tissues thin, leading to loss of lubrication.This can cause pain during sex.

, The same thinning of vaginal tissues that causes pain during intercourse can increase risk of vaginal infections, and lead to urinary tract infections.Loss of muscle tone in the vaginal area can also contribute to loss of bladder control., Night sweats occur during perimenopause, but they are nothing to be alarmed about. They are the nighttime version of hot flashes. Loss of sleep due to a hot flash can greatly contribute to the irritability a woman displays during perimenopause., Although the hormonal change of perimenopause may not directly cause an increase of anxiety, there are so many things occurring around a woman in perimenopause that anxiety can be a normal part of the process.Hot flashes and night sweats cause sleep loss, leading to an increase in stress and a lowered ability to cope with it.A vicious cycle of stress-symptoms-anxiety can be enacted during perimenopause, where your stress level causes your perimenopause symptoms to be worse, leading to anxiety.You’re also at a time in life where a lot of changes occur, such as children leaving home and parents aging, increasing your anxiety levels.

, Some women experience an increase of headaches or migraines at the onset of perimenopause.If you notice more headaches than usual, or an increase in their intensity partnered with other perimenopause symptoms, you may be able to confirm that you are indeed experiencing perimenopause. Some of these symptoms can continue for several years after menopause.

, Once you start to suspect that you are experiencing perimenopause, it’s time to confirm it with a doctor and get mentally prepared for changes in your body. If these symptoms don’t catch you unawares, you may be able to minimize your level of irritability simply by knowing what to expect and having remedies on hand to quickly treat them.


Once you start to suspect you have perimenopause, you can start putting into place things you’ll need from the steps below.

, Since the vaginal walls are thinning as your hormones progressively change, you also may experience vaginal dryness because the vagina produces less moisture. Lubricants with a water base help when you start to feel discomfort.You may also find that vaginal moisturizers, which are inserted internally, can help reduce changes in your pH, preventing bacterial infections., While you may not have night sweats on a regular basis at the beginning of perimenopause, it is prudent to start sleeping in cool clothing to help with nighttime discomfort.

, If you’re experiencing perimenopause and you notice an increase in headaches, the first thing to do is avoid headache triggers such as bright lights, loud sounds, and doing things that cause eye strain (like reading in dim light).


Food triggers should also be avoided, like alcohol, chocolate, and cheese., Proper nutrition can help you regulate mood swings, along with good sleep and exercise.Make sure you are eating a balanced diet, and if you aren’t sure how balanced it is or if there are certain foods you should avoid or eat more of, make an appointment with a nutritionist.


Taking vitamin supplements can also contribute to good nutrition. St. John’s wort, for example, has been known to reduce symptoms of mild depression and mood disorders.Because bone density loss is a byproduct of perimenopause, calcium and Vitamin D supplements may help reduce the impact this has on the body., Studies show that regular exercise can reduce frequency of migraines.It can also help you sleep better at night and reduce your mood swings.Try to work out at least three days a week for maximum benefits.

, You should always meet with your doctor once you start to recognize symptoms of perimenopause. Your doctor can recommend both at-home remedies and medication therapies to make the transition to menopause easier.

, There are many options for herbal alternatives to chemical estrogen therapy, but you should never start a self-prescribed hormone regimen on your own — speak with your doctor to make sure any supplements you use don't interact with other medications you may be taking or aggravate any existing conditions. One such example is Kava, an herb said to help with perimenopause anxiety.Herbal remedies are not regulated as well as prescription treatments, so always consult your doctor about the herbs you intend to try.Just because they are herbal or ""natural"" doesn’t mean they don’t have side effects or complications when mixed with other things.

, You should not waste a trip to the doctor about your perimenopause by forgetting to ask key questions. Ask about treatments available to you, natural alternatives to these treatments, what you can expect, when to see the doctor again, what you should be concerned about, and so on., If symptoms become problematic during perimenopause or menopause, you may want to start hormone therapy. Your doctor may prescribe a regimen of estrogen treatments — alone or in combination with progesterone — to help your body regulate hormones as it transitions to menopause.


Estrogen therapy can come in many different forms, such as cream, gel, a skin patch, and a pill., If your symptoms of vaginal dryness are particularly severe, you may want to ask your doctor about vaginal estrogen. This tablet, ring, or cream can be inserted directly into the vagina where it releases a small amount of estrogen to accommodate for problems with dryness, pain during sex, and urinary problems., Antidepressants are helpful not only for actual depression during perimenopause, but can reduce the occurrence of hot flashes.This is a helpful alternative for women who can’t take estrogen supplements.

, Another medication alternative to estrogen therapy is the drug Neurontin, also known as Gabapentin. It may be a good second line treatment to help with hot flashes., To help those around you adjust to the slew of symptoms you may start to experience for the next few years, explain to your immediate family and other supportive family members about your perimenopause. This will help them understand when you are irritable or can’t do as many activities because of headaches and hot flashes.

, If you have a group of friends you rely on for emotional support, these are the perfect people to tell about your perimenopause journey. They can support your decisions on symptom treatment, be available when you need to talk about your issues, and provide general feedback so that you don’t feel alone.


If you don’t have a group of friends like this, just one or two supportive people will still provide you with the emotional support you need to keep from becoming overwhelmed.
If you simply have no one to rely on, joining a perimenopause or menopause support group at a local community gathering place (community center, YMCA, senior center, etc.) or church is helpful for reducing the impact your symptoms have on your mental state.

, Finding women who have gone through perimenopause is extremely helpful not only so that you don’t feel alone, but for getting advice about how to navigate this stage of life with minimal discomfort."

Talk to your doctor about hormonal therapy.,
Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for oral contraceptives.,
Pick your pack of contraceptives.,
Know all your options for hormonal birth control.",How to Cure Irregular Menstruation1," Hormonal therapy works by interrupting the signals in your hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal circuit, which links your brain to your ovaries.


By interrupting this circuit, the therapy can be used to stop ovulation and stabilize your hormonal ups and downs. This will allow your menstrual cycle to get back on track.;
, Oral contraceptives regulate and stabilize reproductive hormones. Commonly prescribed oral contraceptives, such as those that work well in relieving PMDD symptoms, are pills with combinations of ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone.


Studies have shown that these types of pills offer relief for the physical and psychological symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and also regulate the menstrual cycle.Oral contraceptives are composed of a set of pills that should be taken for the whole month. There are two types of pills found in each set: the pills that contain the hormones and the placebo pills that should be taken during the days of your period.

, Oral contraceptives come in packets of 21, 28 or 91 tablets. These tablets should be taken by mouth. Take your oral contraceptives at the same time every day.


Be sure to follow your doctor’s specific instructions about when and how to take them.If one type of oral contraceptive does not make your cycle regular, talk to your doctor about trying another brand of oral contraceptive.
There are a number of types, and brands, of oral contraceptives. Some are triphasic pills — which include both progestin and estrogen in varying levels — while others are monophasic which are pills that have the same amount of hormone dose in each pill.In addition, there are mini-pills that are progesterone only.
All oral contraceptives are not created equal. Some have estrogen while others have progesterone. These two hormones may affect your body differently. Talk to your doctor to find which one is right for you., Birth control pills are not your only option to treat irregular menses with hormones. You can also use a vaginal ring, birth control patch, Depo-Provera, progesterone-containing IUD, or a progesterone implant. The choice will depend on what works best for your lifestyle and what your reproductive plans are. You can also use progesterone-only tablets to trigger a monthly cycle (keep in mind this would have no contraceptive benefit and would only help regulate your period).

If you talk sometimes, start distancing yourself from him (you can even do this if you hardly talk or anything similar to this), by not noticing him as much, not talking to him as much, not staring at him as much...but do it ""little"" by ""little"". If you two are very apart,this will probably work like a charm if he notices you have a life and it will leave him hanging. Remember, not all guys are the same.

Ask your doctor about underlying medical conditions as a potential cause.,
Treat thyroid disorder.,
Treat polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).,
Combat extreme weight loss.",How to Cure Irregular Menstruation2," Common underlying conditions include thyroid disease and gynecological issues like polycystic ovary syndrome. The treatment for these conditions will be discussed in the following steps.

, The thyroid gland produces hormones that alter the metabolic process in your body. This can affect your menstrual cycle. If you have hyperthyroidism, treatment may include targeting the thyroid tissues by taking medication to slow down thyroid hormone production. If you have hypothyroidism, your periods may be longer and be heavier. Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Your physician may request diagnostic work-ups to determine the drugs that will work best for you.


The most commonly available anti-thyroid drugs are methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU). Methimazole is often the drug of choice for its low incidence of medical side effects and is generally prescribed at 15 to 30 mg a day.Hypothyroidism is treated with daily use of the synthetic thyroid hormone levothyroxine (Levothroid, Synthroid)., Common symptoms of PCOS include light, irregular periods or none at all due to the unbalanced production of reproductive hormones. Oftentimes, ovulation does not take place in PCOS patients. The treatment goal focuses on the restoration of hormonal balance by giving birth control pills or oral contraceptives to trigger menstruation.


If you are overweight and have PCOS, losing weight is an essential part of treatment.
The pill comes in a pack with 21 estrogen and progesterone hormone tablets and seven placebo pills.

, Extreme weight loss as a result of disease or improper diet and excessive exercise may upset the balance of hormones, thereby causing irregular periods. In the same manner, rapid weight gain and stress also alters the normal hormonal processes within the body. A low body mass index or any kind of nutritional deficiencies require nutrition counseling sessions.


Ideal weight loss or gain should not go beyond 2 kilograms a month or 4.4 pounds. Note that 1 pound is equivalent to 3,500 calories or 500 calories per day for seven days.
When you plan to lose weight, do not go below a 1,200 calorie-diet, otherwise, it will trigger hormonal chaos in your body. On the other hand, if you plan to gain weight, limit your calorie intake to no more than 500 calories more than your ideal caloric requirement.

Exercising can help to keep you healthy, which in turn can ensure that your hormones remain level.Try to exercise for at least 30 minutes, five days a week.
Keep in mind that people who exercise excessively or who are athletes often have cycle irregularities.

, Crackers, pretzels, processed chips and other refined carbohydrates can surge the blood sugar level resulting in food cravings. Eating these unhealthy foods may lead to weight gain, which could throw off your menstrual cycle.

, Drinking alcoholic and caffeinated drinks can lower your immune system and can cause you to become dehydrated.Too much alcohol can also cause your blood pressure to increase, which can harm other organs. If you are dealing with an irregular period, limit your intake to:


One cup of coffee a day
One alcoholic beverage a day. This means 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard alcohol.

, Acupuncture is based on the concept that your energy flows through your body in certain ways. When these energies are interrupted, it can cause your hormones and other parts of your body to become unbalanced.Acupuncture involves placing needles in certain pressure points to restore the flow of energy.

Try upping your intake of cinnamon.,
Eat sesame seeds to help regulate your menstrual cycle.,
Use more turmeric in your cooking.",How to Cure Irregular Menstruation4," This is an alternative approach to relieving irregular menstruation. It comes from the herb Lepidium meyenii. It is thought to work by nourishing and stimulating balance in the endocrine system. Rather than introducing synthetic hormones,This herbal remedy may induce the hormonal system to secrete necessary reproductive hormones naturally.Take 3 tablets a day after meals. Ideally you should take two tablets after breakfast and one after lunch.

, Ginger is thought to promote menstruation. It is commonly used when dealing with delayed menstruation. To make ginger tea:


Boil half a teaspoon of freshly ground ginger in one cup of water. Add honey to enhance the flavor if need be. Drink this mixture three times a day for a month.

, Cinnamon is thought to have a warming effect on the body. This warming effect is useful for regulating menstrual cycle. It may also help to reduce menstrual cramps. Cinnamon also contains hydroxychalcone which is thought to regulate insulin. A high level of insulin in the body can cause irregular menstruation.To prepare the cinnamon, add half a teaspoon of cinnamon to a glass of milk. Another option is to drink cinnamon tea or chew on a cinnamon stick regularly.

, Sesame seeds are thought to help balance hormonal levels.Sesame seeds contain lignans, which help bind excess hormones. They also contain essential fatty acids, which help in hormonal production.


Dry and roast a cup of sesame seeds. You can crush this up into a powder, or eat them whole.

, Just like unripe papaya, turmeric is thought to have herbal stimulant properties which help stimulate menstrual flow. Turmeric is also considered a warming herb which helps in regulating menstruation and hormones.To prepare turmeric add one to four teaspoons of turmeric powder to a glass of milk. Drink this formula daily for a few months until effects are felt.

Vaginal discharge that is white or grey and may look foamy
Burning on urination
Itchiness and irritation around the vagina
Keep in mind that not all women with BV have symptoms.;
, Yeast infection symptoms can often resemble the symptoms of BV. These symptoms include:An abnormal vaginal discharge. The discharge can be a watery, white discharge to a thick, white, and chunky discharge. This is often described as looking like cottage cheese.
Itching and burning of the vagina and labia
Painful intercourse
Painful urination
Redness and swelling of the area just outside of the vagina.

, Symptoms of trichomoniasis (sometimes called “trich”) in women can be:Vaginal discharge that is usually smelly or itchy
Vaginal discharge that is typically frothy or foamy
Vaginal itching
Yellow or a gray-green discharge
Painful urination

, Vaginal infection symptoms can differ depending on where a woman is in her cycle. This is because the hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle can affect the composition of the bacteria in the vagina and the characteristics of the vaginal environment. Knowing your menstrual cycle will help you keep track of changes that you’re experiencing.

, Many women have BV or trichomoniasis but they do not have any of the tell-tale symptoms.If you suspect you might have an infection, see your doctor.
Trichomoniasis can be transmitted to sexual partners. If you suspect you have trich, see your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment.

, Most women have probably had at least one experience with BV. There is no specific cause. Essentially anything that disrupts the normal bacterial balance in the vagina can result in BV. The risk of BV increases with:Having a new sexual partner
Having multiple sexual partners
Having sex without a condom
Douching
Using an intrauterine device (IUD) as a method of birth control

, Yeast infections, also called candidiasis, are increased by:Wearing tight underwear or non-cotton panties. These styles of panties can increase the temperature, the moisture levels and can be irritating.
A weakened immune system
Using vaginal douches and/or perfumed feminine hygiene sprays
Vaginal trauma. This can be scratches in the vagina that occur during insertion of a tampon or other objects, or during rough sex.

, These types of infections can occur because of a number of causes.


In BV, there is no specific cause, but it typically results from an imbalance of the normal bacterial populations.
Yeast infections can result after antibiotic use; the antibiotics kill off the normal bacterial populations, allowing the yeast to get a “foothold.” They can also come about as a complication of diabetes, or during hormonal changes, including a normal menstrual cycle or the use of birth control.

, It is important to get the correct diagnosis from a doctor before starting treatment. The treatments for the different forms of vaginal infections can be different, depending on the degree of infection.


At the doctor’s office, your physician will likely take a sample of the vaginal discharge, ask for a urine sample and perform a vaginal exam. This exam may be uncomfortable but it is usually over quickly. The discharge will be tested for the presence of bacteria, yeast or other organisms such as Trichomonas.
It’s important to get a specific diagnosis from your doctor. The approaches for treating vaginal infections differ depending on the type of infection.

, Untreated or incorrectly treated BV can result in complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pre-term births and low-birth weight babies and put a woman at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV ), chlamydia and gonorrhea.Untreated or incorrectly treated Trichomonas infections can also lead to increased risk of HIV., If you choose to only use natural remedies, make sure you call your physician if:There is no improvement in your symptoms after three days.
You develop a fever.
You experience difficulty or pain on urination.
Sexual activity is painful.
You have abdominal pain.
The amount or characteristic of the vaginal discharge increases or changes (such as changing odor or color).
You have a new rash that appears anywhere on your body.

, You should always get a diagnosis from your physician when you first start experiencing any of the symptoms. This is because some natural treatments work better for BV or candidiasis, and others may not work as well. You can also use these treatments along with the medications prescribed by your physician. They don’t interfere with oral antibiotics.


Tell your doctor that you are using these approaches. If you are successful, perhaps your physician can recommend the method to others.

, Trichomoniasis is classified as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), so if you are diagnosed with trichomoniasis, you should inform any sexual partner so they can be treated as well. ,If trichomoniasis is the diagnosis, then home remedies are not appropriate.

Look for clothing that has “wicking” or “cooling” on the label. Go for clothing in fabrics like linen or cotton and avoid synthetic materials like polyester or nylon.For example, you may wear tops and dresses made of linen that are flowing and loose fitting. Or you may wear loose cotton sweaters and cotton dress pants so you do not get too hot during a hot flash.;
, Hot flashes can also cause you to feel hot one moment and then chilly or cold the next moment. To help regulate your body temperature when you have hot flashes, dress in layers. This way, you can shed a layer when you feel hot and put a layer back on when you feel chilled or cold. You may plan your outfits around layering so you can shed a layer and still look professional at work.For example, you may wear a nice cotton top with a pair of cotton dress pants and then also put on a nice cotton sweater that you can shed if you get too hot. Or you may wear a linen dress with a cotton blazer that you can take off if you get hot during a meeting at work.

, Sometimes you are not able to shed enough clothing at work to feel comfortable and you may end up sweating in your clothing. If you are worried about appearing unprofessional at work after a hot flash, you may keep a clothing in a desk drawer that you can change into in the bathroom. This way, you can still look put together at your meeting later in the day, with no sweat lines to be seen.


For example, you may store a more professional outfit at your desk, such as a clean cotton collared top and dress pants, as well as a more casual outfit, such as a cotton sweater and loose pants. Then, you can change into either outfit depending on what you are doing that day at work.

Understand what Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) means.,
Know about the psychological causes of FSD.,
Review the physical or medical causes of FSD.,
Realize what FSD is not.",How to Deal with Female Sexual Dysfunction1," FSD is only diagnosed if it is causing YOU significant distress about your sexuality. FSD can cause problems, or interfere, with a woman’s ability to respond sexually.FSD can be generalized/global (e.g. happens during every sexual encounter) or situational (e.g. only happens in certain circumstances).
FSD can be primary/lifelong (e.g. started when you first became sexually active) or it can be secondary/acquired (e.g. began at some point after you experienced no issues with sex).
FSD is usually divided into one of four categories: (1) Desire problems; (2) Arousal problems; (3) Orgasmic problems; and (4) Sexual pain disorders.;
, Formal diagnoses of FSD from a psychological perspective is based on the definitions provided in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is used by psychologists and psychiatrists in Canada and the United States. There are three types of FSD as per this manual:Female Orgasmic Disorder (also known as anorgasmia) is when a woman has trouble experiencing an orgasm, or she is able to experience an orgasm, but it’s not as strong as it use to be.

Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder is when a woman has significantly reduced interest in sex, or is unable to be aroused. This can include having no interest in having sex, not experiencing any erotic thoughts or sexual fantasies, and the inability to become aroused from stimulation. Sometimes this, the most common kind of female sexual dysfunction by far, is also known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder or inhibited sexual desire disorder.Gentio-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder is when a woman has pain or anxiety with vaginal penetration. Depending on the specifics, this is also known as vaginismus (involuntary muscle spasms in the vagina that can be caused by scars, injuries, irritations or infections) or dyspareunia (pain during or after intercourse that can be caused by vaginal dryness, medications or hormonal changes) or vulvodynia (pain in the vulva). The specific name of the issue is based on the cause of the pain, as opposed to the fact that you have pain.There are physical therapists who specialize in helping women with these issues. Muscle relaxants and topical analgesics can also help.
These psychological problems can be caused by untreated anxiety or depression, or a history of sexual abuse. They can also be caused by: ongoing (sometimes internalized) issues you have with your partner; stress associated with work for family responsibilities; concern about your sexual performance; unresolved sexual orientation issues; and body image and self-esteem issues., There are many physical and medical reasons why you may experience FSD, they include:Medical conditions including cancer, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and bladder problems. You won’t discover you have one of these issues because you experience FSD. Rather one of these issues that you already have may be the cause of your FSD.
Medications such as antidepressants, blood pressure medications, antihistamines and chemotherapy drugs can decrease sexual desire and the ability to have an orgasm. Depression itself can also cause sexual dysfunction. Oral contraceptives are also known to decrease sexual desire.
Hormonal changes that occur after you’ve given birth and while your breastfeeding, and after you’ve gone through menopause, can decrease sexual desire. These changes also cause physical changes to your genital tissues that may reduce the overall sensation in that area and cause vaginal dryness.

, FSD is not any and every problem with a woman’s sexuality, and there is no ‘normal’ for women to measure themselves against. Normal is what you want it to be and are comfortable with.

Not being able to orgasm during intercourse, but requiring clitoral stimulation to orgasm, is not FSD. This is actually quite common among many women.
Simply not being interested in having sex, or being unable to become aroused by a partner, is not FSD. There are a large number of reasons why sex may not be welcomed, including: ongoing stress; tiredness; a new baby; headaches; etc.

, Studies show that practicing deep breathing can actually reduce the frequency of hot flashes.A particular technique called paced respiration can be especially beneficial.


To perform paced respiration, take slow deep breaths through your nose, expanding your diaphragm. Then, exhale slowly, contracting your diaphragm. Do this for about six to eight breaths per minute.

Know the risks of douching.,
Try a store-bought douche.,
Mix apple cider vinegar with water for a douche.,
Try a douche made from hydrogen peroxide.,
Use oregano essential oil and water as a douche.",How to Cure Vaginal Infections Without Using Medications2," Douching is not generally recommended, because the vagina naturally cleans itself. But, it can be used sparingly when you have BV. You should know, however, that there is a risk of pushing the bacteria into your cervix and uterus and risk PID and other serious infections.


Douching is actually believed by many physicians to increase the risk of BV., Douching is the procedure of washing or cleaning out the inside of the vagina with water or other mixtures of fluids. You can buy prepackaged mixes for douching at most pharmacies and drug stores. These usually come in a bottle with a curved neck or a bag.


Start by getting into the shower or bath. Most women find it easier to prop one leg on a surface like the edge of the tub. Be careful not to slip.
Then, with one hand, spread the labia (the “lips” that are on either side of the vagina) and find the vaginal opening.
Hold the bottle or bag in the other hand.
Gently squirt the douche upward through the tube or nozzle into your vagina.
The mixture will come back out through your vagina.

, Apple cider vinegar is believed to restore the acidic pH of the vagina.It can be used with relative effectiveness to get rid of BV.


Get a douche kit from a drugstore. You will use the equipment that is included with the kit. Or, you can use an enema kit, which has the same equipment as a douche kit.
Mix two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with one cup of warm filtered water. Don’t use white vinegar, as this is too acidic.
Use the douche twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. , Hydrogen peroxide has disinfectant properties, and it can also get rid of irritants that can cause BV.Mix 3% hydrogen peroxide with an equal amount of warm distilled water and douche with this mixture. Use distilled water because the water should be sterile and bacteria-free.
Use as a douche twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. , Use two to three drops of essential oregano oil in eight ounces of distilled water. Repeat twice a day for one week. Repeat twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. For yeast infections, try douching with two to three drops of essential tea tree oil in eight ounces of distilled water. Repeat twice a day for one week. Repeat twice a day for four days and then daily until all symptoms disappear. Never ingest tea tree oil. You can also apply two to three drops of the oil on a tampon and insert the tampon into your vagina. Leave it in for about one hour.
Do not use essential oil treatments if you are pregnant, nursing, or expect to become pregnant in the immediate future.

Try plain yogurt.,
Replenish good bacteria with a probiotic suppository.,
Use periodontal gel.,
Try a clove of garlic.,
Treat a yeast infection with a boric acid suppository.",How to Cure Vaginal Infections Without Using Medications3," It sounds messy, and it IS messy. But inserting yogurt into your vagina is a way of re-populating the vagina with harmless bacteria that may be able to “crowd out” the parasite. However, there are no scientific studies that indicate this. , , , Use plain yogurt and a 10 mL syringe (you can buy this syringe at your local pharmacy).
Every night, fill the syringe with the plain yogurt and fill your vagina by inserting the syringe and depressing the plunger.
Go to bed as usual, but wear a sanitary pad. The messiness comes in the morning when you get out of bed. You should also wear a thin pad during the day.
Repeat every night until the symptoms disappear.
You can also use a tampon coated with yogurt, but tampons without the applicator can be difficult and uncomfortable to insert.

, A probiotic will help replenish good bacteria in your body. , , Probiotic capsules can be expensive and can be found in most groceries and drugstores. Use gelcap suppositories, since hard suppositories may not be as effective. Buy a brand that has Bifidobacterium longum; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Bifidobacterium infantis; Lactobacillus acidophilus; or Lactobacillus reuteri HA-188.
There is not a lot of evidence showing if probiotics as a supplement or in yogurt are helpful in preventing trichomoniasis.

, Use Curasept periodontal gel and apply in and around the vagina. Curasept contains 0.5% cyclohexadiene, a disinfectant which has been shown to be effective in treating BV., A whole clove of peeled garlic can be inserted into the vagina and has been reported to be helpful in treating BV. .This is because the garlic contains allicin, which is a natural antibiotic that fights BV.


Peel a clove of garlic. Poke some holes in the garlic so that the allicin can be released. Insert the clove into your vagina. Replace the garlic every four hours for seven days or until symptoms have disappeared. , Boric acid can be irritating, so you shouldn’t make your own suppository. Do not directly apply it to the vagina. Look for Vitanica Yeast Arrest, found in many health food stores. This product is specially formulated for vaginal yeast infections.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper usage.
You must not be the recipient of oral sex while using boric acid because boric acid is poisonous to your partner.

You will likely need to take this medication every week or month for six months to a year., Treatment will depend on the type of infection, how extensive or severe it is and how long you have had the infection. Antibiotics are prescribed for BV and for trichomoniasis, but they are not effective on yeast infections.


BV is generally treated with either metronidazole or clindamycin. These are considered safe if you are pregnant.

Make an appointment with your doctor.,
Answer your doctor’s questions honestly.,
Be prepared for a pelvic exam.,
Treat an underlying medical problem.,
Attempt hormonal therapy.,
Perform Kegel exercises.",How to Deal with Female Sexual Dysfunction2," Call and make an appointment to see your doctor to discuss your issues. If you already have a gynaecologist, make an appointment directly through that office. If you do not have a gynaecologist, ask your family doctor to refer you to one. Be prepared to discuss the following things with your doctor:Your exact symptoms. What types of difficulties you’re experiencing, when they occur and how often they occur.
Your sexual history. How many relationships have you had in the past where you did or did not experience the same problems. And whether you’ve ever experienced sexual abuse.
Your medical history. This would include any medical conditions you’ve already been diagnosed with, including any medications you’re already taking. Make sure to mention over-the-counter, alternative or herbal medications, as well as prescriptions.

, It may be embarrassing to talk about your sexual problems with your doctor, but understand that you need help in order to overcome them. Answering your doctor’s questions openly and honestly will ensure you get the right treatment for what you’re experiencing. Some questions your doctor may ask are:How much do the problems you’re experiencing bother you?
How satisfied are you with your current relationship?
Are you able to become aroused or have orgasms during sexual interactions with your partner?
Are you having any pain during intercourse?
What forms of birth control do you use?
Do you drink alcohol or take recreational drugs on a regular basis? If so, how much do you take?
What kinds of surgery have you had in the past, specifically in relation to your reproductive system?
Have you ever had an unwanted sexual experience?

, Some sexual problems may be caused by very specific things that can be found during a pelvic exam. Or may be determined via a pap smear test. Your doctor will check for any physical issues with your genital tissues and skin elasticity. They can also check for scarring and may be able to narrow down where pain is occurring., Many sexual problems are caused by other conditions or medications that change the way your body behaves sexually. In order to reacquire your ‘usual’ sexual desires and behaviours, your doctor may have to experiment with multiple ways to treat your underlying condition.Everyone reacts to medications differently. If a specific medication is causing your problem, your doctor might try a different medication instead. It may take a couple of tries to find the right medication or dose before the problem is resolved.
Your doctor may test you for medical conditions that you have not been previously diagnosed with. If one is found, treating that condition may solve your sexual problem.

, If your sexual problem is linked to a hormonal imbalance or cause, your doctor may suggest a form of hormone therapy.Estrogen Therapy is done using a vaginal ring, cream or tablet. It can improve vaginal tone and elasticity, increase vaginal blood flow, and enhance lubrication. While it sounds easy enough, it does come with some risks. Make sure you discuss all the side effects with your doctor before starting any type of estrogen therapy.

Androgen Therapy includes the testosterone hormone. Testosterone plays an important part in sexual functions for both men and women. However, androgen therapy is somewhat controversial, so you’ll want to be fully aware of all the pros and cons of this therapy should you decide to give it a try. Testosterone can be used ""off label"" for libido, but there is a potential increased risk for breast cancer if you use it.

, Women who experience vaginismus often have a feeling like they’re ‘too small’ for their partner’s penis, and can experience burning or tearing sensations when something is being inserted into their vagina (including a tampon or speculum). The actual cause of the problem is the muscles in the vagina not being relaxed enough for intercourse to be comfortable. The ‘cure’ is to learn how to control and relax your vaginal muscles through exercises.These exercises can take several weeks to several months to work well enough that you feel comfortable having intercourse, so be patient.
While you’re training your vaginal muscles, it is best not to have, or try to have, intercourse. Your muscles are spasming due to an involuntary reaction, and having intercourse while you’re trying to work out that involuntary reaction may only prolong the problem. You can, however, perform other sexual activities other than intercourse during this time.
Kegel exercises help you tighten the muscles of the pelvic floor. These are the same muscles you would use when you want to stop urinating while on the toilet.
Contract your pelvic floor muscles, hold for a couple of seconds, then relax. Do this as often as you can throughout the day, in sets of 20.
Once you’ve got the hang of contracting your pelvic floor muscles, do the same exercises while inserting a finger into your vagina. Slowly work your way from one finger to three fingers. You’ll need to insert your fingers at least 5-6cm to feel the effect, which is approximately up to the middle joint in your fingers. Not only will this help you identify your pelvic floor muscles, it will also get you use to having something in your vagina that doesn’t hurt. If it does start to hurt — stop.
Once you’re able to insert three fingers into your vagina without any pain (on at least a couple of occasions), you can try to have intercourse with your partner. In order to be able to control penetration, it’s better if you position yourself on top. Make sure you’re in control of the situation so you can stop anytime you want.
When inserting your fingers or when having intercourse it is best to use lubricants to make the process easier.
Talk to your partner throughout this entire process, especially when you’re ready to have intercourse again. The first few times you try intercourse you may need to stay still for periods of time so you can get comfortable and relax your muscles.

, A psychologist can only help you effectively if you tell them the truth, and are as open and honest as possible. Treatment plans will be based on what you said, so if you aren’t honest you may waste your time trying a treatment plan not designed for your specific situation. Your psychologist will most likely ask about the following things:A complete history of the sexual problem you’re experiencing. When it started, what the exact symptoms are, etc.
Some details about your sexual history and past relationships.
Information about your physical health, including anything you may have been tested for medically and what the results were.
Information about your emotional health, including what’s going on in your life (in general), how your job is going, what stresses you out, how you’re feeling, etc.

, You and your psychologist will develop a treatment plan together. Your psychologist will customize the treatment based on your specific circumstances and needs. Some possible treatments may include:Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) — CBT is used to help you identify and change the feelings, thoughts, and behaviours you have that are causing the problem. CBT is normally conducted on a weekly or bi-weekly basis with a psychologist, plus through at-home exercises you can do on your own.

Mindfulness-based Interventions — Mindfulness works by helping you feel and understand your body and its various sensations. Mindfulness is achieved by not judging, criticizing or measuring those feelings against anything else, it is simply learning how to feel.

Use a lubricant.,
Get a sex toy.,
Reduce the amount of alcohol you consume.,
Stop smoking.,
Take better care of yourself.,
Consider acupuncture.,
Take up yoga.",How to Deal with Female Sexual Dysfunction4," It is important to make your partner aware of any issues you’re having, and what types of treatment you’re receiving.

Try different types of sexual positions with your partner. If you experience pain with one position, try several others until you find one that’s comfortable.

, Foreplay can include a lot of different activities, including: watching erotic videos or reading erotic books; playing out erotic fantasies; sensual massages; or even a warm bath.

If it works, it’s well worth it! Plus there are many online stores that you can order from that mail out their products in unlabelled boxes and disguise the company name on your credit card bill.

, Excess alcohol in your system has the ability to blunt sexual responsiveness. Cutting back on the amount of alcohol you consume may help alleviate sexual issues you’re experiencing., Smoking can restrict the blood flow in your body, which in turn means that less blood is able to reach your sexual organs. Less blood to your sexual organs can cause you to have trouble becoming aroused or to have trouble experiencing an orgasm., Ensuring you get enough physical activity every week, eating properly, and taking the time you need to relax once in a while can have a long-term and positive impact on your sexual experiences.Regular aerobic exercise can increase your stamina and elevate your mood.
Taking the time to relax now and again can help relieve stress and anxiety, and help you be able to focus on sexual activity.

Maintain a healthy, balanced diet.,
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.,
Incorporate plant estrogens into your diet.,
Stay away from spicy foods.",How to Deal With Hot Flashes2," Women who are overweight are more susceptible to hot flashes. Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet, coupled with daily exercise, can help you stay at a healthy weight. Always consult a registered dietician or your doctor before altering your diet.Consume more vegetables, healthy fats, and lean protein. Shape your meals so they contain one protein source, one low fat source and one low carb vegetable source. A low carb diet can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle and improve the symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes.Healthy protein sources include egg whites, soy products, and chicken. Fish such as salmon and trout, as well as shellfish like shrimp and lobster are also good sources of protein in a healthy diet. Non-fat greek yogurt is also a good way to get protein and dairy in your diet.
Your diet should also focus on food sources of vitamin E, which can lower the severity of hot flashes in women. Leafy greens, tropical fruit, and nuts are all good sources of vitamin E.
Low carb vegetables include: broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, kale, brussels sprouts, cabbage, swiss chard, lettuce, cucumber, and celery. Steaming or baking vegetables, rather than frying them, will ensure you receive all the nutrients and antioxidants in low carb veggies for the week.
Healthy fat sources include avocados and nuts, as well as olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil. Cooking with these oils will boost your fat levels without causing you to gain weight.
Cut out carbs, sugars, and animal fats. Foods high in carbs and sugars cause your body to secrete insulin, which is a main fat storage hormone in your body. When your insulin levels go down, your body can start to burn fat. It also helps your kidneys shed excess sodium and water, which will help you reduce any water weight.Avoid foods high in starch and carbs like potato chips, french fries, and white breads. You should also avoid consuming foods high in sugar like soft drinks, candy, cakes, and other junk food. Animal fats found in red meat and gamey meat like lamb can be fattening and slow down your metabolism as they are difficult to digest.

, Caffeine is a common trigger for hot flashes and mood swings among menopausal women. Replace caffeine with water whenever possible. Instead of going for coffee or black tea, choose herbal tea or sparkling water with a squeeze of lemon or lime juice. Cut back on dark chocolate, too, as it contains caffeine.Like caffeine, alcohol can make hot flashes and mood swings worse. Whenever possible, choose a nonalcoholic beverage instead of an alcoholic one. When you do choose alcohol, limit your consumption to no more than one drink per day.

, Naturally occurring plant estrogens may help reduce the severity of hot flashes. Their effect is not as strong as that of human estrogen, but they may still be helpful. Plant estrogens can be found in the following foods:Soybeans
Chickpeas
Lentils
Tofu
Crushed or ground flaxseed

, Spicy foods are known to trigger hot flashes in many women. Try seasoning your food with milder seasonings, like basil, chives, and oregano, instead of using blackening spices, peppers, curry, and other hot spices."

Consider hormone therapy.,
Ask your doctor about antidepressants.,
Talk to your doctor about anti-seizure medication to control your hot flashes.",How to Deal With Hot Flashes3," If your hot flashes are severe, hormone therapy may provide some relief. Doctors usually prescribe very low doses of estrogen to offset the effects of menopause.Talk to your doctor about whether this option is right for you.


Hormone replacement therapy has specific risks and benefits. The risks have probably been overstated for the 50-60 year old population. Hormones also reduce the risk of bone fractures. While hormone therapy may help reduce hot flashes, it has also been connected with a variety of severe medical issues, such as breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Be sure to do thorough research and ask your doctor a lot of questions before choosing this option., Some women find that antidepressants help mitigate the symptoms of menopause. If you would prefer not to undergo hormone therapy, this might be the right option for your needs.The most effective treatment is hormone replacement therapy. Certain antidepressants can work about half as well as hormones.
Keep in mind possible side effects of antidepressants include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, weight gain, or sexual dysfunction.

, Some women find relief from hot flashes by taking anti-seizure medication like Gabapentin. You may experience side effects like drowsiness, dizziness, and headaches while on this medication.Your doctor may also recommend you try high blood pressure medication to regulate your hot flashes. The drug Clonidine, in pill or patch form, may be prescribed. The side effects of Clonidine include dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and constipation.

Take vitamin E supplements.,
Use black cohosh or evening primrose oil.,
Consider acupuncture and hypnosis.",How to Deal With Hot Flashes4," Be aware that vitamin supplements are not regulated by the Federal Drug Administration, so always be cautious about taking any over the counter supplements. In one study, vitamin E supplements were shown to be effective at reducing the symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes.You may be at risk of heart failure if you use high doses of this supplement for a long period of time. Talk to your doctor before taking any natural supplements.

, These are herbal treatments that may relieve your hot flashes. Black cohosh is a supplement that can produce estrogen like effects on your body and offer relief from hot flashes. However, you may experience mild stomach upset and the supplement can be harmful to your liver and there is no evidence that it works better than placebo pills.Evening primrose oil is a supplement that can help relieve your hot flashes, however, you may experience side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and headache.

, These alternative treatments can help to reduce the frequency and severity of your hot flashes. Some women have experienced relief via acupuncture, however the treatment can be costly and may require multiple sessions.Research has shown that hypnosis can successfully relieve hot flashes in women with breast cancer and reduced the number of hot flashes women experienced each day. But more medical research is needed to assess the longer term effectiveness of these treatments.

Take oral probiotics to prevent BV.,
Wash your genital area gently.,
Wear only white, 100% cotton underwear.,
Use a mild detergent for your underwear.,
Practice good habits with toileting.,
Use tampons during the day.,
Avoid wearing pantyhose.,
Avoid irritating products.",How to Cure Vaginal Infections Without Using Medications5," You can take probiotics by mouth (either as capsules or in yogurt). These are mainly useful for prevention rather than treatment of BV. If you are prone to BV, eat one serving of yogurt daily (about 150 grams) with four to give billion CFU (Colony Forming Units). Make sure to choose a yogurt that has this information on the label.


You can also take probiotic capsules according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Experts don’t know exactly how ingested bacterial cultures in yogurt or probiotic supplements can populate the vagina, but there is evidence that they do., Use a very mild soap and warm water to wash your genital area. Dry yourself with a clean towel or allow yourself to air dry. You can also try drying it with a blow dryer set on cool.Avoid scratching or rubbing your genitals. Keep irritation at a minimum by leaving your genitals alone. Don’t scratch or rub the area.

, Cotton allows your genital area to stay cool and dry. The white underwear avoids irritants that may be in different dyes. Avoid nylon, acetate and any synthetic fibers.


Avoid wearing thong underwear because these tend to be irritating.

, Use a mild and fragrance free soap (such as fragrance-free Woolite) for washing your panties. Do not use fabric softeners or dryer sheets. These also contain chemicals that may irritate you.


Double-rinse your underwear to ensure that all detergent is gone. Detergent residue can cause irritation.

, Use white, soft toilet tissue. Remember always to wipe from the front to the back to minimize the risk of infection from bowel bacteria.

, Instead of using sanitary napkins while you have your period, use tampons during the day. Stay away from deodorant tampons because of the risk of toxic shock syndrome. Replace tampons every few hours, depending on your flow.


Do not leave tampons in overnight. Use sanitary pads instead.

, Pantyhose do not allow the genital area to “breathe.” They also trap heat and moisture, which creates the perfect setting for bacteria, yeast and other organisms. Instead, wear nylons with a cotton panty insert.

, Avoid feminine hygiene products, which can irritate the vulva. These include deodorant sanitary pads, all feminine sprays and deodorants, any products containing Vaseline, oils or greases.


Avoid bubble baths, bath oils, talc, or powder, especially powder that contains cornstarch. Cornstarch provides food for microorganisms.

Treat vaginal infections after getting diagnosed.,
Consider home treatment if you aren't pregnant or nursing.,
Match the right treatment to the correct cause.,
Try natural remedies if you can limit or abstain from sexual activity during treatment.,
Use natural remedies while they continue to work.",How to Cure Vaginal Infections Without Using Medications6," While some vaginal infections can be cured without the use of medications, it’s important to consult your OB/GYN or primary physician before beginning any treatment. Effective natural remedies may vary depending on the type of vaginal infection you have and the severity of the infection.


Since some symptoms are common among multiple types of vaginal infections, self-diagnosis is both difficult and risky. An official diagnosis from your doctor is the only safe way to identify the type and degree of vaginal infection you have.
Tell your doctor if you have a strong preference for natural remedies. Some doctors are willing to work with you to accommodate this preference, and they should be able to guide you on which remedies would be best to try for your specific needs.
Note that trichomoniasis is technically an STI. Natural remedies will not be sufficient to cure an infection caused by trichomoniasis; you will need medication to treat it., While many natural treatments are safe for women with BV or yeast infections, you should avoid most home treatments if you are currently pregnant or may become pregnant, or are currently breastfeeding. Some treatments can inadvertently harm your baby.


That being said, if you have a vaginal infection during pregnancy, you should still ask your doctor about treatment. Active yeast infections, in particular, can pass to your baby during birth and result in thrush., Some treatments are only effective against certain causes of vaginal infection. To avoid possible complications, you should only try a natural remedy promoted for use against your type of infection; do not use a home remedy suggested for treatment against another type of vaginal infection unless instructed to do so by your doctor.


As a reminder, douching can be used sparingly if you have BV. It is not recommended for vaginal infections caused by yeast or trichomoniasis. Similarly, periodontal gel and garlic cloves should only be used for BV.
On the other hand, a yogurt suppository or probiotic suppository might be effective for both yeast and BV.Boric acid suppositories are only recommended for use against yeast infections.

, Abstaining from sexual activity may not be necessary for all treatments, but you should check with your doctor or do some thorough research to determine if the remedy you’ve chosen is safe to you and your partner before engaging in sexual activity during treatment.


In particular, exercise extreme caution when taking boric acid suppositories. Boric acid is toxic when ingested, making oral sex especially dangerous., Natural home remedies can cure vaginal infections in some cases, but if your symptoms don’t respond to consistent treatment, contact your doctor again. It is possible that your type and degree of infection can only be cured with medication.


Vaginal infections—especially those caused by yeast—that won't go away or continually return may suggest a more serious underlying cause, including diabetes, cancer, or certain STIs. While this won't always be the case, it's important to rule out the possibility by asking your doctor to test you.If your symptoms worsen or do not improve after three days of treatment, contact your doctor.
It's important to completely get rid of your vaginal infection. If left untreated, you may suffer from future complications, including pelvic inflammatory disease, an increased risk of pre-term deliveries, and an increased risk of contracting STIs.Even if you think you cured your infection naturally, consider asking your doctor to re-test you to make sure.

Take painful sex seriously.,
Note other problems with vaginal penetration.,
Pay attention to other muscle spasms.Vaginal muscle contractions and spasms are the hallmarks of vaginismus, but some women also experience spasms in the legs or lower back.,

Take sexual activity very slowly.",How to Cope with Vaginismus," The first and most disturbing symptom of vaginismus is pain during attempted sexual intercourse.Different women experience this pain differently--it may feel like burning, stinging, tightening, tearing, or as if your partner is “hitting a wall.” In many cases, the pain and the involuntary muscle contractions are severe enough to prevent sexual intercourse entirely.


Many women discover this problem the very first time they attempt to have sex. This is called primary vaginismusOther women develop vaginismus later in life, which is secondary vaginismus. So, it is important not to discount this key symptom just because you have been sexually active without pain in the past.;
, In addition to pain during sexual intercourse, women with vaginismus may have trouble with other kinds of penetration, including tampon insertion and pelvic exams. Other symptoms also include:unconsummated marriage
ongoing sexual discomfort or pain following childbirth, yeast/urinary infections, STIs, IC, hysterectomy, cancer and surgeries, rape, or menopause
ongoing sexual pain of unknown origin
halted breathing during attempts at intercourse

, These spasms occur most frequently during attempts at sexual intercourse.

, Avoiding sexual activity or romantic relationships because of pain or embarrassment about your symptoms is a clear sign that medical help should be sought.


Remember that this avoidance is not your fault, and is caused by your body's involuntary association of sex with pain.

, Make an appointment with your primary care physician or gynecologist to discuss the possibility of vaginismus. Be clear about the extent and severity of your symptoms.

, Your doctor should perform a pelvic exam and note any discomfort or vaginal contractions that occur. In addition, he or she will probably recommend additional tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.


The vaginismus may have an obvious physical cause, like an infection, injury, or hypersensitive nerves at the opening of the vagina (provoked vulvodynia)., If all other potential causes of your symptoms are ruled out, your doctor may diagnose you with either primary or secondary vaginismus. Additionally, your doctor may describe your condition as global, if it occurs in all situations involving insertion or situational, if it occurs only in certain situations (like attempted sexual activity).Unfortunately, female sexuality and sexual dysfunction are not fully understood. You may run into medical personnel who dismiss your symptoms or fail to help you. In this case, be persistent about getting a diagnosis and treatment. If your doctor does not help you, see another who has experience treating vaginismus and other forms of female sexual dysfunction.
Other possible diagnoses are apareunia, a general term for inability to have sexual intercourse (of which vaginismus is one type), and dyspareunia, which refers broadly to pain during sexual intercourse.These diagnoses will push your treatment forward, providing the opportunity to arrange a team of experts.

, Many women with vaginismus can trace their symptoms to feelings of anxiety, fear, and stress. These can be more deeply rooted, or simply related to current factors of life, like lack of sleep and excessive work-related stress., Women with vaginismus are more likely than others to have deeply ingrained negativity about sex and sexuality.These feelings may date back to childhood, or they may be related to a particularly traumatic event.


When negative underlying beliefs about sex start at a young age, another potential component of vaginismus comes into play--lack of proper sexual education.

, It is estimated that women with vaginismus are twice as likely to have a history of childhood sexual interference as non-sufferers.Events thought to contribute range from mild to severe traumas, and include the following:sexual abuse by someone familiar
sexual assault
pelvic trauma
domestic violence
highly negative early sexual experiences with a consensual partner

, If you have secondary and situational vaginismus, it may be rooted in issues with a sexual or romantic partner. These issues might include a lack of trust, a fear of commitment, or a concern about becoming too vulnerable or opening yourself up to pain and disappointment.

, A variety of conditions may provoke or heighten the symptoms of vaginismus. This is particularly likely if your vaginismus appeared after a period of normal sexual functioning. Potential medical conditions that can contribute to vaginismus include:


urinary tract infections and other urinary problems
sexually transmitted infections
cancer of the sexual or reproductive organs
endometriosis
pelvic inflammatory disease
vulvodynia or vestibulodynia

Medical procedures involving female reproductive organs, like hysterectomies, can also cause vaginismus.



, This is more likely if it was very difficult or resulted in injuries to the sexual organs. Other women have vaginismus from the hormonal changes and dryness that usually occurs during menopause.


Secondary vaginismus can also result from a fear of having children or going through childbirth., Some women never find out why they have vaginismus. They have no physical causes and no known non-physical causes.


Some research even suggests that symptoms of vaginismus are part of general defense mechanisms that are triggered in threatening situations. This suggests that it need not always be viewed as a primarily sexual dysfunction., A therapist can be helpful whether or not your vaginismus is caused by emotional or psychological issues. This is because awareness of the condition itself often produces fear and anxiety before intercourse, starting a vicious cycle that exacerbates symptoms.Feelings of depression, isolation, and lower self-esteem are also common effects of the stigma of sexual dysfunction.


Treatment outcomes are much more positive when the woman and her sexual partner are motivated, cooperative, and resolve to lessen relationship conflicts. So, a couple's psychological evaluation is a great beginning to treatment.If your vaginismus is connected to anxiety issues or past sexual trauma, a therapist can help you deal with these issues so you can start to move forward.
One particular type of therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can be especially helpful to some women. CBT focuses on the relationship between thoughts and behaviors, and a cognitive behavioral therapist can help you change your thoughts and behaviors regarding avoidance of sexual intercourse.

, One treatment for vaginismus is called exposure therapy, or flooding, and it involves gradual desensitization to penetration.Therapist-aided exposure to penetration is an effective treatment, even for women with lifelong vaginismus.The techniques for exposure usually involve vaginal penetration exercises using dilators.


This is the same method used for self-treatment, with the addition of a guide who can help you continue on your own with confidence and success., Ask your doctor to refer you to a physical therapist who has experience dealing with vaginismus and other forms of female sexual dysfunction. Because the muscles of the pelvic floor play such a major role in vaginismus, physical therapy is one of the best treatment options. Your physical therapist might:teach you breathing and relaxation techniques
help you learn pelvic floor muscle contraction to control your pelvic floor muscles

, To do a Kegel exercise, you simply contract the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine, hold for a few seconds, then relax. Aim to do about 20 contractions at a time, as many times a day as you can.


Some doctors recommend doing Kegel exercises with a finger inserted into your vagina (you can work up to three fingers). Using your finger allows you to feel the muscle contracting in order to better control its movements.

, Your doctor may recommend vaginal dilators to use at home. These are cone-shaped instruments that are placed in the vagina. They get progressively larger, enabling the muscles of your vagina to stretch and become accustomed to penetration.


To begin, bear down as you would when having a bowel movement. This helps enlarge the vaginal opening. Then, insert fingers (not the dilators yet) into your vagina, continuing to push or bear down.
When you begin using the dilators, leave them in for 10 to 15 minutes. The vaginal muscles will become used to the pressure.If you have a spouse or partner, you may want to ask this person to help you insert the dilators., Women with vaginismus need to be patient and try treatment options before jumping into sexual intercourse. If you try to become sexually active right away, you may experience pain or discomfort, and this sets you up for a cycle of pain and anxiety that worsens vaginismus. It is vital that you have a patient, supportive partner.


When you do try to have sex, go very slowly, use plenty of lubricant, and experiment to find the most comfortable positions.
Doctors typically suggest that women hold the penetrative object and place it partially or completely in their vagina as they have done with vaginal dilators. This applies equally to penises, dildos, and vibrators."

In conjunction with your doctor's advice, check whether you are experiencing at least five or more of the following symptoms thought to be associated with PMDD:Low energy levels, feeling deep fatigue, incredible tiredness
Physical symptoms can include tender breasts, headaches, neck aches, muscle or joint pain, bloating, etc.,
Note when these symptoms arise for you.,
See your doctor.,
Discuss possible causes with your doctor.,
Continue to keep a diary.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Get lots of regular exercise.,
Talk to someone who loves you unconditionally and understands you have PMDD.,
Take medication if your doctor considers this appropriate.,
Reduce and eliminate unhelpful drugs.,
Learn ways to help you sleep.,
Consider getting some form of counseling or therapy.,
See your doctor for a review.,
Find ways to work around the symptoms.,
Talk to your immediate supervisor and explain that you have PMDD.,
Get in later and go home earlier.,
Take over-the-counter drugs to get through the day.,
Change the way you work.",How to Cope with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder,"
Loss of interest in your usual activities and relationships
Irritability, feeling crowded and anger; some of this may be inflicted on other people you live or work with
Feeling tense, anxious
Feeling out of control; in some cases you may feel paranoid about people's motives toward you
Possibly experiencing panic attacks
Mood swings, a dark mood descends and won't leave, you may cry a lot or feel overwhelmed by emotional stimuli
Feeling sad, hopeless; in some cases, thinking suicidal thoughts
Resorting to binge eating, experiencing food cravings
Difficulties falling asleep or staying asleep; insomnia (which can cause any feelings of anxiety, tension, anger, etc., to worsen)
Difficulties concentrating; your brain may feel ""racy"" or ""foggy"".;
, If they're occurring in the lead-up days to a period and seem to lessen or disappear after the period arrives, there is a possibility that you have PMDD. It's a really good idea to keep a diary that covers at least three periods so that you can establish the pattern and present this to your doctor.

, Explain that you are experiencing at least five or more of the above listed symptoms in the days leading up to your period and that these feelings seem to evaporate or lessen greatly upon the arrival of your period. Your doctor will need to consider both the listed symptoms and other issues, such as whether there might be another condition or illness involved. You will likely undergo the following:


A thorough physical examination
A pelvic examination
A psychiatric examination.

, Research is still being done on the possible causes of PMDD. Hormonal changes might play a significant role, while already having a condition such as seasonal affective disorder, anxiety or severe depression can enhance the effects of PMDD.The usual suspects of poor diet and lack of exercise may also contribute to it, so it is thought that caffeine, salt and low exercise levels might exacerbate PMDD.Other possible causes include having a mother who has PMDD, smoking, being overweight and alcohol abuse.Low levels of serotonin could be another cause.If any of the possible causes are applicable in your case, be sure to raise them with your doctor to help him or her pinpoint what might be an issue for you.

, Even after your doctor has diagnosed you and suggested various treatment approaches, it is important to note the changes (or lack of them) with treatment. This helps your doctor in continuing to pinpoint more coping methods for the future.

, Remove as much processed food and fast food from your diet as you can. Eat lots of leafy greens, wholegrain foods, vegetables and fruit. Reduce your reliance on salt, sugar, alcohol and caffeine.


Substitute caffeinated coffee and tea with decaffeinated or no-caffeine products. If you really love coffee, try to avoid it in the week your period is due; this will require good calendar watching on your behalf.

, Try to go for a walk every day, or work out at your favorite exercise. Swimming, walking the dog a good distance, running, gym work, riding a cycle, etc. are all good forms of daily exercise.

, This could be a mom, a sibling, a spouse or a friend. Choose someone who knows it's ""that time of the month"" and can be reassuring, not make judgments and can offer a comforting shoulder to lean on temporarily. If you don't feel as if there is someone to talk to and you really need to talk, consider calling an organization that listens to people when they're in trouble; a chat with someone who cares can do wonders.


A pet can be great comfort too. Unconditional love in oodles there, and you can get lots of affection back too.

, This is something you'll need to discuss with your doctor. If you already suffer from acute depression or anxiety, medication may be an important part of your general recovery. That said, not everyone wants to take medication, so do your research and be prepared to choose the option that works best for you. Remember that being proactively interested in your well-being is an important part of maintaining good health, as by making the choices yourself, you remain in greater control. The kinds of medication that might be useful, depending on the context, include:Anti-depressants or anti-anxiety medication, especially where depression or anxiety are a constant issue for you
Birth control pill - some people find the pill helps correct hormonal imbalances and stabilizing ovulation; again, this is not for everyone but it might be helpful and is worth discussing
Diuretics - these can help with fluid retention
Ovulation suppressors
Supplements - calcium, B6, L-tryptophan and magnesium in the correct doses might assist but only on your doctor's adviceStandard pain relievers, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, especially to relieve physical pain and tension.

, If you smoke, PMDD is a good reason, among many others, to quit. And if you have a problem with drinking excess amounts of alcohol, seek help from your doctor. Even if you're not a heavy drinker, small amounts of alcohol might be a problem for your particular metabolism, so try not drinking any alcohol in the week leading up to a period to see if minimizing your intake helps. Record this in your diary and speak to your doctor about the results.

, Rather than resorting to sleeping pills, try the many available techniques that can help you to sleep better. You can find more details in How to sleep better and How to cope with insomnia.

, If you have mood swings, depression, anxiety, etc., talk therapy can be highly beneficial. For example, if you descend into a dark place when PMDD hits and think nobody loves you, you're a complete failure and you just want to die, these thoughts are the condition talking, not the real you. Indeed, the thoughts aren't real––they're manifestations of the mood swing that has overtaken you. Therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MCBT) can help you to listen to the thoughts in an abstract, objective way without associating them with your very self. In that way, you can learn to talk over them, reacting to them as the disembodied gatecrashers that they really are and send them packing.

, After trialing ways to cope with PMDD for a few periods, revisit your doctor to discuss the outcome. If you feel better, keep up the new things you're doing. If you still have problems, show your doctor the diary you've kept and explain which symptoms don't seem to be alleviated so far. It is important to keep working on fixing as much of PMDD as you can, at least to the extent that you can lead a normal life again.

, Life goes on, regardless of whether or not you have PMDD and that can be a problem. In a perfect world, you'd be able to call work and say, ""Sorry, got PMDD, need two days off"" and everyone would be cool about it. The work world hasn't evolved to cope with cyclical unwellness, so you will just have to do your best. Some coping suggestions are presented in this section.

, Explain the types of impact it has in your case but offer immediate and concrete solutions too. Basically, get some support and understanding, while showing it won't affect your work performance as a whole.


See if it's possible to make a deal to work from home in a flexible way. You still get the work done but without the pressure of people who might be just too much when you're feeling so bad. More and more people are finding it is possible to work from home some days of the week, depending on the type of work they do; do some research first so that you can present a good case.
If you get irritable with co-workers at this time of the month, it might help to explain that you aren't well rather than having them feel you suddenly dislike them. That said, some people are less than understanding, so be careful what you say, and to whom. It might just be better to ignore them or avoid them if you feel a sudden urge to vent on such people.

, Make up for it by working harder on non-affected days. You can also bring work home, although your rest is really important for coping.


Reschedule meetings or presentations that you know will suffer from you being unwell.
Bow out of after-work social events. Either make an excuse not to go at all, or turn up to be polite, then leave early.

, Aspirin, Tylenol, ibuprofen, etc., can help calm some of the pain and physical symptoms. Take anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medication if your doctor thinks this will help.

, This isn't for everyone, but it can work for some. Go freelance, work as a contractor, be a consultant, etc. Do work in which you determine the work hours, rather than the place of business. Find a job that only cares about what you deliver, not that you're sitting or standing in the right place all day long. Fortunately, unlike previous generations of women, technology has made this a real possibility.

This natural lubricant helps clean your vagina, keeping it free from unhealthy germs. Normal secretions are odour-free. Secretions may be thin, stringy or have white spots. If this sounds like your discharge, leave it alone. Natural discharge is very important in keeping your vagina healthy.;
, There are several different types of vaginal discharge. These types are categorized based on their color and consistency. Some are normal, while others may indicate an underlying condition that requires treatment.Thick, white, cheesy discharge – This is usually a sign of a yeast infection. May also be accompanied itching or swelling around the vulva.
White, yellow or grey discharge – Especially if accompanied by a fishy odor, this type of discharge is likely a sign of bacterial vaginosis. May also be accompanied by itching and swelling.
Yellow or green discharge – A yellow or green discharge, especially when it is thick, chunky, or accompanied by a bad smell, is not normal. This type of discharge may be a sign of the infection trichomoniasis, which is commonly spread through sexual intercourse.
Brown or bloody discharge – Brown or bloody discharge may be a product of irregular menstruation, but can also be a sign of more serious illness such as cervical cancer if accompanied by pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding.
Cloudy yellow discharge – This type of discharge, especially if accompanied by pelvic pain, may be a sign of gonorrhea.

, Factors that affect vaginal discharge include what you eat, your menstrual cycle, whether or not you're on the pill, if you are breast-feeding, what medications you are taking, whether or not you are pregnant, and whether or not you are under stress.


You can also be at risk of throwing off your vagina's natural pH balance if you are on antibiotics or if you use vaginal douches, feminine hygiene products or perfumed soaps. While anti-biotics cannot be avoided, douching and scented feminine products should always be avoided as these are bad for your body.
Other things that can put you at risk include pregnancy, diabetes or other infections that are near or around that area of the body.

, Leaving in a tampon for too long can cause unusual discharge. Some women forget they even had a tampon up there! You can also end up with other objects in your vagina which can cause a discharge (as your body tries to expel it). A common example is a piece of a broken condom.

, Off-color or foul odors in the vaginal region can be the sign of a pelvic infection after you've had a surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), vaginal atrophy during menopause, trichomoniasis or vaginitis, and several other vaginal infections, all of which should be diagnosed by a doctor and treated as advised by your doctor.


Vaginal discharge with bacterial vaginosis will be gray, white or yellow. It will also have a fishy odor.
If you have gonorrhea, you might have a cloudy or yellow discharge.
Yeast infections can be apparent if you have a thick, white discharge. This discharge is often described as having a cottage cheese consistency. Cottage cheese discharge is also characteristic of chlamydia, a common STI.
If you have an irregular period or endometrial or cervical cancer, you may notice a bloody or brown discharge.
If you have trichomoniasis, yellow/green frothy discharge that has a bad odor may affect you.
If you don't have health insurance, there are clinics (like Planned Parenthood) which offer gynecological exams and treatment that are inexpensive or free.
Avoid taking medication until you know what the cause is. There is medication for things like yeast infections, but you should not self-diagnose a yeast infection if this is your first time getting one. Taking yeast infection medication without a yeast infection can lead to future problems.

For instance, a serving of raisin bran (3/4 cup) has five grams of fiber. Similarly, you can gain 3.2 grams of fiber from eating two pieces of whole wheat bread.Another option is eating a cup of cooked barley, which has 9 grams of fiber., Beans are also a great source of fiber.

Seek help.",How to Accept Your Baby's Gender," The first step toward accepting your baby’s gender is to think about and identify why you are concerned about or disappointed in your baby’s gender. Personal beliefs, your cultural background, family pressure, and society’s expectations can all influence how you feel about your baby’s gender. While your feelings are personal and unique, here is a list of common reasons why people may have difficulty accepting their baby’s gender:Some cultures value one gender more than another, or place limitations and impose strict gender roles.
Your family has expectations that your child should be a certain gender or behave a certain way.
You may already have children of one gender, and hoped for your next baby to be the same gender or a different one.
Sometimes a parent feels like they will be better able to relate or connect with one gender more than another.
There is a perception that one gender is easier or harder to parent.
You hoped for a child who did not share your gender. You may feel like you faced gender discrimination and don’t want your child to face the same circumstances.
You may feel like only boys can carry on your name or legacy.
You planned for one gender, but your child turned out to be another. For example, an initial ultrasound may have indicated you would have a girl, but you end up having a boy.
Concerns that one gender has a greater risk of inheriting a genetic disease or condition.;
, It’s natural for parents to think about the gender of their baby and envision how the baby will fit in the family and imagine what the baby will be like as a child, a teenager, and as an adult. So, when the baby’s gender turns out to be different from what you expected, experts say you are reacting more to the disruption in your dream or fantasy than you are to your baby.Don’t feel like your baby is a mistake or the wrong gender. Instead, embrace the new possibilities and create a new dream., Don’t make assumptions that one gender gets along with one parent more easily than another or can only take part in certain activities. A child will love and connect with parents who put in the time and effort to provide support.As a parent, your actions and words determine whether or not you will bond with your child.

, You can make a commitment to accepting your child’s gender and confront any negative gender assumptions you may have.


For example, if there were things you looked forward to doing with a boy or girl, ask yourself if it’s really impossible to do these with a child of the other gender.
At the same time, you can also think about and celebrate the new opportunities you may have. For example, think about the special relationship that mothers and sons can have or fathers and daughters.
Remember, a child can do anything when parents offer support, love, and encouragement.

, Many medical professionals can do testing before and after the baby is born to determine if they may be at risk for contracting a hereditary condition. Medical professionals can tell you if your concerns are valid, and they can also provide advice on how to prepare for and treat a child with this condition.


Being prepared and confronting your fears is better than worrying and feeling hopeless.

, If you make a commitment to accepting your baby’s gender, you’ll be better able to cope with your feelings and move forward.


Think about the consequences of raising a child who feels unwanted and unloved because of their gender. He or she may suffer from low self esteem, difficulty accepting themselves, problems connecting with others, and having successful relationships.
To prevent this from occurring, you can start working through your gender disappointment.

, Although gender disappointment might seem like a taboo topic, if you don’t admit how you are feeling, you are going to have a hard time moving past it and learning to accept your baby's gender. Here are a few suggestions to help you get started:Write a letter about how you feel. When you’re done, try tearing it up or burning the letter. This can help you like you are letting go of your disappointment and concerns. Keeping the letter around can act as a constant reminder of these feelings, and it won’t help you move forward.
Talk with a friend or family member about what you are experiencing. The chances are high that they have dealt with a similar situation or know other people who have, and they might be able to offer some good advice on how to accept your baby’s gender., You might worry that you are the only person struggling to accept your baby’s gender and that it means you will not be a good parent. Many people, however, admit that they have felt disappointed about the gender of their baby at different points in their lives. Here are a few ideas about how you can feel less isolated and alone:Many parenting magazines and websites offer ways to connect with men and women who may also be struggling to accept their baby’s gender. Consider joining a chat room or posting on an online bulletin board. You will feel less isolated, and may also be able to help someone else improve their situation.If you know other new mothers or fathers in your area who may be having a hard time accepting their baby’s gender, form a support group and establish regular meetings. You can also join an existing support group for expectant parents or new parents.

, You might feel reluctant to communicate with your significant other about your feelings for fear that he or she will be upset, angry, or hurt. However, attempting to hide your feelings will prevent you from working as as a team to parent and raise your baby.Since you’ve probably spent some time examining your concerns, you can communicate with your significant other about why you are having a difficult time accepting your baby’s gender. Explain that this is something you are committed to resolving, and that you would value their support and advice. He or she may be able to help reassure you, and if you agree to work on the matter together, you’ll both feel less upset, anxious, and disappointed.
Trying to disguise your disappointment isn’t a long-term solution, and your significant other may be more hurt if you wait to share your concerns.

, Setting up a time to meet and talk with a midwife, doctor, nurse, or counselor about what you are going through is an important step in feeling better. They interact with many parents-to-be, and are experienced in offering emotional support and medical care for any problems that may arise.They will also be able to identify whether your gender disappointment might be caused by a medical condition such as postpartum depression.If you feel like your current medical professional is not supportive or understanding of your situation, consider working with someone else.

, Instead of focusing on how disappointed you feel or how hard it is to accept your baby’s gender, try thinking about how amazing and miraculous it is that you and your significant other created this baby. Remind yourself that your baby needs your love, support, and acceptance, and this has nothing to do with gender.Keep in mind that every baby, whether a girl or a boy, has the same basic needs—food, sleep, attention, affection, and love.
It can also be helpful to remember that gender is only one aspect of what makes your baby who they are. Instead of fixating on gender, think about the personality traits, physical features, and family background and history that make your baby unique and special.

, If your reason for not wanting a certain gender comes from cultural or social expectations, teach your child to accept themselves regardless of her or his gender. Instead of conforming to other people’s ideas about what your child can or can’t do, support your child in whatever they decide to do and teach them to challenge gender barriers and gender prejudice.For example, having a daughter doesn’t mean you can’t play sports with them, fish with them, or bond with them. Avoid teaching your children that activities are off limits because of their gender.
While you can share activities with your child regardless of her or his gender, it’s important not to force them to do things they aren’t interested in. This could jeopardize your relationship with your child, and make it difficult to accept his or her gender.

, One way to help you cope with gender disappointment and accept your baby’s gender is to volunteer your time to work with children in your community.For example, if part of your dream of having a boy was to coach your son’s sports team, consider signing up to coach a team in your area.
If you imagined yourself mentoring a daughter, you could volunteer to be a role model for young women in your community.

, Researchers have shown that cuddling with your baby increases the bonding chemistry between parents and newborns. As a result, cuddling may also help you accept your baby’s gender and improve your connection with your newborn.Touch your baby’s skin.
Nuzzle the top of your baby’s head.
Smell your baby.
Look into your baby’s eyes.

, Feeding, bathing, and changing diapers may seem like chores, but performing these activities will help you feel more responsible and closer to your baby. , Go for a walk around the neighborhood with your baby in a stroller, take them to the grocery store, or walk around the mall. The more time you spend with your baby, the closer you will feel to him or her, and the time spent on these activities will promote gender acceptance.You will also encounter many people who admire and compliment your baby, which will make you feel even more like a proud parent.

, Even if you still feel disappointed that your baby’s gender is different from expected, tell your baby you love them just the way they are. It’s important for your baby to feel loved, but verbalizing acceptance will also help you feel more accepting., While television and movies often depict the bond between parents and babies as immediate, this isn’t always the case in real life. Be patient, and give yourself time to process all the changes in your life.Pregnancy and the initial months after the baby is born bring major physical and emotional changes. Sleep deprivation, hormone levels, and lifestyle shifts may make you feel disappointed, depressed, and like you are having a hard time accepting your baby’s gender.
Pressuring yourself to bond with your baby may make you feel more anxious and disappointed, so take your time.

, Although you may feel like you have come to terms with your baby’s gender and have successfully bonded with your child, it’s natural for your previous concerns and feelings to re-emerge occasionally. When this happens, don’t be hard on yourself.Sometimes, it can be helpful to think about what may have triggered your feelings. For example, did you see a baby in a store or hear someone talk about their baby that reminded you of how you initially felt?

, If you are struggling to bond with your new baby and accept your baby’s gender, it’s important to seek help and work with a mental-health professional. A trained psychologist, counselor, or therapist, can help you connect with your baby and learn to accept your baby’s gender."

Get the right size gym ball.,
Either get a gym ball specific for pregnancy or check the weight limit.,
Inflate the ball.,
Sit on the ball.,
Experience the benefit of simply sitting on the ball.,
Begin gentle exercises, such as the following.,
Bring the ball to your birth.,
After childbirth, your gym ball is a great way to get your pelvic floor muscles back into shape.,
Try sit-ups using the ball.,
Use your gym ball for your baby.",How to Use a Gym Ball During Pregnancy and After Childbirth," This is important to make sure you have correct posture for your exercises.


If you are under five feet three inches (160cm): You need a ball that inflates to around 21.6"" (55cm).
Between five foot three and five foot eight (160cm to 172.72cm): Then you will need a ball inflating to 25.5"" (65cm).
Five foot eight (172.72cm) and above: The ball should inflate to 29.5"" (75cm).;
, You should aim for a ball that supports at least 250-300 pounds (113.39kg to 136kg) and it must have a feature called 'anti-burst'.

, Your ball should be firm to the touch, but not hard - usually about 70 percent of its size is the right amount of inflation. It is also recommended to leave the ball 24 hours after inflating before you begin using it. The firmer the ball, the less stability it has, and the harder the exercises will be for you.

, Make sure you have a chair or sofa nearby in case you need it to steady yourself.


Place your feet approximately 20-25 inches (50.8cm to 63.5cm) apart.
Keep your spine straight, but leaning slightly forward. This will help to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, which is something that is very important for pregnancy in order to prepare your body for an easier labour.

, In order to balance on a gym ball you have no choice but to sit correctly, keeping your back straight and pelvis aligned, which reduces backache and helps your baby into a good position. So if you're pregnant, but too tired for exercises, just sitting on your ball instead of the sofa can still help strengthen your muscles and ease pressure on your back.

, Make sure you are supporting your bump if needed, and always stop immediately if you feel out of breath or uncomfortable at any time.


Rock your hips gently from side to side.
Rotate your hips in circles, do ten sets clockwise and ten sets anti-clockwise.
Rotate your pelvis in slow figures of eight.
Sit carefully on your ball, place both hands under your bump to support and bounce up and down. Rest after every set of 25 or less, according to your fitness level.

, If you're able to bring your ball with you, you'll find it can also be used during the early stages of labour.


Rotating your pelvis in figures of eight during contractions can help ease muscle pain.
Kneel on the floor with a towel under your knees, hugging the gym ball to your chest. You can then lean head, shoulders and chest onto the ball, allowing your belly and lower back to relax.
Whilst kneeling as above, you can sway your body side to side or rest back on your heels.

, You can do the same exercises as whilst you were pregnant, just make sure you are not pushing your body more than you should.

, After childbirth, sit-ups are a great way to strengthen your abdominal muscles. Wait until you have had your 6 week checkup and that your doctor has said you are okay to resume exercising.


Make sure your gym ball is against the middle of your back and your feet are around 20 inches (50.8cm) apart and flat on the floor.
Place your hands behind your head and raise as normal.
Begin by resting after every set of 10, then after 25, and increase according to your fitness level. Do not rush yourself, you are still healing!
Combine with a cardio routine three or four times a week to see the best results.

,


You can also use your gym ball to cradle your baby, often whilst swaddled and to rock them to sleep.
Babies with head control may enjoy being held and bounced.
Older babies that can sit or stand with support may enjoy batting and playing with the gym ball on the floor.

Recognize what a contraction feels like.,
Start timing when you feel a few in a row.",How to Time Contractions1," Many women describe contractions as a pain that begins in the lower back and moves in a wavelike fashion toward the abdomen. The feeling is described as being akin to menstrual cramps or constipation. With each contraction, the pain is mild at first, it builds to a peak, and then it subsides.


During contractions, the abdomen becomes rigid.
For some women, the pain stays in the lower back area. Contractions feel a little different for everyone.
At the beginning of labor, most contractions last from 60 - 90 seconds and occur every 15 to 20 minutes. They decrease in duration and increase in frequency as labor draws closer.;
, It's common to feel a contraction every now and then in the months leading up to labor. Your body is ""practicing"" for the main event, and it's usually no cause for alarm. When your due date approaches and you feel several contractions that seem to be following a regular pattern, time them so you can determine whether you're going into labor.

Surprise your partner.,
Tell loved ones individually.,
Wait for a family gathering.,
Throw a gender reveal party with a twist.,
Go public on social media.",How to Announce Twins1," If he wasn't there when you found out you'd be having twins, there are lots of creative ways you can tell the dad-to-be.


Start purchasing supplies you'll need like cribs and car seats. Your partner will be very surprised when he sees that there's two of everything!
Show him the sonogram and see how long it takes him to see that there are two babies. If he doesn't realize on his own, point out the baby's face, and then point out the other baby's face.
If your partner doesn't know you're pregnant yet, wrap up not one, but two positive pregnancy tests. Surprise him with the news when he asks why there are two tests there.;
, Tell the most important people in your life before making a public announcement. You can be as creative as you want!


For close relatives like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and siblings, send a card or an e-card from the babies. For example, you could write, ""We're really excited to meet you, Aunt Carol! Love, the Johnson twins."" You may want to include a copy of the sonogram.If the timing works out, wait for a gift-giving holiday like Christmas, a birthday, or Mother's Day. You can wrap up your message in a box disguised as an ordinary gift, or you could give your loved one a twin-themed gift, like a T-shirt that says ""World's Best Grandma"" with a picture of two babies.Invite loved ones over and start showing them the things you have bought in preparation for the babies. You can be subtle with this by just showing them things like clothing and diapers and waiting for them to comment that you probably have more than you need. You may also be able to find outfits and bibs that are twin-themed., If you'd rather tell your entire family about the news at once, consider waiting until everyone is gathered to celebrate something else, like Thanksgiving for example. You can then give them all something else to celebrate!, If your friends and family know you're pregnant but they don't know that you're expecting twins, make the announcement at a gender reveal party.


This could work especially well if you're having a boy and a girl. Many gender reveal ideas are based around revealing a color, whether it's cutting open a cake to see if the batter is blue or pink, or opening a box to reveal blue or pink balloons.For twins, you can use a combination of blue and pink or a gender-neutral color like yellow. Your guests might be a bit confused at first, but they'll be really surprised when they figure out what's going on!
You can also use this idea if you're having two babies of the same sex. If you're having twin girls and you want to use the balloon idea, for example, you can put two large pink balloons in a box. Write ""It's a girl"" on one and, ""It's another girl"" on the other.

, If you're ready to tell the whole world that you're expecting twins, post the news on your favorite social media site. Depending on your preferences, you can post a simple and straight-forward message or a creative picture that requires a little bit of thought.If you want to post a picture, think about creative ways you can hint that there are two babies. For example, you can take a picture of two pairs of baby shoes. If it's around the holidays, you could post a picture of Christmas stockings for Baby #1 and Baby #2 hanging next to those for the rest of your family.You can also post a funny picture that shows you and your partner panicking about the thought of having two babies. Just make sure to make it clear that you're actually really happy!
If you already have children, think about including them in your announcement picture. They could, for example, be wearing T-shirts that say, ""I have two little brothers on the way.""Utilize yours or your partner's profession in the theme you use to spread the word about the twins. If you or your significant other is a lawyer, for instance, you could post a mock legal brief to announce the twins.
Make sure you tell those who are close to you first before you post the news electronically. Some people may be offended that you didn't tell them in person or on the phone.

Have patience.",How to Prepare for Pregnancy After 40," As people age, the likelihood of suffering from common health conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes increases and older women may also be more likely to have conditions that impair fertility.


Your health care provider will perform a routine exam and probably do a pap smear and pelvic exam. The exam should not take more than 15 or 20 minutes but you may take more time to talk to your provider about getting pregnant.Ask your doctor how to increase your chances of conceiving and what lifestyle changes you can make to assure you have a healthy pregnancy. Be honest about your current lifestyle and be open about any recommendations for changes.Discuss whether you will be able to continue using any medications you are currently taking while you try to conceive and while pregnant or breastfeeding. Ask your doctor if alternate therapies or medications are safe during pregnancy, and if such routes are realistic for you given your medical history.Evaluate with your doctor which health problems are most important for you to address before pregnancy. As certain health problems, like high blood pressure, get worse with age it's important to discuss how to manage these issues with your doctor.Get any immunizations your doctor recommends. Your doctor may perform blood work to check for immunity to diseases such as rubella and chickenpox. Wait a month to try conceiving after you get a vaccine.Your doctor may wish to perform labs to evaluate your ovarian reserve, or the probability that good eggs still remain.;
, The risk for certain pregnancy-related health issues increases with age. Discuss your personal risk with your doctor and what you can do to reduce that risk.


High blood pressure can sometimes temporarily develop in pregnant women and some research suggests the risk increases with age. Women of any age have their blood pressure monitored regularly during pregnancy, so your physician will strive to make sure your blood pressure is under control. You may need to be on certain blood pressure medications during pregnancy to assure a healthy delivery.Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that occurs only during pregnancy. It becomes more common with age. Untreated gestational diabetes will cause the baby to grow much larger than average, so you will have to control your blood sugar levels with exercise, diet, and possibly medication if you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes., Many women over 40 give birth naturally. However, due to an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications, the likelihood of a C-section increases with age.


Go over a specific birth plan with your doctor and make sure you take the possibility of a C-section into account. If you've already had one child via C-section, some doctors will not allow you to give birth vaginally. Discuss any concerns with your doctor and let her know your preferences for giving birth.The strain of childbirth is harder if you're older. Problems related to high blood pressure and issues with the placenta during birth increase with age. Your doctor should carefully monitor your health throughout pregnancy. If she believes you're at risk for delivery complications, she may want to induce labor and deliver the baby via C-section., It can be more difficult to conceive after 40, so you may need fertility treatments. Talk to your doctor about the possibility of fertility enhancing drugs or surgical treatments.


Oral medications, such as clomiphene or clomiphene citrate, are taken by the mouth during days three through seven or days five through nine of the menstrual cycle. These medications increase the chance of ovulation. However, oral meds do increase the chance of multiple pregnancy. There is a 10% chance of twins on such medications. These meds have about a 50% success rate for conception and delivery, but only if the patient is not ovulating. They do not increase pregnancy rates substantially if the patient is already ovulating on her own.Gonadotropins and Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) are hormonal injections used to boost fertility in older women. Injections start two to three days into the menstrual cycle and continue for seven to 12 days. You will need a health care provider to perform a transvaginal ultrasound during treatment to monitor egg size. The rate of multiple births are high for such treatments. About 30% of women who conceive via hormonal injections have multiple births, and two thirds of these births are twins.If there is any damage to the reproductive system that is causing difficulties with delivery, a doctor may want to perform a surgery to correct the issue. If successful, surgeries should greatly increase the chance of conception., If you have any existing health problems, make sure they're under control before you try to conceive.


Sexually transmitted infections can prevent your ability to conceive, so get tested if there's any risk you have an STI. Most STIs can be treated effectively with antibiotics. Get proper treatment for sexually transmitted infections and diseases immediately and do not try to conceive until you're STI free.If you're on any medication for a chronic condition, such as hypothyroidism, you should take a blood test before attempting to conceive to make sure it's under control. You will need periodic testing throughout your pregnancy and your doctor may need to alter medication dosage over time., Dietary changes are important during pregnancy as you'll need increased amount of certain nutrients during pregnancy. Make sure you're prepared for a healthier diet.


Over half the grains you eat each day should be whole grains. This means whole-grain cereals, brown rices, whole-wheat pasta, and whole-wheat bread. You should also eat a wide variety of healthy fruits and vegetables throughout your pregnancy.You should also strive to get extra protein, preferably in the form of lean meats, nuts, eggs, and legumes. Fish is a good source of nutrition and high in protein, but you should avoid fish like king mackerel, shark, swordfish, and tilefish as they may be high in mercury.Dairy products are also important during pregnancy due to the calcium and vitamin D they contain. You can talk to your doctor about calcium supplements if you're unable to digest dairy.There are a variety of foods that are off limits during pregnancy as they can be harmful to a fetus. Raw meats and deli meats can contain contaminants that are harmful to a fetus. Smoked seafood can also be harmful. Anything that contains raw eggs or egg yolk can be damaging, so make sure your eggs are cooked all the way through. Soft cheeses, like brie, are often made from unpasteurized milk and should be avoided. Caffeine intake should be lessened during the first trimester., If you are overweight or underweight, your doctor will likely want you to get your weight into a healthy range before you conceive. Talk to your doctor about how to gain or lose weight in a healthy fashion and work with her to form a diet and exercise regimen that works for you.Underweight is defined as having a BMI under 18.5 and overweight is a BMI over 25. A BMI of 30 or more is considered obese. If you're underweight prior to pregnancy, you'll be expected to gain more weight throughout your pregnancy and if you're overweight you'll be expected to gain less. As weight can be somewhat hard to control during a pregnancy, it's best to strive for a healthier weight before conceiving.Being overweight during pregnancy increases the risk for gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. Being underweight can increase the risk for a premature birth, and your body may not be strong enough to support a pregnancy.Work with your health provider prior to conceiving on achieving a healthy weight for your height. Talk about exercise and nutrition and what changes you should make to your lifestyle to achieve a healthy weight., Tobacco, alcohol, and recreational drugs of any kind will be off-limits during pregnancy, so you should avoid using such substances while you're trying to conceive. You should also minimize caffeine intake, as caffeine should only be used in moderation during pregnancy. If you're a heavy caffeine drinker, work on cutting back before trying to conceive to minimize symptoms of caffeine withdrawal. You should only have about 150 mg of caffeine a day, which comes to about two cups of coffee., Exercise is safe and even encouraged during pregnancy, and there are a variety of pregnancy-safe exercises you should be engaging in before and during your pregnancy.


Aerobics, resistance, and flexibility exercises are important for pregnant women. Walking, stationary biking, yoga, swimming, and weight lifting are generally safe for pregnant women. However, every pregnancy is different so discuss your health with your doctor beforehand. She may recommend more or less exercise depending on your overall health.Your heart rate should raise during a workout, but if you're over 40 it's important to keep your heart rate between 125 and 140 beats per minute. You can measure your heart rate by taking your pulse through your neck or wrist and counting the number of beats in a 60 second timeframe.Be careful about abominable exercises that involve lying on your back. These can be dangerous to the fetus as they restrict blood flow., The rate of chromosomal birth defects is higher in infants born to women over 40. Be aware of these risks and be open to testing for chromosomal abnormalities.


Aneuploidy, or an abnormal number of chromosomes, is more likely to occur with age, and can cause disabilities such as Down Syndrome. A person is born with a set number of eggs, and healthier eggs tend to be released at a younger age. Eggs with chromosomal abnormalities are more likely to be released and then fertilized in your 40s. By age 40, the chance of Down Syndrome is 1 in 60 and that number continues to increase with age.There are a variety of tests that can be conducted to check for abnormalities. A sample of amniotic fluid or placenta tissue can be used for testing. Such tests do come with a slightly increased risk of miscarriage but there are new test that can be done at no risk to the fetus. A simple blood test, called a Cell Free DNA test, can now be used to detect fetal abnormalities., Pregnancy loss can be very traumatic, and the risk increases with age. Whether via stillbirth or miscarriage, you will be at an increased risk if you're over 40.


Carefully consider the possibility of pregnancy loss before trying to conceive. While many women do deliver healthy babies after 40, miscarriages due to preexisting health conditions and hormonal abnormalities become more common. Make sure you prepare for the emotional impact pregnancy loss will have on you, in the event that it occurs.
Close monitoring of the fetus throughout pregnancy is important if you're over 40, as it can prevent the likelihood of pregnancy loss. Talk to your doctor about any personal risks associated with your age and ask her for increased monitoring during pregnancy.At 40, the rate of miscarriage increases to 33% and that number gets higher as you age. By 45, the miscarriage rate is at 50%. Talk to your doctor about what you can do to prevent miscarriage., The chances of having twins or triplets increases with age, especially if you use in-vitro fertilization or fertility drugs to increase your chance of conceiving.


Make sure you're financially able to support a multiple pregnancy. Educate yourself about the specifics of carrying twins, including options for delivery. Many twins need to be delivered via C-section., It can take much longer to conceive if you're over 40. Older women's eggs are not fertilized as easily as younger women's, and it may take over six months to conceive. If you still have not successfully conceived after six months, talk to your health care provider.The chances for multiple births depend on a variety of factors, but certain fertility treatments increase the rate. Hormonal injections have a 30% chance of multiple births and oral medications carry a 10% chance of twins.

Locate the pain.,
Evaluate the pain.,
Time the contractions.,
Change positions.,
Note where you are in your pregnancy.,
Take a walk.,
Relax.,
Know your triggers.,
Call your doctor if you have signs of true labor.,
Call if you have premature signs of labor.,
Call your doctor if your baby seems to be moving less than normal.",How to Identify Braxton Hicks Contractions," Does your contraction tighten in a band across your abdomen? If so, it's probably a Braxton Hicks contraction. True labor pain usually starts in the lower back and moves forward to the abdomen, or from the abdomen to the lower back.True labor pains are often described as resembling menstrual cramps.Pain in the lower back that comes and goes, and pressure in the pelvis, are often signs that your contractions are real.;
, Are the contractions uncomfortable, or very painful? Do they grow more painful with each contraction? Braxton Hicks are not typically painful, and do not grow more painful with each contraction. They usually stay weak, or start strong and grow weaker.True labor pains will steadily increase in strength.

, Braxton Hicks are often irregular. They do not grow closer together. True labor occurs at regular intervals that grow slowly closer together, starting 15 – 20 minutes apart and increasing to fewer than five minutes apart. True labor pains last 30 – 90 seconds., If you experience a contraction while sitting, try walking around. If you are walking or standing, sit down. A Braxton Hicks contraction will often stop when you change position. True labor contractions will not stop when you change movement, and often intensify when you walk., If you are not yet at 37 weeks, your contractions are more likely to be Braxton Hicks. If you are past 37 weeks and have other signs such as frequent urination, loose stool, vaginal spotting, or losing your mucus plug, your contractions might be real.True contractions before 37 weeks could be a sign of early labor: contact your health care provider if you think you are having early true contractions.

, If your Braxton Hicks contractions are making you uncomfortable, moving will often make them go away. If you have been walking, taking some time to sit might also stop them., Getting a massage, taking a bath, or just taking some much-needed rest time can help soothe your contractions. Reading, listening to music, or napping can all be helpful.If you are able to sleep through your contractions, then they are probably not labor contractions.

, Braxton Hicks are a healthy exercise your uterus does to prepare for labor. They occur naturally, but some pregnant people find them to be triggered by particular activities. You might experience a Braxton Hicks after exercise or strenuous activity. Some are triggered by sex, or orgasm. Some people experience Braxton Hicks when they are overtired or dehydrated.Learning your triggers can help you recognize a Braxton Hicks contraction when it comes.
Braxton Hicks do not need to be prevented, but they can be a good reminder to drink water and get rest.

, If you have contractions coming every five minutes for over an hour, or if your water breaks, call your health care provider. If you're unsure that the signs are there, a doctor or nurse can help you identify them over the phone or in person.You may not have to go to the hospital right away, but calling can help you figure out your next steps.
False alarms are common, especially in first pregnancies. Don't worry about embarrassing yourself by making an early trip to the hospital: it's part of the experience., If you have any signs of labor before 36 weeks, consult your health care provider. If you have signs of labor in combination with vaginal spotting before 36 weeks, call immediately.If you experience vaginal bleeding, rather than spotting, at any point in your pregnancy, call your health care provider.

, Once your baby has become a regular kicker, a lack of movements could require medical attention. If you don't feel at least ten movements within a two-hour period, or if the movements have significantly slowed, call your doctor."

Decide what timing tools to use.,
Start timing at the beginning of a contraction.,
Write down the time the contraction starts.,
Write down the time the contraction ends.,
Write down the time when the next contraction begins.",How to Time Contractions2," You may use a stopwatch, a clock with a second hand, or an online timing tool to keep track of the frequency and duration of your contractions. Have a pencil and paper handy as well so that you can record the numbers and recognize patterns.


Use a precise timer, rather than a digital clock without seconds. Since contractions often last under a minute, it's important to be able to time them to the second.
Make a chart to help you easily record the data. Create a column titled ""Contractions,"" one titled ""Time Started"" and a third titled ""Time Ended."" Include a fourth column called ""Duration"" to calculate how long each contraction lasts, and a fifth column called ""Time Between Contractions"" to calculate the length of time elapsed between the beginning of one contraction and the beginning of the next one.

, Do not start in the middle or at the end of an already-occurring contraction. If you-or whoever is experiencing the contractions-are in the middle of a contraction when you decide to start timing them, wait for the next contraction to begin.

, When you feel your abdomen tighten, start the timer or begin watching the clock and jot down the time in the ""Time Started"" column. The more accuracy you can provide, the better. For example, instead of writing ""10 PM,"" write ""10:03:30 PM."" If the contraction did start exactly at 10 PM, then write ""10:00:00 PM.""

, When the pain subsides and the contraction ends, record the exact moment it stopped. Again, include as much information and accuracy as you can.


Now that the first contraction is over, you can fill in the ""Duration"" column. For example, if the contraction began at 10:03:30 and ended at 10:04:20, the duration of the contraction was 50 seconds.
Record other information about the contraction, such as where the pain began, what it felt like, and so on. This could be useful as the contractions continue and you begin to notice patterns.

, Subtract the start time of the previous contraction from the start time of this contraction and you'll know how far apart your contractions are. For example, if the previous contraction started at 10:03:30 and this contraction started at 10:13:30, then your contractions are exactly 10 minutes apart.

Recognize the signs of labor contractions.,
Know the other signs that labor is occurring.,
Know when to prepare for the birth.",How to Time Contractions3," In some cases women have series of contractions before they actually go into labor. These are called ""false contractions,"" or Braxton Hicks contractions. Knowing the difference between real labor contractions and false contractions can help you determine what steps to take next.


Labor contractions get closer together and shorter in duration as the hours pass, while false contractions don't follow a predictable pattern.Labor contractions continue even if you switch positions or move around, while false contractions may go away after you move.Labor contractions get stronger and more painful over time, while false contractions tend to be weak.

, Aside from having regular contractions, there are other physical signs that a woman is experiencing labor, rather than false labor.Look for the following changes:


Water breaking.
The baby ""lightening,"" or dropping lower toward the cervix.
Passing of the mucus plug.
Dilation of the cervix.

, It's time to go to the hospital or have the midwife get ready to deliver the baby when ""actual labor"" occurs. This happens when strong contractions with a duration of 45 to 60 seconds occur 3 to 4 minutes apart."
"
Send twin birth announcements.,
Create a website about the twins.,
Mail newsletters that announce the twins' arrival.,
Change your answering machine or voice mail message.,
Post a sign in your front yard.",How to Announce Twins2," The traditional method of announcing births usually comes in the form of mailed cards with birth statistics. You can be creative and include funny captions.


You can send two separate cards in two separate envelopes, two separate cards in the same envelope, or one card with information about both babies together.

, You can begin this once you find out you're expecting twins and include ultrasound photos and shower pictures. Once the babies arrive, you can chronicle their milestones and include updates about their growth.


If you didn't tell everyone you were having twins beforehand, make a big announcement on the website and be sure to link to it from your social media accounts so all your friends will see it.
Some website providers offer free templates to use, or if you're more computer savvy, you can design your own. You may also opt to make your website private and accessible only to those who have a password.

, This is ideal if the children are born around the holidays or specific seasons as you can incorporate that theme into the newsletter. .


If your babies arrive shortly after the New Year, you might state on the newsletter that you rang in the New Year with not just one Baby New Year, but two.

, Your recording can let everyone know that the twins have arrived and can provide answers to common questions people may have.

, This will let all your neighbors know the good news. You can opt for one sign that says, ""It's twins!"" or, ""It's two boys!"" or you can post an individual sign for each baby.

Get into the lying position slowly and carefully.,
Try to lie on your left side.,
Roll over to your right side if you are uncomfortable.,

Don’t sleep on your stomach after your first trimester.,
Roll on your side, if you are not already on your side.,
Take a deep breath before you stand up.,
Ask someone for assistance.",How to Lie Down in Bed During Pregnancy," When trying to lie down while pregnant, pillows are your best friend. Before you get into bed, pile on the pillows and ask your partner to help you position them for you so you can get comfortable. A long pillow, like a body pillow, is great for positioning against your back when you lie down on your side, or for you to hug when you sleep on your side.You can also use a pillow to prop your head up so you don’t get heartburn while lying down and place a pillow between your knees or under your belly to take pressure off of your back and legs. Many stores also sell a long body pillow designed to also go between your legs to support your hips when you're pregnant.;
, Your doctor will likely recommend you drink lots of water during your pregnancy to stay hydrated. But avoid drinking a large glass of water before lying down or before bed, as this may cause you to wake up several times during the night to go to the bathroom. Stop drinking water one hour before you plan to lie down., Many pregnant women suffer from heartburn, which can lead to discomfort and interrupted sleep. Prevent heartburn by skipping spicy meals a few hours before bed or before lying down. You should wait at least two hours after eating to lie down and relax so you don’t develop heartburn.If you start to feel heartburn once you lay down, use a pillow to prop your head up. Elevating your head can help your body to digest what you have eaten.

, To ensure you get a good night’s sleep, make sure your mattress is firm and your box spring does not sag or dip. Place your bed on the floor if the box spring sags or use a board under your mattress to keep it even and firm.If you are used to sleeping on a softer mattress, you may find switching to a harder mattress uncomfortable. Stick to the softer mattress if it is what you are used to and you have no issues getting a full night’s sleep on the bed.

, Sit on the bed, closer to the head of the bed than the foot of the bed. Move your body as far on to the bed as you can. Then, lower yourself down onto one side using your hands as support. Bend your knees slightly and pull them up onto the bed. Think of yourself as a rolling log, rolling on your side or on your back.Have your pillows ready on your bed so you can position them easily once you lie down.

, Lying on your left side, or the “left lateral position” will help with your blood circulation and ensures your baby gets a sufficient amount of nutrients and oxygen from the placenta. Doctors also recommend sleeping on your left side to help with insomnia or other sleep issues during pregnancy.Get comfy on your left side by placing a pillow between your legs, a pillow under your belly, and a pillow or a rolled up towel behind your back. You can also hug a full length body pillow for extra comfort.
Another option is to sleep on your left side in a three quarter position. Lying on your left side, place your bottom arm behind you and your bottom leg straight out and down. Bend your top leg and rest it on a pillow. Bend your upper arm and place a pillow behind your head., If your left side isn’t comfortable for you or if it feels too awkward, try rolling onto your right side.Complications with lying on your right side are almost nonexistent, so it's fine to choose the right side if it's more comfortable.

, Sleeping on your back is fine for the first few weeks of pregnancy, when your uterus has not yet expanded and will not exert any kind of pressure on the vena cava, which is the vein that carries blood back to your heart. But by your second trimester, avoid lying on your back as it can lead to nausea and dizziness. It can decrease oxygen transmission to baby.To lie on your back comfortably during your first few weeks of pregnancy, place a pillow under your thighs and let your legs and feet roll open to the side. You can also roll one or both legs back and forth to release any tension in your lower back., Many pregnant women are comfortable sleeping on their stomach during the first week of their pregnancy, especially if they usually sleep on their stomach. But it can become uncomfortable once your uterus starts expanding and you begin to feel like you are carrying a large beach ball on your stomach. Sleeping on your stomach after your first trimester can also endanger your baby’s health so try to lie on your side or to your back for the remainder of your pregnancy.Keep in mind your baby will also experience discomfort while you sleep or lie down and might wake you up with a kick if she is feeling stressed due to your sleep position. If you wake up on your back or your stomach, simply roll over to your left or right side. However, being comfortable during pregnancy is very important. , Shift your knees so they come towards your belly. Move your knees and your feet to the edge of the bed. Use your arms as support as you push yourself into a sitting position. Swing your legs over the side of the bed.You can also place a pillow between your legs to help you get up.

, To avoid any dizziness or nausea when you get up, take a long breath before you raise up off the bed. This will also prevent you from aggravating any back pain you might be feeling., Enlist the support of your partner or someone close by to help you get out of the lying position. Have the person grip your forearms and gently help you rise up from the bed."

Find large sweaters.,
Pull on tights.,
Start wearing hats.,

Thanks to swollen and aching feet, you will want extra support throughout the day. Find a pair or two of comfortable flats.You want shoes that are easy to put on without having to bend over. Try to get a pair half a size up to help with swelling. Some ideas include:


Ballet flats with embellishments like rhinestones or bows
Gold or silver sandals
Leather clogs
Fleece-lined boots;
, Oversized sweaters are fashionable when you have a small baby bump, and they will continue to fit you as your tummy grows. Try to look for sweaters that have a long length and an open front.Avoid denim or other rigid fabrics. You may gain weight in your arms, which will make these jackets tight and constricting. Some good options include:


Roomy knit sweaters
Soft, flowy cardigans
Kimono jackets
Shawls

, There are many benefits to wearing stockings during pregnancy. They can help prevent varicose veins and reduce swelling. In addition, they keep your legs warm in the winter. While you can wear nude tights, try mixing things up with some brightly colored designs. Tights also come in a wide array of patterns, such as floral or animal prints., Maternity clothing can be limited in terms of style and fit. If you are worried about a drab wardrobe, you can try adding something new to your look. Hats are a great way to accessorize in funky ways, and—unlike the rest of your body—your hat size is unlikely to change during pregnancy. Best of all, hats can be purchased for relatively cheap, giving you an easy way to mix things up. Some fun hat styles include:


Floppy straw hats
Feminine cowboy hats
Fisherman caps
Trilbys or Fedoras

, You may not want to wear the same styles over and over again during the next nine months. Try to find accessories that can be worn in multiple ways. These will help you keep your outfits fresh and interesting.


You can clip broaches and pins onto your jacket, purse, scarf, or hat.
Scarves can be worn around your neck, in your hair, or on your handbag.
If you're not wearing your cardigan, you can tie its sleeves loosely around your neck so that it drapes down your back.

At least once a week, take your piercing out (when your piercing professional says it is safe to do so) and wash it with warm water and soap.Scrub hard in order to disinfect the ring or bar. Dry it with a paper towel or wash cloth before you reinsert it.
Use safe soaps when you are washing. Soaps with flowery scents, and artificial additives can increase the likelihood of infection.;
, Beyond your daily shower/bath, it is critical that you keep your navel region clean and sanitary as a means to prevent infection. Every day, use a wash cloth that is soaked in warm water and soap, and wash the navel region.After you are done washing, dry off gently using a paper towel or a dry washcloth. Use gentle dabs rather than pressing hard against your skin.
Keep a lotion around, or cortisone cream, which can be applied whenever you feel as if there is a redness or dryness. Check the labels of the packaging as some antibiotics are unsafe for pregnant women.
Do not use your fingernails or fingers to scrape because that might cause irritation.

, Try to avoid tugging on it or fiddling with it, because your pregnancy will make the skin more elastic and more prone to stretching or tearing.


Not only should you not touch the piercing, but you should also not let anyone else touch, kiss, or lick the piercing. The exchange of bacteria and/or fluids around the healing area is a recipe for infection.
If you touch the pierced area out of habit, or accidentally let someone else touch it, immediately wipe the area down with warm water and soap.

, A navel piercing will likely catch on to your shirt as your stomach grows, and your shirts become more tight. This is also the case for tight maternity pants, which tend to ride up over the stomach and can latch onto the piercing. Make sure that each of your shirts and pants give at least an extra inch around so that your piercing has room to be free and not hook.


When buying clothes, try and go to stores specializing in pregnancy clothing. They will have shirts and pants that are available in larger sizes. Do not get tight-fitted stretch shirts if you have a piercing, because there is a likelihood that the piercing will still catch on.When a shirt is too tight, the piercing can hook on and rip out. If this happens, contact your doctor as soon as possible. Do not use over the counter antibiotics to treat a serious wound.

, As you become pregnant, your belly will start to push against your old clothes. There is a high likelihood that your piercing will hook onto your clothes and rip out. Contact your doctor in case this happens, and do not use over-the-counter antibiotics to solve a serious problem., This is a home remedy that can help decrease the likelihood of infection and the spread of illness. If you are already taking an antibiotic prescribed by your doctor, do not use this as it might interfere with the medicine.Add a teaspoon of salt to a cup of warm water. Mix together using a spoon.
Get a washcloth, and soak the rag in the liquid. Gently dab the washcloth onto the area. Make sure to wash your belly button and the surrounding navel region. You can also sprinkle the mixture on the navel region with your hands, but make sure they are clean first.
After you have used the mixture, wipe the navel region off with a dry cloth or paper towel. Let the region fully dry before you put your shirt back on.

, By providing warmth or coolness to the pierced area, you can reduce inflammation and thereby decrease the risk of infection. You can either buy specialized hot water bottles or cold packs, or use a strong plastic bag.


If you choose to use the plastic bag, make sure that it is thick enough. Sometimes cheap bags can leak, and you do not want to burn or freeze the already inflamed area.
Add either warm water or cool water into the bag. Lay back, and lift up your shirt. Gently dab the bag against your skin. Do not press down too hard, as this will cause more inflammation.
When you are done, and the pain has subsided, let your navel region reach room temperature before you replace your shirt back over the area.

, These are great home remedies that provide some minor health benefits. Gently apply small doses to the pierced navel region. Clean the area off with a damp paper towel or wash cloth. Make sure that the area has dried before you replace your shirt. If you experience a negative reaction to the oil, immediately contact your doctor., Pregnant women often times complain about sensitive skin, inflammation, and irritation. Navel piercings amplify these negative side effects. If you are feeling any discomfort whatsoever at the navel region during the pregnancy, it is best to take the piercing out.


Check your skin for redness and/or dryness. Keep track as to whether or not your daily regimen of soreness treatments are working.
Plan to remove your piercing around the fifth or sixth month of your pregnancy. That is when most women get their largest around the navel region, which can result in serious pain if you do not remove the piercing. The skin begins to stretch and the piercing will be pressed up against the region.
If you have any doubt as to what is causing the pain, contact your doctor.

, Use warm water and soap, create a lather, and clean in between your fingers as well as under your fingernails. If your hands are dirty, this can likely cause infection.

, You do not want to take the piercing out if it is stuck, or if the skin has attached to the piercing. If this has happened, seek the help of a doctor, or a piercing professional.

, This is generally thought of as a non-decorative ball. One hand will hold the main bar, as the other hand gently unscrews the ball. Feel the ball first to see if it will unscrew safely and easily. If the ball is stuck, contact a professional.

, Do this as gently as possible. If you feel any tug as you pull it out, leave the piercing in and contact a professional or your doctor.

, Apply warm water and soap to a washcloth or paper towel. Gently dab the region. Make sure to get both the navel region and the belly button. Let the area dry before you do anything else to it. Apply a small bandage or bandaid to the pierced area as to not risk the region getting infected.

, There is a high likelihood that your hole will close up after you remove the piercing. Every few days or weeks, slide the piercing through the hole to keep it opened.Leave the piercing in the hole for a few minutes, up to an hour. Do not leave it in any longer as the pain from the piercing pressing up against your uterus will likely come back.
Be careful as you do this. Make sure your hands have been sanitized as well as the navel region. Clean the region after you are done.

, In some cases, it is not necessary to remove the piercing while pregnant, but it might be more comfortable to get a new piercing. Look for piercings labeled ""PTFE"". This means that it is flexible, and not a rigid metal bar. It will move and expand with your belly as it grows during the pregnancy. It can also be cut to the size of your girth., This is absolutely critical because the metal in the piercing is right in the way of where the doctor will make the incision. Follow the previous steps to remove the piercing, and do not put the piercing back in until you are completely healed. Consult your doctor to find out what would be an appropriate time to reinsert your piercing., As your tummy stretches, your belly button will probably stretch as well. The skin around your piercing has more freedom to stretch, which makes it more prone to stretch marks, scarring, and infection. This can be reduced or prevented by the use of moisturizers and good hygiene.


It is also best to moisturize every day using a moisturizer that is natural and free from harsh chemicals or fragrances.

, During the third trimester when hormone levels are soaring, women become more susceptible to skin conditions such as rashes, irritation, itching, and inflammation. It is important to address any of these conditions immediately after they develop to prevent them from worsening or leading to infection.

, Continually reinserting the piercing into the hole can cause damage to the navel region. Wait until at least a few weeks after you have had your baby., Often times during pregnancies, ""innie"" belly buttons can pop out, creating strain between the piercing and your skin. Your skin and abdominal muscles are also expanding while you are pregnant, putting more pressure on the navel region. Throughout the day, lift up your shirt to see whether your belly button has been stretched, ripped apart, or torn.If this happens, immediately remove the piercing. It is best not to inflame the region any more that it already is. Place a small bandage over the area, and contact either your doctor or a piercing professional.
If there is simply redness, or the potential for stretching, use a bandage and cover the belly button. This will stop your belly button from popping out any more than it already has.
You will want to consider the process of healing. You do not want to heal a piercing while you have a new baby kicking your navel region, making you bend over, constantly move, etc.

, There are many risks to getting a piercing right before, or during a pregnancy. The piercing can cause infection, inflammation, and even the possibility of disease. You need to spend time thinking about why the belly button piercing is so important.


Write down a list of reasons why this is critical. This is not only a good idea for pregnancy piercings, but piercings at any time. Go through each one and decide whether that is a good enough reason (it means something to me, it is part of my identity, etc.).
After you have written down the best reasons you have, talk to your friends and family about your decision. They might have a different point-of-view, and wish to dissent or agree.
Talking with a piercing professional is also important. The professional is likely to have gone through this situation before, and know the best advice for you.

, It is important that the place you go to get a piercing is legit. Any problems with the piercing can result in infection, disease, and harm to the baby.


Ask if you can watch the piercer set up his station before you get the piercing. The piercer should always wash his hands, and instruments. The instruments he or she uses should be unopened.
Look around the studio to see if the place is well kept. The floors should be neat and tidy, the station sanitized, and there should be no presence of blood.
Make sure that the piercer enforces age restrictions. The piercer should also have an active portfolio of his or her past work. Ask to see the portfolio before you even begin to think about getting the piercing.

, The typical, close-fitting belly button piercing will not be an option for a woman that is soon to be pregnant. You will need to shop around for piercings which are optimal for your future condition.


Plastic maternity belly button rings. These rings are made of soft, plastic material that will stretch along with your growing belly. These rings can expand slightly, and therefore are less likely to irritate the skin and lead to infection. The good news is that they are much cheaper than the metal rings and they're easy to find online.
Try out circular rings instead of barbells. These are less likely to fall out than barbell shaped rings. As your tummy grows, it's possible for the pierced hole to temporarily stretch as well. If it gets large enough, there is a chance barbell rings could slip through it.
Use large gauge rings rather than smaller ones. The larger the gauge, the thinner the ring, and the better it will fit as your tummy grows. Buy a 14 gauge ring, which is the largest gauge.
Stick-on belly button jewelry is a great alternative to the traditional piercing. It can be used to imitate a pierced belly button and is very popular with pregnant women. Fake piercings will also decrease the likelihood of inflammation and infection. Check out How to Make a Fake Belly Button Piercing.

, It is always the best option to simply delay getting your navel pierced until after you have had your kid, and have actively recovered from the pregnancy. Getting your navel pierced while pregnant can result in infection, disease, and harm to the baby.The navel region is not very muscular, and therefore has very little active blood flow. This means that, even if you were not pregnant, the navel piercing would take a long time to heal. The navel is the longest piercing region to heal, at around nine to twelve months on average.The navel region is next to abdominal cavities, making infection even more of an issue. The navel piercing is also one of the only piercings to continuously have to touch your shirt, making infections even more prone to spread.
There is the possibility that your naval region treats your piercing as a ""foreign object,"" and therefore not heal properly.

, While there are general risks to a pregnancy navel piercing, your doctor will know the specifics about your past health. If you have been prone to infection before, have a history of disease, or have had problems healing piercings, you might want to wait. Make sure you consult with the doctor before you get the piercing, as he will be able to give you advice before you go in to get the piercing.

Exercise regularly.,
Maintain good posture.,
Stretch your lower back.,
Enroll in a prenatal yoga class.,
Swim or do prenatal water exercises.,
Squat and lift with your legs when picking something up.Do not bend at your waist or lift with your back muscles.",How to Alleviate Back Pain During Pregnancy1," Continuing physical activity during uncomplicated pregnancies has been shown to be beneficial and not risky.However, if your back pain develops late in pregnancy, you should be cautious about easing slowly into new routines.


Look for pregnancy-safe ways to strengthen your core, abdominal, and back muscles. Avoid traditional crunches and oblique exercises, which can put pressure on important veins and separate abdominal muscles from each other. Instead, try standing crunches or tucking your tailbone while standing. You may also try getting on your hands and knees and touching alternate elbows with your knees, switching between sides.Walking, swimming, and stationary cycling are particularly safe options for exercise during pregnancy. Ask a doctor or physical therapist for other suggestions.Stand with your back to a wall. Bend your knees and work to straighten your spine.Engaging in high impact exercises prior to pregnancy, such as running and jogging, have been shown to reduce the risk of pelvic girdle pain in pregnancy.;
, As your center of gravity shifts forward during pregnancy, you might start to strain muscles in order to avoid falling over. Practicing good posture can shift your center of gravity back and reduce strain.


When standing, envision an imaginary cord pulling your body up into perfect alignment from above your head. Use a comfortably wide stance, don’t lock your knees, and rest one foot occasionally on a step stool if you have to stand for a long time.When sitting, sit up straight and don’t slouch your shoulders.Instead, keep your shoulders back and relaxed.

, Get on your hands and knees and alternate rounding and then flattening your back. Hold each position for several seconds, but be gentle, gradually working up to ten repetitions.This is sometimes called “cat and cow” stretching.

, In addition to relieving back pain, prenatal yoga can improve sleep, reduce stress, and alleviate other symptoms such as nausea and headaches. It may also strengthen the muscles you will use in childbirth.Always let your yoga instructor know that you are pregnant.
You can also do gentle yoga poses at home. However, be sure to avoid poses that involve lying on your stomach, lying on your back after 16 weeks, inversions (going upside-down), strong twists, back bends, holding your breath, or taking short, forceful breaths. If something feels difficult or like a strain, don’t do it.There are many safe poses during pregnancy. These include hip-opening squats (malasana), chair pose (utkatasana), warrior poses I and II (virbhadrasana), tree pose (vrksasana), and legs up the wall pose (viparita karani). , In addition to being a great workout, water exercise relieves pressure from your back and joints.Since the water supports your weight, even walking or floating in the pool will help relieve the pressure.

, Ask for help if you need it.


When carrying bags, try to distribute the weight evenly. Carry a similar amount of weight in each hand."

Ask about other fertility treatments.",How to Get Pregnant," Some birth control methods have a longer readjustment period than others, so be aware that you might not conceive right away. The time it takes for a woman's body to be again ready to become pregnant after discontinuing contraception varies.


Hormonal contraceptives — such as oral birth control, hormone injections, or the Nuva Ring — might have a longer lag period while your body readjusts.
If you have an implanted contraceptive, such as an IUD, you need to see a health professional to have it removed.
If you were relying on barrier methods (such as condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms or sponges), you don't need to worry about a readjustment period. This doesn't mean you'll conceive immediately, though. (Also, take caution to prevent sexually transmitted infections if you were relying on these devices for protection.);
, If you can time it right, your odds of becoming pregnant will be much higher. There are a few tricks to tracking your ovulation:


Count forward from the first day of your last period. On average, most women ovulate 14 days after they first begin to menstruate. (Does this mean you should only start trying 2 weeks after your period? Not exactly. See Step 3 for more help!)

If you have regular cycles, you can often estimate the time of ovulation by dividing your cycle in half. For example, if your period usually lasts 28 days, you will likely ovulate around day 14 of your cycle (14 days after you begin menstruating). If you have a longer cycle, you may ovulate as late as 20 days after your period began.Download a tracking app. If you find it difficult to keep a calendar of your cycle, make an app do it for you. Search ""ovulation tracker"" and find one that works for you.
Take your basal body temperature. Your body's temperature will rise slightly when you're ovulating, so an uptick is a good sign that you're fertile.Keep a thermometer by your bed, and take your temperature first thing in the morning when you wake up. (Try to do it around the same time.) Jot down your temperature each day. If you notice a spike between 0.5 and 1 degree Fahrenheit that lasts more than a day, you might be ovulating!Fertility is highest during the two to three days before your basal temperature risesso if you can observe any month-to-month patterns in when your temperature rises, you can predict the best time to conceive.


Keep track of your cervical mucus. It sounds gross, but it works. When your vaginal discharge is clear and stretchy, like raw egg whites, you are most likely fertile and should plan on having sex daily for three to five days from the day you noticed this consistency in your discharge. Once the discharge becomes cloudy and drier, you are less likely to conceive.
Use an ovulation predictor kit. Just like buying a pregnancy test, you can pick up an ovulation predictor kit from your local drugstore. The cost can add up, though, so this might be a good way to jumpstart calendar charting by figuring out when you tend to ovulate.

, Once you know you're fertile, get busy! When and how often you have sex can influence how quickly you conceive, so try these tips:


Start having regular sex slightly before ovulation. Here's the thing: an egg is viable for about 24 hours, but sperm can survive for up to a week in the fallopian tubes. To make sure you don't miss your shot, start trying to conceive a few days before you think you might ovulate.
Keep the sperm supply fresh. However, just because sperm can last up to a week doesn't mean they're in tip-top shape by then. To combat this, aim to have sex at least every other day while you're fertile. (Though you can certainly try more often, too!)
Do not use spermicides, lubricants, or chemical stimuli. Products aimed at enhancing pleasure or preventing conception should be avoided during intercourse if you are trying to achieve pregnancy.Enjoy yourself. Orgasming after your partner ejaculates into you can help pull sperm into the cervix, which may facilitate the movement of your partner’s sperm.
Bask in the afterglow. Don't make the sperm work against gravity — instead of getting up immediately afterward, lie back and relax for a few minutes. Studies on the efficacy of artificial insemination demonstrated that lying flat for 15 minutes after sex can increase your odds of conception up to 50%, Once the ovulatory period has passed, the waiting game begins. Wait until your next expected period — if it doesn't show up, take a pregnancy test and see what happens! If you're the impatient sort, you can try these methods a little earlier:


Keep taking your basal body temperature. If your temperature stays high for 14 consecutive days after ovulation, odds are good that you conceived.
Watch out for implantation symptoms. Some women experience an implantation bleeding, which usually turns up as slight spotting as the zygote attaches to the uterine wall. It usually happens 6 to 12 days after conception. You might also experience light cramping.

, Most couples don't get pregnant right away. Out of 100 couples trying to conceive every month, only 15 to 20 couples will succeed. However, 95% of couples trying to conceive will get pregnant within two years! You can't control every factor of your fertility, but there are a few simple changes you can make to increase your odds.

, Even if you haven't hit any fertility roadblocks, a basic pre-conception physical is a good idea. Some pre-existing health conditions can be aggravated or significantly worsened by pregnancy. Your doctor will probably conduct a pelvic exam and order some basic blood tests. Some disorders you'll want to catch before pregnancy include:


Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which can interfere with ovulation.
Endometriosis, which can generally inhibit fertility.
Diabetes: If you can catch and manage diabetes before conceiving, you'll be able to avoid birth defects commonly associated with the disease.
Thyroid disease: Like diabetes, thyroid disease is relatively non-threatening to your pregnancy as long as it's diagnosed and well-managed., If you're not conceiving right away, take this opportunity to focus on your physical well-being. You'll improve your odds of getting pregnant, and you'll be able to start the process on the right foot.



Lose weight. Studies demonstrate that clinically obese women have a harder time conceiving, as well as experiencing more problems during pregnancy. If your body mass index (BMI) is a little high, consider spending some time on diet and exercise.

Check out http://www.choosemyplate.gov/ for healthy diet suggestions.
Get fit. Shed some belly fat, start running or take up yoga.
Don't go too far. Women who are clinically underweight (with a BMI under 18.5) might stop menstruating altogether, and have difficulty conceiving. Aim for a weight that's healthy, not extreme.



, Starting before you get pregnant will build up the necessary nutrients in your system for a developing embryo. For example, taking folic acid supplements before trying to conceive may reduce the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects.


Make sure your vitamins contain folic acid, calcium and iron., Some substances are harmful to your chances of conception, while others can harm your newly developing baby.


Consumption of pesticides may also be linked to pregnancy difficulties, so now may be a good time for couples to choose organic foods.
Avoid trans fat, often found in processed baked goods and sweetened foods. There is some evidence that a diet high in trans fat (especially relative to monounsaturated fat intake) can increase chances of infertility.Avoid questionably prepared raw fish, unpasteurized cheeses, sprouts, prepackaged foods that don’t look fresh, and lunch meats containing nitrates. These foods and other foods that are undercooked or improperly cleaned can lead to food poisoning or illness, reducing your chances of supporting a healthy pregnancy.

, Traditional medicine and folklore have long held that certain foods promote or decrease fertility and sexual appetite. In recent years, scientific research has confirmed some of the potential biological mechanisms for certain foods’ perceived effects on fertility.


Eat a diet rich in organic plant-based foods that includes grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. The antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals provided by these foods are thought to improve cellular health and even promote a healthy uterine lining.
The right kinds of protein can help boost fertility; tofu, chicken, eggs, and some seafood are high in omega-3 fatty acids, iron, selenium, and other fertility-enhancing components.
Consuming full-fat dairy products, such as whole milk or full-fat frozen yogurt, can potentially improve fertility over a diet of only low-fat or fat-free dairy., Men should take a multi-vitamin that contains vitamin E and vitamin C, eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and avoid excessive alcohol, caffeine, and fat and sugar intake.Men should also make sure they get plenty of selenium (55mcg per day), as selenium is suspected to increase fertility particularly in men., Recreational substances — such as cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine and harder drugs — can slow your conception timeline. However, they're also things you should avoid during pregnancy, so might as well start now! Here's what to do:



Quit smoking. Not only is lighting up while you're pregnant a bad idea, it can hinder your chances of conceiving in the first place.Giving up an addiction while you're pregnant can be extra stressful, so save yourself some suffering by quitting beforehand.

This goes for your partner, too! Men who smoke regularly have lower sperm counts and more abnormal sperm. Second-hand smoke can affect your odds of conceiving, as well.


Stop drinking. Women planning to conceive should avoid alcoholic beverages for up to two months prior to attempting conception. This is especially true for couples who are having a difficult time conceiving.
Avoid excessive caffeine intake. This includes both food (like chocolate) and drink (like coffee). Women who drink more than three cups of a caffeinated beverage daily are significantly less likely to get pregnant compared to women who consume two cups or less.Do not use drugs. Illegal street drugs, such as cocaine or marijuana, can impair your body’s ability to get pregnant and develop a healthy baby.

, If it's a struggle for either you or your partner to get interested in sex, you might find it difficult to conceive. A qualified reproductive medicine professional or sex therapist can help you overcome these issues as a couple.


Try not to let infertility to strain your relationship. The pressure to conceive, as well as invasive and emotionally stressful fertility treatments, can actually lead to sexual dysfunction and make getting pregnant even harder.Set a relaxing mood, don't demand too much of your partner, and try to focus on this time as an opportunity to enjoy each other before you have to worry about the needs of a child.

, Many people believe in the power that the mind has over the body; once you decide to become pregnant, some people believe that how you think about the process and your relationship may have an impact on your success. Stress can overwhelm your health even at the best of times, so keeping as much of a positive outlook as possible will help you both stay calm and keep healthy.


Focus on positivity and opportunity as much as possible. When you are with your partner, if your mind gets distracted, start imagining a beautiful baby until your mind comes back to your desire of becoming pregnant. The act of focusing on each other and your pregnancy goals may help you forget your other stresses. Just avoid dwelling too much on getting pregnant, lest that stress you out even further. If you reach a point where the stress of trying to get pregnant is itself a chore or seems overwhelming, it may be time to touch base with your doctor.

, Patience is difficult when you're trying to conceive, but try to give it time. Setting a deadline for seeing a doctor can help ease your anxiety and get you ready for the next phase of getting pregnant. Here's when you should seek help:Healthy couples under the age of 35 engaging in regular (twice weekly) intercourse should be able to conceive within 12 months (plus time for readjusting after discontinuing birth control).
If you’re over 35, see a doctor after six months of trying. Women over the age of 35 and women who are peri-menopausal may experience difficulty in getting pregnant due to the natural decline in fertility that occurs as women age. In most cases, pregnancy can still be achieved but may take longer and require more targeted intercourse and lifestyle changes.
See a fertility specialist right away in a few special cases. If you have endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, prior cancer treatments, endometriosis, a history of miscarriages or you're over 40, make an appointment with a reproductive specialist as soon as you want to conceive.

, Everything from illness and stress to excessive exercise and medications can decrease fertility.


Certain medications can prevent or complicate conception. Provide your health practitioner with a complete list of medications, herbs, supplements, and any specialty drinks or foods you are eating so that he or she can evaluate your list for potential fertility blocks.
Get checked for sexually transmitted infections. Some infections can decrease your ability to conceive, while others can cause permanent infertility if left untreated.
Have a gynecological examination. In some cases, women may have a removable tissue barrier that is preventing sperm from reaching the egg, or may have a physical condition that affects the menstrual cycle, such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.In general, it’s a good idea to have regular gynecological exams once a year to make sure that you’re healthy.

, If both you and your partner have been given a clean bill of general health by a physician, consider sperm testing and medical monitoring of your fertility.


Men should have a semen analysis to check the quality and number of sperm emitted during ejaculation. Additional male fertility tests include a blood test to check for hormone levels and ultrasounds that monitor the ejaculation process or sperm duct obstruction.Fertility tests for women often include hormone tests to check for thyroid, pituitary, and other hormone levels during ovulation and at other times during the menstrual cycle. Hysterosalpingography, laparoscopy, and pelvic ultrasounds are more involved procedures that can be used to evaluate the uterus, endometrial lining, and fallopian tubes for scarring, blockage, or disease. Ovarian reserve testing and genetic tests for inherited infertility problems can also be performed., Fertility treatments can be expensive, stressful and time-consuming. Take some time to consider the commitment before you get started.


Discuss it with your partner. Make sure you're both ready to commit financially and emotionally to such an exhaustive process. Talk about how long you're willing to try treatments, what you're willing to spend, and when or if you'd both want to consider other options, such as adoption.
Speak with a trusted health professional before visiting a fertility clinic. A health professional who has no motivation for promoting a particular therapy or procedure can help you and your partner understand the basic options for assisted reproductive therapies.
Evaluate your medical history. Some procedures carry risks, and others may only be advisable in women without certain health characteristics. A health professional that has your best interest in mind will not promote the use of technologies that are not appropriate for your individual situation.
Look at the costs. Many physicians can also give advice about understanding costs and insurance coverage and provide a realistic, unbiased idea of how long and how successful attempted reproductive assistance may be for you and your partner.
Find the right specialist. Ask for recommendations regarding particular fertility specialists or clinics, and get a referral if necessary.

, Set an appointment just to talk about your situation and your expectations for getting pregnant.


Develop a list of questions before your appointment. Go over them with your partner to make sure you haven't missed anything. Cover any concerns you have about costs, side effects, and the success of the treatments.
At your first visit, do not expect to have a physical evaluation or to begin treatment. Just show up ready to ask questions and learn about your options.
Do not feel obligated to commit to a particular treatment center after a single visit; visit several and keep your options open until you identify the best clinic for you.

, In small trials, the process produced better results than in-vitro fertilization, and the procedures involved in NaPRO may be covered by many insurance plans.

, IVF is considered the most effective and common method of achieving pregnancy through assisted reproductive technology.IVF involves the removal of mature eggs from your body (or that of a donor) and its fertilization with your partner’s (or a donor’s) sperm in a laboratory, with subsequent insertion of the fertilized egg into your uterus to promote implantation.
Each cycle can last 2 or more weeks, but most insurance companies pay for few — if any — IVF cycles. The process is invasive and both the egg extraction and the implantation portions of IVF carry risks.IVF is less likely to succeed in women with endometriosis, women who have not previously given birth, and women who use frozen embryos. Women over the age of 40 are often counseled to use donor eggs due to success rates of less than 5%., If your fertility troubles are caused by difficulties in sperm reaching the egg or by sperm difficulties, artificial insemination or donor insemination may provide a solution.Artificial insemination involves the injection of sperm into the woman’s body to circumvent male ejaculatory problems. If the male partner’s sperm is infertile, a donor’s sperm can be injected into the woman’s body in an attempt to conceive as well. This process is often performed one day after ovulation hormones rise in the woman, and can be done in a doctor’s office with no pain or surgical intervention.IUI may be used for up to six months before trying alternate, more expensive, and more invasive therapies. In some cases, the therapy can be combined with fertility drugs for the woman, and the injection of healthy sperm works the first time.

, In some cases, fertility drugs may be sufficient for elevating fertility hormones and allowing natural conception. In others, fertility options such as Gamete Intra-fallopian Transfer (GIFT)or surrogacy may be recommended.

Begin an honest conversation.,
Speak clearly.,
Listen to each other.,
Conduct research.,
Track your thoughts.,
Make a timeline.",How to Emotionally Prepare for Pregnancy1," If you are in a relationship, it is important to be on the same page as your partner. Deciding to have a baby together is one of the biggest decisions you will ever make. Speak to one another openly about your intentions and desires regarding raising a family.There are many important questions and concerns that should be discussed before starting a family. Some individuals have specific timelines in mind regarding a family, while others may care only about the number of children they have.
Discussing all of the details surrounding raising a family is the first step in emotionally preparing for a pregnancy. It is a sign that you have the maturity needed to become a parent.
If you feel uncertain, that's ok. Tell your partner, ""I have something important I want to discuss. I'm nervous, so please be patient."";
, Tell your partner how you feel now about pregnancy. If you are having any concerns, speak up. If you feel ready to start trying for a baby, then make this clear.Try explaining your feelings. You can say, ""I feel like we are ready to take the next step in our lives. I want to consider trying for a baby.""
Bring this up when you are feeling stable in your relationship. Early on in a relationship is often an unrealistic time to raise this possibility.
If you are at a point of emotional or financial turmoil in your lives, you might want to consider waiting until things calm down. If your partner broaches the topic at a bad time, ask if you can revisit the conversation in the future.

, Remember that this should be a joint decision. If your partner voices a different opinion, tell yourself to listen respectfully. If you don't understand the point being made, ask questions.For example, try paraphrasing. You could say, ""I hear you saying that you're not ready to stop traveling for work. Is that right?""
If your partner remains ambivalent, be considerate. It may take time to bring him or her around to your way of thinking.
Avoid badgering him or her, or insisting that you keep talking about it regularly. Give it a rest for a few months before returning to the discussion––this will give your partner time to think about what you've said.

, When you are considering making a major life change, it's a good idea to find lots of information. Find useful and constructive information to inform your conversation. It's recommended that you do a little research first and find useful resources to guide both of you in understanding what changes could occur.A good place to start is with printed resources, such as self-help books, pregnancy books, parenting books, self-discovery books and resources printed by parenting and baby care groups. Such resources will help both of you to explore the health and emotional issues associated with pregnancy, including risks and stresses.
Moreover, be sure to read beyond the pregnancy stage and read about early childhood. Look at sources that discuss how child raising impacts your life.

, Monitoring your thoughts and emotions can make it easier to communicate. It's a great way to help you focus on issues to bring up with your partner. Consider starting a journal in which you can document all the feelings associated with the emotional pregnancy journey, including the decision to try to get pregnant.There is also a more practical element to doing this––it enables you to keep track of the highs and lows of your feelings and moods.
A journal can be many things––it can help you organize your thoughts as you collect information from various sources, it can be a place for expressing your feelings, it can be where you keep price comparisons for all the baby items you think you need to get and it can be a place to keep medical notes too.
Be sure to include information that you receive from conversations with your spouse or partner, suggestions from friends and family members as well as the facts that you absorb from print resources.

, Invest in a suitable method of contraception until you are ready to intentionally conceive a child. The most common cause of feeling emotionally unprepared is an accidental pregnancy. Talk to your partner about the method of birth control that works best for you.Avoid these worries by properly planning when you want to conceive and only remove contraception from your regular routine when you choose the time. This way, you will both maintain control over the outcome and start off with the desire to create a family on your own terms.

Be cautious of sleep apnea.",How to Stop Snoring Naturally1," For some people, snoring is the result of a frequently-changing or irregular sleep schedule. Working very long hours before sleeping, skipping a night's rest, or failing to sleep enough over long periods of time can leave the body extremely fatigued. When the body does get a chance to sleep, it ""crashes"", sleeping especially long and hard. During this intense sleep, the muscles at the back of the throat relax more than they normally would, which makes snoring more likely.To avoid this state, try to get a full night's sleep starting at about the same time every night. Though everyone's sleep needs are different, most adults do best with about seven to nine hours of sleep.Children and teens usually require somewhat more.
Wait until bedtime to sleep. Naps are a great way to recharge your batteries when you have a stable sleep schedule, but they are counter-productive when trying to change sleeping habits. Do not nap at all during the day so that you can fall asleep at the appropriate time later.;
, Use the bed only for sleep and sexual activity. Do not watch TV or look at your phone. About an hour before bed, turn off all of your electronics and dim the lights of your phone and computer. Doctors note that our eyes are sensitive to the bluish light emitted by electronic screens.Avoid stimulants after mid-day. Depending on the size of your body, the amount you ingest, and your general health, the effects of caffeine can remain active in your body for up to 5 to 10 hours after initial consumption. Avoid coffee and caffeinated teas and sodas.
Avoid eating within three hours of going to bed.
Avoid alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows down your body. While this will help you fall asleep, alcohol also slows down your metabolism and interferes with your brain during its sleep cycles. You're likely to wake up more often if you've consumed alcohol before bed.Avoid heavy exercise one to two hours before bed. Doctors advise that you avoid a heavy cardio workout a few hours before you plan to go to bed; this can unsettle your circadian rhythm and make your sleep less restful. That said, light stretching and exercising, such as an evening walk, are probably useful in getting you ready to go sleep., This can help you relax before bed and also set proper and functional breathing in motion even before you hit the hay. Here are two different exercises to try:Deep breathing - Put your hands (palm down) on your stomach, right below the rib cage. Place the fingers of your hands together. Take a long, slow deep breath by expanding your belly. This ensures that you are using your diaphragm to breathe rather than your rib cage. The diaphragm creates suction that pulls more air into your lungs than can be achieved by expanding the rib cage. Your fingers should separate as they lie on your belly. Exhale and then repeat. Do this whenever you are short of breath or as often as you can. At first, you may feel a bit dizzy because you are getting more oxygen than you are used to!

Humming breath - As you exhale a breath, make a humming sound. This helps strengthen the diaphragm. Do this whenever you are short of breath or as often as you can.

, Keep your room dark at night. Sleep specialists note that our circadian rhythms are influenced by light and darkness. This means that many people have a hard time falling asleep when it's still light out, which happens in the summer thanks to daylight savings.At night, shut your blinds and curtains. Turn off bright overhead lights. Consider getting a black out curtain which keeps any light from shining through. If it's still too bright or too much light is getting in, consider wearing a sleep mask.


Set the temperature of the room and your body. Because the body drops in temperature when it falls asleep, you can trick your body into thinking it's time to sleep by simulating a temperature drop. If it's cold outside, take a hot shower so that when you come out, your body experiences a temperature drop. If it's hot outside, allow your room to heat up and then turn on the air conditioner.
If you live in a dry climate, you may want to try running a humidifier in your bedroom as you sleep. Sensitive throats can sometimes be irritated by breathing in the dry air throughout the night.
Turn on white noise. You can listen to some light music or put a fan on for some background noise.

, The membranes of the throat and soft palate, the tissue at the back of the roof of the mouth, can be irritated by breathing in dust, pollen, dander, and other airborne particles — especially if you have allergies to these things. This irritation can lead to swelling of the throat membranes, narrowing the airway and making snoring more likely. Luckily, eliminating these irritants is usually a simple matter of keeping the bedroom and the bed itself as clean as possible. Here are a few pointers:Wash sheets and pillow cases every week. If you have pollen allergies, dry them in a dryer and not on the clothesline, or at least inside where there is less pollen.
Replace old pillows every six months.
Vacuum the room and clean surfaces (including ceiling fixtures) regularly.
Keep animals out of the bed.

, In adults, snoring usually occurs when the soft palate and upper throat collapse during sleep, restricting airflow to the lungs and causing the characteristic ""rattling"" noise of snoring with each breath.When you sleep on your back, the positioning of your head and neck make it much easier for the soft palate to collapse on the tongue and upper throat. To start fighting a bad case of snoring, try sleeping on your side. This simple change is sometimes enough to drastically improve a bad case of snoring.While sleeping face-down on the stomach can also help with snoring, it's often advised against because it can lead to soreness in the neck and lower back., Sometimes, stopping a bad case of snoring is as easy as buying a bigger pillow. Propping your head by just a few inches during sleep can reposition your tongue and jaw, opening your airway and making snoring less likely. Try using more than one pillow, buying a thicker pillow, or simply folding your current pillow over on itself to give your head the extra elevation you need to stay snore-free.Keeping your head raised helps keep the airways open.

, If your sinuses are blocked when you go to sleep, your body may rely entirely on mouth-breathing (which is much more likely to cause snoring) while it's asleep. To prevent this, try to make a habit of clearing your sinuses before sleeping. One easy way to do this is simply to take a hot shower a few minutes before you get into bed; the hot water and warm, moist, air stimulate your sinuses to open. Items you may want to use include neti-pots and other liquid nasal-clearing devices, nose strips, and decongestants.Buy a can of sterile salt water solution at your local pharmacy, or make a salt water solution. Add 1/2 teaspoon to a glass of warm water. Do not make the solution too strong; it can burn nasal membranes. Before bed, tilt your head left then right while using the canned solution to deliver the salt water to all areas of your sinuses via the nostrils. If you use your own solution, you can inhale the solution via a teaspoon closing one nostril, then the other. Or, use a neti pot which pours the solution in one nostril and out the other. You should notice your sinus cavities opening and breathing become easier. The remainder of the solution will filter down your throat, also opening the throat cavity.

, Usually, snoring is annoying, but not seriously dangerous. However, in some cases, snoring can be a sign of a potentially life-threatening condition called sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, which is much more likely in people who are obese, is a condition in which the airway becomes so obstructed during sleep that the body doesn't receive sufficient air. When this happens, sleep is frequently interrupted, extreme fatigue occurs, and snoring becomes very pronounced. Since sleep apnea can greatly increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other serious medical conditions, it's very important to see a doctor if you exhibit the signs of sleep apnea, which are listed below:Very loud snoring during sleep
Waking from sleep with a choking sensation
Extreme fatigue even after a full night's rest
Restless sleep
Headaches in the morning
Narcolepsy (falling asleep at inappropriate times)
Decreased liveliness, decreased libido, mood changes

Increase your daily calorie intake.,
Consume food high in essential vitamins and minerals.,
Have meals that cover all five food groups.,
Eat cakes, cookies, and fried foods on rare occasions.,
Avoid certain types of food during pregnancy.,
Create a daily meal chart.,
Have healthy snacks to help with nausea and sickness.,
Drink enough fluids.,
Eat foods high in fiber to help with constipation.,
See your doctor if you experience rapid weight gain or frequent headaches.,
Talk to your doctor if you experience any preterm symptoms.,
Talk to your doctor about vitamin and mineral supplements.,
Do not double your supplements when you are pregnant with twins.,
Ask your doctor about herbal supplements before you take them.",How to Eat When Pregnant with Twins," Part of the myth of having twins is true: you will need to up your calorie intake for the day. You should consume about 600 extra calories a day, depending on your pre-pregnancy BMI, activity level, and physician's recommendations.You can also calculate the number of calories you'll need each day by multiplying the number of kilograms you weigh by 40 or 45.So, for example, if you weigh 62 kilos, you can multiply that number by 40 and by 45 to get a range of 2,480-2,790. This range represents the number of calories you should probably eat each day.
However, how you get these calories is even more important than the amount of calories you consume. You should maintain a well-rounded diet that has a balance of protein, carbs, and healthy fats. 20 to 25 percent of your calories should be from protein, 45 to 50 percent of your calories should be from carbs, and 30 percent of your calories should be from healthy fats.Avoid overeating and going over your suggested calorie intake. Rapid weight gain can put your babies at risk and lead to other health issues.;
, When you’re pregnant with twins, it’s important to fortify your diet with enough vitamins and minerals in every meal of the day. Focus on increasing your levels of folic acid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron, as well as several other vitamins and minerals to keep your babies healthy.Protein: An average size woman needs 70 g of protein a day. Pregnant women are advised to consume 25 g more protein per baby, so add 50 g to your daily protein intake when you are pregnant with twins. Protein helps your babies to grow and develop their muscles in the womb. Go for high protein sources like lean meats (beef, pork, turkey, chicken) as well as nuts, yogurt, milk, cottage cheese, and tofu. Avoid fatty protein sources such as fatty cuts of beef or pork, sausage, bacon, and hot dogs.
Iron: This is a key nutrient to ensuring your babies grow properly and have a healthy birth weight. Consuming iron while pregnant will reduce your risk of hypertension, anemia, and preterm delivery. Get at least 30 mg a day of iron. Good iron sources include red meat, seafood, nuts, and fortified cereal.Vitamin D: This nutrient helps to increase blood circulation in your placenta and helps your babies absorb calcium in the womb. Pregnant women should get between 600-800 IU (International Units) of Vitamin D a day.Folic acid: Maintaining high folic acid levels will help reduce the risk of birth defects. Consume at least 600 mg of folic acid a day.Most prenatal vitamins contain folic acid (or folate). You can also find it in the form of spinach, asparagus, or fruits like oranges and grapefruits.
Calcium: Consume at least 1,500 mg a day of this essential nutrient.Infants need a lot of calcium to build strong bones as they develop in the womb. Milk and yogurt are good sources of calcium.
Magnesium: This is another essential nutrient that will help to decrease your risk of premature labor and help to develop your babies’ nervous systems. Have at least 350-400 mg per day of this nutrient.You can get magnesium from nuts like pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and almonds, as well as wheat germ, tofu, and yogurt.
Zinc: You should consume at least 12 mg of zinc per day.Maintaining high zinc levels will lower your risk of preterm delivery, a low birth-weight for your babies, and prolonged labor.A good source of zinc is black-eyed peas.

, Your daily meals should cover all five major food groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, protein, and dairy) to ensure you are getting the right balance of nutrients and minerals.Have 10 servings of grains a day. For example, 10 servings of: one slice of multigrain bread, ⅔ cup of cereal, ¼ cup of muesli, and ½ cup cooked pasta, noodles, or rice.
Consume nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day. For example, nine servings of: ½ cup of vegetables like spinach, asparagus, or baby carrots, one cup of salad, one medium fruit like apple, banana, or ½ cup of fresh berries, two smaller fruits like plums or apricots, and 30 g of dried fruit.
Consume four to five servings of protein a day. For example, four to five servings of: 65g cooked lean meat like beef or pork, 80g cooked chicken or turkey, 100g cooked fish like salmon or trout, two eggs, 170g cooked tofu, 1 cup legumes or lentils, and 30g nuts like almonds, seeds like pumpkin seeds, and tahini.
Have three to four servings of dairy a day. For example, three to four servings of: one glass (250ml) of non-fat milk, one glass of soy or rice milk with added powdered calcium, one tub (200ml) of yogurt, and one to two slices of hard cheese.

, Though you are not restricted to not eating these unhealthy foods, you should only eat them in small amounts and on the rare occasion when you have a craving for cookies you cannot ignore. Avoid consuming empty calories, as this can lead to an unhealthy weight gain and provides little nutritional value for your babies.


You should also limit your consumption of artificial sugars, such as candy and sodas. Avoid foods cooked in trans fats and go for foods cooked in healthier oils like olive, coconut, and avocado oil.

, As with a normal pregnancy, you should avoid certain foods when pregnant with twins, including:Raw or partial uncooked eggs.
Raw or undercooked meat.
Sushi.
Raw shellfish.
Cold cured meats, such as deli meats.
Herbal teas.
Unpasteurized cheeses, which may contain the listeria bacterium. (Queso dips often contain unpasteurized cheese.)
While doctors used to recommend pregnant women stay away from peanuts, studies now suggest that eating peanuts and other tree nuts (as long as you are not allergic to them!) during pregnancy can help reduce your babies' risk of developing allergies to them., One way to ensure you get enough nutrients while pregnant with twins is to create a meal chart that you can fill in every day. It should contain all five food groups as well as the suggested servings of each food group. You can then note how many servings you ate per day and note any gaps or missed food groups in your meals.


Go grocery shopping with a list based on the suggested servings per day. This will help you limit any unhealthy meals and ensure you are consuming enough vitamins and minerals through the food you eat on a daily basis.

, These symptoms are common early in your pregnancy and can last up to 16 weeks. It’s important to try to still eat and drink despite any nausea or morning sickness. Rather than tuck in for a big meal, eat small healthy snacks throughout the day to keep your nausea in check. This will also help improve your digestion and reduce any heartburn you may be feeling while pregnant.Keep crackers, fruits (berries, plums, and bananas are all easy to eat fruits), low-fat yogurt packs, pre made smoothies (with no additives or preservatives) and protein snacks on hand for quick, easy to prepare snacks.

, Sipping water throughout the day will ensure you stay hydrated. Though you may end up running to the bathroom every five minutes, drinking lots of water will help with your babies’ blood flow and waste removal.You should drink about 10 cups (2.3) liters of water each day while pregnant.You can confirm you are well hydrated by looking at your pee; it will be pale in color if your body is hydrated.Try to drink more water earlier in the day and then reduce your water intake after 8 pm. This will allow you to sleep longer at night without having to get up constantly to use the bathroom.
You can have some caffeine while pregnant. Limit it to 200mg a day -- about two cups of brewed coffee. Avoid higher intakes than this, as high caffeine intake during pregnancy is associated with infant health problems.Avoid consuming caffeine at the same time as you take iron supplements or eat foods that contain iron, as caffeine may interfere with iron absorption. Wait to eat for at least an hour after having a cup of coffee.There is no safe level of alcohol consumption while pregnant., As your babies grow, they will put pressure on your bowels. Your gut will also need to slow down its digestion process to absorb all the vitamins and minerals you are consuming. So you will likely experience constipation when pregnant, and will need to consume high fiber foods to help your gut digest.


If you experience constipation, eat more fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and bran based cereals throughout the day. You should also do light exercise like walking and gentle stretching to keep your bowels regular and stimulate your digestive system.

, Twin pregnancies have an increased risk of preeclampsia. In this condition, the mother has increased blood pressure, protein in her urine, and more swelling than normal in pregnancy. Swelling is especially pronounced in the face and hands. Rapid weight gain and headaches are possible symptoms for preeclampsia and require immediate examination by your obstetrician.Your obstetrician will treat your symptoms based on the severity of your condition. She may recommend bed rest and medication for less severe cases, or the immediate delivery of the babies, which is the only “cure” for preeclampsia, for more severe cases.
You should be aware that the recommended weight gain for twins is more than for a single pregnancy. Healthy women with a normal BMI before pregnancy should gain between 37-54 pounds during a twin pregnancy,as opposed to between 25-35 pounds for a single pregnancy.Your doctor will recommend a weight gain that's appropriate for you.

, Twins have an increased chance of being born early or preterm. If you experience any bleeding or vaginal discharge, diarrhea, pressure in your pelvis or lower back, and contractions that become more frequent and close together, you should notify your doctor or obstetrician.Even if you may not be going through pre term labor, it’s important to address these symptoms for the safety of your babies.

, Most pregnant women can get the necessary iron, iodine, and folic acid from their diet, but your doctor may also suggest taking supplements if you skip meals often, have a low appetite, or have other health issues.


Avoid taking supplements without consulting your doctor first.

, Having too many vitamins and minerals in your body can be harmful to your babies.


If you are vegan, or do not eat a lot of dairy in your diet, you may need to take calcium supplements. Vegans may also need a B12 supplement. As well, pregnant women should take a folic acid supplement each day to ensure they have the right amount of folic acid in their system.
Do not take fish liver oil supplements, high dose vitamin supplements, or supplements containing vitamin A as these can be harmful to your babies., The FDA does not evaluate or regulate natural herbal supplements, so the quality and strength of the supplement may vary between different manufacturers or even different batches. However, the FDA recommends that pregnant women always check with their doctor about the safety of taking an herbal supplement before buying it or consuming it. Some herbal supplements may contain products that are not safe for pregnant women and may endanger your babies.If you are interested in herbal supplements to help alleviate any issues in your pregnancy, speak to a trained, certified herbalist. Ask your doctor for a referral to a reputable herbal specialist.

Diagnose your particular snore.,
Avoid things that make snoring worse.,
Keep your bedroom more humid.,
Take up the didgeridoo or practice singing.",How to Stop Snoring1," Do you snore with your mouth open or closed? Learning to distinguish between kinds of snoring will help you to address the particular causes of that kind of snoring.


Closed-mouth snoring indicates that your tongue is the cause of your snoring, and that some exercises and lifestyle changes should help eliminate the snoring.
Open-mouthed snoring can be caused by sinus trouble or by posture in bed, and can be remedied by addressing those issues.
Snoring from any position might indicate apnea or other significant issues that will require more substantial medical treatment to address.;
, Alcohol, sleeping pills, coffee, and fatty foods before bedtime can all increase snoring by making your throat muscles relax and narrowing your airway. Large meals and fatty foods likewise restricts your airflow by pushing up on your diaphragm.Smoking can also be a frequent cause of snoring, and is a health hazard in general. If you're a smoker and struggle with snoring, consider quitting.
Consider losing weight. Fatty tissue in the back of the throat is often the cause of snoring. Losing even a little bit of weight can be greatly beneficial if you want to stop.
If you regularly take any kind of medication, talk to your doctor about alternatives. The drugs you're ingesting might be making your snoring worse.

, Dryness is often a cause of snoring, so using a humidifier or taking a hot bath or shower before bed can help alleviate snoring by keeping the breathing channels moist.

, While it may sound strange, singing or instrumental practice that strengthens the throat muscles will firm the tissue of your throat and mouth. Doing some simple mouth and throat exercises like singing will strengthen your throat so that it does not relax and block air when you sleep. The throat muscles involving in playing the didgeridoo are perfect for preventing snoring.


While you're driving to work, turn up the radio and sing as loudly as you want to the tunes. Singing several times throughout the day will give your throat a workout and keep your sleep more sound.
If you're not into singing, develop some exercises. Stick your tongue out as far as you can, then relax. Repeat 10 times. Stick your tongue out again, and try to touch your chin. Hold. Repeat with trying to touch your nose. Repeat 10 times.

Complete a self-assessment.,
Plan for lifestyle changes.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Emotionally Prepare for Pregnancy2," When your are contemplating a pregnancy, it is natural to have some hesitation. Try addressing the things that are causing you to pause. To begin, consider the financial ramifications of a pregnancy and of raising a child. Financial instability can contribute to emotional unpreparedness surrounding a pregnancy.Children are expensive. And so is health care. It's essential to have the means to care for a child properly or you'll risk feeling overwhelmed and possibly even resentful.
Discuss the financial details openly with your partner, including expectations about who will take time off work and when, if at all, the partner principally responsible for at-home baby care will return to work.
If you choose to be a stay-at-home mom or dad, there will need to be very clear financial strategies set in place to ensure that this decision doesn't mean you're stretched beyond your abilities financially.
Be realistic. Consider costs of doctor visits, food, clothing, daycare, etc. Try to reduce debt and save as much as possible before becoming pregnant.

, Many people are nervous about the physical impact of a pregnancy. Addressing this concern can help you feel more physically and emotionally ready for changes. Caring for the physical needs of your pregnant body can help to prepare you emotionally for a pregnancy.Many women experience intense emotions as a result of hormone fluctuations and the dramatic changes that their bodies encounter during a pregnancy. Some women are shocked to find that they have ""mommy brain"" and can't think straight during some or all of the pregnancy.
While this doesn't happen to all pregnant women, for those who do experience it, it can be very distracting. This might mean considering reduced duties if working, scheduling earlier bedtimes and getting help with things that you find tax your energy too much.
By exercising regularly and eating healthy, you can take greater physical control over your body. In turn, this can help to create better emotional control.
Get in the habit of getting some moderate physical exercise most days of the week. If you already work out, ask your doctor how you can adapt your routine to be safe during pregnancy.
Start taking prenatal vitamins before you are pregnant. You can also make sure that you are getting plenty of folic acid and calcium. Try eating leafy greens such as kale and low-fat dairy products.

, Write down a list of questions to ask yourself before you make the decision to become pregnant. This list can include concerns or hopes, or just general questions. After you write the questions, spend some time reflecting on honest answers.Ask yourself why you want to have a baby. Reflect on whether it is something you truly want, or if you are feeling pressured by society.
Think about your support system. Do you have friends and family around who will support you?
Are you ready to change your career plans? Do you think you'll want to work full time after you have a child?
A self-assessment can be very useful in helping you emotionally prepare for the changes a pregnancy will bring. Ask your partner to complete one, too.

, Obviously, pregnancy is going to effect your mind, body, and finances. But a big part of preparing emotionally is thinking about all of the other ways your life is going to change. During a pregnancy, you may not have the energy to keep up your normal schedule.During the beginning and end stages of a pregnancy in particular, you may feel tired. If your partner is the one who is pregnant, you may need to adjust your schedule to help her get the rest you need.
Both partners should think about if they are ready for extra chores. During a pregnancy, you will need to spend a lot of time preparing.
You will need to furnish a nursery, buy supplies, and make plans for child care. Think about your current lifestyle and figure out where you will find additional time.
You may also need to reconsider travel. Are you used to being able to take off for weekend trips at a moment's notice? During a pregnancy, you may not feel physically capable of going on a spur of the moment adventure.
You can also start thinking about how a baby will change your lifestyle. Are you ready to add caring for another human being to your morning routine? Are you ready to find a sitter each time you want to have a date night?

, Your doctor is an excellent resource, before and after you become pregnant. You can schedule a prenatal appointment to discuss your plans for conception. Be honest and open about any questions or concerns that you have.Make a list of questions to ask your doctor. Plan to discuss hormonal changes and how they will affect your emotions.
You can also ask about any special concerns you have. For example, if your family has a history of diabetes, depression, or other illnesses, you can ask your doctor to make some recommendations.
Ask your partner to go with you to the appointment. From the beginning, planning for a baby should be a team effort. That will make both of you feel emotionally supported.

Learn to meditate.,
Make a back-up plan.,
Think about the birth.,
Make a to-do list.,
Talk about your feelings.",How to Emotionally Prepare for Pregnancy3," Talking to others is a great way to feel more prepared for a pregnancy. Draw on naturally available, realistic sources of information––family members and friends who have already experienced raising children. Discuss the emotional nature of pregnancy and parenthood with trusted friends and family members.Individuals who have experience with pregnancy and parenthood can provide you with helpful advice and resources that can prepare you for the emotional changes that you will experience and the lingering emotional transformation caused by a newborn baby.
Ask your friends to be honest. You can say, ""What was the hardest challenge of your pregnancy?""
Be respectful. Before asking personal questions, ask your friend if she minds discussing these personal issues with you.

, Many women state that meditation is incredibly helpful during a pregnancy. It can relieve anxiety and help promote restful sleep. Consider adding meditation to your pre-pregnancy routine.If meditation is already a habit, it will feel natural to keep doing it when you are pregnant. Meditation has many emotional benefits, such as keeping you calm.
Look for an app that has guided meditations. Begin by practicing for 5 minutes a day.
Find a comfortable place to sit. Try placing a comfy cushion on the floor, closing your eyes, and concentrating on the mediation.

, Some couples have trouble naturally conceiving. This may not happen to you, but it can be helpful to address the problem before it occurs. Talk to your partner about whether or not you will be open to trying other methods of having a child.


There are many ways that a doctor can help you conceive. Consider whether or not you would be comfortable trying hormone therapy or IVF.
Remember that adoption is an option. Many couples decide to adopt a child if they are unable to naturally conceive.
Have an honest conversation with your partner about how important having kids is, and what you are willing to do to have them.

, Consider how you feel about giving birth. Would you like to work with a doula? Or have a traditional hospital experience? Thinking about these things in advance can make you feel more prepared.It can also be reassuring to plan to attend birthing classes regularly and inquire about after-birth baby care classes, too.
Talk to your doctor and your partner about what type of experience you would like to have.
You can also read books about the experience of giving birth. Blogs are also a great way to learn about individual stories.

, Many women and their partners find emotional relief and stability when they tackle pregnancy-related tasks one at a time. Make a list of tasks that you need to complete. Once you're pregnant, you can begin working on the list.Consider drawing up a timetable and marking in suitable times for each thing you'd like to achieve. Most of all, aim to be as rested, contented and un-rushed as possible.
Be aware that many women experience what is commonly called ""nesting instinct"" toward the end of pregnancy, a period of intense activity arising out of a boost of energy that lets you get baby's room and requirements ready. This can help you to get those last minute things organized with pep.

, Communicate regularly during a pregnancy. The best way to emotionally prepare before and during a pregnancy is to regularly communicate about your fears, your hopes, your desires and your anxiety. Communicating with your partner, your parents, siblings and friends will help to ease the emotional burden that is often associated with a pregnancy.

Remember that you are going through a physically and emotionally challenging time and it is important to use the support of others to bolster your morale. This will help you feel like you can cope.
Even if you live far away from most family members, there are always hospital and midwife resources on which you can draw for added support. The internet can be another source of support if you join some online pregnancy support groups.

Lose weight.,
Get more exercise.,
Keep hydrated.,
Avoid relying on sleep aids.,
Treat nasal congestion or obstruction.,
Avoid smoking.",How to Stop Snoring Naturally2," Like many other physical problems, being overweight can make sleeping worse. Snoring is associated with obesity. People who are overweight or obese (especially men) tend to have bulkier throat and neck tissue and poor muscle tone, which can lead to a narrower airway (and excessive snoring) during sleep. Worse, however, is the fact that obesity is a contributing factor in potentially serious sleep disorders, like sleep apnea.To eliminate these harmful effects, work to lose weight with diet and exercise. Usually, your general practitioner will be able to recommend a diet and exercise regimen to help you lose weight or may even refer you to a specialist for extra help. Some helpful tips include:


Increase the fiber in your diet. More fiber increases bowel regularity and helps you feel “full” longer. In other words, fiber can help decrease the amount of food you eat because you don’t get hungry as often. Good sources of fiber include brown rice, barley, corn, rye, bulgar wheat, kasha (buckwheat) and oatmeal.
Eat more fruits and vegetables. Get more leafy vegetables like Swiss chard, collard greens, spinach, lettuces, beet greens into your diet. These are full of fiber, vitamins, minerals and are low in calories. Fruits are also great sources of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other essential nutrients and make a great snack.
Limit the amounts of fatty or red meats in your diet. Increase the amounts of fish and skinless poultry you eat.
Avoid foods that are “white” like white bread and white rice. These foods have been processed and have lost a significant amount of their nutritional value. In general, try to avoid pre-packaged or prepared foods as well as most “fast foods.” These tend to have higher amounts of sugars, salts and fats added to “improve”their taste., Some evidence suggests that getting a healthy amount of exercise every day can make snoring more manageable. Obviously, exercise can help you lose weight and slim down, making your throat tissue less bulky and reducing your chance of snoring and sleep apnea. However, by improving your overall muscle tone, exercise can also help your throat maintain its proper shape during sleep. If your soft palate and upper throat do not collapse downward into your tongue, your chance of snoring is greatly reduced.Everyone's exercise needs are different. However, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that adults get at least two and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) per week, along with two days of moderate strength-training exercise.If more intense exercise is performed, the total amount of time spent exercising can be smaller.

, When people are dehydrated, the secretions in their nose and throat naturally become thicker and sticker. In some cases, this can translate to a more obstructed airway and increased snoring. Drink lots of water (8 to 10 8oz. glasses per day). Staying hydrated can keep the tissues inside your mouth and nose moistened, which can help control breathing difficulties.Different people's daily water needs can vary greatly based on their sex, size, and level of activity. In general, you'll know if you're getting enough water if you rarely feel thirsty and your urine is colorless or a light yellow.
If you have trouble getting more water in your diet, try drinking a glass of water with each meal and then between each meal. Be sure as well to drink water before, during and after any exercise you may do.

, Any sort of drug or chemical that helps you get to sleep can potentially become an addictive crutch with repeated use. Even short-term use can cause episodes of excessive snoring. The same sorts of chemicals that make it easier to get to sleep also usually relax the body's muscles, including those in the throat. This causes the soft palate to collapse on the back of the tongue during sleep, leading to snoring.


Note that this includes alcohol, which, like sleeping pills, can have a depressant effect on the nervous system, making the airway collapse during sleep.

, Make sure that your nasal passages are clear so that you can breathe through your nose rather than your mouth when you sleep. Having allergies or a deviated septum can limit airflow through your nose and so it's important to address these conditions. If you are suffering from allergies, you can try taking an antihistamine or using a nasal spray, as recommended by your physician. In cases of a structural defect, like a deviated septum, you may need to have surgery to fix the problem.Do not use an oral or spray decongestant to clear your nasal passages for more than three days in a row. Long-term use of decongestants can have a rebound effect and in fact cause the congestion to worsen, such that you build up a reliance on these medications. Ask your doctor about a prescription steroid spray if your congestion does not improve.

, In addition to many other well-documented health problems, smoking can increase the likelihood of snoring. Though the cause-and-effect relationship isn't perfectly understood, it's thought that the throat irritation from smoking can lead to swelling and inflammation, narrowing the airway during sleep. In addition, if the smoker suffers from overnight nicotine withdrawal, his or her sleep may be interrupted, raising the risk of airway obstruction.Note that being exposed to second-hand smoke has been found to have the similar snoring-causing effects as actually smoking tobacco.

Try a tongue extension.,
Try ""chewing""-style jaw exercises.,
Try exercising your throat muscles.,
Sing.,
Take up the didgeridoo.,
Know when to consult a doctor.",How to Stop Snoring Naturally3," Though it may sound unlikely, believe it or not, there is some evidence that performing exercises to physically strengthen the mouth and throat can make snoring less likely. With these muscles stronger, it's less likely that they'll collapse during sleep and obstruct your airway.Here are two tongue exercise to try:Stick your tongue out as far as it goes. Slowly move it to each side, touching it to the corners of your mouth. Move the tongue to the top of the mouth without curling it. Repeat the motions above for about 15 seconds. Repeat for at least a few minutes several times per day.
Place the tip of your tongue behind your top front teeth. Slide your tongue backward. Do this for three minutes each day.

, Another exercise you can do to prevent snoring involves strengthening your jaw muscles. Though there are several ways to do this, the basic idea is usually the same — simply imitate the motion of chewing without any food in your mouth. Follow the steps below:Open your mouth ―as far as it goes (as if biting into a large apple)― and hold it open for about ten seconds.
Close your mouth and let it rest for several seconds before repeating.
Repeat for at least a few minutes several times per day.

, Strengthening the muscles of the throat can help keep your soft palate from collapsing onto the back of your tongue. One easy throat exercise is simply to repeatedly say each vowel loudly and clearly about thirty times before bed, taking short breaks in between vowels.When the exercise is done correctly, you should sound more or less like this: ""Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah ... ee, ee, ee, ee ... Oh, oh, oh ...,"" and so on. If you're embarrassed to do this in front of your partner, you may alternatively want to do this as you drive to work.

, One of the best throat exercises of all is to simply sing! Not only has frequent singing been shown to decrease the frequency of snoring, but it increases the quality of sleep. Singing works to increase muscle control in the throat and soft palate, thus strengthening your muscles and keeping them from collapsing during sleep.If you don't already sing, try enrolling in singing lessons, joining a local choir, or even simply singing in the car.

, Learning to play this aboriginal wind Australian instrument has reportedly decreased or eliminated snoring in adults. This is because playing the instrument helps to strengthen the throat and soft palate., It is sensible to approach snoring with less-intensive approaches. But not all snoring can be cured by natural approaches, either. Your doctor may suggest mouth appliances or other approaches. Be sure to consult a doctor if:


These approaches do not make a significant difference within two to four weeks.
You suspect sleep apnea, which may require devices such as CPAP machines or even surgery.
You are extremely fatigued during the day. This can be a dangerous situation which needs investigating before you have an accident, lose a job, or fail school.
Snoring can be a condition that feeds into a vicious circle, in which gaining weight worsens the snoring and makes the snoring even worse and so on and so on. Many of these ""natural"" approaches may work, but may take significant time, whereas a medical professional can sort through more quickly.

Prop yourself up for sleeping.,
Try sleeping on your side.,
Try mouthpiece devices.",How to Stop Snoring2," If you sleep on your back, buy yourself a few extra pillows and prop yourself up in bed, rather than lying flat on your back. Also, raise the head of your bed. An easy way to do this is to place several flat boards under the legs at the top end of the bed. A couple of old phone books under each leg should also raise the bed enough to do the trick.

, There's a good reason you don't want to sleep on your back: in that position, your tongue and soft palate rest against the back of your throat, blocking the airway.


Try the tennis ball trick. Sew a tennis ball to the back of your sleeping shirt, to make it uncomfortable to roll onto your back., Also known as dental appliances or mandibular advancement splints, these are usually small plastic devices worn in the mouth during sleep to prevent the soft throat tissues from collapsing and obstructing the airway. They do this by bringing your lower jaw forward and/or by lifting your soft palate. Some devices also stop the tongue from falling back over your windpipe


Talk to your dentist about these kinds of devices, or consult a sleep therapist."
"
Address any nasal congestion.,
Tape your nose open with nasal strips.,
Consider using a sinus/nasal rinse.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Stop Snoring3," Try taking a decongestant or antihistamine if nasal congestion is causing your snoring. Use these only as a temporary measure if you suspect that a cold or allergy is to blame. Prolonged use of either can be harmful.


Gargle with a peppermint mouthwash to shrink the lining of your nose and throat. This is especially effective if your snoring is a temporary condition caused by a head cold or an allergy.
Change your sheets and pillowcases often to relieve nasal stuffiness, alleviate bedroom allergens. Try to vacuum your floors and wash your curtains often too.

, These are available at most pharmacies. They may look odd, but who's looking? Following the directions on the package and tape one of the strips to the outside of your nose. They work by lifting and opening your nostrils to increase airflow.


Consider trying expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) devices, which cover the nostrils and uses the power of your own breath to create a gentle pressure that helps keep your airway open.

, These are designed in such a way that the debris and mucus formed in the nose is completely flushed out. Rinsing will be helpful in relieving yourself of the snoring.


You can try to have a warm shower or bath. Hot moist air will be helpful in draining the mucus from the sinuses, thereby reducing the possibility of snoring.
Raise the head portion of your bed. This will be helpful in reducing the amount of mucus draining down and blocking your nasal passages. When nasal passages are not blocked, you will not snore.

, If you struggle with chronic sinus infections, get a prescription for nasal decongestants. Reducing the infection will help to cure your snoring.

"
"
Pick a time to talk.,
Remember that snoring is a physical problem.,
Be aware of deeper issues.",How to Stop Snoring4," Confronting your partner about their snoring in the middle of the night or immediately upon waking after a restless and sleepless night can cause resentment and arguments. Avoid angry discussions about sleeping, and keep the discussion light.


If your partner's snoring is chronic, talk after dinner when there'll be time to calmly prepare for the night's sleep and address your concerns.

, Whether you're a snorer or live with one, there's nothing to be embarrassed or angry about. It's not a conscious choice the snorer is making, but it is a physical concern that can be remedied with a little planning.


If you've got a snoring problem and your partner complains, you need to take it seriously. If you're sleeping through your bouts of snoring, you need to take their word for it.
If your partner snores chronically, bring it up sooner rather than later. Taking ""behind the back"" precautions like using ear plugs as a way of avoiding hurting their feelings may end up making them more embarrassed, as if it were an issue to be avoided. Talk about it and plan together for a cure.

, Talking about snoring may inadvertently lead you into discussing smoking, drinking, weight, or other sensitive issues that may be affecting your relationship with your partner. Be aware of the territory your conversation might get into, and communicate thoughtfully and tactfully throughout the discussion.

Don’t eat any unpasteurized cheeses.",How to Have a Healthy Pregnancy," The most important first step in your pregnancy is choosing a prenatal care physician, and seeing them on a regular basis. Frequent and consistent appointments with an OB/GYN, a family doctor or a certified midwife can ensure both your safety and your growing child’s throughout the pregnancy process. Begin prenatal care as soon as you know that you’re pregnant, when you decide you want to be, or when you suspect you might be. You can start by seeing your regular doctor, but will likely want to transfer to a specialized prenatal care doctor as your pregnancy progresses. So long as you are undergoing a normal pregnancy (according to your doctor), your scheduled prenatal appointments should be along this timeline:


See your physician every four weeks until you are 28 weeks pregnant
See your physician every two weeks from the time you are 28 weeks to 36 weeks pregnant
See your physician once a week (or more often, as per your doctor’s instructions) after the 36th week of pregnancy;
, Carrying around extra mid-body weight, morning sickness, and aching muscles can all combine to make exercise sound incredibly unappealing. However, keeping active while you are pregnant will ensure not only your health, but your baby’s as well. Regular exercise can make delivery less difficult, make losing your baby weight easier, aid in post-birth physical recovery, and encourage healthy fetal growth. Aim to do thirty minutes of low-impact exercise such as swimming, riding a bicycle, lifting weights, or yoga a day. Walking is a good option too


Don’t participate in any high-impact exercises (workout classes, long runs) or contact sports (soccer, rugby, football), as these put you at a high risk for injury.
Always stretch before you exercise while pregnant; a hormone called ‘relaxin’ is released to prepare your body for labor, but this can weaken your muscles and joints. Without stretching, you increase your risk for muscle or joint injury.
Avoid activities or stretches that require you to lie down on your back, because this puts pressure on a major vein that reduces blood flow to the uterus, which may make you feel dizzy and lightheaded.
Overheating can be dangerous to your baby, so make sure you always keep cool by having a fan and cold water at the ready., Not only are you eating to nourish you and you baby(ies), you’re resting for both of you as well. Getting lots of good sleep while pregnant will give your body the time it needs to help develop your growing baby, making you feel better in the process. Aim for eight hours of sleep minimum a night, and try to snatch a mid-afternoon nap as well. Going to bed at a consistent time every night (preferably before midnight) will also help to regulate your sleep schedule, making your sleep more restful and deep.


Sleeping on your left side is recommended for pregnant women, as this relieves pressure from your back and prevents a major vein connected to your uterus from having the circulation cut off.
Waking up for a short (5-10 minute) walk in the middle of the night may help to reduce or remove any morning sickness you experience.
Don’t take any sleeping pills while pregnant, unless prescribed and approved by your doctor.

, Although a daily regimen of pills, supplements, and vitamins may be difficult to keep track of, it can be incredibly helpful in reducing the risk of a series of birth defects. To start, women should consume prenatal vitamins (advertised as such) in 600 micrograms per day after becoming pregnant. Prenatal vitamins contain a combination of high levels of folic acid and iron among other things, both of which are responsible for early development of the baby and reducing the risk of complications and defects such as spina bifida and premature birth. Talk to your doctor about what supplements to take, but keep in mind that most pregnant women need to consume extra:


Folic acid (folate) - between 400-600 micrograms daily
Iron - 30 milligrams daily
Calcium - 1200 milligrams daily
DHA (a type of omega-3 fatty acid) - 200 milligrams daily, It’s true that you should be gaining weight while pregnant, but the amount you gain can have a big impact on both your child’s health and your own. Individual weight gain will be dependent on your weight and BMI prior to pregnancy, meaning that each woman will need to gain a different amount to be in a healthy range. To determine your ideal weight gain, start by calculating your BMI. Then, use that and your weight to locate yourself on the following weight gain chart:


Underweight women (BMI less than 18.5) should gain 28-40 pounds.
Women at a healthy weight (BMI between 18.5-24.9) should gain 25-35 pounds.
Overweight women (BMI between 25-29.9) should gain 15-25 pounds.
Obese women (BMI higher than 30) should gain 11-20 pounds., Strange as it may seem, dental care is particularly important during pregnancy. This is because your body is producing higher than normal levels of estrogen and progesterone, both of which (in high levels) can be responsible for causing gingivitis and gum disease, leading to bleeding, gum sensitivity, and swollen gums on a regular basis. You should try to visit your dentist every 3-4 months while pregnant to make sure you’re keeping a healthy mouth. In between visits, make sure that you brush and floss your teeth regularly. You may, depending on where you leave, benefit from free or discounted dental treatment.

, The oft quoted phrase ‘eating for two’ conjures up images of vast platters of food and multiple meals throughout the day. The truth of the matter is though, that on average you should only be consuming about 300 calories more per child, per day. Therefore, if you’re pregnant with a single baby you should eat 300 extra calories, for twins you should eat 600 extra calories, and for triplets you should eat 900 extra calories per day. These numbers will vary slightly depending on your starting weight before pregnancy (see weight gain list above), but will remain close to 300 calories.The calories you consume should be healthy calories - not those from junk food and fast food.
One of the primary goals of eating more is to supplement your body and the child with the vitamins and minerals necessary for development (you can’t get them all from supplements).

, Weight gain during pregnancy is expected, so you are doing yourself and your baby a disfavor by attempting to diet to keep off weight. While you should avoid eating huge amounts of food (beyond the extra 300 calories a day), you should not cut down your eating at all, or remove major meals or food groups from your regular diet. Further, regular eating supplies your body with vital vitamins and minerals you can’t receive elsewhere. Other than potentially dangerous foods (listed below), do not cut out food from your diet. This means that diets like paleo/atkins (no carbs), juicing (no solid foods), and weight watchers/nutrisystem (low calorie) should not be started during your pregnancy unless prescribed by a licensed medical doctor.By depriving your body of nutrients through dieting, your child may suffer from malnutrition and certain birth defects.
Diets held for medical/religious/moral reasons can be maintained in pregnancy.
Avoid trying to lose weight or maintain your pre-pregnancy weight through food restriction, at any point during your pregnancy.

, Taking prenatal vitamins is important for supplying your body with the extra folic acid, iron, and calcium you need. However, there are lots of other nutrients and vitamins you can only get through consumption in food, meaning that you can’t rely on supplements for your vitamins and continue to eat junk food and unhealthy alternatives. Supplements are intended to be just that - to supplement you with the extras you many not be able to consume enough of. This means you should be eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein every day.


If you eat fast food regularly, aim to cut down your consumption to once or twice a week at the most. Fast food is notoriously nutrient-deprived, filling you with empty calories.
If you’ve got a strong craving for unhealthy foods that lack vitamins, try eating something healthy first (like a piece of fruit) and following it up with a small bit of ‘cheat’ food. This will help you transition away from a diet of unhealthy junk food.
Don’t exceed the recommended daily dosage of prenatal supplements in an effort to reduce the amount of food you need to eat.

, However, it is best to get this from natural foods rather than pills and supplements. You can get lots of vitamin C from citrus fruits, papaya, strawberries, broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, and red peppers (among other foods). Aim to eat 3-4 servings of these foods per day.

, Eating protein is always important, but when you’re pregnant you should aim to eat 2-3 servings of protein a day. Protein is primarily responsible for blood production and cell growth, both your own and your baby’s. Great sources of healthy proteins include eggs, Greek yogurt, legumes (beans), tofu, peanut butter, and lean meats.

, Calcium is vital to pregnant women, and many don’t get nearly as much as they need. Although there is normally some calcium in prenatal supplements, you should try to consume an additional 1000 milligrams of calcium per day. Great sources of calcium include yogurt, hard cheeses, milk, and spinach. By consuming more calcium, you’ll be aiding in your child’s bone and nerve development.


Vitamin D is important to consume as well, as it is required for your body to absorb calcium. It is found in most of the same foods as calcium is, as well as in cereals and breads.

, Yes, you’ll be getting folic acid in a prenatal supplement. However, you should try to eat folic acid that occurs naturally in foods for the best results. Folic acid is responsible for enzyme functioning and blood production in your baby. Foods that contain folic acid include kale, chard, spinach, squash, beans, nuts, and peas. All of these foods contain other helpful nutrients, so try to eat 1-2 servings of them per day.

, Iron is used in the body for blood cell production, both in your own body and your developing child’s. Most prenatal supplements contain iron, but as per most nutrients, it is best that you consume iron in a natural form from food rather than a supplement. Foods that contain high levels of iron include red meats, spinach, and iron-fortified whole grains (like certain breads and cereals). Get at least one serving of these iron-filled foods per day., Alcohol is a big no-no for pregnant women, as its consumption is responsible for an array of birth defects and complications. Drinking alcohol significantly increases the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth, makes it more likely that your child will have developmental disabilities later in life, and runs your baby the risk of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Cut alcohol out of your diet completely while pregnant, to avoid risking these complications. If necessary, seek help from a therapist specialized in drug and alcohol use.If you happened to consume alcohol prior to knowledge of your pregnancy, don’t worry - so long as you cease your drinking habits, it is unlikely you’ll experience alcohol-related complications.
Non-alcoholic beer and wine do actually contain a small amount of alcohol, making them inappropriate substitutes for regular beer and wine.

, It’s generally recommended that smoking of any sort be avoided, as it is very damaging to the lungs. This is especially true for pregnant women, because whatever you smoke, your baby smokes as well. Nicotine and tobacco in the blood stream is absorbed by the child, increasing the likelihood of stillbirth, miscarriage, and a low birth weight. Some studies have also shown that babies whose mothers’ smoked while pregnant, grow up to be chronic smokers themselves. Cut out all smoking in your life, including cigarettes, e-cigs, cigars, and marijuana.

, Drugs of any sort - particularly ‘street’ drugs - are incredibly dangerous for a developing child. Recreational drugs almost guarantee your child will suffer from a birth defect or complication, because they have such a significant impact on your body and brain function, and therefore your child’s. Further, mothers who are addicted to drugs and continue to use them while pregnant can actually pass on their addiction to their child. The newborn baby is then addicted to drugs, and suffers withdrawal symptoms just like an adult does. If you’re a user of recreational drugs or are addicted, get help from a psychologist or group therapy, to protect the health of your growing baby.When at all possible, maintain a drug-free lifestyle beyond the birth of your child for your own health.

, Raising your body temperature too high can be dangerous for your offspring, as studies have correlated high body temperature to developmental complications and birth defects. While warm showers and baths are fine, spending extended periods of time in very hot environments can cause serious problems, especially in the first trimester. Avoid any environment where the temperature is above 101 °F (38 °C), and if you absolutely must be in such an environment, limit your time spent there to less than ten minutes., Although coffee, tea, and soda may be favorite drinks, if they contain caffeine they can be harmful to your little one. Studies have shown that caffeine consumption while pregnant is linked to higher rates of miscarriage and birth complications. It is best to cut out caffeine from your lifestyle altogether, but some doctors believe up to 200 milligrams (equal to one 10oz cup of coffee) per day is safe. When possible, use caffeine-free or decaffeinated versions of coffee, tea, and soda. Foods that contain caffeine (like chocolate) are fine in moderation, because the levels are so low.

, Certain chemicals and toxins are particularly dangerous for pregnant women to come into contact with, even though they may not be for a non-pregnant woman. Cleaning solvents, strong chemicals, heavy metals (like mercury and lead), and some biological agents (like asbestos) are all associated with birth complications and defects. If you work or live in a place where you may come into contact with these toxins, do your best to avoid them at all times. Make lifestyle changes to do so, if necessary., As random as it may seem, a very dangerous infection known as toxoplasmosis is prevalent among cat litter boxes, and can quickly spread to pregnant women. The illness may have no recognizable symptoms in the mother and will pass to the baby undetected, causing serious brain and eye damage to the growing baby. If you have a litter box, steer clear of it and have a friend or relative take over control of cleaning it regularly., Certain food-born illnesses, including toxoplasmosis (yes, the cat litter illness) and listeriosis, are often present in undercooked and raw meat. These illnesses can be quite dangerous to a developing child, making it best to avoid the foods that carry them. Avoid eating any shellfish, raw fish (like sushi/sashimi), rare or seared meat, and raw eggs.

, Heavy metals, like mercury and lead, are incredibly damaging to a growing baby and can even cause death in high enough amounts. Some fish have particularly high levels of mercury, making them dangerous for pregnant women to consume. These fish include swordfish, shark, king mackerel, tuna steak, and tilefish. However, fish such as canned tuna, salmon, halibut, and cod are all still safe to consume while pregnant.


Keep your consumption of any kind of fish - even the safe kinds - down to once or twice a week while pregnant.

, Although a platter of soft cheeses may sound delicious, unpasteurized fresh cheeses can contain bacteria that are responsible for an array of birth complications. As a result, it is best for pregnant women to avoid eating them altogether. Popular unpasteurized fresh cheeses include brie, feta, goat cheese, Camembert, and blue cheese. Hard cheeses, such as cheddar, Swiss, and Havarti are all safe to consume."

Dress differently depending on pregnancy stage.,
Know your body type and shape.,
Dress for the first trimester.,
Dress for the second trimester.,
Dress for the final trimester.,
Consider buying one of those stretchy bands.",How to Dress when Pregnant1," When it comes to dressing during pregnancy, comfort and style are key. What feels right in week 9 may feel downright wrong by week 14.


What perfectly flatters your curves during the second trimester may become rather indecent by the tail end of your pregnancy. Buy the right size for your changing body. Do not buy larger clothes then you need unless you like how they look.
Purchase clothing designed for maternity wear when you start to show if you wish. This clothing will be built for greater comfort, and it’s usually a better idea than purchasing regular clothing in bigger sizes. If cost is an issue, check thrift stores. You can usually wear regular clothes for the first three months.
Avoid the temptation to just buy much larger clothes unless you want to. The problem with just buying larger clothes is it can make you look, well, larger. Maternity clothes will be fitted in the right places while allowing room for the bump, so they can help you retain a sense of shape.;
, Different people carry their babies different ways. Some people have high pregnancies, for example, and some people carry the baby lower.For those carrying their babies low, clothing that’s soft on the waistline will be more comfortable. Shirts cut below the bump can look attractive.
If you’re carrying high, you can try to create a line between the breasts and bump by adding high belts and ties.
Don’t give up. Just because you’re pregnant, doesn’t mean you can’t retain your typical style. You don’t always have to go for the sweatpants, either., In the first trimester, the challenge for many is to keep the pregnancy under wraps. Many people don't want to divulge their growing secret until at least the second trimester. Thus, you can usually stick to non-maternity clothing for the first three months.


What to do: Go into your closet and put aside anything that feels too tight or clingy. Stick with silhouettes that flow over belly, hips, and thighs that can camouflage the few pounds you may gain in the first months.
Wear soft knits, A-line skirts, empire-waisted tops and frocks, wrap shirts and dresses all work well. Another great piece for the first trimester: a ""blouson"" style top – that is, one that has a fitted waistband at the bottom but some roominess above the band. The fabric falls loosely over your belly while the fitted waistband keeps the look more tailored.
Throw on a pair of boot-cut stretch jeans for a comfortable, pulled-together look. Most maternity clothes have too much fabric for your barely there bump, but you've grown enough in other places that your pre-pregnancy clothes just don't fit. What to do: Stretch your wardrobe with a couple of key additions.

, The challenge: You feel like every few weeks you're a new size and don't want to blow your budget on new clothes every month.


What to do: Invest in a few items that will grow with you. Look for pieces that have details like ruching, tie-backs, buttons or gathering at the sides, and wraps, which will all let you adjust your clothing as your body grows and changes.
What's more, they will let you flatteringly flaunt your bump, which usually pops out during this time.

, When you're further along in your pregnancy, try buying fashionable t-shirts, only a couple sizes larger.


Maternity pants are go-to super comfortable, and fashionable during pregnancy. Consider ditching heels, as they may lead to back problems. Try comfortable flats or boots instead.
If you're feeling self-conscious about ugly maternity wear, try adding scarves or jackets, belts, necklaces, etc.
It’s all about the pants. Find comfortable pants that fit well. You can wear your shirts for most if not all of your pregnancy as long as you like how they look, they and won't be stretched so you can't wear them again. If you do buy pregnancy shirts, make sure that they work for nursing so you double or triple the amount of time you use them.

, You can place this band at the top of your jeans, over the waistband that will no longer button or zip. This will work for earlier stages of pregnancy before you transition into maternity pants.


The band will keep your pants up, and no one will know they're unbuttoned.
In a pinch, you can also use a rubber band looped over the button and through the buttonhole to do the same thing, minus the smoothing effect of the band. You could use a big safety pin too."

By going to bed and getting up at the same time, your body will become accustomed to sleeping a certain number of hours at night which can help you avoid sleeping too much. Your body will want to wake up., Set a bedtime for yourself, at least eight hours before you must get up.To make sure you are actually going to sleep at your bedtime, set an alarm on your phone about an hour before. That way, you have time to wind down, turn off the electronics, and get ready for bed.

, One sleep cycle is about 90 minutes; therefore, try to plan the amount of sleep you get around your cycles. In fact, if you find yourself awake slightly before your alarm goes off, you should just get up, rather than entering another cycle. Waking up in the beginning or middle of a cycle can make you groggy., Darkness and light are important to your sleeping rituals — reducing light exposure prompts your body to start producing melatonin, a hormone that makes you sleepy. Light (either natural light from the sun in the morning or artificial light from lamps and electronic devices) will suppress the production of melatonin, helping you feel more alert. Once you get in a rhythm, the darkness will help you sleep, and the light will signal your body to wake up.When you go to bed, make sure to shut out any light. Turn off hall lights, and cover your alarm clock. Put up blackout curtains if streetlight comes through your windows or you must sleep during the day.When you wake up, use light to your advantage. Open up the curtains, if it's light out already, or go outside for a few minutes. If it's not light out, try using a light box with full spectrum light., Don't exercise in the three hours before going to sleep. If you exercise too close to bedtime, it may stimulate your mind and body, keeping you awake., It's tempting to get a few extra minutes of sleep in the morning by hitting ""snooze"" on the alarm; however, doing so can make you groggy, which means you'll want to sleep even more. Try to get up as soon as the alarm starts to go off.Don't set multiple alarms, either. You may like waking up to the first alarm knowing you have another 15 or 30 minutes to sleep before your ""real"" alarm goes off, but this will interrupt your sleep cycle and make it harder to get up when it's time.
One way to ensure you wake up is to make sure your alarm clock isn't within arm's reach. Basically, you don't want to be able to hit snooze.Try moving it across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another thing that can help you wake up is to use a natural light alarm clock. It's like having a little sun in your bedroom to wake you up., After getting some light, hop in the shower. To make it especially refreshing, try switching between hot and cold water every 20 seconds. This method will help jolt you awake., You can make getting up easier by having something you love every morning. Maybe it's as simple as a cup of tea or a coffee, or maybe you have a bowl of your favorite cereal. Use something you love as a motivation to get up and moving., If you find yourself getting drowsy, it's time to move about. Try to take a short walk, even if it's just to the bathroom or break room. 20 minutes is ideal, but if you can't manage that, just try a quick walk around the office or a few jumping jacks to get your blood pumping., If you're eating a heavy meal at lunchtime, you're more likely to feel tired in the afternoon. Try eating something light, such as a salad. Be sure to include 3 – 4 ounces of protein (one serving), as it can help you power through the afternoon.It's fine to snack on healthy foods if you start feeling hungry in the afternoon. It's better to stick to smaller meals or snacks rather than having one huge meal at noon., If you find yourself getting sleepy at your computer, it's time to take a break, at least from staring at the screen. Try to look at something else across the room for at least five minutes., It's no secret that caffeine can help you stay awake; however, science has shown it's best to spread out your caffeine throughout the day instead of taking one big dose in the morning in the form of three or four cups of coffee. To spread it out, try drinking something with a lower amount of caffeine, such as green tea, more often throughout the day, or just drinking smaller amounts of coffee at a time.Also, don't drink caffeine too close to bedtime, as it can keep you awake, making you more tired the next day. Try to stop the caffeine about six hours before bedtime (and remember chocolate contains caffeine!).

, Music can help rev up your energy, especially if it's something you like. Instead of sticking to silence, plug in some headphones if you're at work or crank up the radio if you're at home. It's hard to fall asleep if you're bopping your head along to your favorite song., Even if you feel like going to sleep, try to stay away from the bedroom or the couch. Don't be anywhere that you enjoy snoozing.If you find yourself snoozing constantly, even at your desk, you may want to see a doctor about being tested for narcolepsy.

, You don't actually have to use soap; however, taking a trip to the bathroom to throw some cold water on your face can help you wake up. If you've got makeup on, try putting some cold water on the back of your neck."

Understand what causes sleep apnea.,
Talk to you doctor about your sleep.,
Undergo a thorough physical examination by your doctor.",How to Acquire a CPAP Machine," You will have had a sleep study (called a ""polysomnogram"") to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea, and your doctor will use the results of this sleep study to help you pick out a CPAP machine and adjust the settings to be right for you.Your doctor will discuss the results of the sleep study with you, and write a prescription for a CPAP machine.
Your doctor can also help to answer any questions you may have about where in your community to obtain a CPAP machine.;
, You will need to order the CPAP machine from a company that sells home medical equipment. You want to make sure the home equipment provider you use is covered by your insurance.Most people's insurance does cover CPAP machines.However, it never hurts to verify your coverage prior to making the purchase.

, Go to websites where CPAP users discuss what they like and dislike their masks and machines. Look up the official website for the machines you are thinking about buying. Talk to your doctor or a representative at the company selling you the machine.


You already had a trial run with the help of an experienced technician at the sleep center. Think back to what mask worked for you at that time.
The CPAP machine has three main parts: a mask that sits over your nose or your nose and mouth, straps to keep the mask in place on your face, and a tube which connects the mask to the machine’s motor. This motor blows air through the tube and out of the mask; this constantly blowing air applies mild pressure which keeps your upper airway open.A nasal pillow can take the place of the mask. It has two short plastic-like tubes that fit into your nostrils. There is a strap to hold it in place and a tube connecting it to the machine motor.Decide whether you prefer this option, or a full mask. It will depend how well the mask fits your face (there are a variety of mask options available), and which option feels best to you. This part is very subjective and varies from person to person.
The CPAP machine is small, lightweight, and generally quiet. The noise the machine makes while it is working is soft and rhythmic. It should not interfere with your ability to sleep.Consider getting a CPAP machine with a variable warming humidifier.This helps a great deal if you have sinus issues; the extra moisture may make the blowing air less irritating.If in doubt, CPAP machines with humidifiers included have been shown to be more successful for most people.

, After purchasing your CPAP machine and trying it out at home, let your doctor know if your family or spouse is hearing snoring, or if you are feeling tired during the day again. He or she may need to adjust the settings on your CPAP machine to help it work better for you, if you encounter any problems., Call your doctor if you cannot tolerate the machine while you sleep. The doctor can help you find a different type of mask or therapy. Remember the benefits of treating your sleep apnea.


CPAP keeps your upper airway open during sleep, improves the quality of your sleep, makes you feel more rested in the morning, allows you to be more productive throughout the day, lets others living with you get some sleep, and can decrease or prevent high blood pressure.The health benefits of using your CPAP machine regularly are enormous, even if you don't always notice the difference yourself. It will pay off years down the road in avoiding health complications that can otherwise arise from sleep apnea., If you have not yet been diagnosed with sleep apnea, but suspect you may have it, it is important to talk with your family doctor. Until you have received an ""official diagnosis"" of sleep apnea (including undergoing a sleep study called a ""polysomnogram""), you will not be eligible for medical coverage for a CPAP machine., You breathe in air through your upper airway. Normally, air goes in through your nose and mouth then it flows past the back of your throat into your lungs. If you think about your body as a machine, it is busy throughout the day using energy to keep you running smoothly. The lungs pull oxygen, an energy source, from the air into your blood. But, your lungs can do more than one thing at a time; carbon dioxide, a form of waste, moves out of your blood into the same air. The end of this cycle is when you breathe out this air.When you have obstructive sleep apnea, your breathing is slowed or maybe even stopped. If you have severe sleep apnea, you may stop breathing hundreds of time in one night. This is because all of the muscles in your body, including your upper airway, relax as you sleep. This allows the tissues in the back of your throat to hang loosely and block the easy flow of air into your lungs. Your brain and the rest of body are not getting enough oxygen. Your body’s answer to this problem is to wake you up just a little. This tightens up the tissues in the back of your throat just enough to allow you to breathe better. You will not remember waking up over and over again, but your sleep is not restful., The people around you, such as your spouse and/or family, will have to tell parts of your story (such as reporting about any snoring and/or sudden nighttime awakenings from the fact you have stopped breathing). They likely know more about what really happens when you are sleeping than you do. However, you can tell your doctor about symptoms such as not feeling rested, falling asleep during the day, or perhaps even falling asleep for a moment while driving (note that this is one of the biggest dangers of undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea)., Your doctor will look for things which may put you at risk for sleep apnea. He or she will also ask about your health in general.


Your doctor will look in your mouth to look at the size of your tonsils and/or adenoids; these tissues found in the back of your throat can block your upper airway if they are large. Your large tongue could fall back into your throat and block the flow of air.Obesity is the strongest risk factor. The prevalence of OSA progressively increases as the body mass index increases. Having a large neck size (17 inches or greater in men and 16 inches or greater in women) increases your risk.You are at higher risk if you are over the age of 40, but even a child can have sleep apnea — the prevalence of OSA increases from young adulthood through the sixth to seventh decade. The doctor will take note of your sex and race. You are at a higher risk if you are male (men are two to three times more likely to have OSA) and African-American, Hispanic, or a Pacific Islander. Having a small jaw or abnormalities in the upper airway are other risks factors your doctor will look for during the examination.Nasal congestion increases sleep apnea twofold. Smoking increases the risk of sleep apnea by aggravating preexisting symptoms. Menopausal and postmenopausal women are at an increased risk of sleep apnea. Family history of snoring is also a risk factor. Alcohol, narcotics, and benzodiazepines may increase the risk for sleep apnea.
Other medical conditions that increase the risk of sleep apnea include pregnancy, CHF, End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), chronic lung disease, asthma, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, acromegaly, thyroid disease, and PCOS.
Finally, if the clinical examination and symptoms you share with your doctor are suspicious for sleep apnea, he or she will order a sleep study for you. This is how the definitive diagnosis is made. When the diagnosis of sleep apnea is confirmed via a sleep study, you will then be eligible to proceed with getting a CPAP machine for treatment.

Having an activity you regularly engage in before bed can help signal to your mind and body that it's time to sleep. Relaxation techniques before bed can also help the brain wind down.


Deep breathing can help aid in sleep. Place one hand on your lower stomach and breathe in so your hand rises with each breath. Hold the breath for a count of three and then exhale.Try tensing your toes. Curl your toes in, count to 10, release, and then count to 10 again. Repeat 10 times.Relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation, can help you wind down before bed. You can find progressive muscle relaxation techniques online. PMR involves hyper-focusing on one region of the body at a time. This can help place you in the present moment, avoiding any troublesome thoughts that prevent you from sleeping.
A warm shower or bath can also help with sleep. Consider hopping in the tub an hour or so before bed. Make sure the water isn't too hot, as this can actually be stimulating.;
, To help prevent insomnia, make your bedroom or sleeping area as inviting, calm and soothing as possible.Simply improving your sleeping area can lead to higher quality sleep.


If you live in a noisy apartment or area, consider a white noise machine. This can drown out unwanted sounds. You can also download white noise apps on your phone.
You should strive to keep your beds and sheets comfortable. If you're irritated by a certain fabric, replace it. Experiment with the temperature in your room. Keep your room cool —try around 60–65 °F or 16–18°C (though this may be too cool for some). Keep bright lights and electronic screens out of the bedroom.Try putting a fan in your room, which can provide white noise as well as move air around and keep your room cool.
Your bed should only be used for sleeping and sex. Avoid doing work or reading in your bed. You do not want to associate your bedroom with anything but sleep.Avoid trying too hard to sleep — wait until you're drowsy to go to bed. If you can't sleep, then get out of bed after 20–30 minutes and do something relaxing until you're drowsy.Remove clocks from the bedroom. Once you set your alarm, hide all clocks from view. Seeing what time it is can increase anxiety and make insomnia worse., Heavy meals a few hours before bedtime can cause indigestion and discomfort. This can result in an inability to sleep. Stick to light, healthy snacks before bedtime like whole grains, fruit, and low-fat dairy.

, Another common cause of insomnia is consuming certain sleep-disrupting chemicals too close to bedtime. Alcohol, caffeine and nicotine are all well-established as sleep disturbers, and their effects can last as long as 8 hours.As a general rule, avoid caffeine after lunch, avoid alcohol within 6 hours of bedtime, and avoid nicotine (tobacco) a few hours before bedtime.Caffeine increases the firing rates of the neurons within your brain, causing more thoughts to race through your head. Alcohol consumption, while making many people drowsy leads to less high quality sleep.
Coffee, black tea, green tea, hot chocolate, dark chocolate bars, most sodas, and energy drinks are sources of caffeine. Even caffeine-free energy drinks contain stimulants such as guarana, cola nut and/or ginseng. Avoid such beverages close to bedtime.
Sugar is also a stimulant and should be avoided for at least an hour before bedtime.

, If stress is causing your insomnia, finding ways to turn your brain off before bed can help. Establish a pre-sleep routine that allows you to wind down and de-stress before bed.


Consider a calming activity before bed. Read something light and fun. Take a warm bath. Meditate. Avoid activities that are stimulating, however, like using your computer and watching television.You can also try writing down your thoughts earlier in the day. Dedicate 10 to 15 minutes each day to writing down your worries or at least taking time to think about what's bothering you. Then, at night those thoughts will be out of your brain. This can make it easier to fall asleep.If you find yourself worrying in bed despite trying to unwind, busy yourself with mental exercises. Try to think of 50 boy's names that start with the letter ""A."" List as many fruits and vegetables you can that start with the letter ""C."" As silly as these exercises may seem, they'll take your mind off worries and tire you by occupying your brain with other thoughts., Concerns with work, school, and social life can lead to stress which then causes in insomnia.Trying to reduce or manage your daily stress can help relieve the symptoms of insomnia.


Be reasonable about your obligations and responsibilities. Many people are stressed due to being overcommitted or over scheduled. If you don't have time to make a dish for your school's bake sale, do not promise to do so.
Scratch items off your ""to-do"" list if you realize you won't have time to get to them today. Ask a friend or family member for help running errands if you're having a busy week.Feel free to disengage with stressful situations. If you have a family member or co-worker who tends to grate on you, lessen contact. If certain social events cause you stress, stay in for a night.Manage your time in a way that you can avoid stressful situations. If you hate running late, leave for work a little early each day. If you stress about day-to-day chores, lump together tasks that can be done in the same outing. For example, plan to pick up your prescription at the same time you stop by the grocery store after work.Talk to friends and family members about stressful issues. It can be very helpful to have a friend or family member to vent to on stressful days. Just getting troublesome thoughts of your system to help. If you feel uncomfortable talking to someone about your stress, consider journaling your feelings instead.Talk to your doctor about your stress level. Your doctor can recommend lifestyle changes that can help your body better regulate stress. He or she may also be able to provide you with a referral to a counselor or therapist who can work with you on stress management.

, Regular physical activity can help regulate your sleep cycle. If you don't have an exercise routine already, working to establish one can help you combat insomnia.


Strive for 20 to 30 minutes of regular vigorous activity each day. This should be in the form of aerobic exercises like biking, jogging, sports, or aerobic routines you can find online.Establishing an exercise routine can take some work. Keeping a regular schedule can help. Try to exercise every morning or every day after work. Having a certain time during which you normally work out can make exercise feel routine, as much part of your day-to-day activity as brushing your teeth or having dinner.
When you exercise matters when it comes to insomnia. While exercise can help, you should not engage in vigorous physical activity too close to bedtime. Try to make sure your workout routine occurs five to six hours before bed., If you have difficulty sleeping, you may want to nap during the day. However, this can make falling asleep much more difficult. Try to limit daytime napping or, better yet, avoid it altogether. If you can't get by without a nap, do not nap for more than 30 minutes and do so before 3 PM., Ask your doctor if any of your current prescription medications may be contributing to your insomnia. If they are, see about switching medication types or altering doses. Check the labels of any over-the-counter meds you take regularly. If they contain caffeine or stimulants like pseudoephedrine they may be causing your insomnia., If acute insomnia has transitioned into chronic (long-term) insomnia despite your efforts with home remedies, then make an appointment with your family doctor. You may have an underlying medical condition causing your sleep difficulties.


Common causes of insomnia include chronic pain, depression, restless leg syndrome, severe snoring (sleep apnea), urinary problems, arthritis, cancer, overactive thyroid gland, menopause, heart disease, lung disease, and chronic heartburn.Ask your doctor if any of your medications put you at risk of insomnia — problematic drugs include those used for depression, blood pressure, allergies, weight loss and mood alteration (such as Ritalin).
Your doctor will go over your medical history and any other symptoms you might have. It might be helpful to make a list of concerns and questions ahead of time to ask your doctor.

, As insomnia is the result of emotional stress, therapy can help you manage insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy, a type of therapy that helps you better control negative thoughts, is often helpful for those suffering insomnia.


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is used to combat factors that exacerbate chronic insomnia such as poor sleep habits, irregular sleep schedules, inadequate sleep hygiene and misunderstandings about sleeping.CBT includes behavioral changes (keeping regular bedtimes and wake-up times, eliminating afternoon naps), but also adds a cognitive (thinking) component. Your therapist will work with you to help you control or eliminate negative thoughts, worries and any false beliefs that are keeping you awake. Your therapist may ask you to do work outside of his or her office, such as keeping a diary of negative thoughts or engaging in certain activities to cope with negative thoughts.
You can find a therapist by asking for a referral from your doctor. You can also find a list of providers through your insurance. If you are a student, you may have access to free counseling through your college or university.

, If your doctor thinks it's necessary, he or she may prescribe drugs to help you address sleeplessness. Keep in mind that most doctors do not prescribe drugs for the long term when treating insomnia as drugs sometimes treat the cause with addressing underlying issues.Z-drugs are a class of drugs that help encourage calmness and sleep. They are usually prescribed for two to four weeks at a time as they become less effective over time. Side effects can include increased snoring, dry mouth, confusion, and drowsiness or dizziness during the day., There's numerous herbal remedies or natural supplements that act as mild sedatives and can help induce sleep and combat insomnia.


Valerian root has a mild sedating effective. Valerian root is sometimes sold as a supplement at many health food stores. As it sometimes has an effect on liver function, you should talk to your doctor before using valerian root.Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in your brain and essential for circadian rhythm and deep sleeps. Research is inconclusive on how well it treats symptoms of insomnia, but it is generally considered safe for short-term use.Acupuncture is a medical procedure in which a doctor places needles into your skin at strategic points. There is some evidence this may help people with insomnia. You might want to look into acupuncture treatment if other methods don't work."

Realize the complications of both types of sleep apnea.",How to Deal with Sleep Apnea," Obstructive sleep apnea is far more common than central apnea, and is most often caused by direct interference with the passage of air when your throat muscles relax, resulting in interrupted breathing.The muscles in your throat support structures in your mouth and throat that normally remain open to let air pass through, even when you are sleeping.The structures supported by the muscles in your throat include the soft palate, the uvula, the tonsils, and the tongue.When the throat muscles relax too much as you fall asleep, your air passages are blocked.This causes a 10 to 20 second lapse of time when the level of oxygen in your blood is inadequate for the amount your brain needs.Your brain wakes you up briefly in order to restore the passage of air. In many cases, the person does not remember waking up.This can occur as often as 5 to 30 times every hour, or even more, and continues throughout the night.;
, Some symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea may overlap with those of central apnea. In most people, the cause of the problem clearly indicates one of the two possible types. Common symptoms that occur with obstructive sleep apnea include the following:Excessive daytime sleepiness that may cause you to fall asleep at work, while watching television, and have trouble staying awake to drive.Loud snoring, often loud enough to disturb the sleep of others, and is the loudest when you are positioned on your back.Observed episodes of periods of time when breathing stops.Waking up suddenly with a feeling of shortness of breath, often accompanied by a snorting, choking, or gasping sound.Waking up with a headache and/or chest pain.Difficulty concentrating during the day.Moodiness or noticeable changes in mood.Problems with insomnia, such as being able to stay asleep at night.Having high blood pressure., While the symptoms are similar, the underlying possible causes of central sleep apnea are different.Central sleep apnea occurs when the brain sends faulty signals to the muscles responsible for regulating your breathing.Central sleep apnea is much less common than obstructive sleep apnea and is usually related to another medical condition.The most common causes for central sleep apnea are medical problems associated with serious cardiovascular problems such as heart failure, disorders that involve abnormal functioning of your brainstem, or a history of a stroke.Some medications used repeatedly or in large doses can cause this type of sleep apnea. Opiates are the most common medications tied to causing central sleep apnea, as they send messages to the brain that disrupt and slow normal breathing patterns.Opiates that have been associated with central sleep apnea include morphine, oxycodone, and codeine., While the symptoms are similar and overlap with those of obstructive apnea, there are some differences. Symptoms associated with central sleep apnea include the following:Shortness of breath that wakes you from sleep.Shortness of breath that is relieved by changing your position to sitting upright.Observed periods of abnormal breathing, including periods when you stop breathing, while you are sleeping.Difficulty staying asleep often considered to be insomnia.Excessive daytime sleepiness that may cause you to fall asleep at work, watching television, or even driving.Daytime evidence of poor sleep including difficulty concentrating, morning headaches, and mood changes.Snoring. Although snoring is also a symptom of obstructive apnea, it can also be unrelated to apnea., Treatment options often begin with adjusting factors that may be within your control.Seek medical attention to confirm your diagnosis and get support for the important lifestyle adjustments you can alter to help treat your apnea., Alcohol significantly slows your rate of breathing. This causes the amount of oxygen that is available in your blood to be lower than normal. When you experience symptoms associated with sleep apnea, you want as much oxygen as possible to reach your brain.Do not consume alcohol within four hours of your bedtime., People that smoke will have more trouble with their air flow and airway passages.Talk to your doctor if you need help to stop smoking. Products are available both over-the-counter and by prescription that can help you successfully quit smoking.

, If you are overweight or obese, this may be the primary cause of your sleep apnea.Take steps to manage your weight in order to control your symptoms.Talk to your doctor if you need help with weight loss. Prescription products may help, plus your doctor can connect you with a nutritionist and possibly an exercise therapist to help you as you work towards your weight loss goal., Be sure you doctor is aware of the problems you having with your sleep apnea.With your doctor’s help, your routine medications can be adjusted to prevent them from aggravating your condition or causing problems., Try to avoid sleeping on your back.Use extra bed pillows to provide support against your back and help prevent you from rolling onto your back during your sleep.Special pillows are available to help you rest comfortably while providing support to help you sleep on your side., When you are congested or your nasal passages are blocked, this causes you to breathe through your mouth at night possibly triggering or worsening the apnea.Talk to your doctor about the safest and most effective way to keep your nasal passages open at night. Over-the-counter products, including some that do not contain any medication such as breathing strips, are available.Other products like saline nasal sprays or neti pots may work well for you to help your nasal passages stay clear at night., Custom-fitted mouth devices are available specifically for sleep apnea.The devices are made to fit in your mouth to keep your lower jaw and tongue in a position that keeps your airway passages open so you can breathe at night.This type of device may or may not correct the type of problem you have that is causing your apnea, so talk to your doctor first to determine if this may be helpful., With the help of your doctor, you may be able to pinpoint the exact cause of your apnea.For example, if you know that your tonsils are enlarged and are causing your apnea, then talk to your doctor about possible procedures to correct the problem.In people that are suffering from central sleep apnea caused by cardiovascular issues, working closely with the cardiologist to address and correct those problems can help to reduce the symptoms of their apnea.The same is true for people with diabetes. Taking good care of your diabetes, including steps to control weight management, can help to manage the sleep apnea symptoms., To proceed with apnea treatment using CPAP equipment, which stands for continuous positive airway pressure, your diagnosis will likely need to be confirmed.The method used to diagnose sleep apnea is a polysomnography test, most commonly referred to as a sleep study.This is inconvenient but necessary to confirm the diagnosis, determine the severity of your apnea, and is usually required to support the diagnosis by your insurance company so they will assist in paying for the equipment., Once you have completed your sleep study, your doctor will explain the differences in the available equipment.A CPAP unit provides a steady stream of air with enough pressure to prevent the tissues in your mouth and throat area from closing or collapsing as you sleep.Most units deliver a constant flow of air at the desired pressure level, which is adjustable and indicated on the machine.A newer method of delivering air pressure is called autotitrating positive airway pressure, or APAP. This type of unit adjusts automatically to the different breathing patterns of the person throughout the night.Many people describe the APAP equipment as being easier to get accustomed to and easier to tolerate.Some units available are called bilevel positive airway pressure, or BPAP. This type of unit is designed to deliver one level of pressure when the person is inhaling and another pressure level when exhaling.The most common CPAP unit weights about 3 pounds, has a tube that connects to the mask, and is compact enough to sit on your bedside table.The units have adjustable levels of pressure so you can begin with a small amount of pressure as you get used to the equipment, then gradually increase the pressure to the level your doctor recommended., Masks are available in different styles and sizes.Some masks fit just over the nose and others are designed to fit over the mouth and nose.Try on several to determine the size and style that is most comfortable to you., Be sure the doctor or technician shows you how to adjust the fit of your mask.A mask that fits poorly can cause skin irritation, sores, and may not function as it is intended., It may be helpful to wear the mask for a few hours during the day without being attached to the actual unit.Start with wearing the mask for fewer hours each night if you have trouble adjusting to it. Work towards keeping the mask in place with the unit on for the duration of your sleep time.Start with lower levels of pressure and gradually increase to reach the amount of pressure your doctor recommended., Your sleep apnea is not being treated if you do not wear the mask with the appropriate amount of pressure. It is important that you wear your mask every night.Additionally, it is very important that you give yourself a 1 to 3 month time frame to become used to wearing the mask every night. If you wake up and find you have removed your mask or headgear, put it back on and continue to sleep. This is an imperative part of creating the habit of sleeping properly with your CPAP.
Consider that more than 80% of sleep apnea sufferers discontinue using their CPAP within the first year due to not forcing themselves to create the habit of wearing the CPAP mask. Unfortunately, they may not realize the dire health consequences they could be facing, such as a heart attack, by not making this important life change.
Wear the mask for at least 6 to 7 hours each night for the best results.Most masks are designed with convenient travel cases so you can take it with you on business or pleasure trips away from home., Clean and maintain your equipment, including your mask, every day.Many units are equipped with computer chips that communicate the results of your sleep to your doctor. Follow your doctor’s instructions regarding the recorded information from your unit. Some units require that the chip be taken to your doctor’s office or downloaded via a computer., The most common complaints of CPAP users include simple side effects that can be managed.Nasal congestion and dry mouth are common side effects. Many units are now equipped with built in humidifiers that help with these problems.Wear the chin strap that comes with your unit to prevent dry mouth. The chin strap functions to keep your mouth closed at night so you are breathing only through your nose., Depending on your response to CPAP treatment, your success with recommended lifestyle changes, and the underlying cause of your apnea, surgery may be an option to consider.Surgery is done to correct any problems related to anatomy and specific to the individual.Examples of surgical procedures sometimes used to treat sleep apnea include structural correction for nasal passage problems, excessive amounts of tissue in the soft palate area, or enlarged tonsils or adenoids that are blocking the passage of air when you sleep.If surgery is determined to be an option, the procedure done will be designed specifically to correct problems associated with that individual. There is no general surgical procedure performed that is universally used to correct sleep apnea., While anyone can have obstructive sleep apnea, some conditions and characteristics make the condition more likely to develop. The more common risk factors include the following:Being overweight. As many as 50% of the people with obstructive sleep apnea are overweight. Fatty tissue deposits around the upper airway passages are thought to contribute to the problem.Having a larger waist size. While this factor is unclear as to the direct relationship to obstructive sleep apnea other than being overweight, it is considered a risk factor.Having a neck circumference greater than 17 inches in men, and 16 inches in women is associated with developing obstructive sleep apnea.Being hypertensive, or having high blood pressure.Having a narrowed airway in your throat. This may be due to genetics or you may have enlarged tonsils or adenoids that are blocking the passage of air.Being diabetic. People with diabetes are more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea.Being a man. Men are twice as likely as women to develop obstructive sleep apnea.Being black and under the age of 35. In this age group, obstructive sleep apnea occurs more often in black people.Being between the ages of 18 and 60. While this disorder can occur in anyone at any age, it is more common in people that are between the ages of 18 to 60.Having a family history of obstructive sleep apnea places you at greater risk of developing the disorder.Being a smoker. Smoking puts you at higher risk of developing the disorder.Drinking alcohol. Alcohol use tends to cause the symptoms to worsen.Being a woman past menopause. Women who are past menopause have a higher risk of developing sleep apnea., There are factors that increase your odds of developing central sleep apnea. While anyone can develop central sleep apnea, some factors clearly increase the risk. Some of the more common risk factors include the following:Males are more likely to develop this form of sleep apnea.Adults over the age of 65 develop central sleep apnea more frequently, possibly due to other medical conditions or natural changes in sleep patterns.Cardiac problems including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure are often linked to central sleep apnea.Brain tumors, a history of stroke, and conditions that involve the brainstem are associated with an increased risk of developing central sleep apnea.Sleeping at high altitudes may contribute to central sleep apnea. This tends to resolve once you relocate to lower altitudes., Both obstructive and central sleep apnea can lead to complications, with the possibility that some complications may develop even if you are treated.It is not uncommon for some people to suffer from both forms of sleep apnea, or have one type develop after the first has been identified.The sudden changes in oxygen flow to the brain and other vital organs place a strain on the cardiovascular system. Consequently people may develop problems with high blood pressure which increases the risk of heart disease.Severe symptoms can lead to more serious consequences including coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and stroke.In people that already have a heart condition, repeated episodes of low blood oxygen can cause a sudden cardiac event and possibly death.Daytime fatigue can be overwhelming and can cause problems with functioning. Due to the frequent awakenings, your body is unable to establish the level of sleep needed, called restorative sleep, in order to be alert and well-rested during the day.People with obstructive or central sleep apnea are more likely to have problems with daytime concentration, memory problems, and mood changes.Some research has found a greater incidence of glaucoma in people that have obstructive sleep apnea.Another, but very important matter, is the disrupted sleep of your bed partner.Be sure your doctor or surgeon is aware of your condition in case you need a surgical procedure. The use of anesthesia can sometimes worsen symptoms for a short time following the procedure.Let your doctor know of your problems. Depending on your situation, some medications may need to be avoided that can cause further problems due to your sleep apnea."

Avoid stiff fabrics. Instead choose stretchy fabrics. Yoga pants will also be a great choice because they are loose and comfortable. Avoid zippers and buttons. Wearing pants or skirts with elastic or ties instead of zippers or buttons is a must.
Jersey knits and other soft, stretchable garments are both comfortable and easy to wash and wear.

, You don’t want to pick loaded-with-Lycra clothes. While these curve-hugging tops will show off your bump later, right now you'll feel too much like a sausage in a tight casing.


At the same time, buying clothing fitted for a pregnant body is actually going to make you look slimmer than encasing your body in a huge too-large shirt. Satin is not considered a good pregnancy fabric by some, and bright colors are not usually a great idea, either.Avoid tops that are too billowy and tent-like, unless you prospectus look. Look for ones that flow gracefully over the extra pounds beneath while still having a bit of shape. Tunics are a great choice. While fitted across the shoulders and arms, a tunic flows gracefully across the middle, disguising extra weight. V-neck or scoop-neck shirts are a good choice as they draw the gaze to the neckline.

, An exception to the anti-cling rule: tank tops and other garments with built-in shaping panels.


These can help smooth out the sudden pooch or contain your growing breasts. Top these tanks with a body-skimming top or cardigan made of a smooth jersey fabric.
Stock up on such layering tanks. Wear them under tops that no longer button all the way. Throw one or two on under an oversize cardigan or blazer.

, You need a few workhorse items that will go from work to weekend without sacrificing comfort.


What to do: Embrace the wrap dress, if appropriate for your work place, or rather, let the wrap dress – in a sleek solid color or a color-blocked pattern – embrace your curves. You'll look perfectly pulled together for the office and be comfortable and stylish for running weekend errands.
As your bump gets bigger and higher, simply change where you place the tie, eventually making the frock into an empire-waisted garment, giving much-needed definition between bosom and belly.
Another faithful, versatile item to choose: a pair of dark denim maternity boot-cut jeans with the stretchy fabric built right into the waistband. The cut and color will flatter you throughout the entire pregnancy and work for almost any work or social situation.

, Other than wrap dresses, wearing skirts and dresses can be tricky during pregnancy. In particular, you will want to avoid too-short skirts.


Dresses and skirts that are designed to show a longer length in the back (similar to a gentleman's morning coat) are often in fashion and, as your abdomen expands with your growing baby, still look as if they were meant to look that way. A shift or maxi dress is a good choice.If you choose to wear a skirt make sure it is slightly form fitting and low volume. Try for A-Line skirts, pencil, sarong, godet, or a thin low volume gypsy style.
A high-waisted skirt in comfortable material is a good idea if it falls at the knees or below them. Wrap dresses are perfect for pregnancy. They are comfortable, stretch over the stomach, and still retain a bit of sex appeal., Maternity pants are basically pants with an elastic waistband so you don't have to worry about not fitting.


You can get them at many department stories. Maternity pants also come in blue jean style but with a stretchy waistband. Don’t be afraid to rock a pair of maternity blue jeans. Blue jeans can be a great way to start a pregnancy outfit.You want to avoid anything with zippers or buttons.

Work with slimming and solid colors.,
Wear comfortable shoes.,
Accessorize for the right effect.,
Invest in a good bra.",How to Dress when Pregnant3," Black is very slimming, so wear as much black as you like. Go for the long line look.


White shows off your belly and will make it more obvious. Some abstract colors like a neon top with dark pants, also draw attention to your belly. You could try another solid color like soft gray if black gets too boring. Try wearing a single color from top to bottom.Vertical stripes are much better than horizontal, ideally with darker vertical colors at your sides and lighter vertical stripes in the center.
Avoid garish or in-your-face bold and big patterns. Keep in mind that darker on the bottom and lighter on the top brings the eyes of the beholder up towards your radiant face.

, Shoes are important to consider because as your child grows, your blood and other fluid volumes increase, often causing swelling in ankles and feet (this can also permanently change your shoe size.)


Wear lower shoes with flats. High heels are just a bad idea during pregnancy especially because it would be dangerous if you fell. You also want to choose shoes with some extra room.Wedges are fun and beautiful to wear. Buying insoles for your shoes can increase comfort for sore feet. Flip flops can be useful as feet swell.

, Wear layered necklaces that are shorter than your growing baby bump to keep the focus up top.


Try wearing a great scarf. This can draw people’s eyes away from your bump.
Wear natural fiber undergarments. Sometimes during pregnancy one sweats more than usual. To look stylish, wear hoops and big sunglasses.

, Your boobs are probably busting out all over. What to do: If you haven't already, now's the time to invest in a few great bras.


While you may choose to go for bigger sizes of your favorite bra, you might want to consider the comfort and expanding nature of maternity or nursing bras. Cotton bras are a good choice. You will want one that supports your back.
Most women find that not only do their cups runneth over, but their band size (the circumference around the back) will grow too. Besides moving up a band size (or two), you can also find inexpensive bra extenders at most lingerie stores.

Count sheep.",How to Fall Asleep Fast1," To fall asleep, your body increases levels of hormones which induce sleepiness as it gets darker outside. This makes you tired and ready to crawl into bed shortly after it has gotten completely dark. If you are on your laptop, cell phone, tablet, or watching TV, and video games, you are inhibiting the creation of these hormones. They keep you vigil. Remove all electronics with bright screens at least an hour before bed so it will be easier for your body to get tired.


Some studies show that people who play video and computer games more than seven hours a week sleep more poorly than those who don’t. If you fit that criteria and have chronic poor sleep, try cutting down on your gaming time.
Besides the bright light from the screens, social media outlets (like on your phone and computer) can cause stress and raise anxiety levels. Say no to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Email, Texting, and any other social media outlet you participate in at least an hour before sleeping.;
, Raising the temperature of your skin increases those feelings of sleepiness and makes your journey to deep sleep happen a bit faster. Take a hot bath or shower for thirty minutes before bedtime and reap the sleepy benefits they provide.









Make sure the water is above 100 °F (38 °C) for the best results. Water that is too cool won’t provide the same benefits as hot water.
Hot baths are better for inducing relaxation, but regardless of whether you take a hot bath or shower, make sure that you enjoy the water for at least 20 minutes.

, Hot skin and a cool room are the perfect combination for falling asleep quickly. Lower your thermostat so that the temperature is 65 degrees or lower. Cold air temperatures induce sleepiness and prevent night sweats. Plus, having a cool room gives you a good excuse to cuddle up close to your significant other, which relieves anxiety and stress.








, Bright lights, not just from electronics, can put a big damper on falling asleep. They trick your body into thinking it is too early in the day for sleep, and prevent an increase in hormones responsible for sleepiness. Turn off all overhead lights, night lights, and lamps to fall asleep faster. Don’t forget to close your blinds too! Light-blocking curtains can be extra beneficial when combined with closed blinds for improved sleep speed.









If you want to read or write before bed (you can also write your plans for tomorrow), try using a small book light rather than a desktop lamp or overhead light. These are small enough that they won’t affect your hormones too much.
If you have a bright clock, use the dimmer option to lower the brightness of the screen. Additionally, turn it away from the bed so that it is not facing you with its brightness, and won’t distract you with checking the time.

, Reading is a wonderful way to reduce stress and help your mind to unwind. Choose a favorite book and read immediately before bed for a bit. Avoid reading horror or action books, as these may have the opposite effect and leave you laying in bed even later than you intended!









Pick a very long book, such as Marcel Proust's ""Remembrance of Things Past"". You will feel sleepy well before getting far through the book.

, If you find that your mind simply won’t turn off or you struggle with daily stress as you try to fall asleep, clear your mind by writing in a journal. Make a note of everything that happened to you during the day in addition to the things you are worrying or stressing about. Getting them out of your head and onto paper will ease your transition into sleep and help your dreams to be less anxiety-filled as well.








, Sipping on something warm and calming will relax your body and mind. Avoid drinking anything with caffeine, but drink something small, soft, and sweet shortly before bed. A cup of warm milk with honey, chamomile, or peppermint tea is great for helping you to fall asleep fast. Pair your drink with your reading or writing and you’re set!







, If you sleep on your back, your airways are blocked off and increase your likelihood for snoring. Sleep on your sides to cut down the likelihood of snoring throughout the night, and encourage your partner to do the same if it is a problem for them too.








, Ideally, you want to sleep so that your neck is in a straight line. If necessary, position a pillow between your knees to keep your hips in a neutral position. Some people use two pillows, one for their arm and one for their head elevation. Others tuck a selection of pillows around them. Whatever works to keep you comfortable and in-line is best.








, Many herbs and minerals have been used for centuries to aid in sleeping. Try some of these different supplements every evening before heading to bed and see if they improve the speed at which you fall asleep.









Calcium and magnesium work together in harmony to help you fall asleep. Take 600mg of calcium and 200mg of magnesium nightly and wait for the results.
Hops don’t only work to create beer, but are also great for creating that lethargic feeling you need for sleep. It helps with insomnia as well as reducing anxiety. Take 30-120mg of a hops supplement each night before bed.
Try a wild lettuce supplement. Wild lettuce tablets help with sleep, anxiety, and depression. A knockout! Take 30-120mg nightly.
Use an L-theanine supplement nightly to improve your alertness during the day and your quality of sleep at night. You can also drink green tea in the mornings, which contains trace amounts of the amino acid.
Take valerian root supplements. This is one of the oldest cures for insomnia; it helps both the speed at which you fall asleep and the quality of your sleep. Take 200-800mg of the supplement every night., This is the hormone responsible for inducing the feelings of sleep you have when it gets dark outside. A low dosage of the pill works better than a high one when taken nightly. Soon enough, you’ll be slumbering away as a result of this natural hormone’s effects.









You don't have to take the supplement though; melatonin can be found naturally in bananas, oats, pineapple, oranges, tomatoes, and cherries, as well as others foods.

, Avoid tight or uncomfortable clothes like socks and hair bands. Be sure to use the bathroom just before you go to bed; a constant need to pee will prevent you from going to sleep and thoughts of being too tired or cold to get up and go can simply cause you to stay awake even longer.








, If your mattress is getting saggy or pokey, flip it over. If it’s too firm, cover it with a foam pad. If you get too hot at night, flip over the pillows. If you have scratchy or uncomfortable sheets or blankets, get new ones. Nothing is more important than getting some rest. If your bed is chronically uncomfortable, consider buying a new one to put your body at ease.








, Turn on a white noise generator or a recording of sounds from nature. The constant, low-level sound drowns out other noises that may prevent you from falling asleep. You could also listen to soft, relaxing music. There are specific pieces of music which are thought to aid sleep––do an online search for the many possible types to find one that suits your needs. Make sure the music you choose is relaxing and peaceful. Experiment with different types of music to get your best sleep tunes. For example, try a bit of classical music such as Mozart or Schubert, or modern ambient pieces such as ""Solace"" by Tom Day, ""A Walk"" by Tycho, ""Lost in Thought"" by KOAN Sound, or ""Strobe"" by deadmau5. These are merely great starting points for you to get on a sound journey to slumber land.









Consider using earplugs to drown out any annoying sounds or loud background noises. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to sleep while a car alarm goes off or your neighbor’s dog barks.
Try not to fall asleep with regular headphones in, as these may slip around and become painful or annoying against your ears and face as you sleep. Use a music playing device with a self-timer set to turn off after a certain amount of time.

, Studies show that using lavender essential oils helps to relax the body and create a comfortable surrounding for sleep. Add a few drops of the oil to your pillow or pillowcase to aid in your journey to the land of nod.








, Well, don’t really count sheep. But try counting! Doing a mundane, repetitive task in your head will distract your mind and bore you into exhaustion.

Turn on white noise.",How to Adjust Your Sleep Schedule," If you're changing your sleep schedule so you can wake up early enough for work, for example, you probably want to wake up an hour or so before departure.


Consider all the variables when making your decision. What do your mornings look like? How much time do you usually need to get up, get ready, and get out the door?;
, Most people require 6 to 8 hours of sleep every night, but the exact duration of necessary sleep differs from person to person. Determine at what time you need to fall asleep in order to wake up at your desired waking time.


One way of figuring this out is to keep a sleep log. Document the hours you sleep every night for a couple of weeks. Average them, then work backwards from there to determine what time you need to go to bed to get that average amount of sleep and get up at the time you desire. For example, if you usually sleep on average about 6 hours and you want to wake up at 5 A.M., you'll want to plan to fall asleep by 11 P.M.
Doctors recommend that you aim for at least seven hours of sleep every night., If you normally wake up at 10 A.M. but want to start waking up at 5 A.M., this isn't going to happen overnight. Sleep specialists argue that the best way to change your sleep cycle is by making adjustments in 15-minute increments.For example, if you normally get up at 8am, but want to start getting up at 5am, set your alarm for and wake up at 7:45 A.M. Do this for three or four days until you feel comfortable with time. Then shave off another 15 minutes. Do this until you reach your goal time.If you're looking to change your sleep schedule sooner, try 30-minute increments.

, Avoid hitting that snooze button. While it can be difficult to get up earlier, snoozing doesn't improve the situation and can in fact make you more tired since it doesn't give you the most restful sleep. Instead, get up when the alarm goes off. You can also put your alarm on the other side of the room. That way when you wake up you'll have to go to the other side of the room to shut off your alarm., The key to effectively altering your sleep schedule is to be consistent. In other words, you need to stick to the sleep and wake times you set every day of the week - this includes weekends!


You can sleep in a little bit on weekends, but sleep specialists only recommend allowing yourself an extra hour or so (to a maximum of two hours). This will keep you on track for the upcoming work week., Eat a light dinner early on in the evening and then nothing. Harvard researchers have found that when you eat affects your internal clock; changing when you eat can be helpful in adjusting to changes in your schedule, whether due to work, life or travel.Fast for approximately 12 hours before your desired waking time. Then, wake up at the desired time and eat a healthy breakfast containing protein. Fasting helps reset your internal rhythm clock to begin your day when you break the fast. This in turn helps set your new waking pattern in place.Try to eat three regular meals spaced out evenly across the day. Make sure your diet is full of fruits, vegetables, and cereals. Avoid fatty foods, which can unsettle your stomach.Don't eat the largest meal of the day within the three-hour period before bedtime.Avoid all food and drinks during the fasting period. You can, however, have water.

, Depending on the size of your body, the amount you ingest, and your general health, the effects of caffeine can remain active in your body for up to 5 to 10 hours after initial consumption. Avoid coffee and caffeinated teas and sodas.Nicotine should also be avoided because it is a stimulant and can keep you wired.

, Alcohol is a depressant, which means it slows down your body. While this will help you fall asleep, alcohol also slows down your metabolism and interferes with your brain during its sleep cycles. You're likely to wake up more often if you've consumed alcohol before bed., Doctors advise that you avoid a heavy cardio workout a few hours before you plan to go to bed; this can unsettle your circadian rhythm and make your sleep less restful. That said, light stretching and exercising, such as an evening walk, are probably useful in getting you ready to go sleep.If you're someone who does intense exercises at night but sleeps well afterwards, then there is no reason to change your routine. Just know yourself.

, Naps are a great way to recharge your batteries when you have a stable sleep schedule, but they are counter-productive when trying to change sleeping patterns. Do not nap at all during the day so that you can fall asleep at the appropriate time later.If you must nap, consider taking a power nap of not longer than 20 minutes.

, About an hour before bed, turn off all of your electronics and dim the lights of your phone and computer. Doctors note that our eyes are sensitive to the bluish light emitted by electronic screens.Bright screens are not only hard on the eyes but also trick your body into thinking it's still daytime and that your mind should still be active.


Instead of looking at a screen, read a book, write, or draw. Do something relaxing that calms you or makes you feel restful. You might consider turning down the lights while you do this activity.

, Because the body drops in temperature when it falls asleep, you can trick your body into thinking it's time to sleep by simulating a temperature drop.


If it's cold outside, take a hot shower so that when you come out, your body experiences a temperature drop.
If it's hot outside, allow your room to heat up and then turn on the air conditioner.

, Sleep specialists note that our circadian rhythms are influenced by light and darkness. This means that many people have a hard time falling asleep when it's still light out, which happens in the summer thanks to daylight savings.At night, shut your blinds and curtains. Turn off bright overhead lights. Consider getting a black out curtain which keeps any light from shining through. If it's still too bright or too much light is getting in, consider wearing a sleep mask.In the morning, turn on all the lights once you awake. This will help kick start your body for the day., You can listen to some light music or put a fan on for some background noise.Listen to the sounds of waves or rain; it will help calm your body and help you get a good night's sleep. Avoid music with lyrics or any songs you know really well because this might be too distracting for you as try to fall asleep.
You can also purchase white noise and other sound machines that have a variety of sounds for you to choose from.

Speak to your doctor first.,
Make a plan to stop taking the sleeping medication.,
Believe in your own ability to sleep naturally and accept your own sleep needs.,
Know what to expect.",How to Break Away from Sleeping Medication1," If you're currently taking sleeping medication and it's playing havoc with your sleep and general health and wellbeing, you should notify your doctor and explain what is happening. Your doctor will be able to advise you as to whether or not you can quit the pills outright or whether there needs to be an adjustment period.


Don't presume you're stuck taking pills. Be adamant that you wish to minimize or stop using the sleeping medication altogether and make your doctor your ally in achieving this outcome. Discuss lifestyle changes that can help improve your sleep.
You may wish it ask about weaker sedatives or natural alternatives such as the natural sedative valerian tea, or melatonin supplements,but keep in mind these can interact with other medications, and you should speak with your doctor before use.;
, Don't throw the pills away just yet; they are insurance to prevent you from panicking and they are still available for those terrible nights when you really do feel like you need them.At the same time, you need to commit to giving them up permanently as carefully and as thoroughly as possible.


If your doctor has suggested a gradual withdrawal program, stick with it. This will greatly increase your chances of success, as quitting sleeping medication too suddenly can throw your body totally out of balance., Some people need more sleep while others need less hours of sleep in order to function optimally; know your own needs and nurture them.


Also be sure to implement the remaining suggestions in the following steps; each is a practical means by which you gain control back over your sleeping routine and, in turn, make your plan more likely to succeed., Depending on the type of sleep medication, withdrawal symptoms can occur. You may feel anxious, edgy, irritable, and depressed, and you may find yourself sweating, experiencing tremors, and increased heart rate, and nausea.You may experience ""rebound insomnia,"" which means you may experience great difficulty falling asleep after you come off the sleeping medication — possibly worse than what caused you to start taking sleeping pills in the first place.Rebound insomnia often causes people to relapse and start taking sleeping meds again, but you must remember that is it temporary, and side effects should go away after about two weeks.Speak with your doctor about how to handle rebound insomnia, or if you are experiencing depression or anxiety that lasts several weeks or months after you stop.You may also experience vivid, strange, and disturbing dreams.Again, this is a normal part of withdrawal and it will go away.
Implementing self relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can assist you in getting through this time. Remember that this is temporary.

The worst culprits are caffeine, alcohol and sugar. These three consumables need to be managed within your overall diet so that they don't deprive you of a good sleep:



Caffeine: Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, chocolate, cocoa, cola, some energy drinks, and foods and medications made with these products. The amount of caffeine from each item varies according to the strength and type of source. In general, it is advisable to stop drinking or consuming caffeinated products at least five hours prior to bedtime.The older you are, the more susceptible you are to caffeine, and it has the ability to suppress sleepiness, keep you up later than you should be, bring about restlessness, heartburn, tremors, etc., and can end up depriving you of much-needed refreshing sleep.Alcohol: While alcohol can cause you to feel drowsy enough to fall asleep initially, it plays havoc with refreshing sleep after you've gone to sleep! Alcohol can reduce REM sleep and the length of sleep, as well as causing you to sleep more shallowly and to awaken often through the night.And for the beauty fans, alcohol creates bags under your eyes!

Sugar: Sugar lurks in a wide range of processed, natural, and cooked foods. Every form of sugar can interrupt sleep if we have too much of it. The problem with sugar is the blood sugar high it creates followed by the crash; experiencing this frequently reduces our energy levels and leaves us fatigued and our sleep patterns are disturbed by poor source of energy sugar is.;
, What causes indigestion in one person may well not bring it on in another, so the possible list of foods here could be endless. The point is to know your own causes of indigestion and to manage these. Some of the more common causes of indigestion include:


Any food you have an intolerance for (foods you're allergic to shouldn't be consumed at all) – common intolerance being gluten, dairy, and chocolate or sugar;
Rich meals just before bedtime. When you don't give your body adequate time to break down the food, and you lie down, indigestion can easily follow. Stop eating rich food at least 5 hours prior to bedtime.A light and healthy diet not only keeps down your weight but also reduces the risk of sleep apnea.
Onions, beans, and peppers can bring on indigestion in susceptible people., These are foods that ensure no highs and crashes but that keep you at a relatively even energy level throughout the day. Having even energy levels stops irritability, fatigue, stress, and exhaustion; it also improves mood and eases the pathway to a better night's sleep because you feel calmer, more rested, and balanced. Energy-stabilizing foods include:Protein-rich meals: Lean meat, cheese, natural yogurt, eggs, fish, wholewheat bread, pulses, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, etc. are steady sources of protein that will give you energy.

Chromium-rich foods: Chromium will help your body to overcome low blood sugar levels. It is found in such foods as shellfish, baked beans, and cheese.

Fresh fruit: Choose this over sugary snacks. You get the benefit of the fiber, the nutrients, and the slow-release energy from fresh fruit so avoid substituting it with juice, dried fruit, or fruit-based baked goods. Apples and pears are calming to the digestive system.

, Water is life-giving and is free of energy-depleting substances. Moreover, it is an important aid to good digestion. Aim to drink 2 liters (about 8 cups) daily.

, An amino acid and an essential chemical, tryptophan helps to build protein.Found in such food as meat, fish, greens, and eggs, consuming tryptophan late in the day will release melatonin and serotonin for good sleep. It speeds up the onset of sleep, decreases the level of spontaneous awakenings during your sleep, and helps to increase the amount of refreshing sleep you get.It is recommended that you consume a main meal about four hours prior to bedtime that consists of complex carbohydrates and foods rich in tryptophan (see the list under ""Tips"" below).
If you're hungry for a snack before bedtime, choose one that is high in tryptophan but ensure that there is at least an hour between eating it and bedtime, to allow for proper digestion. Some bedtime snacks you could consider include:Nuts and tofu
Cheese and crackers

Cereal with milk

Apple pie with ice cream (sugar-reduced)
Oatmeal raisin cookies (sugar-reduced)
Banana slices on whole wheat toast

Peanut butter sandwich.



, Calcium and magnesium calm your mind, so foods rich in these will increase your chances of a good sleep. In addition, there are some foods that are known for their beneficial sleep-inducing properties:



Lettuce: This contains an opium-related substance as well as hyoscyamine which has anti-cramping properties.Lettuce leaves can be juiced with a squeeze of lemon and drunk as a sleep inducing drink – much better for you than sleeping pills!

Complex carbohydrates: These contain serotonin which helps sleep; good sources include pasta, brown rice, and oatmeal.Mandarin juice: This contains bromine, which is calming.

, The glycemic index (GI for short) is a rating system for food that refers to the speed with which the food we eat gets processed. Food that is processed more slowly keeps us fuller for longer and tends to be healthier overall, so this food has a low GI. Low GI foods maintain a better sugar level, helping us to feel better, more balanced, and not tired during the day.By bedtime, a day of low GI foods leaves you naturally tired and ready for sleep. Low GI foods include:


Wholegrain breads, pasta, rice, yams, mixed green salad, or lightly sauteed vegetables.
Pulses, lentils, and beans are excellent low GI foods.
The more processed a food is, the higher its GI rating will be.

, There are various herbs that are helpful in inducing sleep. When made into an herbal tea either via infusion or decoction, these can help induce sleepiness:Chamomile: Either tea bags or grow your own and dry it out. Adding honey or ginger can improve the flavor.

Verbena: Also known as lemon verbena, this herb helps with sleep.

Lemon balm: A lemony member of the mint family that aids sleep.

Passionflower: This herb is a sedative. It can be effective for insomnia and anxiety; follow the instructions provided by the dispenser or packaging. If you have a nervous stomach, try this tea three times a day.

Lime flower: This is also known as linden. Use the dried flowers to make a tea.

, If you're not eating a healthy diet, your nutrition levels might be low. There are a number of vitamins and minerals that are important for a good night's sleep, including vitamin B, calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, and chromium.


Obtaining vitamins and minerals through a healthy diet is always preferable but sometimes supplements are the only way to get enough of a particular nutrient; speak with your doctor for more advice.
In some countries it is possible to take the hormone melatonin, which is thought by some to stimulate sleep during disturbed sleep cycles.However, note that there is little scientific evidence of the benefits to sleep of melatonin supplements thus far, and you will just be inevitably reducing the amount of melatonin that your body produces. This is probably best left to older people, whose melatonin production is in decline."

Generally, that means you need to get at least six hours of sleep a night, but eight hours is usually better. That means you need to make sleep a priority, and pay attention to when you need to go to bed., To sleep your best, you need to sleep in a environment focused on sleep. For instance, a cool room is usually best, along with layers to keep you warm as needed. You can also wear earplugs if your area is noisy.Block out as much light as possible. Light, even ambient light like a bright street light, can affect your sleep.
If you're tossing and turning, consider your bed. Maybe it's time to update it to something more comfortable., Going to bed at the same time every night and getting up at the same time every day tells your body what to expect. You'll start getting sleepy when it's bedtime, and you'll be more likely to fall asleep more easily and sleep better. Sleeping better can sometimes improve sleep paralysis.It can also help to have a sleeping ""cue."" Pick something that relaxes you, such as drinking a cup of (caffeine-free) tea, reading or meditating, and do that every night before bed., While it's important to do certain things before bed to help you sleep, it's also important that you don't do other things. For instance, skip the caffeine and alcohol, as they can both affect your sleep negatively. Also, don't eat a huge amount or smoke right before trying to sleep.Two hours before bed time, start turning off all your screens (such as the television and smartphone), which can affect your sleep. Start winding down and moving towards bed. As you wind down also stop doing any work, which may be too stimulating and interfere with your sleep.

, Sleep paralysis occurs more often when you sleep on your back. This may be due to the tongue falling back into the throat and causing a temporary air blockage. Try sleeping on your side instead to lower the probability that you will have an episode. If you often end up on your back, sew a pocket or pin a sock to the back of your nightshirt and insert a tennis ball or two to break the habit., You don't have to go to the gym. Simply introduce a low-impact exercise regimen to your day. Taking a walk in the morning, for example, is a good idea. Exercising can help you sleep better, but it's important to not exercise too close to bedtime, as it is initially energizing. Get your exercising in at least four hours before bedtime., If you can't sleep, don't just lay there getting upset about it, which will just keep you up longer. Try getting up and doing something you find boring for 20 minutes or so before attempting sleep again.If you're laying there stressing about something on your mind, try spending some time writing your worries down in a journal to get them off your mind.

, Stress interrupts normal sleep cycles, which can greatly contribute to the likelihood of sleep paralysis.Take time each day to reduce your stress by doing activities you find relaxing, such as meditating, listening to music, doing something creative, or playing with a pet.


Also, try to cut stress out of your life where possible. For instance, if you notice feeling anxious or stressed every time you watch the news, try cutting back.

, Even though it may feel terrifying when you are experiencing it, remembering that sleep paralysis won't really result in any harm can be comforting. The main side effects of sleep paralysis are lack of sleep and increased anxiety., You may find that you are able to move smaller areas of your body, such as your toes, fingers, or your tongue. Once you are able to make a small initial movement, you may find that the spell of the paralysis is broken, and you're able to move the rest of your body.Try focusing on your body parts sequentially as in a relaxation routine. Bring your attention to your toes and think about them. Then try to move your toes and move on to your feet, legs and so on.

, Some people intentionally induce a sleep-paralysis state to encourage what they believe to be out-of-body experiences. In turn, imagining yourself moving or projecting movement may be enough to push you out of paralysis., Sleep paralysis can be accompanied by fear or even terror. Other people feel like someone or something menacing is in the room. As you experience these emotions, try to remind yourself that everything is okay. Focus on trying to deepen your breathing, especially if your chest feels weighted or heavy.Fear can be one of the worst aspects of sleep paralysis. Try to remind yourself that the thing you fear has not really happened. Focus on the here and now.

, Often, an episode of sleep paralysis can be broken when you hear a sound or feel someone touch you. Therefore, having a close family member understand that can help if they happen to see you having an episode, which will only work if you are able to open your eyes during paralysis. They can tap you or speak to you to try to arouse you out of the paralysis.If you can, open your eyes so that another person nearby can notice. However, not everyone is able to do it.

, Some people are able to open their eyes and look around. If you can, try to do so. Look back and forth quickly. This small movement helps some people come out of the paralyzed state., Write down as many details of the experience as possible. Include the time, your sleep pattern, sleeping position, your mental/emotional state before and after you were paralyzed, and if you were paralyzed while falling asleep or upon waking up.This information can all be useful, especially if you decide to a see a doctor about the condition.Also track any other sleep problems you notice, such as insomnia, the number of times you wake up in the night, hallucinations upon waking, and/or falling asleep frequently during the day.
Try to notice if anything in particular triggers the paralysis. For instance, you may notice it happens more often when you drank alcohol the night before.

, Narcolepsy can be an underlying cause of sleep paralysis. If you've noticed extreme tiredness during the day, coupled with an inability to stay awake, narcolepsy may be an underlying cause of your disease. Ask your doctor if this could be a possibility.Other symptoms of narcolepsy can include hallucinations when you're falling asleep or waking up and cataplexy, which is sudden muscle weakness often brought on by strong emotions. For example, a large burst of laughter may cause parts of your body to go weak temporarily.

, A sleep study is done in a hospital or other medical facility. Basically, you stay overnight, and you're hooked up to machines to help determine any problems you may be having with sleep. It's one of the tests used to diagnose narcolepsy, for instance., Other diseases can cause sleep paralysis, too. Particularly, anxiety, depression, and PTSD can all cause sleep paralysis to occur. Sometimes, treating these conditions can help with the sleep paralysis, so discuss the possibility with your doctor.It is particularly important to seek a counselor if you believe your sleep paralysis is caused by PTSD.

, Sometimes, your doctor may prescribe an antidepressant to help you regulate your sleep cycle. In turn, that may decrease your instances of sleep paralysis. Many people who have instances of sleep paralysis find they have fewer instances when on an antidepressant."

Keep your bedroom as a sanctuary.,
Eat dinner earlier.,
Don’t workout at night.,
Avoid caffeine late in the day.,
Try not to nap.,
Regulate your sleep cycle.,
Keep your partner on track.,
Visit a doctor.",How to Fall Asleep Fast2," This means keeping it clean, free from junk and distractions, and fresh. Change the sheets weekly, fluff up the pillows daily and try to get at least a little fresh air circulating through it each day. Having your room as a sleep-only area helps enormously. Yes, it is nice having a quiet den where you can do whatever, but having cool and distracting stuff around as you desperately try to catch some 'Z's is disruptive.

, Your body needs time to digest, and does it best when you’re sitting or standing. Laying down as your body processes all the food you’ve eaten will make it difficult to fall asleep quickly. Try eating dinner at least three hours before you go to bed; this will prevent digestion from interfering with your need to sleep.

, Switch any workout routine to the morning; evening workouts can keep you buzzing into the hours when you ought to be soundly asleep. Avoid working out within 4 hours of heading for bed. However, if you don't have a workout routine, make one! Working out does have a huge impact on speed and quality of sleep. It simply must be done at the right times.

, Drinking caffeine later than 8 hours before you go to bed means that the energizing effects are still in-play on your hormones. Stop drinking caffeine by around 2:00 in the afternoon so that your body has plenty of time to process the chemical.

, When you’re totally exhausted and its been a long day, the most appealing thing to do is to take a nap. However, doing so can alter your sleep cycle and make it harder for you to fall asleep at your true bedtime. If you absolutely must take a nap, try to limit it to 20 minutes or less to keep your hormones in line.

, Going to bed and waking up at the same times every day helps your body to know when it should get tired. With a busy work schedule and social life this task can seem difficult, but regulating your sleep schedule will be incredibly beneficial to you and your health in the long run. Make a point to be in bed by the same time every night and set an alarm for the same time every morning. Eventually, you won’t have to keep track of these times anymore and your body will regulate your sleep for you., If you have difficulty falling asleep because of a sleeping partner that you share a bed with, talk to them about your difficulties. If they snore, touch you too much, don’t touch you enough, or any other variety of reasons, try to come up with a reasonable solution so that you can fall asleep fast.

, If you have chronic difficulties falling asleep, you may have clinical insomnia or sleep apnea. If you are concerned about your health as a result of your sleep, visit your doctor or a psychologist and discuss possible tests and options.

Get into a regular sleep routine.,
Avoid using the bedroom for activities other than sleep or sex.Many people have a television in their bedroom, or use their laptop computers, their tablets, or their cellphones in the bedroom prior to falling asleep at night.,
Avoid mentally or emotionally engaging activities right before bed.For instance, avoid having a difficult or frustrating conversation with anybody in person or over the phone or Internet.,
Go to bed immediately when you're feeling drowsy and when you have the need to sleep.Avoid forcing yourself to stay awake.,
Ensure that adequate amounts of darkness are present in your sleeping space.,
Exercise regularly.Exercise will help induce nightly sleep through giving your body a proper workout.,
Avoid drinks and beverages high in sugar and caffeine.Any foods high in sugar will increase your energy levels thus making it difficult to fall asleep naturally.,
Take a hot bath or warm shower before going to bed.,
Seek cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) remedies if you're still experiencing an inability to break from sleeping medication through practical modifications to your lifestyle.",How to Break Away from Sleeping Medication2," When you break away from your sleeping medication, the most important thing you can do for yourself is to set up a healthy, regular sleeping routine. Although you will still likely experience withdrawal symptoms from the medication in the first few weeks, practicing what is called ""sleep hygiene"" can help to counter-balance the withdrawal and to set you up for lasting success with your new sleep pattern.The first step in sleep hygiene is to set a wake-up time that is the same every day. Even on weekends, you should be getting up at the same time that you do on weekdays.
If you find that you are tired, the best strategy is to go to bed earlier rather than changing your wake-up time.
Therefore, if the alarm goes off, make sure you get up; if you remain fatigued throughout the day, you can go to bed earlier and eventually your body will adapt. Try making your bed time earlier in 15-minute increments.
An additional benefit to this strategy is that your body naturally becomes more tired at night. When you know that ""sleeping in"" past your alarm is not an option, you learn to listen to your body as it naturally gets tired in the evening and to use this as your signal of when it is time to go to sleep.

, This is one of the most counter-productive things you can do for your sleep, because the light from the screens (called ""blue"" light) changes the chemistry in your brain and causes you to be more awake and less likely to fall asleep.


Melatonin is the natural chemical produced in your brain that regulates the sleep-wake cycle. It is produced in larger quantities prior to falling asleep. The bright light from computer, television, or cellphone screens counters the effects of melatonin, as the brain's natural production of melatonin is related to the natural light or darkness of the surrounding environment (it is what causes us to feel sleepy when it is dark out).
It is advisable to diminish (or cut out altogether) screen time right before bed.
It is also advisable not to use these devices in the bedroom as psychologically you want your bedroom to be associated with sleep.
If you use your phone as your alarm to wake up, purchase an actual alarm clock so that you are not tempted to spend time on your phone when setting your alarm before bed.

, Also, resist the temptation to start anything that requires fired-up thinking processes, such as trying to solve a work problem at 11pm at night. Your best bet is to leave it until the morning.

, Unfinished chores can be completed the next day after a refreshing night's sleep. Your body breaks away from the natural cycle when its sleepy state is overcome by other distractions, and it can become very difficult to fall asleep again.

, Any light source from the outside creates a distraction and can easily awaken you. Block out these light sources if they create a distraction when you are trying to fall asleep. Heavy curtaining and blankets will do the trick.


The same is true for external noise; do your best to muffle it and consider closing the window to prevent external noises from filtering in. Interestingly, ""white noise"" (such as the sound of a fan or sound machine) can help you fall asleep, because the ambient noise helps mask other sounds, such as car alarms or people moving about the house., Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise five days a week and include one to three days of strength training., Caffeine is also a stimulant that makes sleeping difficult. If you are thirsty, warm milk or plain drinking water is the best option for getting a good night's sleep.


Avoid having caffeine after mid-day. Make all drinks caffeine-free from this point until you awaken the next morning.
Remember that chocolate contains caffeine and sugar, so try to avoid eating it too close to bedtime.

, A hot bath works wonders and is known to relax and soothe tired and aching muscles. A relaxed body is able to sleep better. Add soothing scents such as lavender, neroli, rose, frankincense or sandalwood essential oils to calm the mind.If you plan on washing your hair, allow sufficient time to for your hair to dry. If you have to wait half the night for your hair to dry, you'll add to your sleep deprivation.
Not everyone has or likes a bath. If you'd rather take a shower, don't hesitate; it still works by soothing you with warmth and the relaxing rhythm of the water falling over you. Choose lavender or similar scented shower gels that help to calm you.

, CBT can make a difference in how you view the utility of the pills and can help you to discover your own way of overcoming insomnia."

Determine if it's the right time and place.,
Figure out if he's ticklish.,
Make sure your nails aren't too sharp.,
Sit next to your boyfriend on the couch, bed, or ground.,
Slide your fingers under his arms and wiggle your fingers in his armpits.,
Run your fingers up and down his sides.,
Tickle the bottom of his feet while he's busy defending his upper body.,
Finish by sweetly nuzzling his neck and alternating between giving him little kisses and blowing on the skin.,
Don't tickle for too long and stop if it seems like he's really not enjoying himself.,
Be prepared for retaliation.",How to Tickle Your Boyfriend," Sometimes it can be tricky to know if tickling will be viewed as cute and playful or annoying and inappropriate. Consider your location (if you are in public, he might not appreciate giggling madly in front of a bunch of people), and his current mood.


If you've just been fighting or he's angry, now might not be a good time to poke and prod him.
Listen to what he's saying. If he's confiding in you that he's heartbroken over his dog's death, he probably needs a hug more than he needs tickle torture.
Wait until you're somewhere relatively private and have room to wrestle a little and not injure yourselves.
Make sure he's not holding a hot beverage or something that might injure him or you when you catch him by surprise.
Don't try to tickle him when he's playing video games or absorbed in something that is really important to him (even if you are annoyed that he's not paying attention to you). This is when tickling is just annoying, not fun.
If you two are joking around and he's in a good mood, he probably won't mind a little tickle.;
, Your tickle attack will fail if it turns out your boyfriend isn't even ticklish. Do a little exploring first to figure out where he's most ticklish. The most vulnerable spots on the body are also the most ticklishPoke him in his side, just above his hip or in his ribs and see if he giggles.
Give him a hug and ""accidentally"" tickle his armpit. This is one of the more ticklish spots on most people.
If he's laying down with his shoes off, gently run your toes along the bottom of his feet and notice his reaction.
Kiss him gently on the neck and exhale through your nose so the air hits his ear. See if he gets goosebumps on his neck.

, Sharp nails might be good for tickling if you plan to just graze them over his skin (like on the underside of his feet or the back of his neck). But if you plan to really get into a tickle war, sharp nails may become painful.

, Smile and get close to him, maybe cuddling or kissing him a little so he doesn't suspect anything.

, Move your fingers like you are typing rapidly or as though you are gently scratching a dog behind its ears.


The key is to use a fairly light touch--if you use too much pressure tickling can quickly become unpleasant and even painful.Try and get him to stretch his arms above his head so he is fully exposed for an attack. Stretch first and he may instinctively copy you. Or say something like, ""who wants ice cream?!"" and raise your hand. He'll probably do the same (unless he hates ice cream).
If he's laying down you can straddle him so he can't escape and he's more vulnerable.

, Think of your hands as little crawling, scurrying spiders. He will probably try to stop you by pressing his arms against his sides. People will automatically try to defend themselves by limiting your access to vulnerable areas., His feet will be vulnerable, so grab one foot in one hand and use the other hand to tickle his foot.


Be careful that you don't get kicked. He may begin to jerk his legs away from you and kick you in his struggle to escape.

, This will tickle him, too, but it's a nice way to show him that this was all in fun.

, Some people really hate being tickled and, even though they are laughing, it will make them really angry. If he tells you he's not in the mood, starts yelling, or starts thrashing and kicking, you should stop.


Don't tickle him for more than 15-20 seconds.
If he says he's laughing so hard he's going to pee in his pants, believe him and stop tickling.

, It's unlikely your tickling will go unanswered, so if you are dishing it out, you better be ready to take it. When you stop tickling your boyfriend, pull your arms tightly against your body so he can't access your armpits.

Tickling can be a very flirtatious action, and it's likely that, during or after the struggle, someone will initiate making out or fooling around.

Invite her.,
Get some snacks.,
Pick a film that both of you will like and try not to fight about it.,
Prepare the movie space.,
Wait for her to come, then start the movie!,
Make your move.",How to Watch a Movie at Home with Your Girlfriend (Teens)," Obviously, the first step is simply inviting her to watch a movie with you. Make sure to pick a night when she can come. You can do this in a casual way, such as texting or emailing her, or go romantic and write her an old-fashioned letter. You could also simply ask her. Whatever you feel most comfortable with is usually the best option.;
, Go out and buy some snacks for the two of you to enjoy. Popcorn (see warnings though), chips, and/or candy are a few good choices. If she is on a diet or just would rather eat healthier food, try getting some soda crackers, dried fruit, and/or vegetables that both of you like. Also, if you know of a particular snack she likes, then you should get that too. She'll appreciate the fact that you thought of her. Don't forget the drinks. Pop or juice are good choices, but if she would rather drink something healthier, water is okay. Once again, if she likes a certain drink, make sure to buy that.

, Try to figure out what type of movie she likes. Some girls like chick flicks or romantic comedies, while others will enjoy slasher films and horror movies. Think about who your girlfriend is and which one she'd enjoy more. If you're really stuck, just ask her what movie she'd like to watch. It's better for you to ask her than make her suffer through an hour and a half to two hours of a movie that she hates. Also make sure that you would like the film as well as your girlfriend may sense how much you hate the movie and feel guilty that she is enjoying the date but you aren't and it could ruin the date. When you have decided upon an appropriate movie, then go ahead and rent it or buy it (unless you already own the movie).

, Before she comes over, clean the space where you're going to watch the movie and set it up so that it is appropriate for watching a movie. You need to make sure that there is a comfortable place for you two to sit (a recliner, a couch, etc.). It is also necessary that the place where you sit with your girlfriend is a place where you can be close to her and cuddle up on with her. Have a blanket on just in case either of you get cold, as it gives you optimal snuggle opportunities. Make sure that there is a table of some sort around (either a coffee table or a side table) so that you can put your drinks and snacks on it. Finally, get your parents and siblings out of the room - they can really ruin your evening!

, Let her know where she can get the snacks and drinks and make sure that she has everything she needs before starting the movie. If possible, dim or turn off the lights for a better movie watching experience and a more romantic setting.

, This is your girlfriend, so somewhere during the movie, make a romantic move. Whether this means holding hands with her, wrapping your arm around her, kissing her, or cuddling with, do it! She'll like it, and she'll probably be expecting something anyway. However, don't get too crazy, because keep in mind that your family may be only a few rooms away and your girlfriend may not be ready for anything too major.

Communicate openly about issues and ideas.,
Make eye contact.,
Make listening a priority.,
Give compliments, as long as they are genuine.,
Be there for her when she's upset.",How to Treat a Girl the Way She Should Be Treated1," All good relationships are built on communication, openness, and honesty. Hiding your dreams and passions from her is only going to create a divide between you, making it harder to connect as you drift apart. Bridge this gap by talking openly and often. Share your hopes, fears, and wacky ideas, and she'll feel free to share hers.


This includes ideas that are difficult to talk about. You may think you should ""protect her,"" but she is a smart, capable person just like you. She'll feel more touched that you trusted her than hurt by what you have to say.;
, Eye contact breeds trust, closeness, and love. It shows that you're talking honestly and respectfully, whereas looking away may make you seem untrustworthy. Just as importantly, keep you eyes up and away from her body. You don't want a girl to think you only like her for her body.


If you have trouble making eye-contact, look between her eyes or at her earlobe. If you're a few feet away, most people won't notice that you're not looking at their eyes., 50% of conversation is listening, but people often forget how important it is to shut up from time to time. Ask her questions and listen thoughtfully, nodding along and asking relevant questions when possible. If you've been talking for 2-3 minutes straight, it is time to slow down and ask her a question.Make eye-contact as you listen.
Ask her simple questions like, ""how was your day?"" and ""what do you think of that?""

, If you really like this girl, try unique compliments, such as ""I love your laugh, it brightens up the whole room,"" instead of ""you have beautiful eyes"". Avoid cheesy pick-up lines that she's probably heard before. A compliment only means something if you really mean the compliment.


The more genuine and specific your compliment, the better it will be. Think about what you really love about her and let her know. Don't just spit the lines you've heard in movies., Sometimes she doesn't expect you to offer a solution, but instead wants you to listen to her vent. Treat her with care and compassion when she shares her feelings with you. If she needs time and space, give it to her.


Being supportive is about being there when she needs you. Even if something seems small to you, you need to show her that you care when she's upset.
If she seems upset, but won't talk, don't push her. Just listen. Ask her if there ""is anything on your mind?"" or simply ""how is everything going."" Asking her ""if something is wrong"" implies that there is something bad happening, which can cause her to close up."

Answer thoughtfully.,
Discuss common interests.,
Listen.",How to Talk to a Guy over the Phone," Before calling, think about some topics that you know interest him. Discussing a movie he likes, a sport he plays, or a video game you now he plays are good ways to get him talking and to learn more about him. Maybe you are in class together and you need some help on an assignment. You can write down a list of topics to go through, but don't rely on that too much. You want to make it casual and impromptu.


Ask him things like ""How did baseball practice go last night?"" or ""What are you writing your term paper about?"" to get him talking about things he loves or knows. These are open enough that he can elaborate and will get him talking.
Make sure to focus on a few topics that you know a little bit more about as well. You don't want it to seem fake or rehearsed when you talk about these topics.;
, Once you've planned a few things to say, take a few deep breaths. If you are too jittery or uncomfortable, it is likely that he will feel uncomfortable as well or you could scare him off. Just act natural, be yourself, and remember, he is just a guy.


Make sure you are in a place where you're comfortable and are not likely to get interrupted. You are more likely to be relaxed and confident in your conversation.
It might not just be you that's nervous. If you have been giving hints that you like him, he might be waiting for a more obvious sign that you do in fact like him. Calling him is a good way to get this across., Whether he picks up, someone else picks up, or he isn't there, think about what you are going to say. When he answers the phone, give a casual but excited greeting. Since you've never talked to him on the phone before, make sure you mention who it is, saying something such as ""Hi, this is Mary. How have you been?"". People generally sound different on the phone than they do in real life.If someone other than the guy answers the phone, don't be nervous to ask for him. Just be polite and ask if he is available.
If you get his voicemail, stay calm. Leave a message, letting him know who you are, your number, and that you want him to call you back. If you think your date is silly or fun enough, you can leave a goofy message for him, something along the lines of ""If you can't reach me when you call, I might be out, or I might have gotten abducted by aliens."" It shows that you know what kind of guy he is and that you're not too serious.

, Ask questions that have more than one word answers, such as ""What do you think of the movie you saw last weekend?"" or ""What is the best part of that new game I heard you bought?"". This is the time to use the list of topics you thought about before you called him. Find a way to bring up those topics and then ask him questions about them. This gets him talking about his interests and lets him know you noticed him.Try to avoid questions like ""What's up?"". They are very vague and don't give the conversation anywhere to go. Also avoid asking what his favorite food or color is. These questions are really common and won't make you seem interested or interesting. This is the time to show him how great you are., You don't want to monopolize the conversation, so make sure you listen to him as much as you talk. No one likes it when they spend the entire time on the phone and can't get a word in. Also pay attention when he's answering the questions you ask him. Respond to things he says, giving your input when needed or laughing when he makes a joke or says something funny.


Even if you have something you really want to say, make sure you don't interrupt him. You don't want to seem rude and want to give him plenty of time to get his thoughts out. He would probably love to hear what you have to say, just wait until the right time to give your response., Pay attention to the questions he asks you. Give adequate, lengthy responses that fully answer his questions. If you give clipped, short answers, he might think you aren't interested. You want him to know that you are paying attention and that you want to keep talking. Also try to incorporate some of your interests into your responses, with topic starters like ""I've never played that video game, but I'm really love playing strategy board games."" These give him little hints about you and will help you two get to know one another. Don't overshare. You want to keep some things to talk about at a later time, hopefully when he asks you out on a date. You also want to keep him interested.Try not to sound cocky. You don't want him to think you're arrogant or showing off too much. This could make him think twice about calling you in the future.

, Find a natural place to end the conversation without sounding rude. You can either use a real or fake excuse, but cut off the conversation when it is still going well. This will leave him wanting more and will encourage him to call you next time. Try to say things like ""I had a great time talking to you, but I'm meeting my friends for coffee in half an hour."" This let's him know that you like him but also lets him know you aren't going to be sitting at home waiting by the phone.You don't want to keep him on the phone too long. If either of you are pausing too long or are trying to fill the silence, it means you've probably gone on too long. Try to figure out a way to pick up the conversation before you hang up. You don't want to leave it on a low note.Most guys don't talk on the phone that much, so an extended conversation might not be his thing. You also don't want to run out of things to say., Even if you are dating someone, calling them can still be nerve-racking. Just remember to be calm. Since he is your boyfriend, you don't have to stress as much, even if the relationship is new. You know he likes you and should be happy to talk to you on the phone.


Make sure you're in a comfortable and quiet place. You are more likely to be relaxed and will be able to talk longer without interruption.

, If the last few times you talked were filled with silences, think about things you want to know about you boyfriend before you call him. Is there a game you know he just bought that he's been playing? Ask him if and why he likes it. Try to remember small details that he's brought up when you were last together, such as ""How did that paper turn out that you were working on a few days ago?"" This way, he knows you pay attention to him when you're together and knows you care.


This is especially helpful if you find that you've run out of things to say the last few times you've been together or talked on the phone. This doesn't mean that the relationship isn't working, but it could just mean that you're both shy or that you two don't know each other that well yet.

, Don't wait around for him to call you. Just because he's the guy, that doesn't mean that he is the one initiating everything. Calling him lets him know you're thinking about him, that you care, and that you are still interested in him.


Make sure you don't call him too much. This seems clingy and you don't want to suffocate him. Keep it balanced., Don't be afraid to ask personal or difficult questions. Ask him what his future goals are, what his life's ambition is, or what he is most scared of in the world. Try phrasing it in a way that makes it open ended for him to fill in as much detail as he wants, such as ""I know you're majoring in civics. What would be your dream job?"". This lets him know you care about him on a personal level and that you want to know all the different parts of his personality.Don't ask him where he thinks the relationship is going or other questions dealing with your relationship. This might scare him off or make him uncomfortable.

, Make sure you pay attention to the questions he asks you. Give adequate, lengthy responses that fully answer his questions. If you give clipped, short answers, he might think you're mad at him.Don't overshare. Even though you are trying to get to know each other better, you want to keep some things to talk about at a later time so there is still mystery in your relationship.Try not to sound cocky. You don't want him to think you're arrogant or showing off too much.

, Pick things that you know you both have in common. This way, you both will have something to contribute to the conversation and you can find some common ground. By giving your perspective, you let him know that you have your own mind while still having similar interests to him.Don't bring up topics that you know you disagree on. If he does, don't lie and tell him you agree with him, but steer the conversation back to a safer topic with phrases like ""I don't necessarily agree with that policy, but I do agree with your stance on that new health bill."" You don't want to start a fight or bring unnecessary strife to your phone conversation.

, No matter if you are uninterested in what he's discussing or if he's told a particular story before, listen to what he has to say. When he answers your questions, pick up things to bring up later or use them to get to know him better. Just don't monopolize the conversation. You want him to know that you don't always have to be in control of the conversation.


Don't be afraid of silences. Just because there is a pause in conversation, this doesn't mean that the phone call is going badly. Silences can mean that you're becoming more comfortable with one another and that you just enjoy being in each other's presence."

Lying demonstrates to your girlfriend that you don't trust her with the truth. Getting caught in a lie within the context of a relationship can put tremendous stress on the relationship itself and may even lead to a breakup.


It's also important to remember that, in the long run, telling the truth is easier than lying. Keeping a complex web of lies straight in your head can be incredibly stressful - just one slip of the tongue may ruin you. In the famous words of Mark Twain, ""If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything."";
, Just as you are free to develop your own thoughts and opinions, so is your girlfriend. If your girlfriend and you develop different thoughts and opinions, this is generally OK. Just because your girlfriend has a different opinion than you doesn't necessarily mean that she arrived at that opinion with logic that was faultier than your own. If your girlfriend thinks differently than you in matters of art, politics, or recreation, for instance, the most you can generally do is to listen to her explanation for the way she feels and logically debate her. You may find that your difference of opinion stems from a difference in life experiences; you'll probably find that it's not something to take personally.


There are, however, certain types of disagreements you should take seriously - namely, disagreements about the parameters of your relationship. For instance, if you see your relationship as an exclusive, long-term commitment but your girlfriend is looking for something much more low-key, this is something you'll need to seriously discuss before your relationship can progress.

, One easy, surefire way to demonstrate to your girlfriend that you respect and value them is simply to make it obvious that you're listening when she's speaking. Do this by keeping engaged in the conversation - responding to the things she says with thoughts of your own - and by remembering what she says. Obviously, no one can remember 100% percent of what his or her girlfriend says, so, if you have a hard time remembering things, rather than trying to memorize everything that comes out of your partner's mouth, memorize the big, important things (place of birth, dietary restrictions, middle name, and so on) and make a point to repeat select minor things at later points.


It may seem cynical to purposefully pick things that your girlfriend says to repeat later. Try to adopt a positive outlook when you do this - think of this as making an effort to show you value your partner's thoughts rather than scoring easy points down the road.

, Partners in a romantic relationship shouldn't have to compete for each others' attention. Show that you respect your girlfriend by paying attention to her (with few exceptions) when you're together. For instance, don't allow yourself to become distracted by a television behind her at the restaurant, a video game that you're midway-through when she shows up at your house, or, worst of all, another woman. Basically, spend the time that you're with your partner with your partner.

, Men and boys are taught to act like ""gentlemen"" around their girlfriend from a young age, but the messages they get telling them to do this can be confusing and even contradictory. For instance, a boy's father might chastise him for failing to pull his girlfriend's chair out when she sits down at a restaurant, while she, on the other hand, might find this type of behavior patronizing. The best remedy for these types of confusing situations is to talk frankly with your girlfriend early on in your relationship about which types of traditional ""gentleman"" behavior have a place in your lives and which do not.


It's important to respect your girlfriend's independence by taking her wishes in this area to heart. Don't insist upon opening car doors for her, pulling out her chair, and so on, if she doesn't like it or it makes her uncomfortable. This can create tremendous awkwardness in the long term. A real gentleman knows that actual respect is far more important than archaic displays of etiquette.

, Having different ideas about the types of behaviors that are and aren't appropriate ways to express affection is a great way to run into conflict with your partner. For instance, if you love to make out with your girlfriend in semi-public places like movie theaters, but she's naturally shy about such things, you absolutely should not ignore her feelings. Respecting your partner sometimes means refraining from doing things that you want to do but she does not - basically, making small sacrifices.


Consider the reverse of the scenario above - would you want someone to kiss you if you knew that you didn't want him or her to? Of course not. Putting yourself in your partner's shoes like this can help you understand how actions that might seem minor to you can be very big deals to others.

, One way of showing how much you respect your girlfriend is to be unafraid about the things you can express to her. This isn't to say that you should make a point to reveal deeply personal information early on in your relationship. Rather, it means that you should be open to her. Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel - even if it's a bad feeling.


Paradoxically, this can also mean being fearless about expressing your inner fears. You can (and should) occasionally talk to your girlfriend about deep-seated sources of worry - for instance, your performance at school or work, stressful relationships with your parents, and so on.

, Like the vast majority of human beings, most girls won't want to ask to be treated well - they'll want you to spontaneously treat them well. If your girlfriend constantly has to ask for the things she likes in your relationship - like for you to hold her hand, listen when she talks, remember her birthday, and so on - these special things are robbed of the joy they might otherwise bring. This can even make her feel isolated or needy. So try to stay on the ball - make an effort to treat your girlfriend with respect without her having to ask you.

, It's hard to be a steady presence in your girlfriend's life (and vice versa) if you rarely talk to her. Though every couple will have a different natural ""rhythm"" of communication, generally, you should try to meet, call, or, at the very least, text your girlfriend once or twice a week, if not more. This should stem from a natural urge to want to know what she's been up to - what minor accomplishments she's made in the last few days, what challenges she's faced, and so on.


Be sure to contact your girlfriend on your own - don't just respond to her calls and texts. Taking the initiative to make that crucial first contact with your girlfriend demonstrates that you want her as much as she wants you.

, Nothing is less romantic than a man who loses sight of what's really important in life in favor of his money or possessions. Your girlfriend should always take precedence over material pleasures. For instance, don't skip your anniversary dinner to wax your new car. Don't neglect your girlfriend for weeks to play an addictive video game. Don't devote your every waking hour to your work. Keep your life in perspective - genuine love is a longer-lasting source of joy than any material gains you can ever hope to make.


This being said, a good girlfriend will never willingly ask you to do things that are bad for your financial health. Though the mythical ""gold-digger"" is much rarer in real life than popular culture may lead you to believe, beware of women that pressure you into buying expensive gifts.

, It's normal for a man to show he cares for his girlfriend by celebrating birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, and so on with her. It's exceptional for him to show that he cares on the days between these big events. Take your girlfriend by surprise. Celebrate your relationship for no other reason than that you cherish it. This doesn't necessarily have to mean booking a fancy, expensive night out - a simple love note, a rose, a sweet text message, and other things like this can let her know that you are thinking of her and care for her.

, One of the goals of any good relationship should be for both partners to reach the point where neither has to put on a ""nice"" front for the other. Within the context of your relationship, you should be able to truly be ""you"" and not one of the characters you adopt for work, school, etc. This won't happen overnight, but it is something that has to happen for a great relationship to develop.


Sometimes this may mean being truthful about negative emotions that, for whatever reason, you can't express during your daily life. Be honest and open about these emotions - they're part of the real you - but don't let them become the only topic of conversation in your relationship.

, This goes far beyond everyday compliments, which can become rote and dull if you repeat them too often. Instead, when you want to make your girlfriend feel amazing, be specific, drawing examples from your personal history and attempting to genuinely express your inner thoughts. Also, try to adjust the ""sappiness"" of your comments to a level that you know your girlfriend is comfortable with. Finally, choose especially poignant opportunities to make these types of comments - no matter how good you are with words, you can cheapen your thoughts by repeating them incessantly.


For example, if you know your girlfriend is comfortable with a little sappiness in your expressions of verbal affection, rather than saying, ""Hey, nice dress"", you might say, ""I like your dress. It reminds me of that dress you wore when we first met."" This is much sweeter and has the added benefit of showing that you remember a small deal from early in your relationship.

, While most girls (like most guys) will appreciate a classic dinner/movie night out, there's no need to pigeonhole yourselves as a couple by sticking to traditional date possibilities. Be creative - take your girlfriend to do things she'd never thought she'd do before. Going outside of your comfort zone can be a great opportunity to bond as a couple. As an added bonus, non-traditional date ideas can be a great way to save money if you're young.


One great date idea is to surprise your girlfriend by taking her to do an activity that she's casually expressed an interest in during conversation. For instance, if she's previously talked about how cool she thinks aquatic animals are, you might consider taking her to a SCUBA diving class. Similarly, if she loves art, you might want take her on a hike into some scenic woods with an easel and paint to make your own together.

, Your big night out is no time to be distracted by other people or commitments. Put everything else aside for a few hours. Clear your mind of any upcoming projects that will require your attention and tune in your girlfriend and the relationship you share with her.


Be sure to turn off your phone, pager, laptop, and/or any other distracting devices. Nothing ruins a great moment like having to take a business call in the middle of your candlelit dinner.

, That age-old question - whether a man should or shouldn't pay for his girlfriend on their night out - is more relevant today than ever before, as it's become accepted (and even expected) that a woman may pay instead. There's no right answer to this question - the specifics of who pays for what in your relationship are up to you and your girlfriend to discuss. Generally, if you're responsible for planning the night, it's recommended that you at least make a genuine effort to pay. Do so to demonstrate how important your girlfriend is to you, not out of an old-fashioned conception of gender norms.


If your girlfriend insists that she should pay or that you should split the bill, you may want to put up a token resistance to show that you're genuine, but don't seriously fight her on the issue. Some women can feel patronized if their man constantly pays for them while they're out together, so show that you value her as an equal partner in your relationship by allowing her to pay.

, Your special night is a great opportunity for expressing the sorts of naked, passionate emotions that don't ordinarily get voiced. Feel free to be as sappy and passionate as you like, but keep your compliments focused on things like your girlfriend's personality, her sense of humor, the way she makes you feel, and her aesthetic beauty, rather than her sexiness or her figure. There will eventually be time for these things, too, but don't cheapen your special moment by bringing them up in a ""serious"" romantic context.

, Your girlfriend is undoubtedly important to you, so let her know that this the case. If you do nothing else on your night out, tell (and show) your girlfriend that she really, really means a lot to you. Everything else - the fun you have, the adventures you go on, the time you spend together - is just a way of expressing this truth.


The best, sweetest way to tell your girlfriend that she's important to you is almost always to just be completely frank about it. Flowery, elegant language is no substitute for genuine emotion - almost all girlfriends will be able to tell when you're being yourself and when you're not.

Surprise her with occasional, spontaneous displays of affection.,
Text, call, or reach out once a day.,
Make small, daily interactions into ""mini-dates"" from time to time.,
Take her on dates.,
Remember and celebrate the special days, like birthdays and anniversaries.",How to Treat a Girl the Way She Should Be Treated2," Quickly kiss her cheek, grab and squeeze her hand, or whisper something kind in her ear. Gauge how she responds. Every girl is different, and some will like more obvious affections (like a kiss in public) more than others. Some ideas include:


Pull her into you, lean in and kiss her. Let her do the same. When it comes to kissing, don't always take charge.
Hug her from behind and kiss her on the cheek as a surprise ""Hello.""
Cuddle with her when you lay down or sit together. Put an arm around her shoulder or kiss her shoulder.
Hold her from behind and rest your neck on her shoulder.

, It doesn't have to be a big conversation every time. Simply showing her that you think about her is enough. Send her a link to a new recipe to try together, a potential date, or a funny picture. Ask her how she's doing. Let her know what you're up to, or something interesting that happened to you. Even a quick Snapchat or two shows that she's on your mind, and that you don't just ignore her when she's not around.

, Take her on a moonlit walk, or out to get a cone of ice cream. Grab some nice take-out and a good movie for a surprise night in, cook her a meal before she gets home, or just ask her to come eat lunch on a park bench instead of in the cafeteria or break room. These little acts of kindness show that you are thinking of her and are willing to go out of the way, just a little bit, to keep her happy.

, Going on dates isn't just about spending money, it is about carving out time to be alone together. A great date is just a chance to enjoy each other's company, learning more about each other and exploring the world together. Movies, concerts, and dinners are all classic dates, but they are not the only things you can do. Think about her passions and interests and find dates that she might enjoy.


Head to the local SPCA and play with some animals for a cuddly free date idea.
Go out for a hike or walk in the local park and pack a picnic dinner or lunch for the ending.
Check your local paper for events, from street festivals to outdoor music and theater.

, Take initiative on the big days and plan a surprise, even if it is something small like flowers or breakfast in bed. Having the foresight to celebrate these little milestones will make her feel special and show her that you value the relationship as much as she.


Occasionally, have a little fun by celebrating a goofy holiday or anniversary, like the first time you cooked together or National Talk Like a Pirate Day."
"
Act chivalrously, remembering your manners.,
Don't talk about a girl's body parts with her or your friends.,
Don't treat her like one of your guy friends.,
Spend most of your time with her when in groups and parties.,
Never force a girl to do things with you.,
Be respectful to your girl when talking to friends.",How to Treat a Girl the Way She Should Be Treated3," Most boys forget about opening doors, letting the girl walk first, etc, believing that the behaviors are ""old-fashioned."" But nothing makes a girl notice you more than if you hold the door for her, help her with her books, or pull her chair out for her. Channel your inner gentleman. This isn't about patronizing her or acting like she isn't independent, it's about taking the time to be kind and thoughtful.


Offer her your arm when she's in heels, or hold hands through busy crowds.
Let her go first through doors, down the street, and into the car.
Offer her your seat, especially when they are limited (like on the bus).
Avoid showing off or talking about yourself., Don't talk about other girls' booties or how big their boobs are. It shows you are disrespectful and may only see women sexually. This includes talking about your own girl's assets. While some girls don't mind the occasional compliment about it, over-emphasizing their physical attributes makes you seem uncreative and single-minded.


Try not to use words like ""hot"" or ""sexy."" Instead, try ""gorgeous"" or ""beautiful,"" which are a little gentler and apply to more than just her breasts and butt.

, Be nice, kind, and generous. Avoid bodily noises. Don't be obnoxious, putting on your music, your movies, and your shows all the time. Show her that you have been raised well and been taught to treat women with respect, which is really attractive.


It is perfectly okay to have things you talk about with the boys but not your girl. You don't ever need to lie to her, you just don't have to bring up certain things. Some topics, like the new Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition, are meant to stay between the guys., This doesn't mean you need to be joined at the hip. Spend time with your own friends as well, but check in with each other regularly to make sure she's not alone in the corner.

, Show her you care by kissing her all over (forehead, hand, ear) and making her feel like she's special every day. However, you each need to respect each other's boundaries. If something makes her feel uncomfortable, you need to pull back. She has the right to determine what she wants to do, and trying to pressure her into something is rude, disrespectful, and wrong.


During a quiet, calm moment, ask her about her sexual preferences and desires casually. Don't have this conversation in the heat of the moment, but some other time, where the talk can be cool and casual.

, How you talk about your girl to your friends will tell them how it is okay to talk about her to you. If you are disrespectful, cracking jokes and sharing secrets, they will feel like they can do the same thing. Remember that the things you and your girlfriend do together are personal and should not be talked about with your pals.


Don't treat her any differently in public than you do in private. Living a dual life is not only hard, it's unsustainable. Treat her with the love and respect she deserves both at home and in the wider world."

Recognize physical signs.,
Recognize the onset of emotional signs.,
Count to ten.,
Breathe deeply.,
Get a change of scenery.,
Try thinking of something humorous.,
Let people know that you are tired.,
Avoid situations that make you angry.,
Take a rest.",How to Control Your Temper While Sleep Deprived1," Anger can make you feel certain physical symptoms. No matter what the stress is, our bodies will automatically be ready to meet a threat. When the body is in stress mode, it goes into a fight-or-flight response that causes physical symptoms. These can include:


Tense muscles and clenched jaw
Your head or stomach hurts
Your heart is racing
You feel sweaty
Your face flushes
Your body or hands shake
You feel dizzy;
, Anger is often accompanied by a flood of other emotions. After all, the amygdala, the center for emotions, is pumping out signals with all its might to meet a threat and ensure your survival. So it’s not surprising that you can get a flood of other related emotions. These emotions are capable of sounding the alarms for the fight and flight response. Along with anger, you might feel:


Irritation
Sadness
Depression
Guilt
Resentment
Anxiousness
Defensiveness

, If you feel yourself getting angry and are experiencing physical or emotional symptoms of anger, you can tell yourself that you don’t have to react right away. Counting can help you put off your feelings for the moment. It might feel a bit silly at first, but counting really can distract your long enough to calm down. Give yourself time to sort out your feelings., Taking deep breaths can restore oxygen to your brain and calm the stress response that you’re experiencing.


Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Make sure you are breathing with your diaphragm rather than with your chest. When you breathe with your diaphragm, your belly extends out (you can feel it with your hand).
Do this as many times as necessary until you start feeling calmer.

, If you feel your blood start to boil, take yourself out of the immediate environment. Take a walk. Deep breathe. If you are able to remove yourself from the situation, do it. Not having the stimulus in front of you, the thing or person you are mad at, will help you calm yourself down.If you can’t leave, then try turning your back for a few minutes and closing your eyes.

, If you can get yourself laughing, you can change the chemical reaction in your body. You can use your brain and imagination to create all sorts of ridiculous situations that can get you laughing, especially if it isn’t mean-spirited or sarcastic humor., When you are tired and in a bad mood, you can lose your temper more quickly. Let people know that you’d appreciate if they would give you a wide birth today.

, If you are already feeling short-tempered, don’t put yourself in a situation that will undoubtedly bring out your temper in full force. If you get angry about the morning traffic, try working from home or taking public transit. If you know your child will only eat cheese sandwiches, don’t fight over feeding him vegetables today.

, If you are able to, taking a short rest will help restore balance to your mood. Even getting a 30-minute catnap will help you feel more alert and less prone to temper flares."

Track your sleep symptoms.,
Keep track of your sleep patterns.,
Ask your sleep partner if you snore in your sleep.,
Visit a sleep lab.,
Talk with your doctor about possible causes.,
Look at external factors and habits.",How to Control Your Temper While Sleep Deprived2," If you have a sleep disorder such as sleep deprivation, you may experience certain symptoms. If you experience any of these signs for three or more nights per week, you should talk with your doctor:You have trouble falling asleep at night (it may take you 30 minutes or more).
You wake up during the night frequently and can’t get back to sleep.
You wake up too early in the morning.
You don’t feel well rested in the morning, no matter how much sleep you get.
You feel sleepy during the day.
You fall asleep unexpectedly during the day.
You snore or snort in your sleep, your breathing stops for short periods of time, or your body jerks when you’re sleeping.
You have tingly or creeping feelings in your legs in the evenings before bed that go away if you massage them.
Your muscles feel suddenly weak when you are angry, fearful or laughing.
You feel like you can’t move when you wake up.
You always need caffeine to wake up and to stay awake during the day.

, Write down when you go to sleep and when you get up. Make note in the morning if you were awake during the night. Keep track for at a couple of weeks so that you can see your sleep patterns.Also track how you feel in the morning when you wake up (Do you feel rested? Sleepy? Groggy?). Track how you feel throughout the day.

, Take note of other things that happen in your sleep, such as snoring, snorting, gasping, or making involuntary movements. If you don’t have a sleep partner, you might consider videotaping yourself sleep for a couple of nights so that you can see if there is anything else going on., You can also go to a sleep lab, which will monitor your sleep cycle overnight. You will have electrodes or other monitors attached to your scalp, face, chest, limbs and fingers. Your breathing, oxygen levels and heart rate will be tracked during the sleep test., Many cases of sleep deprivation are caused by certain issues. These can include aging, pregnancy, menopause, psychiatric disorders (for example, schizophrenia and depression), or chronic illnesses (for example, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis).


Talk with your doctor if you are concerned about these conditions.

, Your sleep can be interrupted because of various external factors that may be difficult to control. These might be: having a newborn infant, stress, drinking caffeine late in the day, exercising in the evening,and so on.

Rate your anger.,
Keep an anger journal.,
Identify your anger triggers.,
Understand the possible effects of sleep deprivation.",How to Control Your Temper While Sleep Deprived3," Rating your anger can help you realize what type of events make you angry and the degree they make you angry. Some events might cause mild irritation, while others might trigger you wanting to blow your top. You don’t really need an official anger scale. You can make your own, for instance, on a scale of one to ten, or zero to one hundred. You can use what works with you.

, Your anger journal will help you keep track of what events anger you. You can also track the degree to which they anger you, as well as the surrounding events that preceded your anger or occurred during your anger. Monitor how you react when you’re angry, along with other people’s reactions to you. When you record in your journal, you can make the following observations:


What provoked the anger?
Rate your anger.
What thoughts occurred as you got angry?
How did you react? How did others react to you?
What was your mood right before it happened?
What symptoms of anger did you feel in your body?
Did you want to leave, or did you want to act out, such as bang the door or hit something or someone, or did you say something sarcastic?
What were your emotions immediately after the incident?
What were your feelings a few hours after the episode?
Was the episode resolved?
Keeping track of this information will help you learn what situations and triggers you are sensitive to. Then you can avoid those situations when possible, or predict when these situations occur if they are unavoidable.

, A trigger is something that happens or that you experience that brings on an emotion or a memory. Some common triggers for anger are:


Not being able to control other’s actions
Having other people fail to meet your expectations.
Not being able to control daily events, such as traffic.
Someone trying to manipulate you.
Getting mad at yourself for a mistake.

, Sleep deprivation can mount up over a series of poor nights of sleep or can be caused by not getting sleep for one night. Your metabolism, age, personal willpower and other personal makeup will all determine how you respond to sleep deprivation. The following effects can all contribute to your difficulty in keeping your temper in check:Increased susceptibility to accidents (due to poor coordination and sleepiness)
Increased susceptibility to colds
Rapid aging
Emotional problems (loss of control, anxiety, panic, depression)
Irritability, moodiness, reduced ability to cope with stress
Poor judgment skills, poor concentration, and inability to make decisions
Long-term effects of sleep deprivation may include obesity, heart disease, or diabetes.

Communicate assertively.,
Be respectful.,
Make your communications clear.,
Express your feelings.",How to Control Your Temper While Sleep Deprived4," There are three styles of expressing anger. Two expression styles, “passive” and “aggressive,” are not healthy ways to express your anger. The third style, “assertive,” is the most constructive way to express your anger.Assertive communication emphasizes that both people’s needs are important. To communicate assertively, give the facts without making accusations. Here is an example:


“I was hurt and angry because it seems like you were belittling my project when you laughed during my presentation. I don’t know what was going on, but it seems like you weren’t paying attention or taking my hard work seriously. I could have just misunderstood what was going on. Can we talk and work this out?”

, Your communications should convey requests rather than demands. In order to get respect, you have to give it. Then you will foster cooperation and reciprocal respect. This is the opposite of what happens with anger. Aggressive, passive, or passive-aggressive communications put you at odds with others.Respectful communications might include:


“When you have the time, could you…”
“It would be a great help if you… Thanks, I appreciate it!”

, If you hem and haw, or you make general statements that are not specific, it can only mean frustration for everyone involved. When you communicate assertively, you should directly address the person with whom you need to resolve your issue. Make it clear what you would like to see happen. Don’t forget to put this communication in the form of a request.


For instance, if your coworker is speaking loudly on the phone and it’s difficult for you to do your work, you can state your request like this: “I have a request. Would you please lower the volume of your voice on the telephone? It’s making it very difficult to concentrate on my work. I’d really appreciate it. Thanks.” , When you figure out how you’re feeling, convey the real feeling, like hurt, and keep judgment statements out of it. Instead of saying, “I feel that you are an insensitive bore,” stick to things that pertain to you. For example, you can say, “I feel that you are not being sensitive to my feelings when you read your paper instead of listen to what I’m trying to say.”

Have good sleep habits.,
Build up extra sleep.,
Try meditation.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Get regular exercise.,
Take an anger management class.,
Try therapy.",How to Control Your Temper While Sleep Deprived5," When you are sleep deprived, your emotions are harder to control. One study showed that with only a few nights of disrupted sleep for teenage girls, their negative feelings increased as well as their anger.Getting a good night’s sleep helps people regulate their emotions.


Try to go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time each morning. Your body will benefit from a regular sleep schedule.
Turn off all screens (TV, phone, computer) at least a half-hour before you go to bed. Studies show that your brain is cognitively stimulated by electronic screens, which can interrupt good sleep.If you have trouble getting solid sleep, talk with your doctor to see if there are other strategies you can try.

, If you know you are going into a situation where you won’t get a lot of sleep, try to get extra sleep beforehand. You may be able to counteract some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation, like moodiness., Meditation has been shown to be effective in emotional regulation.This relaxation practice has been shown to have a longer lasting effect on the amygdala, the center for emotion and the part of the brain where the stress response begins after a stressful or threatening event has been perceived.Start with deep breathing exercises. Find a quiet place to sit. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four. Make sure you are breathing with your diaphragm rather than with your chest. When you breathe with your diaphragm, your belly extends out (you can feel it with your hand). Do this as many times as necessary until you start feeling calmer.
If you feel like you have trouble meditating, don’t worry. Meditation is a combination of deep breathing exercises, visualization, and performing mental tasks, but if you feel like it’s difficult for you to sit long enough to meditate or if you feel uncomfortable meditating, you can just begin with simply deep breathing, and you can initiate your body’s calming response.
When you are calm, practicing meditation will help you process your emotions in a healthier way. You can combine breathing with visualization tasks. A simple way to do this is when you breathe in, envision a golden-white light that relaxes you and makes you feel happy. Envision this white light spreading into your lungs and throughout your entire body. When you breathe out, breathe out muddy, dark colors which represent your angry, stressed out feelings.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is the process of tensing and relaxing your entire body in progressive stages. It is thought that by tensing your muscles yourself, it will help release pent-up tension in your body.Here is an overview of this method:


Start with a few deep breaths. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for four.
Start with the muscles in your head and face. Tighten as many muscles as you can in your face, head, mouth, and neck, and hold for twenty seconds, then release.
Work your way down the body, tensing and releasing your shoulders, arms, back, hands, stomach, legs, feet, and toes.
Now wiggle your toes around, feeling the relaxation from your toes to your head.
Take a few more deep breaths, and enjoy the feeling of relaxation.

, Exercise can help dissipate anger. For adults and children, research shows that exercise helps with mood regulation and controlling emotions., Try going out and exercising when you’re in a mad moment, or use it daily to release aggression.


Exercise will also help you sleep better.

, Anger management programs have been shown to have a high rate of success.The most successful programs help you understand your anger, give you short-term strategies to deal with your anger, and help you build skills.


There are a wide variety of types of anger management programs.For example, there are anger management programs available for teens, executives, police officers, and other populations of people who might be experiencing different types of anger for different reasons.

, If you feel like you are unable to get control over your temper, you may want to try therapy as a way to deal with your anger.Your therapist will most likely use relaxation techniques to help you calm down in the middle of an anger episode. Your therapist will also help you deal with the thoughts that can trigger anger and find new ways to view your situations.


Talk to your therapist about emotional coping skills and assertiveness communication training.

Examine if you want to see her happy.,
Be certain about your decision.",How to Tell a Girl You Love Her (Teenagers)," Saying “I love you” for the first time is really scary. If you’re nervous, planning what you are going to say can boost your confidence. Think about what you want her to know—will you just say, “I love you,” or will you provide her with reasons why you love her? Will you tell her when you fell in love with her? Do you want her to know how special she is to you? Are you going to say “I love you” with a grand, romantic gesture? Once you know what you want to say, rehearse your declaration of love. When it’s time to tell her how you feel, you’ll be prepared and confident., Telling someone you love them is a personal, special affair. You want the moment to be perfect. Pick a location that is private, perhaps even meaningful to your relationship, and a time that is appropriate.


Don't express your love for her in the middle of class.
If you are with a group of people, pull her aside.
You can plan a special date for the occasion. Take her on a walk or a picnic. Tell her during a dinner you prepared for her., In addition to preparing what you will say, you should also prepare for her response to those three little words. Ideally, she will say, “I love you too!” However, she may not feel the same way about you.


She might ignore your comment or divert the conversation to a new topic. If this happens, do not ask her, “well, do you love me too?” If she had wanted to respond, she would have. Instead be prepared to give her some time and space to digest what you said. Try to go on with the date as normal.
Prepare yourself for the chance that her response will be, “I don’t love you” or “I don’t feel that way yet.” Although this is not the response you were hoping for, it is important that you remain calm and mature. Have a positive, kind response prepared—your maturity just might impress her.,


Tell her when you fell in love with her and or why you love her., In addition to telling her “I love you,” you can also show her how much you care. Always treat her with respect and kindness—don’t mistreat her or abuse her trust. Go out of your way to make her happy—if she’s having a rough day, bring her flowers to cheer her up. Stand up for her—when someone bullies her, shut down their negative behavior. Support her—attend all of her sporting events, write her notes of encouragement, and help her meet her goals.

, While some people prefer to say, “I love you,” others have an easier time expressing themselves through writing—everyone loves a good love note! Write a heart-felt love letter or a sincere poem. When the moment feels right, hand her the note in passing, give it to her with a small gift, or slip it in her hand at the end of the date.Don't text or private message her, ""I love you.""

, After she has heard or read those three little words, give her a moment to process and react. Don’t press her for an immediate response. Don’t tell her how you thought she would feel or react. When she is ready to respond, give her your complete attention. Listen to what she has to say and react accordingly. Hopefully she will return the sentiment and say, “I love you too!”, When you are in love with a girl, you are willing to do anything that makes her like you and notice you. You may try to impress her by taking risks or going above and beyond to help others. You may also try to impress her with your ability to play an instrument or play a sport. If your actions are now driven by the ulterior motive of catching her attention, you may truly love her., When you love a girl, it is very common to think about her constantly. Do you find that your mind unexpectedly wanders to thoughts of her throughout the day? Have you stopped to wonder if she is thinking about you too? If she is constantly on your mind, you may love her., When you fall in love with a girl, you may have a strong desire to become the man you feel she deserves. You may feel the need to improve your grades or behavior at school. You may start working out or attending a religious service. If you are willing to make an effort to improve yourself on her behalf, you may be in love with an incredible girl., As you fall in love with a girl, you may make it your priority to make her happy. In order to ease her stress during exam week, you may volunteer to help her study, revise her paper, or complete her chores. When she becomes sick, you may insist on taking care of her and getting whatever she needs. When she is having a rough day, you may go out of your way to make her laugh and smile so she forgets about her troubles. If you are devoting time and energy to making her happy, you may love her., The three little words, “I love you,” pack a huge meaning. Once you express your love, the nature of your relationship with this girl will change for better or for worse. Prior to making this declaration, ask yourself the following questions:


Are you truly in love with her?
Does she share your understanding of the word “love?”
Are you telling her “I love you” in the hopes that you will get something in return."

Prioritize your relationship.,
Make positive changes.,
Make spending time a weekly goal.,
Stick to your new schedule.,
Clear it with your parents.",How to Spend Quality Time with Your Boyfriend or Girlfriend1," The first step toward spending quality time with your significant other is to make your relationship a top priority. A feeling of closeness is one of the most important “ingredients” for a healthy relationship, which you can only find if you spend quality time together.If your girlfriend or boyfriend is, say, number 5 on your list of daily activities, that relationship probably won’t go very far.
If you do find that your relationship is a low priority to you, simply apologize to your girlfriend or boyfriend and start making changes.
If you feel like your relationship is a low priority to your boyfriend or girlfriend, you need to discuss this.;
, If your relationship has not been a high priority, it’s time to make positive changes. Adopt a mindset like the one we all get about New Year’s resolutions. Make sure that you start small and choose only one behavior to change at a time.Choosing only one behavior makes it manageable and prevents you from getting overwhelmed.
Once you have made one positive behavior a habit, you can move on to the next one. Your relationship will slowly but surely rise to the top of your priorities.
Apologize for not making the relationship a priority if it's your fault.

, One positive change that shows your girlfriend or boyfriend that you are starting to prioritize your relationship is making it a weekly goal to spend time with him or her. One way to do this is to choose one night per week as date night.


Pick a night that rarely has other commitments so that you aren’t tempted to cancel plans with your partner, or a night that your partner isn’t usually busy.

, Once you make a plan to spend one night (or day) a week with your boyfriend or girlfriend, stick to it. Don’t ever make plans on that night. Sticking to your promise each week will build trust in your partner.


You will probably find that spending consistent time with your boyfriend or girlfriend makes the relationship a priority in your mind without you even realizing it.

, If you’re a teenager still living at home, you need to inform them of your relationship and your intention to spend quality time with your boyfriend or girlfriend. Ask their permission to spend this time with him or her.


They may say no sometimes because they want you to focus on schoolwork. Tell them that this is understandable but that you would like a balance between school work and your relationship.
If they don’t agree with your relationship, this is another issue and you need to tell your boyfriend or girlfriend. If your parents won’t let you, you will either have to break up or wait until there is no school to spend time together.

"
Make sure your time is ""quality."",
Look at your partner when talking.,
Avoid staring at the TV.,
Give undivided attention.,
Listen attentively.,
Take turns.",How to Spend Quality Time with Your Boyfriend or Girlfriend2," In the method below this one, we talk about doing activities that make it easier to spend quality time. But in order to do that, you need to know what makes a date a ""quality"" one. Quality time is defined as ""time spent giving all of one's attention to someone who is close.""You know you're spending quality time with your boyfriend or girlfriend when you give them all of your attention.

, Making eye contact does a lot of things for human beings, including showing that you are listening. If you want to spend quality time with your partner—not just time, but quality time—then look them in the eyes.


Eye contact makes people feel like you are more “believable and earnest.”Looking at someone for long periods of time, also known as gazing, communicates that you value the other person and that the relationship more than the words you are saying to each other., One way to make sure your partner feels that they are more important to you than anything else is to spend time talking with them rather than staring at a screen.


That’s not to say that you can’t watch a movie or TV together. But screen-watching has its place, and if you are trying to spend quality time with someone, a movie or show is not the time to do it.

, If you don’t spend quality time together, your bond will eventually fade away. Quality time is a way to strengthen this bond.When you’re spending time together, show you care by giving your undivided attention.


That means doing things like putting away your phone, turning off the TV, and doing something together that forces you to look at the other person without distractions.
Giving undivided attention shows that the relationship is important to you., Listening also shows that a relationship is important to you. If you aren’t a good listener, learn to be a good listener by doing things like fully focusing on your partner, avoiding interruptions, and showing interest in the conversation.Show your desire to make the relationship stronger by listening well all the time, not just when you feel like it.
Show that you are listening by offering feedback after your partner is done talking.

, Another way to make your quality time have meaning is allowing the other person to talk just as much as you do. Or if you’re the quiet one, learn how to share your thoughts and feelings even it’s not something you like to do.

Decide to plan activities together.,
Choose inexpensive dates.,
Enjoy the scenery.,
Look up local activities online.,
Play a sport.,
Work out together.,
Volunteer to serve.,
Cook a meal.",How to Spend Quality Time with Your Boyfriend or Girlfriend3," In order to create moments in which you can spend quality time with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you need to plan activities. The best activities are ones that either you or your partner enjoys. If you’re doing the planning, pick something the other person would want to do.


If at least one person enjoys an activity, they will feel like you are paying attention to them, which is key for spending quality time together., Even if you are having a conflict with your boyfriend or girlfriend, a fun activity can keep you from getting so mad that you walk away.If you plan together, you’ll both have a voice about where you go, making each other feel important.

, In order to sustain a weekly dating routine, you should pick activities that are not expensive. There are many things you can do that are free, from walking in the park to attending street festivals to just window shopping at the mall.

, Every community has (or is a short drive away from) walking trails, parks, and other forms of beautiful scenery. Taking this in with your boyfriend or girlfriend is an inexpensive and memorable way to spend time together.

, Your city will often put on free festivals, outdoor concerts, or other activities throughout the year. This is a great way to spend quality time together.


If there is an admission fee, many times it may be waived if you offer to volunteer at the event. You may have to go to the event coordinators and ask about volunteering., Doing physical activity together helps you to laugh and have fun, which is important for any relationship. Laughing together helps you to see the world as less serious, and difficult situations as less daunting., Setting a fitness goal together and then pursuing it side by side will actually help you stay together. Studies show that working out as a couple has many benefits to the relationship.Couples who work out in tandem experience something called “nonverbal mimicry” if they exercise side by side, which creates a closer bond and more emotional intimacy.Working out together enhances physical attraction, improving your physical relationship., Find a homeless shelter, animal shelter, or even go online and look at a volunteer agency in your community. Volunteering together improves the connection between couples., Cooking together can be one of the most intimate and rewarding activities a couple can experience.You can even make a dish with aphrodisiac properties to help enhance your physical relationship.Such foods include honey, chocolate, saffron, avocado, and almonds."

Approach her in person.,
Text her.,
Contact her on social media.,
Call her.,
Re-introduce yourself.,
Use humor.,
Ask her how she is doing.,
Pretend contacting her is a mistake.,
Invite her to an event.,
Ask if she wants to join you for something simple.,
Leave her alone if she isn’t receptive to you.",How to Talk to a Girl That You Haven't Spoken to in a While," If you happen to run into her in a public setting, you can choose to simply walk up to her and start talking to her. This by far the most direct approach, and might take some guts. However, you can definitely do it and pull it off with a little luck. When you approach her:


Stand straight with good posture.
Don’t act like you’re nervous or uncomfortable.
Smile.
Make sure your clothes look nice.
Act relaxed – as if you have plenty of time.;
, Texting is great because it won’t really be in her face. Ultimately, she’ll see the text and then be able to respond (if she wants to) on her own time. However, when texting her, remember to keep it short. In addition, don’t ask to hang out with her right away. Instead, engage in some light banter, joke with her, and ask her how she’s doing.


You could start off texting her something simple like ""Hey! Long time, no talk."" She might respond she doesn't know who you are, and then you can take the conversation from there. If she does know who you are, ask her how she's doing.
Consider texting her about something you think she finds interesting. For example, if she's really into politics, say you were watching the latest election results and thought of her., There are many ways to contact her on social media. You could send a message (keep it short), like one of her posts (on Facebook), or simply comment on something she posts or says. In addition, you could also tag her in a photograph – reminding her of the good times you once had together.Tag her in a photo and write,""Good times!""
If you message her on social media, send her something short like, ""Long time, no talk. What's going on?""

, Calling her is very direct and could be awkward. However, it could also be the simplest and easiest way to reestablish contact. Ultimately, you need to make the decision as to whether you want to contact her in a direct way (like calling) or in a more indirect way (like texting or on social media).


If you call her, you may want to start off by honestly explaining yourself. Introduce yourself and then say, ""I remember that good time we had last fall, and I was wondering what you were up to.""
If you call her and she doesn’t answer, don’t call back. Leave a message or a missed call. If she wants to contact you, she will., If you’re calling her or approaching her in person, you need to introduce yourself. While she might remember you, there is a good chance she might not remember your name. Take the opportunity to briefly introduce yourself. In addition, remind her of how you know each other.


Say something like “Hey, Ann! I’m John – we know each other through Andy.”
Don’t be offended if she doesn’t know your name or forgets it later.

, Whatever way you decide to contact her, you should consider using humor. Humor will make a potentially awkward situation funny, and help remind her of your virtues. There are many ways you can do this:


Start with a light-hearted joke about something you might think is funny. For example, if you remember she really likes Oreo cookies, you can joke about those.
Joke about fashion. For instance, say “I was just in the mall and saw someone that looks exactly like you wearing crocs.”
Use self-deprecating humor. For example, say, “Hey, do you remember me? The guy who wears the absurd cowboy boots.”, Contact her and start up a conversation about how she’s doing in life. If you’re interested in a romantic relationship with her, this is a good way to find out if she is available. In addition, this is a very honest and straightforward way of reinitiating contact.


Generally, you can say something like “It’s been a while since we spoke. How are you doing?”
If you knew her from work, and one of you has moved on, ask her “So, what’s going on with work these days?”
In the case you knew each other through a mutual friend, you could simply ask about whether she’s spoken to that person recently., While it may seem disingenuous, send her a text in which you’re talking to someone else, like a friend or a romantic interest. Make sure the text is simple, but somewhat intriguing. She may respond telling you that you’re texting the wrong person, or she might pretend to be the person you’re supposed to be texting. Whatever happens, use it as an opportunity to talk to her.


You should eventually let her know that you knew that it was her you were texting or calling. Chances are, though, she will already know.

, Whatever way you contact her, invite her to an event you’re attending or hosting. This way, it will seem that you are interested in her, but it won’t be too forward. By inviting her to an event, you’ll give her the opportunity to meet you in a low-stakes situation.


If you’re throwing a party with roommates or friends, this is probably a good time to reestablish contact with a girl you might be interested in.
If you’re going to an event or party somewhere with a group of friends, reach out and invite her to join your group., The easiest way to meet up with her is to suggest something that seems fun and casual. This is important, as you’re likely to strike out if she thinks you’re asking her on a formal date. Instead, consider inviting her to join you:


For coffee with friends.
For a drink at a place you both already hang out.
At some sort of event you both are interested in. For example, ask if she’d like to meet you after a concert, or ask if she’ll be going to a certain campus organization meeting., If she ignores your texts, phone calls, social media messages, or otherwise sends the signal that she isn’t interested in you, leave her alone. Back off completely. Give her the opportunity to contact you. If she doesn’t, she’s not interested."

Identify what you want in a relationship.,
Size up your boyfriend.,
Examine yourself.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Want to Slow Down1," Imagine what your ideal relationship would be like. This can change over time, so don’t feel like you have to stick to some past list of check marks. Be honest with yourself so you have a clearer idea of your actual goals and expectations for the here and now. Ask yourself:Do I only want a casual romance without any future commitments, or am I looking for a partner for the long run?
Do I want someone who will challenge me out of my comfort zone, or someone who matches my expectations?
Am I looking for someone who is totally different from my past boyfriends, or someone similar?;
, Think about his behavior, attitude, and goals regarding your relationship. Ask yourself if there is something specific about him that makes you want to slow things down. Make a list of what he says or does that makes you feel hesitant about moving forward too quickly. Consider things like:Whether he’s pressuring you to make a commitment or take a major step forward before you’re ready.
What he envisions your relationship to be like a week from now, a month from now, a year from now, and so on.
If his behavior towards you has changed (or failed to change) after major turning points that the two of you have already taken.

, You’ve identified what you want out of your relationship, and you’ve considered any red flags that your boyfriend has raised. Now gauge your reaction to those red flags. Ask yourself what it is about them that jars with your expectations. For instance:If you feel like he’s rushing you into making a commitment, do you feel reluctant because a committed relationship isn’t what you’re looking for right now? Or, if you do want that, are you just not sure that he’s the right guy for you yet?
If you feel like you do want (or did want) to pursue a long-term relationship, is there something he’s done that has made you think twice? Like treating you differently around his friends, or still flirting with other people despite your relationship?
Say everything seems to be going perfectly, but you feel reluctant anyway. Does his vision for the future match yours? Would you still be able to meet your life goals in his vision?
Consider past relationships. Do you feel like you’re falling into old traps? Or do you feel nervous because things aren’t going the same way as they have before?

Pick an appropriate time.,
Ease into it.,
Share your reasons.,
Accept responsibility.,
Ask for his take on the situation.,
Make a plan together.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Want to Slow Down2," Remember: you want to slow things down, not end them. Choose a time when your boyfriend is likely to be most receptive. Don’t make it harder on yourself by cornering him in a situation where he might feel defensive.If possible, do it face-to-face, rather than over the phone or through text or email, so you can communicate through both words and action.
Wait for a private moment when it’s just the two of you so he doesn’t have to worry about prying eyes or ears.
Allow plenty of time for a long conversation so you both have a chance to process and respond to each other.

, Let him know before you get started that you need to have a serious conversation so he knows that he really needs to listen. At the same time, assure him that it isn’t “that” serious so he doesn’t draw the wrong conclusion and think you’re about to break up with him. Whether you’re trying to plan a time and place to meet and talk, or leading right into it, aim to come across as serious, but positive. Say something like:“Hey, do you think we could go to the park or something this weekend, just the two of us? I have something I need to share with you, but I’d like to be together when I do.”
“So, I’ve been thinking about us a lot, and I really want this to work, but I think we need to take a step back and really think this through together.”
“I’m having a great time with you. I’m just a little worried that things are moving a bit fast. I kind of want to savor what we have right now, you know?”

, Tell him exactly what it is about your relationship that makes you feel pressured to move too fast for comfort. Whether or not he’s done something specific to make you feel this way, put the emphasis on your feelings, not his actions. Don’t make him feel as though you’re attacking him. Instead, share your concerns and what you steps you need to take in order to feel comfortable. For instance:If you feel like you’re being rushed into a commitment, say something like, “I don’t want us to wake up one day and realize we just said, ‘I do,” because we felt like we had to meet some deadline. I want to take our time so we both know we really mean it.”
If he’s done something that makes you second-guess your relationship, like flirting with someone else, address the issue with understanding, like, “I don’t want either of us to feel backed into this. If one of us feels like, hey, there might be someone else I’d be happier with, we should take this slow so it isn’t such a blow to the other person, you know?”
Explain how your past relationships have affected you, like, “I don’t want to repeat the disaster I had with John, where we rushed in and got way too serious way too fast before we really had a chance to get to know each other.”

, Sometimes you want to slow things down even though you're the one who sped things up. If this is the case, don’t shy away from it. Admit to him that you got a little ahead of yourself. Apologize in case he feels led on or teased. Explain your change of heart in a way that assures him that you still want to move forward, just slower. For example:If you’re in high school, maybe you got swept up in having a serious boyfriend, but now graduation is coming, and you’re unsure of how that will affect things. Explain to him that you just want to be realistic about how your separate plans for college or work might change your relationship, and vice versa.
If you’re the one who initiated sex early on, and now you want to ease up on that, assure him that it isn’t like you never want to do it again. You just want to focus on sharing other experiences so you both know that sex isn’t the only attraction between you.
Maybe you’re the one who first broached the subject of moving in together, but now you’re having second thoughts. Tell him that you got swept away by your fantasies about the future, which isn’t fair to him. Explain that you need to rethink the idea with a more realistic expectation of what this would mean for your relationship.

, First, make sure he understood each point you’ve made. Listen closely to his responses for any signs that he mistook what you meant. If necessary, repeat yourself in no uncertain terms, and ask him to repeat what you said to be doubly sure. Then ask him point by point how he feels about your concerns and proposals. Let’s say that:You’ve suggested spending less time together during the week. Does he feel like this means you don’t want to see him at all? Or does he accept the idea that giving you more space might actually improve the strength of your relationship?
You’ve told him that you’re not ready for sex. Does he consider sex an essential part of a relationship? Or does he appreciate taking your time and getting to know each other better?
You’ve shared your discomfort about accepting labels like “boyfriend” and “girlfriend.” Does he take that to mean that you’re not interested in him at all? Or is he comfortable starting from a more casual starting point with less rigid expectations?

, Set ground rules for how to move forward. Restate what you definitely need in order to feel comfortable in this relationship. At the same time, listen to his wants and needs. Consider compromises if they seem reasonable to encourage the same attitude from him.Of course, it may become clear at this point that the best way to move forward is to part ways. If so, don’t consider this a failure on your part. You’ve thought long and hard about what you need from this relationship, so if he can’t agree to that, he was probably never the right guy for you, anyway.

Build strong memories together.,
Show that you’re still interested.,
Drop him a line.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Want to Slow Down3," There’s nothing wrong with a quiet cup of coffee, but if you’re taking things slow, spice your dates up with more exciting stuff to do. Bond over activities that aren’t part of your normal routines. Don’t worry about proposing the wildest thing ever. Just focus on sharing experiences that both of you will enjoy and remember, like:Taking long hikes in parks neither of you have been to before.
Going on a day trip to the beach, city, or some other out-of-town destination.
Signing up for a murder-mystery dinner or scavenger hunt.

, Maybe you asked to spend a little less time together, or to take a break from getting physical. Either way, let him know that this is a breather, not the end. When you’re together, give him clear signs that he still matters to you. For example:Ask how his day or week has been to show that you still want to know how life is treating him.
Maintain strong eye-contact when you talk so he knows he has your full attention.
Touch his hand, arm, or back when you laugh or hammer home the point of a story.
Ask what he thought of a movie or concert as soon as you walk out of it so he knows that his opinion matters to you.

, Show him that you’re thinking about him even when you’re not together. Stick to your ground rules about how often you should text or email each other, but when you do, make it count. Include things like:An added thought or response about a conversation you had the last time you were together.
A memory of some adventure or quiet moment you had that came back to you the other day.
How you’re looking forward to your next date and what you hope to do.

"
"
Know your rights.,
Be clear about your limits.,
Explain your needs.,
Ditch him if he refuses.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Want to Slow Down4," Regardless of what the situation is, remember: you get to set your own boundaries. Don’t feel bullied or guilt-tripped into doing something that you don’t want to do. Honor yourself by recognizing that you aren’t obligated to go any farther than you want to. This could mean:Not engaging in sexual acts that you aren’t ready for.
Not repeating acts that you’ve already performed and didn’t like.
Taking a break from making out entirely.
Insisting on specific conditions, like contraception or other safe-sex practices.

, Tell your boyfriend exactly what you’re willing and unwilling to do. It’s his responsibility to honor your wishes, so let him know what they are. Be firm about them and make it clear that there is no negotiating.Don’t feel like you can’t speak up once the two of you get started. It’s your right to slow things down at any time, whether that’s before or during your makeout session.
Even if you thought you were game for something at the start, tell him right away if you change your mind as things move forward.

, Let him know why you feel the need to slow down, or why a certain act is a no-no. However, don’t feel obligated to do this. Remember: it’s his responsibility to ease off if you insist on it, with or without an explanation. With that said, keep in mind:Letting him know why you feel the way you do can help him better understand and respond to your needs.
For instance, if you’re reluctant to get too heavy because of trust issues, he will now know that this is an area he needs to work on in general, and not just to get what he wants.
If he’s really a stand-up guy, you could also ask him to help you slow things down if you have a tendency to let yourself get carried away in the moment, only to regret it later.

, Don’t tolerate his insistence on speeding back up if he ignores your demands. Whether you explained things in detail or simply said, “No,” part ways with him if he proves himself to be incapable of honoring your wishes. Even if you still like him, recognize that you would be better off with someone who is willing to match your own speed instead of insisting on his own.Don’t be afraid to call other people in for help if he refuses to listen. Keep your phone handy, or call for help if there are other people in or near the building.
If you end up going along with his desires despite your own, don’t feel like this means you missed your opportunity to end things.
Just because you went along with it once doesn’t mean you have to do it again.
