Separate hazardous waste out of your trash.",How to Protect Biodiversity1," Products from food and daily care items to books and entertainment items require resources to make, taking away from biodiversity. Anytime one resource is consumed or produced, it can affect the ecosystem of the area in various ways, such as by destroying the natural habitat (for plowed fields), polluting the area (oil spills), and reducing natural resources (trees for paper), all of which can decrease the biodiversity of an area. By consuming less, you affect the environment less., While organic produce and foods still require the use of natural resources, they are less destructive since they are not polluting the environment with pesticides. Also, pesticides kill off insects, which can destroy whole species over time., While the main focus of fair trade is to ensure producers in other countries are being paid fairly, it also helps to protect local ecosystems, partially by encouraging sustainable farming. Look for the ""Fair Trade"" label on products., Like products and food, the retrieval of energy affects ecosystems, such as off-shore drilling than can disturb wildlife and create oil spills. You can use less energy by turning off lights and electronics when they're not in use, running the dishwasher and washing machine only when they are full, using the car less, and not running the air conditioner and heater as much.


You can replace older appliances for more energy efficient ones--look for the ""Energy Star"" label.You can also keep appliances more efficient by maintaining them properly and replacing things like filters as needed.
Solar panels are another way to reduce your overall dependence on non-renewable energy sources. You can have them installed on your roof or in your backyard to provide your home with electricity.
In addition to using less resources, using less energy helps to reduce emissions. Emissions contribute to climate change, which can harm biodiversity as ecosystems change.
Carpool or ride public transportation to work to cut down on energy use., Labels like ""Green Seal Certified,"" ""FSC"" (Forest Stewardship Council), ""LEED Certified,"" ""Rain Forrest Alliance Certified,"" and ""Marine Stewardship Council"" indicate the producer's dedication to sustainability., If you don't know the origin of these products, buying them while on vacation, especially in other countries, can encourage continued poaching., Non-native species can be invasive and crowd out native species, decreasing their population. In addition, the non-native species can be spread to other areas through wind and animals.As an added bonus, planting native species means the plants will grow better in your area. If you're in an arid or hot climate, you will not need to water native species as much.
Another option for your backyard is to create a landscape that can be a ""Certified Wildlife Habitat,"" as laid out by the National Wildlife Foundation. Essentially, you would be creating an environment conducive to animals raising their young in your backyard., Both of these can harm wildlife, decreasing biodiversity., Reusing resources helps protect natural resources, which as noted above, helps protect biodiversity. It also keeps trash out of landfills, which can harm environments through leaching and overspill. Anything that harms the environment and ecosystems harms biodiversity. Most communities have recycling programs, including curb-side recycling. You separate out the recyclables from other trash and put them in a separate bin. In most places, you can recycle paper and cardboard, plastics, cans and other metals, and glass. While most recycling programs don't take styrofoam, other places do. For instance, Goodwill takes styrofoam in most communities.


To recycle, lightly clean out items before putting them in the recycle bin. Some places will require you to separate out different types of recycling into separate bins.
You can also create a compost pile to help with waste. A compost pile or bin turns organic material into fertilizer you can use in your garden. You can add shredded sticks, leaves, and grass clippings from the yard, as well as fruit and vegetable scraps from the kitchen. Create a pile for the waste. Always bury the scraps underneath the other compost, and add moisture if you're adding dry materials.You can also recycle computer components. Computers use precious metals, and if they are thrown away, they can release chemicals into the environment from landfills, harming habitats. Most towns have places that will recycle computer parts, though you will usually need to take them in yourself., Products like cleaning chemicals, pesticides, paint, and batteries can leach from landfills into water supplies. Use less harmful supplies, and make use of your community's hazardous waste collection."

Help plant native plants.,
Patrol wildlife areas.,
Pick up litter.,
Clean up streams.,
Raise awareness.Use your voice to raise awareness through social media.,
Organize a campaign at your office.",How to Protect Biodiversity2," You can help protect biodiversity by planting native species in local parks and wildlife preserves, under the supervision of park employees., Protected areas like wildlife refuge help preserve biodiversity. By volunteering to help patrol these areas, you can assist park rangers in stopping violations like pollution and littering.,, You don't even need to contact park rangers for this one. When you are in a park or any area, pick up litter you see. Litter can harm or kill animals and pollute water systems, so by helping reduce litter, you help biodiversity.

, Organizations like American Rivers garner volunteers to clean up waterways, which helps plants and animals thrive., Provide information to others about the best ways to protect biodiversity.

, Office supplies use a large number of resources, and the waste can contribute to pollution. Get your colleagues on board to use less resources overall, and speak with your boss to talk about buying environmentally friendly supplies when they are needed."
"
Support watchdog groups.,
Work against projects and corporations that harm wildlife and habitats.,
Call your representatives.,
Run for office yourself.",How to Protect Biodiversity3," Groups like the National Parks and Conservation Association, the National Wildlife Federation, and Ocean work to protect the environment and biodiversity. You can support them by volunteering your time and energy or by giving monetary donations.Many of these organizations work on the national level by employing lobbyists to enact environmental laws.

, Corporations are already being more responsible due to people like you who raise their voices against harmful practices. Use your voice to complain, and take your dollar elsewhere if you don't like a company's policies.Also, voice your opinion against local projects that are supported by the government or corporations if they will harm the environment in some way. You can write letters, call, or stage a protest.

, Tell them you want them to support laws that protect the environment. Don't forget to call your local council men and women. It takes all levels of the government to protect the environment and biodiversity.Laws that protect biodiversity also protect the environment. Laws should establish what species are endangered and work to protect them. They should maintain national wildlife preserves and work to designate new preserves. They should put committees in place who figure out what harms the environment and who have the authority to take or recommend action to stop those actions. They should also limit the importation of non-native species, which can be invasive.Laws should criminalize behaviors that harm the environment, especially on the corporate scale., If you don't see enough change, you can make a difference by running for office yourself, and then working towards environmentally friendly laws that conserve the diverse environment.

Greater biodiversity increases genetic diversity in an environment which is necessary for long-term species survival.Biodiversity varies depending on the region. Some regions have greater biodiversity than others.;
, A root cause of decreased biodiversity is related to the overconsumption of resources on the planet.Some resources are consumed at a rate faster than they are produced. Products with a certified ecolabel let consumers know that their products are green and sustainable. By using products with eco labels you can be sure that they have been produced in an environmentally sustainable fashion.


Common ecolabels include USDA Certified, Fair Trade Certified, Certified Wildlife Friendly, LEED, Energy Star, and Green Seal., Make your friends and family aware of the detrimental effects our consumer demands have on the biodiversity of our planet. Inform them about deforestation and what they can do in their own way to help preserve our resources.


Start a recycling program in your neighborhood.
Encourage friends and family to use items with ecolabels and learn about the importance of biodiversity.

, Invasive species are plants that don’t naturally occur in a specific area. They compete against native species for nutrients and resources.Invasive species can be so aggressive that they kill the native species and greatly decrease the amount of biodiversity in an area.


Invasive species are usually introduced unintentionally through the transportation of plants from different regions.There are hundreds of invasive species throughout the United States. Plants such as kudzu, bamboo, Japanese maple, and English ivy are a few examples common to many areas., Many parks and preserves have special clean-up days or programs to curb the growth of invasive species. Look online or call your local park to see if they have open volunteer opportunities.


Check out the website for your local parks department for details.
Invite friends and family to a clean-up event and make a fun day out of it.

, Some invasive species can look similar to native species so it’s important to have a photo guide with you. If you are new to a clean-up program, have a knowledgeable guide with you that can help you identify the right plants to remove.


Look up invasive species that are common in your area and learn how to identify them., Invasive species can be difficult to control, but one of the best efforts is to physically remove them. Digging and pulling up roots works well for small plants growing in loose soil.Plants with thicker roots or growth will need to be cut away and possibly treated with herbicide.


Oftentimes, you will need cutting shears or blades to remove the overgrown plants. Be safe and be aware of your surroundings as you work.
Attempt to remove the entire root, or as much as possible to prevent regrowth.
Pile the extracted plants into a wheel barrow to cart away and dispose of.
Leave herbicide treatment to the parks department.

, Native species are the plants and organisms indigenous to the land. Native species vary based on geographic location. They have a positive impact on the environment and ecosystem. Search online or go to the library and look up the native species that grow in your forests and parks.


Native species evolved with the land and are specially adapted to grow in their region.Some common native species are the willow oak, the Sweet Bay magnolia, trumpet honeysuckle, and the American elderberry.You can search for a list of native species by state on the USDA site: http://plants.usda.gov/dl_state.html.

, Many parks have to reintroduce native species when the population decreases as a result of invasive species. Call your local parks department or go online to see if they are having a planting day.


Don’t plant anything without permission.
Invite friends and family to join you.

, Find the location where the new native species will be planted. The park should have this area mapped out beforehand or tell you specifically where to plant. Ask for instructions on proper planting. Ask questions related to the depth of the hole and how to make sure roots are exposed enough for planting.


Wear proper clothing that you don’t mind getting dirty. Gloves are also very important.

, If you have the time, frequently visit your plantings and watch their progress. Keep the area clear of all invasive species by weeding regularly and removing non-native plants."

Stay optimistic.",How to Create Urban Rainforests," Some locations may not let you to have a rainforest, especially very cold climates. Consider the limitations (and opportunities) of where you live when planning your urban rainforest.


Determine your city’s geographical region. Mountainous regions may require a different landscape design than flatter areas. Consider local plants in addition to more typical rainforest plant life. Know the best plants for your climate. If you live in a colder region, choose plants that can survive in that climate. Plan an enclosed greenhouse if you want to choose a more tropical rainforest theme in a colder geographical location. However, realize that this will be more expensive. ;
, Know both the big picture and small details that make up your urban rainforest.


Consider your visitors. Make sure your urban rainforest is a fun and safe space for everyone.
Design your urban rainforest to be child-friendly and accessible. Try not to keep anyone from enjoying your hard work.
Insure your rainforest. You want to protect yourself and your visitors in the case of injury. Follow through on safety measures. Staying safe is always better than regretting it later.

, Know how much money you need for your urban rainforest. Try to plan out every expense you will have designing it, building it, and running it.


Know the prices for plant life. Look into the type of plant life you want on your urban rainforest. Some plants may be expensive, so you may want to look at other options.
Estimate cost of structures and exhibitions. Look at the price of construction materials as well as labor for building any structures or exhibitions you may want.
Price animal and animal care. Know how much each different animal you may want costs. Keep in mind that you will have ongoing costs for their food and shelter as well.

, Don't buy the land yourself. Find people and institutions that can donate land for your urban rainforest.


Scout locations in your city. Find any vacant lots to see if that land is being used. Check in with the city government or local neighborhoods to see if any land is available to develop into an urban rainforest. They may be looking for ways to improve unused land.Be open-minded about how big or small your project may be. Think about how your idea can fit into different plots of land.

, Grants offer regular funding from the government or local charities. They can keep your urban rainforest continuously funded.


Find available grants for your project. Ask other local green spaces where they found grants.
Look at government website such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and Parks and Recreation to find potential grants. There are plenty of grants every year that go unclaimed Write grant correctly. Know what the granting agency wants included. Consider hiring or consulting a grant writer to make sure you do it correctly.
Be specific and detailed in your grant regarding your plans for the urban rainforest. Include a budget and timetable.

, Talk to local businesses about how your urban rainforest will help out the local community


Contact local business to see if they would be willing to donate labor or materials. Offer them acknowledgement once your urban rainforest opens.
Discuss with local businesses the increased customer base due to your urban rainforest. Emphasize to them about the increased property values you imagine your urban rainforest will bring.
See if local businesses will help sponsor events once your urban rainforest is open. They may also offer volunteers to work these events.

, Think about fundraising in the community and asking for individual contributions.


Get community support. Talk to the city government about participating in events to raise awareness of your project.
Consider holding a meeting or town hall to get input from people in your city. Ask them what they want out of an urban rainforest.
Sell benches, bridges, or bricks as memorials to community members. Offer your community the ability to buy memorials at your rainforest to honor their family members and friends.

, Show how your project will help to give back to the community.


Research other local green spaces or public parks to see who has invested in those locations. Contact those businesses for a meeting.
Make a firm and detailed plan for your urban rainforest. Tell them where their money would be going. Give them a proposed budget for start-up costs, maintenance, and special events. Have a realistic timetable for completion of your project.
Plan to meet with multiple investors to procure enough funding for your urban rainforest. Be grateful for any contribution. Focus on how the urban rainforest will benefit your investors. Offer public acknowledgement such as naming buildings after large donors.

, Designing the space of your urban rainforest can be difficult. Discuss with experts on the best way to design it.


Talk to engineers about the best way to organize your urban rainforest. Make sure your space is well constructed for all structural challenges.
Refer to architects regarding best building materials. They may suggest the best type of wood for building structures and exhibitions. Converse with landscapers about the best layout of your plant life. Listen to their suggestions about where each plant should go.

, Know the best way to take care of your plant life. Keep in mind the best plants to choose for your climate and geography.


Learn what plants work best in your climate. If you have a greenhouse, a variety of plants may work. Otherwise, keep in mind your local climate and weather.
Know how to best provide for the needs of your plant life.
Adjust your expectations. Recognize that you may not be able to build a lush, tropical rainforest if your climate and geography does not allow for it.

, Create walking paths through the urban rainforest. Build all building and structures while also keeping in mind maintenance and staff needs.


Think about maintenance and staff needs. Know your labor needs for constructing the urban rainforest. Keep in mind any upkeep you may have in the future as well.
Build in paths. Make sure the paths are wide enough to accommodate all visitors
Erect buildings or structures. Construct your buildings so they can be reached by paths.

, Invite local businesses, investors, and community members to celebrate this special day.


Invite the local press. Have them take pictures of any ribbon-cutting ceremony. Get pictures with investors or local dignitaries.
Ask someone to come speak at your groundbreaking ceremony. Try to get someone interested in your project to talk about its importance.
Offer free food and entertainment. Show the community all the fun your new urban rainforest will offer.

, Make sure they stay in touch with your urban rainforest and its changing needs.


Theme your special planting days based on the calendar. Offer visits by the Easter bunny when planting during the spring time.
Make “planting days” fun. Play music, dance, and have a good time.
Thank your volunteers. Tell them their hard work is appreciated.

, Talk to local high schools and colleges about offering internships for their students.


Talk to local environmental agencies about finding students interested more in your urban rainforest.
Find nearby high schools to see if clubs or sports teams need volunteer hours.
See if local colleges have internships for students learning how to run and maintain green spaces. Try to get your urban rainforest on their list of approved spaces.

, You will likely experience many setbacks during your project. Don't get discouraged and try to keep positive.


Realize that starting an urban rainforest is a lot of work and will take longer than you imagine.
Stay focused on the positive impact your urban rainforest will have. Remember that you are trying to do something good for your local urban environment whether you are trying to foster community engagement, stimulate education, or encourage new interests,
Be realistic. Nothing happens overnight and your dream for the urban rainforest may be ambitious. Improving your community is a worthwhile endeavor.

Reconsider your lawn.,
Diversify your garden.,
Embrace your “weeds.” Many plants that we think of as “weeds” are beneficial to the biodiversity of our yards.,
Consume conscientiously.,
Increase biodiversity in urban landscapes.",How to Help Protect Biodiversity1," Many people do not realize that they are contributing to a monoculture in a major way; by having a grass lawn.Many people like having a large grassy area that is fairly easy to maintain and offers a nice place for children and pets to play. However, by maintaining a grassy lawn, you are choosing to exclude other types of plants.Consider converting a portion of your grassy lawn into a more diverse area by planting a flower or vegetable garden, trees, or a variety of bushes.;
, The more diversity you have in your garden and your yard, the more resistant they are to pests and disease.Plant flowering trees, shrubs and other plants and flowers to attract bees, butterflies and other pollinators. Choose flowering plants native to your region, or plant clover, alfalfa, and other flowering cover crops that will attract bees, replenish nutrients, and prevent erosion.You can selectively choose which pests and weeds you want to get rid of, keeping as many beneficial ones as possible to enhance soil health and to provide a habitat for needed insects and other animals., Some weeds are actually edible, and can be a great (free!) addition to your diet!Even if you choose not to eat your weeds, plenty of insects may choose to snack on your weeds instead of your garden!


Some weeds can actually deter pests from entering an area as well.You can certainly “pick and choose” which weeds you allow to stay on your property; you can decide, for example, to get rid of poison ivy, but keep dandelions or thistle. Encouraging biodiversity does not insist on allowing every plant or animal species free range of your land.

, In addition to promoting biodiversity in your own yard, you can encourage regional biodiversity by buying a variety of local fruits and vegetables.Most areas (even urban settings) have farmers’ markets, gatherings of local farmers selling their produce, baked goods, meat, eggs, and dairy products in one place.


Buying as much of your food as possible from a local farmers’ market promotes your local economy, enables you to find out details about how your food was grown, and gives you the opportunity to learn about fruits and vegetables you may never have tried before.Developing a relationship with the person who cultivates your food also enables you to make requests for different practices, such as minimal or no pesticides, no hormones in meat animals, and a wider diversity of products.

, Diversifying the bioculture in farmland, lawns, and gardens is critical in protecting biodiversity, but there are also many places within urban areas that also need attention.Making efforts to plant flowers, flowering plants, alfalfa, and clover in urban areas can make a big difference in urban biodiversity. A variety of plants can be cultivated along roadsides, in power line corridors, in community gardens, between the street and sidewalk, etc. Encouraging a variety of flowering plants will attract pollinators and can reduce invasive and harmful species without using pesticides.


Urban areas need ample trees as well. To attract birds, you need caterpillars. And to attract caterpillars, you need to plant the right trees. Oak trees are particularly helpful in doing this, as are trees native to an area."
"
Educate yourself about pesticides.,
Decrease your own use of pesticides.,
Control weeds without pesticides.,
Keep pests out of your garden without pesticides.,
Minimize unwanted bugs with household items.,
Ask your local farmers about their pesticide use.,
Buy organic food products.,
Understand the compounding role of genetically modified crops.",How to Help Protect Biodiversity2," The word “pesticide” is an umbrella term for herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and more. They came into use in the 1960s and are used to kill weeds, insects, fungi, plant diseases, and rodents that damage crops, lawns, and gardens. Since their introduction, researchers have documented widespread pesticide contamination in soil, waterways, groundwater, the air, animals, plants and even humans.Research has also shown that pesticides can kill “keystone” species they aren’t meant to target, such as earthworms, spiders, termites, honey bees, and micro-organisms like bacteria that are critical links in the food chain.For instance, honeybees and wild bees pollinate 71 of the 100 crops that constitute 90% of the world’s food supply. Yet since 2007, between 20-30% of all honeybee colonies in the U.S., Canada and Europe have been wiped out each year.The most recent research shows that one class of widely used crop and lawn/garden pesticide (called neonicotinoids) is directly linked to the drop in honeybee colonies.In 2013, the EU issued a 2-year ban on three of the neonicotinoids used on flowering crops attractive to bees. Several member countries, however, lifted the ban for certain crops.While the U.S. has not instituted a similar ban, environmental organizations are pushing heavily for one. You can help by joining and/or donating funds to these organizations.

, Research by the U.S. Geological Survey found that urban waterways were just as contaminated, and in some cases more contaminated, with pesticides than rural waterways. In fact, pesticides were found in 99% of water and fish samples taken from urban streams. The levels also often exceeded those used as guides for the protection of aquatic life.There are ways, however, that you can avoid making the situation worse by reducing or eliminating your use of pesticides in lawn care.


Do not treat your lawn with pesticides. Many people use lawn care companies that spray their grass lawn with pesticides that limit or eliminate the growth of weeds and the presence of insects. Eliminating this type of treatment (as well as abandoning the monoculture of the grass lawn) can go a long way to improve your local biodiversity.
Aerate your lawn when the soil is compacted so that water, nutrients and air can seep in and promote root growth. Water it well before using a mechanical core aerator, a hand aerifier, or a spading fork to create 1/4-1/2” diameter holes about 4” deep every 4-6” inches apart in your grass. Remove the soil cores and leave them on your lawn, then apply grass seed and/or fertilizer., You can eliminate weeds by pulling them, smothering them with ground cover like clover and several layers of newspaper, or pouring vinegar on them. You can also create physical barriers like edgings and retaining walls, plant flowers and garden crops that will beat out weeds for sunlight, water and nutrients or maintain a thick lawn to crowd out weeds., Maintaining a diverse garden can control pests naturally. You can also include plants throughout and on the perimeter of your garden to repel insects. Good options include marigolds, aster, cosmos, garlic, chive, savory, rosemary, petunias, thyme, rue, nasturtium, tansy, dahlias and euphoria.


Allow natural predators like ladybugs, ground beetles and the praying mantis help you take care of problems.
Use physical deterrents to deter pests. Staple tarpaper into the shape of a cylinder and place it around the base of an affected plant. Wood ashes mixed with water to create a paste can be applied around the base of trees to ward off borers that attach to trees.

, Many items you’d find in your kitchen can help get rid of bugs on plants. Mix 1 tablespoon of peppermint castile soap and a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper with a 1/2 gallon of water and spray on infested plants. Use chili powder to get rid of ants or drench their mounds in boiling water.You can also remove bugs by hand; by spraying soapy water on plants; by setting traps or bait boxes with a nonvolatile chemical like boric acid; and by dusting boric acid in cracks and crevices to get to ants, cockroaches and silverfish.

, If you are encouraging local biodiversity by shopping at a farmer’s market, be sure to ask your local farmers about the nature and quantity of pesticides they use.Buy from farmers who limit pesticide use and make it known that you prefer to buy pesticide-free foods. Spending money on a product you support is like voting with your wallet; food producers will change their practices to meet the demands of conscientious consumers.

, If you are unable to shop at a farmer’s market, try to buy organic foods at the grocery store. While organic foods may not be 100% pesticide-free, they are held to standards of minimal pesticide use (including a long list of banned fertilizers and pesticides)., Genetically modified (GM) crops arose in part to accommodate increasing human demands on natural resources. In particular, Roundup Ready crops were designed in 1996 to resist poisonous glyphosate – the active ingredient in the weed-killing herbicide Roundup. By 2008, over 90% of all U.S. soybean crops were Roundup Ready, and over 60% of corn and cotton were as well. This type of monoculture farming has greatly benefited large agribusiness, but it has also devastated family farming and led to decreased biodiversity.


The latter can also be attributed to the development of Roundup resistance among Roundup Ready crops and the resulting surge in use of the herbicide – from 25 million pounds per year for soybeans, corn and cotton in 1996 to more than 135 millions pounds per year in 2007.Like neonicotinoids, studies have found that glyphosate has contaminated waterways, soil, air, groundwater and our food.
Additionally, it’s led to declines in beneficial insects, disruptions in the human endocrine system, links to cancer and kidney disease, and may even cause human DNA damage."
"
Reduce our reliance on GM crops.,
Craft a persuasive message.,
Find out what’s going on in your area to protect biodiversity.,
Make important connections.,
Lobby your government.,
Share your message.,
Support environmental organizations.,
Start your own environmental organization.",How to Help Protect Biodiversity3," Due to these issues and their potentially catastrophic consequences, scientists, environmental activists, educators, etc. have called for eradication of GM crops altogether. However, agribusiness has fought this vehemently. It, along with other scientists and many policymakers, claim GM crops are necessary to support world population growth, which has doubled since 1970 to 7 billion and is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050.Thus, the Union of Concerned Scientists has made the following recommendations, all of which you can assist with – through your vote, the power of your purse, and changes in your lifestyle.


Expand funding for research on public crop breeding so farmers are able to better diversify crops and to find less-harmful means of managing pests, weeds, drought and so forth.
Increase funding for research and incentives enabling further development and adoption of agroecologically- based farming, which focuses on recycling nutrients and energy, diversifying species, crop rotation, and integrating crops and livestockEnact steps, such as making changes to patent laws, to support independent research on GM risks and benefits.
Be more rigorous in independently reviewing GM product approvals so they don’t reach the market until the risks and benefits are better understood.
Create and support food labeling laws so consumers know when they are eating foods containing GM crops.

, Most people will agree that they want a world with a varied natural environment for their grandchildren. Still, it's perfectly reasonable to wonder, ""Why does it matter so much? Why should we make sacrifices to protect it?"" Here are things to emphasize when spreading the word about biodiversity.


Biodiversity has an effect on local and global economies. Humans make a lot of money off of biologically diverse ecosystems. Medicines, luxury goods, certain foods, and tourism dollars all depend in some way on the maintenance of biologically diverse ecosystems all over the world.
Biodiversity in the wild protects our food supply. Most people in the world get most of their food from just a few sources (usually wheat, corn, or rice).Today, scientists use genes from wild plants to ensure that these crops can survive against diseases, droughts, and other problems (similar processes are used for the livestock that give us meat).
The introduction of invasive species to natural habitats by humans can upset local ecosystems and cause biodiversity to plummet.Biodiversity can protect against costly disasters. For instance, one study found that replacing natural grasslands with agricultural pastures made areas more vulnerable to fire and drought.Another found that islands with high biodiversity were less vulnerable to tropical cyclones.
Monoculture farming devastates natural ecosystems. Diversifying crops, crop rotation and reducing clear-cutting make ecosystems much more resistant to damage when something bad happens.
The Irish potato famine is a perfect example of monocultural farming gone terribly wrong in that the country’s farmers’ relied on one type of potato. When disease swept through the country and the environment changed, these potatoes were almost entirely wiped out, leaving the people with little to no food.Areas with high biodiversity also tend to have high ""genetic diversity."" That is, the individual species in the ecosystem have a greater variety of genes. Over time, this contributes to the creation of new species through the process of evolution.

, Before reinventing the wheel, determine what measures, if any, are being taken to protect and enhance biodiversity. Once you know this, you’ll be able a) to better gauge the most pressing concerns in your area, b) to focus your efforts, and c) to make a more persuasive, knowledge-based argument for change to local businesses and municipalities.

, Certain people in the local community can be especially helpful allies when trying to further the cause of preserving biodiversity. In general, these are people with specialized knowledge relating to environmental issues, people with experience organizing, and people with power. A few examples include:


Political activists: Can help get the message to crucial voters, organize rallies, get access to local politicians, etc.
Life science teachers and professors: Can offer their knowledge and expertise when it comes to the specifics of biodiversity-conserving efforts.
Environmental lawyers: Will know about the legal challenges (and opportunities) as far as making your environmental mission a reality.
Community leaders: Have the power and influence to get you local support.

, Ultimately, many environmental issues are in the hands of people who wield power in society. Local, state, and national politicians are particularly important in the mission to sustain biodiversity. These people have the power to write, interpret and enforce the laws surrounding environmental issues. Thus, one effective way to get the environmental policies that you want is to lobby these politicians directly. In other words, you want to try to convince them that your environmental mission is a good idea.


One great way to do this is to get as many people in the community as you can to sign a petition and file it with the local government. See: our petition-writing article.
Another good way to get the political results you want is to raise money for the election campaign of a politician who agrees with you. This politician will now have an obligation to try to pass legislation favorable to you, if he or she wants to get elected again.
Remember: Most politicians are motivated by votes. Your goal should ultimately be to convince the politician you're lobbying that supporting your environmental mission would win him or her votes (and, of course, that working against it would cost votes).
Can't seem to find sympathetic politicians? Consider running yourself on an environmental platform!

, The more people you reach out to, the better chance you have of seeing the biodiversity changes you want. Getting the word out about your mission is crucial to success. Luckily, there are many ways to do this. Here are a few ideas.


Use social media: Today, people spend a good deal of time on websites like Facebook, Twitter, and so on. A social media campaign can help you capture the attention of thousands of Internet browsers, thereby raising awareness and support for biodiversity. See How to Use Social Media to Spur Political Change for more information.
Speak at local events: Local community gatherings (like religious services, town hall meetings, public events, etc.) will often give reputable causes the chance to speak for free or cheaply. Make the most of these opportunities to reach out to community members directly about biodiversity.
Use local canvassing: Door-to-door visits and flyer distribution are old-fashioned ways to raise awareness for biodiversity issues, but they can still be effective.

, There are many organizations out there fighting for these issues already. Many are quite powerful. They can’t continue the battle or be as politically effective, though, without financial and volunteer support from the people. Here is the link to a website with the names and contact information for a number of these organizations: http://www.nrdc.org/reference/environgroups.asp.

, Once you have an understanding of local biodiversity issues, you may want to consider taking action on a larger scale. A good way to do this is to start an environmental organization dedicated to making the changes that are most important to you. By involving others in your mission, you gain both power and legitimacy. There is strength in numbers, and powerful people tend to listen to organizations with many members.


There's no ""right"" focus for an environmental organization. Your club can focus on a narrow issue (like saving the local wetlands from encroaching development) or a broad one (like increasing awareness for environmental issues in general).
The important thing is to pick a goal that you have a reasonable chance of accomplishing. For instance, a local club with 100 members will have a hard time fighting for a global carbon tax.

Be an informed consumer.,
Follow the ""Three Rs."",
Practice eco-friendly food strategies at home.,
Reduce your carbon emissions.",How to Help Protect Biodiversity4," One of the most fundamental tools you have to fight the loss of global biodiversity is your wallet. Make an effort to buy only products and services that were made with an eye for the environmental health of the planet. Avoid buying from companies with practices that threaten global biodiversity. Remember, companies will sell what people want to buy, so tell companies that you want products that do not harm biodiversity.


Research environmentally friendly brands before you make major purchases. For starters, this Fortune report lists a good selection of responsible companies., There's no way around it: Since early in our history, humans have always created a lot of garbage.Today, however, the massive amounts of waste being produced on a global scale pose a major threat to biodiversity. By following the ""Three Rs,"" you can minimize the impact of your waste. The ""Three Rs"" are:



Reduce: Decrease your consumption. Don't buy products you don't need. When you do buy things, try to make choices that generate a minimal amount of garbage. For instance, buy things with limited packaging (or none at all) rather than things that come in many boxes or containers. The less garbage you generate, the less you'll contribute to the loss of biodiversity when natural habitats are used for landfills.

Reuse: Decrease the amount of goods you throw away by using things more than once. One easy example is bringing a backpack or a reusable bag to the grocery store so that you don't use new bags. See our Home Organization articles for more great ideas. Again, less garbage means less loss of biodiversity from expanding landfills.

Recycle: When you do have to throw something away, recycle it so it can be converted to something useful again rather than being added to a landfill. Click here for a good guide to recycling in the U.S., There are numerous other ways to encourage global biodiversity. Best of all, many of these are things you can do in and around the home! For instance, reducing your reliance on commercial crops decreases natural habitat destruction when cleared for farming. See below for a few easy suggestions.



Start a family or community garden. Less demand for large-scale agriculture means less habitat loss and fewer native species displaced.
Use composting at home. The compost can be added to the family garden or the community garden to boost your harvest. This further reduces your reliance on commercial agriculture. Even better, this is a great way to recycle organic waste and kitchen scraps!

, We've all heard it hundreds of times: Burning fossil fuels is bad for the environment. While human carbon emissions have been linked to global climate change beyond a shadow of a doubt, many don't know that they also have a direct impact on the planet's biodiversity.Climate change leads to habitat loss and more stressful environmental conditions that put at-risk species on the brink of extinction. Thus, slowing climate change by reducing emissions is one effective way to preserve biodiversity. Usually, this can be done by reducing the energy we use. For instance, you might try:


Purchasing a zero- or reduced-emissions car for your next vehicle purchase.
Carpooling during your daily commute to save money and reduce the fuel you consume.
Walking or riding your bike instead of driving.
Using energy-efficient electronics to reduce carbon emissions. In the U.S., electronics that are made to use a minimal amount of electricity are given an ""ENERGY STAR"" label by the EPA. Look for this label.Investing in efficient insulation and heating for your house to reduce energy usage.Considering alternative home energy sources like solar panels, which were once too expensive for many people but are getting cheaper each year.

Learn more about biodiversity.,
Know the background to the IBD.,
Check out the IBD theme for each year.,
Check out local biodiversity activities online.,
Participate in The Green Wave.,
Organise your own community IBD celebrations.",How to Celebrate the International Day for Biodiversity," Understanding the importance of biodiversity to your daily life, the whole functioning of your community, region and country and the benefits for the entire world is a key part of celebrating biodiversity. There are many ways that you can learn more about the value of biodiversity:


Start with wikiHow's own biodiversity articles, such as Help Protect Biodiversity, Understand the Concept of Biodiversity and Learn About Biodiversity and Food Webs.
Visit the Secretariat for the Convention on Biological Diversity to learn more about the Convention, about biodiversity and further resources on biodiversity.
Visit your local library or museum library to read books about nature, animals, plants, ecosystems etc. - all of these are pieces of the biodiversity jigsaw.
Visit a local conservation area. It might be a zoo, a nature park, a reserve, a protected forest, a nature centre, an aquarium, a museum etc. There are many places that you can go to learn more and experience biodiversity firsthand.





;
, The IBD first started when the Convention for Biological Diversity came into force on 29 December 1993. The United Nations proclaimed May 22 the International Day for Biological Diversity (IBD) in order to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. The change of date from December to May helped to ensure that country celebrations were not coinciding with numerous holiday season events held in December., Every year the IBD celebrations focus on a particular theme. You can find the theme for this year and for past years at the International Day for Biological Diversity - 22 May website.

, Many local groups participate in the IBD celebrations each year, from local community groups and municipalities to schools, companies and governments.

, If you're a student or a teacher, you can get your school involved in The Green Wave. This involves planting a tree and watering it at 10:00am local time to create a ""green wave"" across the world and recording the event for all to follow online.

, If you are enthusiastic about organizing an event to celebrate IBD in your local community, there are many things that you can do to highlight biodiversity conservation issues, including:


Tree photo competition - have members of the community submit photos of their favourite neighbourhood tree or stand of trees, along with a short explanation of why this tree matters to them. If you want to narrow the parameters of the competition and to highlight the importance of biodiversity, ask competitors to select only native trees, or trees that provide ecosystem benefits, such as food, animal shelter or shade.






Hold a celebration of the work being done by local farmers to conserve biodiversity. Organise an event for local farmers to come and talk to the community about their biodiversity conservation efforts, from preserving heirloom crops to keeping stands of native bush and trees to help native animals and plants thrive amidst the agriculture. Provide awards to the farmers from community members to thank them for their time and efforts in conserving biodiversity.
Hold a poster competition. At school, after-school care or in the local community, you might consider holding a competition for the best posters that describe the importance of biodiversity to your local area.
Arrange for a group tour of local biodiversity. E-mail and drop off flyers (on recycled paper) members of your neighbourhood to alert them to this upcoming event and to invite them to come and learn more about the biodiversity in their local area. If it will be a long walk, ask them to bring their own paper bag lunch and to consider packing it with locally produced food.
Hold a quiz night to raise funds for local biodiversity restoration projects. Choose an area of your local environment that is in need of restoration, such as a stand of local trees, a river area, a lake, an area that is home to a rare species and target it for restoration and conservation. Advertise the quiz night widely in your community and let people know the reason behind it. Sell tickets to the event to raise funds and ask for donations of environmentally considerate prizes. Create biodiversity related questions for the quiz night, such as questions about local wildlife, trees, plants, ecosystems etc. Serve food sourced locally for snacks or ask people to bring a plate of home cooked food.
Hold a tree planting event. Ask your local parliament or legislative representatives to attend and to help source local trees for the event.

Peel the label off of a plastic bottle.,
Cut the top off of your bottle.,
Flip the top to make a funnel.,
Add sand to the bottom of the bottle.,
Saturate the sand with water.,
Make a ruler on the bottle.,
Put the bottle in a hole outside.,
Let the bottle collect rain.,
Record your readings.",How to Make a Rain Gauge out of a Plastic Bottle," Common choices are a 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz) drinking bottle or a2.00 liters (67.6  fl oz) bottle. Either way peel or cut the label off of the bottle. This will allow you to mark on the bottle later and see inside the bottle.





;
, Use a pair of scissors or a utility knife to cut the top off of the bottle. Cut right where the sides stop going straight up and start to turn in. This will leave you the most room in your rain gauge and provide you an effective funnel.








Have an adult assist or supervise this step.

, Turn the top upside down and put it back on top of the bottle. This should leave the top of the bottle pointing inside the bottle (make sure the lid is off). Now, that water can effectively flow into the gauge. Tape your funnel around the edge with packing tape (if you have it) to keep the funnel in place.







, Adding sand to the bottom of the bottle will provide weight to keep the bottle from tipping over. It will also give you a level surface to measure water (the bottom of most bottles is unlevel). Putting ½ inch of sand in the bottle is sufficient.








You can use any sand. Collect some along a river bank or on the beach, or go buy some at your local hardware store.

, Add just enough water to cover the sand completely. The amount of water needed to fill all of the holes between sand particles and cover the top of the sand is called the saturation point. Use a marker to mark the saturation point on the outside of your bottle.







, From the saturation mark, measure up the bottle and make marks every inch. You can also make marks in between these lines to designate fractions of an inch (½, ¼, ⅛, etc.). Put clear tape over your markings to protect them from weather.








You can also use clear tape to tape a ruler to the bottle.
You can also mark the bottle in centimeters or millimeters.

, Usually, rainfall is measured at ground level. This means that you will need to dig a hole just deep enough to put your bottle in. The top of the bottle should be flush with the ground around it.







, Leave the bottle uncovered. When it rains, rainwater will be funneled into the bottle. This will allow you to record the amount of rain that fell on that particular day.







, Write down the amount of rainfall that you record. This way, you can put the rain gauge back in the same place and collect water from the next rain. Over time, you can chart how much rainfall your area has received.








Note that these readings will differ depending on the size bottle you use. Any bottle will differ from the official rain gauge used by meteorologists.

Test the pH of the water.,
Determine the level of nitrates in the water.,
Measure the temperature of the stream over time.,
Calculate the flow rate of the stream.,
Assess the clarity of the water.,
Test the water for the presence of bacteria.",How to Identify a Healthy Stream1," Testing the pH of the stream water can easily done with a simple pH test strip. Dip the strip in the water and then let the color develop. Compare the color of the test strip to the included color chart to determine the pH of the water. Make sure to read the strip within two minutes of testing because the color can fade with time. Ideally, the pH of the stream water should be between 6.5 and 7.5. This is considered neutral and is the best for stream life.A pH of 5 or less is extremely acidic and indicative of waste drainage and pollutants in the stream. 

 It is best to check the pH early in the morning as readings can be altered by organisms with high photosynthetic activity during the day. 

 The pH may vary in different parts of the stream, so try to check the same part of the stream each day for a better idea of pH variations. 
;
, A nitrate test kit can be purchased from your local pet shop or aquarium store. Test the water according to the instructions that come with the kit. Generally, you will add a few drops of solution to the water and wait for the color to change. The color of the water is then compared to a chart that allows you to determine the amount of nitrates present in the water.

 A high nitrate level (50-100 milligrams per liter) can lead to an overgrowth of algae that decreases the amount of oxygen present in the water. This is bad for the native wildlife trying to survive., The temperature of the stream is another important parameter for the organisms living in the stream. Temperature is variable over time and therefore should be measured daily over a few weeks to months. Use a thermometer to take measurements at the same time of day for the most accurate results.The ideal temperature range for a stream is 10°C-14.9°C (50°F-58°F). Streams in the range of 5°C -9.9°C (41°F-50°F) or 15°C -19.9°C (59°F-68°F) are still okay but can be stressful for some life trying to survive. Anything above or below these ranges can be very difficult for wildlife to survive in. 


, Water velocity is an important factor that affects the organisms that live in the stream. Organisms are specially adapted to extract oxygen and nutrients from a flowing stream, but if the water doesn’t flow fast enough, there may not be enough nutrients and oxygen. Slow flowing streams are not ideal because the oxygen is restricted which can lead to fluctuations in pH and temperature.Flow rate can be difficult to determine because the velocity of the water will be different in various parts of the stream. Rocks and plant life can also serve as obstructions slowing down the water. Try to select an area with few obstructions to monitor over time. 

 To calculate the flow rate, set up a start and stop point along the stream. Measure the distance between the start and stop point. Place a small, buoyant object on top of the stream and let it float down the stream. Time how long it takes the object to float between the start and stop point. Divide the distance by time to get the velocity in meters per second: FlowRate=distanceobjecttraveled/timeittooktotravelthatdistance{\displaystyle FlowRate=distanceobjecttraveled/timeittooktotravelthatdistance}.

 The ideal range for a stream is 0.3–0.69 meters (1–2 ft) per second. 	


, This is also known as assessing the turbidity of the water. Turbidity refers to the amount of dirt and particulate matter suspended in the water.A very turbid stream will be murky with little clarity. A stream with low turbidity will be very clear allowing you to see to the bottom. Clearer water allows sunlight to get to the plants at the bottom of the stream that need sunlight to survive.Place a meter stick into the water until you can’t see the bottom of the stick anymore. The depth that you inserted the stick until it disappeared is the depth of visibility. 

 If you can see to the bottom of the stream, it is very clear and has low turbidity. 

 If visibility is less than 35 centimeters (13.7 inches), the water clarity is very poor and something is likely contaminating the water upstream.


, Collect a small sample of water from the stream. You can use an at-home bacteria test kit to see if there are bacteria in the water. If the test kit comes back positive for bacteria, you may want to collect another sample and take it to a water testing facility to have it tested.The local water plant will be able to help you analyze the sample more thoroughly and determine what type and how much of the bacteria is present.

Observe the animal life in and around the stream.,
Identify the types of plants by the stream.,
Look for macroinvertebrates.,
Compare the presence or absence of certain species to an index of health.",How to Identify a Healthy Stream2," A healthy stream can support a diverse range of organisms. The more diverse a stream is, the healthier it is. Streams that only have a few species living in them may be indicative that the conditions in the stream are less than ideal.Start by surveying the species seen in and around the stream. 

 Use these observations to look up organisms and the conditions necessary for them to thrive. 


, Plants growing near the bank of the stream provide important shade that shelters the fish and helps regulate the temperature of the water. Leaves falling into the stream also provide food for invertebrates. Vegetation is essential for filtering runoff before it enters the stream.A healthy stream will have native trees, shrubs, and wetland vegetation growing on its banks. 

 Grass, weeds, and short tussock plants do not provide the shelter and filtration that tall plants do and can lead to an unhealthy stream. 


, Macroinvertebrates such as snails, worms, mollusks, leeches, crustaceans, and insects are essential to the health of a stream. Not only do they serve as food for larger animals, but they also serves as the “janitors” of a stream. They recycle decomposing nutrients and help support the ecosystem of the stream.Macroinvertebrates are very sensitive to changes in the environment such as oxygen levels, pH changes, and pollution. 


, The presence, absence, or dominance of a particular species can be compared to an index of health and used to assess the health of the stream. Use the observations of the flora and fauna around the stream to determine the health of the stream.

 The absence of plants and animals around the stream bed will indicate that the stream is unhealthy as it cannot support this type of life. 

 The dominance of aquatic worms, leeches, pouch snails, and midge larva (pollution tolerant) and the absence of mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies (pollution sensitive) also indicate an unhealthy stream."

Get your feet wet.,
If no organizations in your area exist, build one.,
Pick up litter.,
Help identify invasive species.,
Encourage others to think about nature.,
Do not under value the hand written letter.,
If the local government is not addressing issues, try to spotlight them.",How to Care for Local Nature," There may be something already in progress you can lend a hand to often local forest preserves and community parks will have activities to help preserve your local nature. If you want an idea of how healthy your local area is, try joining or starting a local wild life monitoring group. The lack of presence of various animals tell you a lot about the habitat. Joining a monitoring group gives you a lot of flexibility, you usually get assigned a location to monitor, and get to visit any time with in the various seasons.


Frog monitoring: Frogs have very porous skin and chemical levels in run off and rainwater can affect them easily. If you have good levels of certain frogs it means you have a good environment.
Butterfly monitoring: Butterflies are a great indicator of the over all health of the environment. They are much easier to spot than other invertebrates, but are effected by pollutants in similar ways. So a low population of butterflies means a low population of invertebrates, which can throw off the eco-system, inviting scavengers like rats, and indicate harmful air or soil toxins.Earthworm monitoring: Another fun monitoring group, this one focuses on the health of soil in the area and is recommended for all ages. Again these critters are easily effected by man made chemicals, and locating good populations is a good indicator of bio diversity.
There are hundreds of options when trying to join a group involved with help out your local nature, the best thing to keep in mind is what you enjoy, and what works with your scheduled.;
, Even if what you had in mind isn't currently been working on, you can meet like minded people who may know a group of individuals that have more knowledge or would be able to help in your cause. If you are interested in the current projects, an info session or a training session is the best place to meet others, to ask questions and further your knowledge.

, The best way to care for local nature is to get your hands dirty. From volunteering at local wild life sanctuaries to harvesting seeds at conservation centers, there are a lot of hands needed and you don't need to be an expert to join in.

, Talk to the municipality(city council). Get local school involvement, volunteer hours look great on college applications and job applications for that matter. Get a network built, if your friends know someone who can really get the ball rolling, heck if the guy at the coffee shop does, you can get a lot of support behind your movement. Your organization doesn't have to be huge however, a simple group writing letters to local government can make a big impact.

, If each person walking down a path picked up just one piece of litter to dispose of properly, there would be no litter. Make a little goal to go for a walk once a day and keep nature in your mind. Pick up a wrapper here, pull an invasive plant species, and try to repair damages that you may find.

, For things like invasive species, the local organizations may not know about it or how severe it is. Jotting down a note or taking a picture to try to identify an invasive species can help motivate individuals to address this issue.

, Something as small as mentioning a local flower that a neighbor should keep an eye out for can get some attention.

, A lot of nature lovers would rather stay out of politics, but it's important your local government knows this is something that is important to you. If your local representative knows this is something the citizens want they may be able to aid in starting committees, providing funds for local groups and more.

, Organize a local fundraiser, and send the governor an invite. Who can resist a bake sale, or a local festival. Creating social media pages is also a great way to get local knowledge out and some wide scale recognition.

You should make the hole a little less than halfway down the cup. This is where your cup will connect to the center cup.Note to kids: use scissors under adult supervision.;
, Ideally, these holes will be evenly spaced around the top of the cup, just under the lip. This will help the anemometer stay balanced as it turns. The holes should be the same size as those you cut into the four outer cups., Make this hole large enough to insert a pencil or other small pole. It should be exactly in the center of the cup’s base. This hole will allow you to set the center post in your anemometer., Push the straw through the hole of the outer cup until it reaches the opposite edge. Then bend the end of the straw down against the inside edge of the cup. Staple the straw into place. Repeat this process for a second cup, but not for all four cups.The last two cups will be assembled differently.
For children: have a responsible adult present for stapling.

, Each straw should enter at one side of the center cup and exit on the opposite side through two of the top holes. The straws should cross in the middle and form an “X” in the center of the cup. Be sure to center the straw so that there is the same length of straw on each side of the cup.These are the straws that are already attached to two outer cups. Don’t forget to account for the length of straw that is inside your two outer cups.

, First, slide the cups onto the straws. Make sure that the straw goes all the way to the opposite edge of the cup. Bend down the end of the straw like you did for the first two cups and staple it.Now all four cups should be identical and they should all be attached to the center cup at an equal distance and facing the same direction.

, It doesn’t matter which cup you mark, Choose one and place an “X” on it. This will make it easier for you to count the number of turns your anemometer makes in the wind., The center post can be made from a pencil or small pole. It should go up through the bottom hole of the center cup until it touches the straws. If you are using a pencil, make sure that the eraser is on top (touching the straws) and the sharp end is on the bottom.If you aren’t using a pencil, use a pole that is soft enough to push a pin through.

, A small pin or tack should be used to fasten the straws to the center post. This will prevent the straws from moving side to side as the wind pushes on the outer cups. The pin should be pushed down from the top through both straws and into the center post.Push the pin down securely, but not so much so that it prevents the straws from being able to rotate around this pivot point.

, Have them drive down a street that isn’t busy at ten miles per hour. This will create a steady and controlled amount of wind. Try to calibrate your anemometer on a day that is not very windy, as natural wind could alter the results.Do not attempt to drive and calibrate the anemometer alone.

, Grasping only the center post, hold the anemometer out the window. Make sure that there is plenty of clearance and that you will not hit your arm on something (e.g. another car). Be careful not to drop the anemometer., Watch the anemometer for fifteen seconds. Watch to see how many times the cup with the “X” passes you. This will be the number of revolutions that correspond to a ten miles per hour wind., Calibrate your anemometer to several different speeds. Write down the number of rotations the anemometer makes in fifteen seconds at each speed. Put the speeds and their corresponding revolutions into a chart so that you can easily identify different wind speeds."

Have the students research the positive interconnections between farming and biodiversity.,
Explore the ways in which agricultural activities that promote and protect biodiversity.",How to Teach About the Effects of Agriculture on Biodiversity," Using pesticides can have unexpected and unwanted side effects. Often, the same chemicals that farmers apply to get rid of crop pests harm other species living around the farm. Some of these species may actually help to control the real crop pests! For example, DDT (Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane) is a powerful pesticide that is poisonous to not only insects, but also animals and humans. DDT is so powerful it was banned in many countries, however, some countries that face malaria problems still use it to kill mosquitoes.;
, If farmers are not careful in their use of natural resources, farming activities can decrease the amount of resources available to grow food. When there are not enough nutrients in the soil, farmers often buy chemical fertilizers. Using fertilizers can help grow more food, but using too much can pollute the water. Polluted water affects organisms that drink the water or that live in it. For example, too many pollutants can kill fish. Water pollutants also affect our health, as it decreases the amount of clean water to drink, wash and grow crops.

, Some industrial farms mass-produce a few select breeds in their quest to produce more meat, milk or eggs. This practice, however, leads to a decline in livestock diversity. The same principle applies to crops. As the number of varieties decreases, existing crops become increasingly at risk to destruction by disease and pests. If crops are all identical, it is much easier for a new disease or pest to wipe out an entire harvest. The less diversity farmers maintain, the greater the risk of diseases and pests. This increase in risk means farmers apply more pesticides to the crop fields or administer antibiotics to the animals.

, Farming usually changes the landscape, the water, the air and biodiversity. For example:


Construction workers build roads so that trucks can pick up farm produce and take it to markets.
When farmers cut trees to create space for growing crops or raising livestock, they also reduce natural water filtration (cleaning) and available habitats for many species.

Tractors and other farm machinery emit air pollutants.
In some areas, farming brings enormous changes to the landscape. In parts of the Amazon, large tracts of forests have been cut down and replaced by monoculture (one crop) farming or pastures for cattle grazing. These changes reduce the number and variety of habitats available for species. Without suitable habitats, hundreds of species, including trees, vines, plants, birds, snakes, frogs and mammals, can no longer live in the area. The end result is a loss of biodiversity.

, There are also many positive examples of how farmers find a perfect balance between agriculture and biodiversity. For instance:


In some areas, the land does not change much. Some farmers use the landscape as it is. For example, grasslands are natural pastures for many farm animals or wild herbivores. Many farmers do not fence in these natural pastures so that wild herbivores can use them too. Leaving the pastures open can be risky – carnivores may prey on farm animals.
Other farmers design their farms to minimize changes to the natural landscape. They might even try to enhance biodiversity on and around the farm. They can promote biodiversity by using sustainable farming methods such as including both plants and trees in one field, using little or no pesticides and planting a variety of crops.

, There are numerous ways that farming can promote biodiversity conservation. Here are just a few of them:


Farmers who choose to spray chemicals, can make sure to always follow the instructions carefully to minimize the damage to other harmless species.
Rotate crops. When farmers are careful and manage resources sustainably, they can help preserve biodiversity and the environment. Many farmers around the world use sustainable farming and organic or ecological farming methods. One method is to grow two or more crops in the same field. This helps the farmer reduce crop pests while using fewer pesticides. Another method is to avoid applying pesticides on rainy or windy days so less pesticide will enter waterways causing pollution or get blown away.
Use trees as part of regular farming practice. Trees can act as natural water filters. Their roots absorb rainwater, and minimize the amount of runoff entering rivers and lakes. Runoff often carries pesticides from farmers’ fields that can damage aquatic ecosystems.
Keep the soil filled with beneficial organisms. A handful of farm dirt is rich in biodiversity. Soil biodiversity includes animals, bacteria, fungi and even the roots of plants growing above. Soils form complex ecosystems that make farming possible. There are millions of organisms that live in soil — microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, and macroorganisms, such as worms, mites, ants and spiders. These organisms can help farmers to reduce the negative effects of farming. When they eat and dig underground, earthworms, termites and other burrowing organisms mix the upper layers, redistribute nutrients and increase the amount of water absorbed by the soil. Some macroorganisms are critical to local farming techniques. Farmers in Burkina Faso and in other areas of West Africa encourage termites to live and burrow in their farm plots because they improve the soil.

You should become familiar with the boundaries of the area, any prominent topographical features found inside your area, and any anthropogenic development within your survey area. Familiarity becomes more important with larger area or when you are conducting a survey in a wilderness area.;
, It is much easier to use quadrants rather than transects when using a recorder. Each quadrant should have an area of 500 m if the space will allow. This will insure that no two sampling sites are to close together and limits the possibility of recording the same individual multiple times.

, After the area is sectioned off into quadrants each section should be assigned a number. You can then run the numbered sections through a random number generator to find the sections that will be used for recording. All recording should be done in the center of the selected quadrant.

, It is important to be on your research site at 15 minutes before first light. Some neo-tropical birds sing only 1-3 songs in the first 5 minutes of daylight

, When you arrive in your survey area you should assemble and test all of your equipment to ensure that there is nothing missing, broken, and that you have fresh batteries in your recorder.

, When moving to your recording site it is important to be as quiet as possible and not to move too fast. Fast and loud movements will alarm birds and scare them out of the area. Once you reach your recording site quietly find a comfortable position and sit silently for at least 5-10 minutes. It can take up to 15 minutes for birds that may have been scared off or alarmed by your presence to move back into the area.

, During your recording you should not be making any noise that can disrupt the bird songs and calls. You should record in a circular pattern using the directional microphone to record in each direction for about 3-4 minutes. Each site should be recorded for roughly 30 minutes to ensure a large data set. When your recording is complete at that site quietly leave site and start moving to your next site.

, It is recommended that you use an audio program that allows you to splice and edit the recorded track to identify individual bird species .List species in the order in which they were recorded

, Separate your list into groups of 5 keeping each recorded species in the order in which they were recorded. For example, if you recorded 2 Spotted Towhee, 3 American robin, then 2 American Crow, 1 Song Sparrow, 2 Spotted Towhee your list would look something like this;



Group 1

Spotted Towhee
Spotted Towhee
American Robin
American Robin
American Robin



Group 2

American Crow
American Crow
Song Sparrow
Spotted Towhee
Spotted Towhee



, The groups that you have collected will be represented in the X axis.The Y axis will represent each new species recorded.


Given the list above your first point would be 5 because there are 5 new species recorded. Your second point would only be 2 because there are only 2 new species represented in that group. Continue plotting in this pattern until no new species has been represented in a consecutive 5-6 groups.

The easiest way to measure humidity is to buy a Hygrometer.,
The simplest way to test a Hygrometer for accuracy is the damp cloth test.,
A more accurate way to measure hygrometer accuracy (or to help calibrate accuracy) is the ""Salt Test."",
For advanced applications, you can use the salt test with other related elements, each of which has their own readings.,
Buy a psychrometer.,
Make your own sling psychrometer.,
The Dewcheck is a very advanced temperature and humidity monitoring device for industrial applications.,
The Dewcheck comes with a USB device, so the data can be easily exported.,
Before using the Dewcheck, you need to program in the tolerances.",How to Calculate Humidity," Hygrometers measure humidity from 0% (dry) to 100% (when any more moisture comes out as precipitation or fog.)


Relative Humidity (RH) can change throughout the day. Colder air holds less moisture, so the RH level will normally be higher at night. This is why Air Conditioned environments tend to be so dry.
Prices of Hygrometers can range from very cheap, to very expensive.

You would want a more expensive Hygrometer if you are using it for care of expensive things or need a more precise reading. When purchasing a hygrometer, you get what you pay for, within reason. Weather forecasters, museum curators, cigar collectors, tropical lizard owners, technicians working on HVAC systems, acoustic guitar collectors, and owners of antique Stradivarius Violins want a high quality hygrometer to protect their investments.
If you simply want to make sure your basement is not too wet, or someone's room is comfortable when they have a cold, a cheap hygrometer will do.
Even if you are OK with the inaccuracy of a cheaper hygrometer, there is another problem: cheap hygrometers can break, and you might not notice. For example, if you are measuring humidity in your basement, and you never go in your basement, a broken hygrometer would be a problem.


There are both digital and analog hygrometers.

If you need to create a system where a humidifier turns on when the humidity hits a certain level, you want a digital one.
Many guitar players will buy a nice analog hygrometer to put in their guitar case. The digital ones would not look nice paired with an acoustic guitar.

;
, Simply wrap a damp cloth around it and leave it for a few hours. It should read ~95%.


Note for cheaper electronic hygrometers, the damp cloth test can make readings incorrect for hours or days afterwards. Higher quality gauges will have a very short time till they are accurate.

, The Salt Test is more accurate, but not appropriate for the most demanding applications.


Take a ziplock bag and place your hygrometer(s) into the bag, face up. Then you will take a bottle cap (plastic 2 liter cap works well) and pour some standard table salt into the cap. Next you will add a small amount of distilled water, until the salt is the consistency of slushy snow. Close the bag very tightly. After twelve hours, it should read 75%.

If your hygrometer reads 80%, for example, that means its calibrated 5% too high.
You may need to take more than one reading to confirm it is consistent.



,


For example, you can also use Magnesium Chloride and Lithium Chloride rather than Table Salt (Sodium Chloride.). Magnesium Chloride hits equilibrium at 33%, Lithium Chloride at 11%. Additional ingredients mentioned should be used based on your experience with chemistry.

, For more advanced applications, you may choose an electronic psychrometer, or even a DewCheck instead. For educational purposes, Sling Psychrometers are recommended because they are fun for students.


Field-piece and General Tools are two reputable electronic psychrometer manufacturers.

,


Get two thermometers.
Use one of the thermometers to take the current temperature and write it down.
Put something wet like wet cotton on the bulb (the bottom bit of the thermometer).
Turn the fan on to blow against the thermometer, wait till the temperature stops falling then record it.

Learn the different types of clouds.,
Know what high clouds are.,
Know your mid-level clouds.These clouds form bases at an elevation of about 6,500 to 20,000 feet (1,981.2 to 6,096.0 m).,
Know your low clouds.,
Know your other clouds.",How to Forecast the Weather Using Clouds1," Take a bit of time to understand what clouds are and how different types suggest changes in weather. The basic kinds are cirrus, cumulus, nimbus, and stratus.;
, These clouds form bases at an elevation of about 20,000 feet (6,096.0 m) above sea level. These clouds are usually composed of ice crystals only.


Learn how to identify and analyze cirrus clouds. Cirrus clouds are the most abundant of all high level clouds. They are made out of ice and are thin, wispy clouds blown in high winds and gusts into long streamers. These feathery clouds usually spread across the sky. Although single or maybe a few cirrus clouds can indicate that there is fair weather coming, a gradually increasing cover of cirrus clouds may show that an approaching warm front is coming. By observing the movement of cirrus clouds you can tell from which direction the weather is coming. When you see cirrus clouds, it usually indicates that a change in the weather will occur within about 24 hours.
Learn about cirro-cumulus clouds. These clouds look like ripples or are grainy in appearance. When cirrus clouds begin to be turned into cirro-cumulus clouds, a storm may be on its way. Cirro-cumulus clouds are usually seen in the winter and show fair, but cold weather. In tropical regions, they may indicate an oncoming hurricane.
Learn how to identify cirro-stratus clouds. These clouds look like thin sheets that spread themselves across the sky. At times, they do not look to be different clouds at all; however, they give the sky a pale, white-like appearance. These clouds can indicate the coming of rain. Often, these clouds are thin enough that the sun and moon can be seen through them. Cirro-stratus clouds usually come about 12-24 hours before a rain or snowstorm.

, They are mostly made of water droplets, but can also contain ice crystals. These clouds are most often seen as uniformly bluish-grey sheets that cover all or most of the sky. At times, they are so thick that they obscure the Sun, which then appears as nothing more than a light area in the sky.


Be able to recognize alto-cumulus clouds. Alto-cumulus clouds are mid-level clouds that are composed of water droplets and appear as grey, puffy, irregular objects. These clouds most often are seen in recognizable layers of puffy, round, small clouds. If you see alto-cumulus clouds on a warm, humid, or sticky morning, be prepared to observe thunderstorms late in the afternoon. A similar type of cloud, alto-stratus clouds, often appear a few hours ahead of a warm front that brings precipitation.

, These clouds form bases below 6,500 feet (1,981.2 m) in elevation. They mostly are made of little drops of water only and rarely contain ice.


Study up on cumulus clouds. Cumulus clouds are usually called ""fair-weather clouds"" and are the fluffy clouds you see on a mostly-sunny day. The bottom of each cloud is generally flat, and the top of each cloud has rounded stacks, which often appear puffy. Cumulus clouds look like white cotton balls and usually show that fair, dry conditions. Fair-weather cumulus clouds only last for a short time. When they make showers, the precipitation is most often light and simple, sometimes only lasting for a few minutes.
Know what cumulonimbus clouds mean. Cumulonimbus clouds are thunder clouds. High winds can make the cloud's top flatten into an anvil-like shape. Also called thunderheads, cumulonimbus clouds have bottoms that are usually dark. These clouds can forecast some of the most extreme weather, including heavy rain, hail, or snow, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. The anvil usually points in the direction the storm is moving.
Be able to recognize a funnel cloud. A funnel cloud is a tapering form of a cloud coming from the base of a larger cloud. This is a classic sign showing that a tornado is soon to occur. The tornado forms when the clouds reaches the ground with a violent wind speed and a cloud of debris around it.
Identify stratus clouds. Stratus clouds are grayish clouds that often stretch across and block the entire sky with a dull grey color. They look like fog that is not on the ground. This is called overcast. If their bottoms reach the ground, they become fog. Stratus clouds produce only drizzle or fine snow, if anything at all.
Analyze strato-cumulus clouds. Strato-cumulus clouds are low, puffy, and gray. Most form in rows with blue sky visible in between them. Rain rarely occurs with strato-cumulus clouds; however, they can turn into nimbo-stratus clouds. A sky full of strato-cumulus clouds indicates dry weather, a small difference in temperature from day to night, and sometimes light precipitation.
Nimbo-stratus clouds form a dark gray, wet-looking cloudy layer that is so thick that it completely blocks out the sun. They often produce precipitation in the form of rain and/or snow. The precipitation can be long lasting.

, There exists a group of clouds, rarely or occasionally observed. Despite their lack of categorization, they can still predict weather well.

The clouds that look like hanging bulges from the skies are called mammatus clouds. These clouds are formed by sinking air and mean that a storm is going away.






Fog is made up of billions of practically microscopic water droplets. It occurs if the atmosphere's ability to be seen near the Earth's surface is reduced to 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) or less. This can indicate various weather, usually cloudy and cold and sometimes rainy.






Green clouds are usually related to severe weather. The color is formed by light reflected from green vegetation, such as a cornfield or a very thick forest. They often predict hurricanes and tornadoes.






Nacreous clouds resemble pale cirrus in daytime, but after sunset, are characterized by brilliant colors. They occur at altitudes between 21 and 30 kilometers (70,000 and 100,000 feet). The physical constitution of nacreous clouds is still unknown. However, the simultaneous occurrence of various diffraction colors in more or less irregular patterns indicates the presence of minute particles, possibly spherical ice particles.






Noctilucent clouds also resemble thin cirrus, but usually with a bluish, silvery, or sometimes orange to red color that stands out against a dark sky. Measurements have shown that their altitude ranges from 75 to 90 kilometers (250,000 to 300,000 feet). Their physical composition is also unknown, but they are believed to be composed of fine, cosmic dust particles possibly with a thin, outer layer of ice. Noctilucent clouds become visible after sunset. They are at first grayish, then more brilliant and, as time advances, they appear bluish white like tarnished silver.






Billow clouds are formed from the state of being unstable that is associated with air-flows. This often shows that a front, either cold or warm, is probably coming in.

Measure the temperature T. Use a thermometer or look up your location's current outdoor temperature on a weather prediction website.,
Look up or measure wind speed, V. You can find wind speed estimates for your area on most weather prediction websites, or by searching for ""wind speed + (the name of your town)"" online.,
Enter these values into the formula.,
Adjust for sunshine.,
Understand wind chill.",How to Calculate Wind Chill1," You can measure this in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius, but read the next step carefully so you know which unit to use for wind speed.


Wind chill is undefined for temperatures above 50ºF (10ºC). If the temperature is higher, wind doesn't have much effect on apparent temperature.;
, If you have an anemometer or make one using the instructions below, you can measure the wind speed yourself. If your temperature measurement used ºF, use the wind speed measurement in miles per hour (mph). If you used ºC, use kilometers per hour (km/h) instead.If necessary, use this website to convert from knots to km/h.


If you're using an official wind speed measurement taken at 33 ft (10 m), multiply it by 0.75 to get a rough estimate of the wind speed at 5 ft (1.5 m), a typical height for a human face.Wind below 3 mph (4.8 km/h) does not have a significant wind chill effect., There have been several wind chill formulas over the years and in different regions, but we'll use the one currently used by the UK, US, and Canada, created by an international team of researchers.Plug in your numbers to the formula below, replacing T with the temperature and V with the wind speed:If using ºF and mph: Wind chill temperature = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75V0.16 + 0.4275TV0.16

If using ºC and km/h: Wind chill temperature = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V0.16 + 0.3965TV0.16


, Bright sunshine can raise the apparent temperature by as much as +10 to +18ºF (+5.6 to +10ºC).There's no official formula to measure this effect, but be aware that sunlight will make the air seem warmer than the wind chill formula suggests.

, Wind chill is an invented concept that describes how wind increases heat loss on exposed skin. In extreme conditions, this can be a major factor in how soon frostbite sets in. At a wind chill temperature below –19ºF (-28ºC), frostbite will occur on exposed skin within 15 minutes or less.Below -58ºF (-50ºC), exposed skin can freeze within 30 seconds."

Gather your materials.,
Cut the end off the rubber balloon.,
Stretch the rubber balloon tightly around the mouth of the container.,
Cut a small arrow out of construction paper to attach to the straw.,
Glue two straws or coffee stirrers together.,
Glue the straw or coffee stirrer arm to the middle of the balloon.,
Label the index card with a weather gauge.,
Arrange the barometer so that the arrow points to the weather gauge index card.,
Observe the pressure changes from your barometer.",How to Build a Barometer1," To make a tin can barometer, you will need a tin can, a balloon, a rubber band, glue, two plastic straws or coffee stirrers, construction paper, and an index card.Most of these items should be easily found around the home.


If you don’t have a tin can, any container with a large-mouth (diameter of 1.5 -2 inches), plastic or glass, will work for this barometer. A bottle with a narrow mouth will not work.
A rubber or latex glove will also work in place of a balloon.;
, You will use the balloon (or glove) to cover the mouth of your container. In order to get a piece that will stretch over the mouth, you must first cut the end off the balloon. Snip off the entire straight/narrow part of the balloon, just below where the round part of the balloon begins.If you are using a rubber glove, cut off the fingers of the glove and cut the glove down one of the sides so you have a flat piece of glove that can cover the entire mouth of your container.

, Slide the balloon onto the wide-mouthed bottle or jar so that it is stretched completely flat across the mouth of the container. Secure the balloon in place with a rubber band around the sides.


Ensure the seal is tight around the rubber band and that no air is leaking into or out of the container., Draw and cut out an arrow small enough to fit into the end of the straw. Alternatively, if you are using a coffee stirrer, cut it small enough to glue onto the end of the stirrer. This arrow will help you determine the relative pressure more accurately.

, The more length of arm that extends past the edge of the container, the more accurate your relative pressure readings will be. To extend the length of the arm, stick one straw inside another and glue or tape them together. If you are using coffee stirrers, simply glue or tape two of them together.


Make sure the arm is still straight and doesn’t bend at the join between the two pieces.
Use sticks which are very light (drinking straws are perfect for this project) so that the weight of the stick does not cause the rubber to stretch.

, Place a small dab of white craft glue in the center of the balloon and place the end without the arrow into the glue. Place a small piece of tape over the arm to hold the straw in place while the glue sets.


After the glue is dry, you can remove the tape.

, Make a mark in the middle of the card where the arm points when it is directly horizontal. Above the middle line, draw an arrow pointing up and write “High Pressure”. Below the middle line, draw an arrow pointing down and write “Low Pressure”.


When the arm points toward “High Pressure”, the weather is usually sunny with clear skies.
When the arm points toward “Low Pressure”, the weather is likely cloudy and/or rainy.
Tape the index card to the wall next to the barometer.

, Place the barometer in a place away from activity where no one can knock it over. Arrange it so that the end of the arm points horizontally at the center of the index card weather gauge.

, When the pressure increases, the balloon over the can will deflate. This will cause the arm to point up towards “High Pressure”. When air pressure decreases, the balloon will inflate causing the arm to point down towards “Low Pressure”.Although this barometer cannot tell you the exact air pressure, you will still be able to determine the relative air pressure and predict the weather outside!

Take calculus, physics, chemistry, and earth science.
Hone your writing skills in English classes. Being a scientist means writing research papers and lab reports. If you become a meteorologist on a television station, you will have to communicate clearly.;
, Meteorologists use computers to help with their research and weather predictions. They work with computer programs and computer models when doing research.You need a deep understanding of computers and technology to pursue a career in this field.

, Meteorologists receive a bachelor's of science degree in meteorology or atmospheric sciences.


In college, you will take math and science classes, such as calculus, physics, dynamics, synoptics, and some computer programming courses.Some meteorologists receive degrees which combine meteorology with other scientific fields, such as chemistry, geology, oceanography, physics, or statistics.It may be beneficial to take computer science classes during your degrees, too.If you want to be a TV meteorologist, take classes in journalism, speech, or other media-related fields.
If you want to start working for the government right after your bachelor's degree, you will have to have completed courses which fall under strict guidelines.You must have at least 24 credit hours of atmospheric science or meteorology.

, Depending on the job you want, you may need to get a master's or Ph.D. Most meteorologists get degrees in related, interdisciplinary subjects. Some even get two master's in different sciences. Some graduate degree programs encourage bachelor's in a field like math or computer science instead of meteorology.Many higher level positions require at least a master's. If you want to do research, you will need a Ph.D.There are about 100 undergraduate and graduate programs for meteorology., A good way to get experience at any point during your schooling - whether it's in high school, your bachelor's, or your graduate work - is to become an intern. Look for internships with local meteorologists. This will give you valuable hands on experience that can be put on applications and CVs.If you can't get an internship, see if you can shadow them.

, In addition to forecasting the weather, meteorologists study the characteristics and processes of the atmosphere and how they affect the environment. They also study climate and climate changes. There are many different kinds of meteorologists.


An operational meteorologist is responsible for forecasting the weather.
A climatologist gathers and examines the seasonal changes that occur over time such as months or years.
A physical meteorologist conducts research on the atmosphere and different physical properties.
A synoptic meteorologist uses mathematical models and creates different tools such as software for forecasting weather.
An environmental meteorologist studies problems like air pollution that affects the Earth's atmosphere., There are multiple places you can find jobs in meteorology. Each kind of work requires slightly different backgrounds, but graduate degrees can help you have a better chance getting jobs and receiving promotions.You can work for government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, NASA, NOAA, or the National Weather Service.You can work for a television station, such as a local news network, a national network like CNN, Fox News, or MSNBC, or for The Weather Channel.
You can also find work in the private sector. Many companies pay meteorologists to help figure out how climate and weather patterns will affect their business. Meteorologists can also get jobs dealing with agriculture or air pollution.Airlines use weather forecasters to help them plan flights. Shipping and insurance companies may also hire meteorological consultants.You may also be interested in being a forensic meteorologist. This job provides meteorological information, data, and consulting for legal cases., The American Meteorological Society offers certification programs for certain specializations and areas of interest for meteorologists. Some of these programs include broadcasting and consulting.The American Meteorological Society offers Certified Broadcast Meteorologist credentials for meteorologists working in radio and television. The certification requires you to have a bachelor's degree in meteorology and you need to submit examples of your work to qualify. You must then pass an examination.

, Some organizations require you to get training upon employment. For example, the National Weather Service requires employees to complete 200 hours of on-the-job training per year for 2 years.Be prepared to receive more training and experience if you plan to obtain an entry-level position working for the federal government. The federal government typically places you in intern positions where you work in different offices learning about forecasting and weather systems. You're assigned to a duty station once the training is complete.

, One way to network, meet people, and learn about new research is to go to conferences. Meteorological societies, such as the American Meteorological Society, sponsor conferences where meteorologists can present papers and research.


This also can lead to publication in professional journals., Start searching online for job opportunities. Investigate job opportunities in the private sector for consulting jobs and apply. Try looking for jobs at news stations. You can start working at a small news station before advancing to a larger one.


Look for a job with the federal government. The National Weather Service has stations located throughout the country. The U.S. Department of Defense also hires meteorologists.
Seek job matching opportunities. Some universities and meteorological societies offer students and members help in matching them with jobs in the private sector., Being a meteorologist is a difficult job. You have to have excellent communication skills, especially if you want to work in broadcasting. You must have strong math, science, and computer skills since you will use those on a daily basis. You will have to learn how to work in a team.


Be prepared to work in a variety of environments. Many meteorologists follow the weather, and sometimes these weather conditions are dangerous. Meteorologists will report from hurricanes, blizzards, and even tornadoes.
You need to have a flexible schedule and willing to work long hours.Look for a job with the federal government. The National Weather Service has stations located throughout the country. The U.S. Department of Defense also hires meteorologists.

Find an online wind chill calculator.,
Look up the temperature and wind speed.,
Multiply the wind speed by 0.75.,
Enter the measurements into the calculator.",How to Calculate Wind Chill2," Try the calculators at the US National Weather Service, freemathhelp.com, or onlineconversion.com.


All of these calculators use the new wind chill formula adopted by the US and other countries in 2001. If you use a different calculator, try to find one that uses this formula; the old formula can give misleading results.

, Both of these pieces of information are typically available from weather forecasts on websites, television and radio stations, and newspapers.

, Unless the forecast specifies wind speed at ground level, multiply the speed by 0.75 to get a more accurate estimate of the wind speed at the height of a human face.


This estimate is based on the standard wind speed measurement height of 33 ft (10 m), and typical atmospheric conditions.Using a wind speed measured at a height of 5 ft (1.5 m) is more accurate, but not usually available without your own anemometer.

, Make sure you select the units (such as mph or ºC) that the measurements are written in. Click ""OK"" or a similar button, and you should see the new apparent wind chill temperature.

"
Decide whether to make or buy an anemometer.,
Punch holes in small paper cups.,
Construct one half of the basic shape.,
Finish the basic shape.,
Make a base for the anemometer.,
Count the number of rotations the anemometer makes.,
Calculate the circumference.,
Calculate wind speed.",How to Calculate Wind Chill3," An anemometer is a tool for measuring wind speed. You can buy one online, or make a simple one yourself in about 30 minutes using the steps below.If you bought one, skip down to the step in which you count the rotations – or just read the wind speed directly, if yours has a digital display.

, Take four small paper cups, and punch a single hole in each one, about ½ inch (1.25 cm) below the rim. Take a fifth cup, and puncture four evenly spaced holes, about ¼ in. (6 mm) below the rim, then punch a fifth hole in the center of its base.


You can use a pencil to punch these holes, if you don't have anything sharper.

, Stick a plastic straw into a single-hole cup, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into it. Push the other end of the straw through two holes of the five-hole cup. Stick the free end of the straw into another single-hole cup. Turn the two single-hole cups so they are pointing in opposite directions, along the same plane as the straw. Staple the straw to the cup.

, Repeat with another straw, putting it through the remaining two holes of the central five-hole cup. Rotate these two new cups until each cup opening is nearer the base of the next one. In other words, the top cup points right, the right cup points down, the bottom cup points left, and the left cup points up. Staple the straws and cups together.

, Slide the two straws until all four cups are the same distance from the center. Stick a small pin through the intersection of the two straws. Stick the eraser end of a pencil through the hole in the base of the central cup, and push it gently onto the pin. You can now hold the anemometer by the pencil tip, and use it to measure wind speeds.

, Hold the anemometer upright in a windy area. Watch a single cup (draw on it with a marker if it makes it easier to follow) and count the number of times it rotates. Use a stopwatch or a friend watching the second hand of a clock to time 15 seconds, and stop you when the time is up. Multiply your count by four to get the number of revolutions per minute (rpm).


For greater accuracy, count the number of rotations in 60 seconds (and don't multiply by anything).

, Measure the distance from one edge of the anemometer to the other to find the diameter of the rotating circle, d. The circumference of the circle, is equal to πd. This is the distance traveled in one revolution.


If you don't have a calculator, you can use 3.14 as an estimate of π, or even just 3 for a rough estimate.

, Convert the circumference you calculated into a more useful unit for measuring wind speed (miles or kilometers). Multiply the result by the rpm you calculated to get the total distance traveled in one minute. Multiply the result by 60 to get the distance traveled in one hour (mph or km/h). Here are the full formulas in imperial and metric units:


Imperial: (__circumference__ inches/revolution) * (1/12 ft/inches) * (1/5280 miles/ft) * (__rpm__ revolutions/minute) * (60 minutes/hour) = __wind speed__ in miles per hour.
Metric: (__circumference__ centimeters/revolution) * (1/100000 kilometers/centimeter) * (__rpm__ revolutions/minute) * (60 minutes/hour) = __wind speed__ in kilometers per hour.

These markings will serve as a relative scale to measure changes in pressure.Number the marks starting with 1 at the top of the bottle until you reach the last mark at the bottom. The bottle will be upside down in the glass, so write the numbers with the bottle upside down.

, Using tap water, add enough water to the empty bottle until it is about half-way full. The exact amount of water added does not matter.

, This process can lead to some spilling if you’re not quick enough. The water will come out of the bottle and fill the glass part way, but the water level in the bottle will be higher than that in the glass.


If the water level in the bottle isn’t higher than in the glass, add more water to the bottle and try flipping it again.

, When air pressure increases, more water will be pushed into the bottle. For the barometer to work properly, the bottle opening needs to stay submerged in water at all times. Adding this extra water ensures that the bottle will remain submerged during pressure changes.You want the water level in the glass to be just above the lip of the bottle at all times.

, When air pressure decreases, the water level in the ketchup bottle will decrease. Lower air pressure corresponds to rainy, cloudy weather. When the air pressure increases, the water level increases inside the ketchup bottle.Higher pressure indicates sunny, clear skies.


Take note of where the water level is in the morning. Check it again in the evening to see if it has changed.
Compare the actual weather with the changes in water level. Can you predict the weather with relative changes in the water level of your barometer?

Multiply the temperature by 2.,
Subtract 10% from this number.,
Add 32 to this number.",How to Estimate Celsius Temperatures in Fahrenheit2," Find a temperature display. Look for a public clock on a building such as a bank. Many public clocks also display the temperature below the time. Ask someone to tell you the temperature if you cannot locate a thermometer or temperature display.

, Use a calculator or simply multiply the numbers in your head. Either way, you want to double this number.

, Calculate 10% by multiplying the number by 0.1. For example, 100 x 0.1. = 10. Subtract this number from the number you doubled in the first calculation. Use a calculator to perform these operations for best results.

, Take the doubled number and add 32 to it. Make use of a calculator or perform the addition in your head. This will give you a semi-precise temperature in Fahrenheit.For example:


Determine the temperature in Celsius: 20 degrees
Multiply this number by two: 20 x 2 = 40
Determine ten percent of this number: 40 x 0.1 = 4
Subtract this number from your number in step two: 40 – 4 = 36
Add thirty-two to this number: 36 + 32 = 68 degrees Fahrenheit

Look for thin stringy clouds.,
Analyze clouds for “bumps.” Cumulus clouds have a bumpy or hilly texture.,
Look for flat clouds.,
Take note of the weather.",How to Analyze a Cloud1," If you are observing clouds that look like thin strips, they belong to the cirrus family. Cirrus clouds are white and airy, They look like wisps of white smoke drifting high in the sky., They might look like pieces of cotton candy floating along. These clouds can form at the lower, middle, and upper levels of the atmosphere and are different depending on which level they are in., Stratus clouds resemble flat sheets stacked one on top of the other. Like the cumulus clouds, they can be found in all three cloud levels. Depending on how low a stratus is to the ground, it can affect the sunlight significantly., If you are observing a cloud in the rain, it is either a cumulonimbus or a nimbostratus. The nimbostratus usually comes with a steady rain. The cumulonimbus is a thunderstorm cloud. Both of these clouds derive their names from the Latin word for rain - “nimbus.”"
"
Hold your arm up at a forty-five degree angle.,
Compare the cloud to your fist.,
Compare the cloud to your thumbnail.,
Look at your smallest fingernail.",How to Analyze a Cloud2," Objects that are closer to us appear larger when compared to objects that are off in the distance. Knowing this, we can compare the sizes of two objects to see how far apart they are. Keep in mind that, since we are not using exact size measurements and angles, these distances are only estimations., Keep your arm at a forty-five degree angle and point it directly at the cloud. If the cloud is roughly the same size as your fist (or larger), it is most likely a low level cloud. A low level cumulus cloud is called a stratocumulus and exist from 0 kilometers (0.0 mi) to 2 kilometers above the ground., Your arm should remain pointed straight at the cloud at a forty-five degree angle. If the cloud is significantly smaller than your fist, it is probably above the lower level. Altocumulus clouds are mid-level cumulus clouds, ranging from 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) to 7 kilometers above the ground. From your vantage point on the ground, they can be identified as being roughly the same size as your thumbnail., Again, your arm should be extended toward the cloud at a forty-five degree angle. If the cloud in question is in the high altitude level, it will appear to be roughly the same size as your smallest fingernail. These clouds are known as cirrocumulus clouds and reside between 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) and 13 kilometers (8.1 mi) above the ground."
"
Observe the sun.,
Look for rain.,
Note the cloud’s transparency.",How to Analyze a Cloud3," While cumulus clouds float through the sky resembling puffs of cotton candy, stratus clouds are more like a sheet strewn across the sky. This makes it much more likely that they will directly cover up the sun. This coverage will look different based on the height of the cloud. Low-level stratus clouds will often block the sun’s light so much that you can’t even tell where the sun sits in the sky. The mid-level altostratus will block most of the sun’s light, but you will likely see a bright spot in the cloud where the sun is trying to shine through. Higher clouds, known as cirrostratus, are usually so thin that you can still see the sun clearly through them.Do not look directly into the sun. This can damage your eyes.

, If it is raining, you are likely seeing a low-level stratus rain cloud, or nimbostratus. It is possible for rain to fall from the mid-level altostratus, but this isn’t common. Rain does not fall from the high up cirrostratus clouds.If it is thunder storming , you are looking at a cumulonimbus, not a nimbostratus.

, Depending on the height of the cloud, you will be able to see more or less of sky through it. Low-level stratus clouds are very opaque, and you can see very little, if any, of the sky above them. Altostratus clouds appear more translucent, allowing you to glimpse just a bit of the sky above, and the cirrostratus is almost transparent."

Measure the temperature at ground level.,
Measure the dew point at ground level.,
Create a chart.,
Find the altitude where temperature and dew point intersect.",How to Analyze a Cloud4," This can be done with a thermometer. You can also look the temperature up on a computer or smartphone. You will need to know the current ground temperature to estimate temperatures high in the sky., This is the temperature where water droplets begin to form (rain or dew) at a given pressure and humidity. Knowing the dew point at ground level will allow you to estimate the dew point at higher levels. It is easiest to look this up on a computer or smartphone, but you can Measure Dew Point point using some simple tools., Atmospheric temperature and dew point temperature both decrease at a steady rate as you go up. This means that you can predict what they each will be at some distance from the ground using the current temperature and dew point at ground level. Make a chart with three columns. The first will be height, the second will be temperature and the third will be dew point.Fill in the height column starting with “Ground Level” and then each subsequent value will be an increase of 100 meters (330 ft) (100 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, etc.).
For the temperature column, the first value is your current temperature (in degrees Celsius) and for each 100 meters (330 ft) in altitude that you increase, subtract one degree (20 degrees C, 19 degrees C, etc.).
The current dew point at ground level will be your first value in the dew point column. The subsequent values are found by subtracting 0.2 °C (32.4 °F) for every 100 meters (330 ft) in altitude (15 degrees C, 14.8 degrees C, 14.6 degrees C, etc.)., When the air temperature and dew point coincide, you will form water droplets. When this happens in the atmosphere, those water droplets form clouds. The clouds you are observing will be at the altitude where your graph’s dew point and temperature values are the same."
"
Divide cloud families into species.,
Identify cloud subspecies.,
Consider special cloud formations.,
Analyze clouds as they transform.",How to Analyze a Cloud5," The “species” of a cloud is a deeper classification if it’s characteristics. For example, a cloud in the floccus species would look puffy. Clearly, not all families of clouds could have a member in this species (it actually applies only to Cirrus, Cirrocumulus, and Altocumulus clouds). , Cloud subspecies go one step further in the description of a cloud. For example, a cloud in the subspecies opacus would appear dark, or opaque, in the sky. Like cloud species, not every family may have clouds that fit the descriptor for a given subspecies (cirrus clouds will not ever fit into the opacus subspecies, as they are never dark)., Some clouds form special accessory parts that can be classified. One such example is the special “tuba” formation. This is when a cumulonimbus forms a funnel or tornado. Different cloud families are capable of different special forms., One interesting trait of clouds is that they are constantly in motion. As conditions change, cloud formations can shift from one family to another. You can observe these transformations to further classify and understand clouds."
"
Examine the clouds.,
Look for a red sky.,
Look for a rainbow in the west.,
Gaze at the moon.",How to Predict the Weather Without a Forecast1," The types of clouds in the sky, as well as the direction in which they're moving, can tell you a lot about upcoming weather. In general, clouds that are white and high indicate good weather, and clouds that are dark and low mean rain or storms are on the way. The presence of cumulonimbus clouds early in the day, with more developing throughout the day can mean there's a greater chance of severe weather occurring soon.
Mammatus clouds (formed by sinking air) can form with both severe and non-severe thunderstorms.
Cirrus clouds, or ""mare's tails,"" high in the sky like long streamers, mean bad weather is coming within the next 36 hours.
Altocumulus clouds, which are like mackerel scales, also point to bad weather coming within the next 36 hours.
Mackerel skies and mares tails formations sometimes appear in the same sky. When that happens, rain is sure to follow the next day.
Cumulus towers indicate the possibility of showers later in the day.
Nimbostratus clouds hang low and heavy in the sky, and mean rain is imminent.
Cloud cover on a winter night means you can expect warmer weather, because clouds prevent heat radiation that would lower the temperature on a clear night.;
, Remember the rhyme: ""Red sky at night, sailor's delight; Red sky at morning, sailors take warning."" Look for any sign of red in the sky (not a red sun); it will not be a bold orange or red the majority of the time, but that depends a little on where you live.


If you see a red sky during sunset (when you're looking to the west), there is a high pressure system with dry air that is stirring dust particles in the air, causing the sky to look red. Since prevailing front movements and jet streams weather usually move from west to east, the dry air is heading towards you.
A red sky in the morning (in the East, where the sun rises) means that the dry air has already moved past you, and what follows behind it (on its way towards you) is a low pressure system that carries moisture.

, This is the result of the rising sun's morning rays from the east striking moisture in the west. Most major storm fronts in the Northern Hemisphere travel west to east, and a rainbow in the west means moisture, which can mean rain is on its way. On the other hand, a rainbow in the east around sunset means that the rain is on its way out and you can look forward to sunny days. Remember: Rainbow in the morning, need for a warning., If it is reddish or pale, dust is in the air. But if the moon is bright and sharply focused, it's probably because low pressure has cleared out the dust, and low pressure means rain.


A ring around the moon (caused by light shining through cirrostratus clouds associated with warm fronts and moisture) can indicate that rain will probably fall within the next three days.
Remember the proverb: Circle around the moon, rain or snow soon.

Detect the direction of the wind.,
Make a campfire.,
Check the grass for dew at sunrise.,
Observe the leaves.,
Take a deep breath.,
Check for humidity.",How to Predict the Weather Without a Forecast2," If you are unable to immediately detect the wind's direction, throw a small piece of grass in to the air and watch its descent. Easterly winds, which blow from the east, can indicate an approaching storm front; westerly winds mean good weather. Strong winds indicate high pressure differences, which can be a sign of advancing storm fronts.

, The smoke should rise steadily. Smoke that swirls and descends is caused by low pressure, meaning rain is on the way.

, If the grass is dry, this indicates clouds or strong breezes, which can mean rain is coming. If there's dew, it probably won't rain that day. However, if it rained during the night, this method will not be reliable.

, Deciduous trees show the undersides of their leaves during unusual winds, supposedly because they grow in a way that keeps them right-side up during typical prevalent winds.

, Close your eyes and smell the air. Plants release their waste in a low pressure atmosphere, generating a smell like compost and indicating an upcoming rain.


Swamps will release gasses just before a storm because of the lower pressure, which leads to unpleasant smells.
A proverb says Flowers smell best just before a rain. Scents are stronger in moist air, associated with rainy weather., Many people can feel humidity, especially in their hair (it curls up and gets frizzy). You can also look at the leaves of oak or maple trees. These leaves tend to curl in high humidity, which tends to precede a heavy rain.


Pine cone scales remain closed if the humidity is high, but open in dry air.
Under humid conditions, wood swells (look out for those sticky doors) and salt clumps.

Take note of the birds.,
Pay attention to the cows.,
Look at ants' hills.,
Watch nearby turtles.",How to Predict the Weather Without a Forecast3," If they are flying high in the sky, there will probably be fair weather. Falling air pressure caused by an imminent storm causes discomfort in birds' ears, so they fly low to alleviate it. Large numbers of birds roosting on power lines indicates swiftly falling air pressure.


Seagulls tend to stop flying and take refuge at the coast if a storm is coming.
Birds get very quiet immediately before it rains.

, They will typically lie down before a thunderstorm. They also tend to stay close together if bad weather's on the way.

, Some say ants build their hills with very steep sides just before a rain.

, It is said that they often search for higher ground when a large amount of rain is expected. You may see them in the road 1 to 2 days before a rain.

"
"
Learn the key prediction principles.,
Be observant.",How to Predict the Weather Without a Forecast4," Every prediction method is based on the same principles: low pressure brings rain, and major weather systems move from west to east. Predicting the weather is all about recognizing the signs of pressure change in your area.


While prevailing systems may move from west to east, for example, individual storms in a particular region may not, due to local weather phenomena.

, By forming hypotheses, and testing your predictions, you can fine-tune your weather predicting abilities beyond what any article could ever instruct.


Long-term residents who spend a great deal of their time outdoors, particularly farmers, commercial fishermen and the like, learn to observe trends that give them clues to long term weather patterns and seasonal changes in their specific geographical location.
Pay attention to the unique flora and fauna in your region. Start noticing patterns that lead you to understand the weather patterns better.

, High pressure implies dry weather and low pressure is usually associated with humid air-perhaps precipitating.A high pressure system is an air mass that contains denser air because its air is cooler and/or dryer than the surrounding air. Thus, its heavier air falls downward and away from the pressure system's center -like water being poured onto the ground. With high pressure systems, the weather will tend to become clear or clearing.
A low pressure system is an air mass that has less dense air because its air is moister and/or warmer. Surrounding air draws inward toward the low system's center as the lighter air balloons upward, often causing clouds or precipitation because that moist air cools as it rises. You see this effect when air's invisible water vapor is forced to condense into droplets when it contacts the outside of a cold glass). But droplets won't form if the glass is only slightly cool ...thus, rising low pressure air will only produce rain if it gets up where the air is cool enough to condense the water vapor into droplets too heavy to be kept aloft by the rising air. (Clouds are simply water droplets that are small enough to be kept aloft).
With very low pressure systems, storms are on the way (if they aren't there already) Clouds begin to form and move across the sky -thunderhead clouds forming when moist air is thrust very high. Sometimes tornadoes form when very high pressure air collides with very warm, moist low pressure air.

, Watch out for one on the TV news, online, or in your local newspaper. (Other sources may include magazines and books, but they may not be current.) Newspapers are a convenient method to find a weather map as they are cheap, reliable, and can be cut apart so you can carry them with you while learning to interpret the symbols., If possible, find a map covering a smaller area – these can be easier to interpret. Focusing on a larger scale may be difficult for a beginner. On the map, notice the location, lines, arrows, patterns, colors, and numbers. Every sign counts and all are different.

, This is the weight or pressure the air exerts on the ground and is measured in millibars. It is important to be able to read air pressure because pressure systems are associated with certain weather patterns.


The average air pressure system measures 1013 mb (29.92 inches of mercury).A typical strong high pressure system measures around 1030 mb (30.42 inches of mercury).
A typical low pressure system measures around 1000 mb (29.54 inches of mercury.

, To read air pressure on a surface analysis weather map, check for isobars (iso = equal, bar = pressure) – plain, curved lines that indicate areas of equal air pressure. Isobars play a major role in determining the speed and direction of wind.When the isobars form concentric closed (but not always round) circles, the smallest circle in the center indicates a pressure center. This can be either a high-pressure system (depicted by an ""H"" in English, ""A"" in Spanish) or a low pressure system (depicted by an ""L"" in English, ""B"" in Spanish).Air does not flow ""down"" pressure gradients; it flows ""around"" them due to the Coriolis effect (Earth spinning). Hence, wind direction is indicated by the isobars, counterclockwise around lows (cyclonic flow) and clockwise around highs (anticyclonic) in the northern hemisphere, thus creating wind. The closer the isobars are to one another, the stronger the winds.

, These storms are characterized by increased cloudiness, winds, temperatures, and chance of precipitation. They are represented on a weather map by isobars that are close together with arrows traveling clockwise (Southern Hemisphere) or counter-clockwise (Northern Hemisphere), usually with a ""T"" in the middle isobar, which forms a round circle (the letter can vary, however, depending on the language the weather report is presented in).Radar imagery can show low-pressure systems. Tropical cyclones (South Pacific) are also named hurricanes around America or typhoons in coastal Asia.

, These conditions indicate clear, calm weather with reduced chance of precipitation. Drier air usually results in a greater range of high and low temperatures.They are represented on a weather map as isobars with an ""H"" in the middle isobar and arrows showing which direction the wind is flowing (clockwise in Northern Hemisphere, counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere). Like cyclones, they can also be shown with radar imagery.

, These mark the boundary between warmer air on one side and colder air on the other. If you are close to a front and you know the front is moving towards you, you can expect a change in weather (e.g. cloud formation, precipitation, thunderstorms, and wind) when the front boundary passes over you. Mountains and large bodies of water can distort its path. On a weather map, you will notice some lines that have semi-circles or triangles on either side, or both (shown here). These indicate the boundaries for various types of fronts., With these weather patterns, rainfall can be torrential and wind speeds can be high. Blue lines with triangles on one side represents cold fronts on weather maps. The direction the triangles point is the direction in which the cold front is moving., These often bring a gradual increase in rainfall as the front approaches, followed by prompt clearing and warming after the front passes. If the warm air mass is unstable, the weather might be characterized by prolonged thunderstorms. A red line with semi-circles on one side represents warm fronts. The side the semi-circles are on represent the direction in which the warm front is heading., These are formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front. They are associated with various weather events (possibly thunderstorms) depending on whether it is a warm or cold occlusion. The passing of an occluded front usually brings drier air (lowered dew point). A purple line with semi-circles and triangles both on the same side represents occluded fronts. Whichever side they're on, is the direction the occluded front is going., These indicate a non-moving boundary between two different air masses. These fronts have long continuous rainy periods that linger for extended periods in one area and move in waves. A semi-circle bordering one side and triangles along the opposite side represents that the front is not moving in any direction., If your weather map has station models, each one will plot the temperature, dew-point, wind, sea level pressure, pressure tendency, and ongoing weather with a series of symbols.Temperature is generally recorded in Celsius degrees and rainfall is recorded in millimeters. In the US, temperatures are in Fahrenheit and rainfall is measured in inches.

Cloud cover is indicated by the circle in the middle; the extent to which it is filled indicates the degree to which the sky is overcast.

, There are many other lines on weather maps. Two of the most important kinds of lines indicate isotherms and isotachs.Isotherms – These are lines on a weather map that connect points through which the isotherm passes have the same temperature.

Isotachs – These are lines on a weather map that connect points where the isotach passes have the same wind speed.

, A number on the isobars, such as ""1008"", is the pressure (in millibars) along that line. The distance between isobars is referred to as the pressure gradient. A large change in pressure over a short distance (i.e. close isobars) indicates strong winds., Wind barbs point in the direction of the wind. Lines or triangles coming off the main line at an angle indicate wind strength: 50 knots for every triangle, 10 knots for every full line, 5 knots for every half line."

Cut a slit in each end of a drinking straw.,
Cut thick paper into a triangle and a square.,
Stick the paper triangle and square into the slots on the straw.,
Fill a container with small rocks.,
Make a lid for the container.,
Stick a pencil through the bottom of the container.,
Stick a pin through the straw into the eraser.,
Use a compass to mark the directions on your wind vane (optional).,
Watch the wind vane spin.",How to Make a Wind Vane1," Take a straight plastic drinking straw, and use scissors to cut a slit on each end. Make each slit about 1 cm (or 1/2 inch) long. This doesn't need to be exact, so if you don't have a ruler, just cut a small piece, about the width of the pink section of a fingernail.


If you have a drinking straw with a bend in in, cut the bendy part off, then cut slits in the remaining straight section.;
, Cut these from a manila folder, index cards, or thin cardboard such as posterboard or a cereal box. Make the triangle a wide ""arrow"" shape (isosceles), and keep it smaller than the square. If you have a ruler, make the arrow about 5 cm (2 in.) long, and the square about 7 cm (2 3/4 in.) on each side.You can cut the square into a different shape as long as it is still larger than the arrow. You could also draw on them or add stickers for fun.

, Put the triangle on one end, so it makes a point like an arrow. Put the square into the other slot. If they slip out, add a little glue and lay the straw flat on a piece of scrap paper. Keep following the instructions below, and this wind vane arrow should be dry and stuck together by the time you need it again.


Put down scrap paper or newspaper before using glue, to avoid spilling glue on the table.

, Take a yoghurt container, a plastic drinking cup, or another small, plastic container that no one plans to use for another purpose. Fill this about halfway full with pebbles, sand or other heavy objects that will keep the wind vane from slipping.


If you don't have the right container, you can use a big piece of soft clay instead.Stick the sharp side of a pencil into the clay to keep it in place, then skip ahead to the step that starts ""Attach the drinking straw.""

, If the container already has a lid, put it on tightly. Otherwise, you can make a lid by gluing a paper plate or a piece of cardboard over the open end of the container. Make sure the glue is dry and the lid is attached before you continue.

, Pick a pencil with a rubber (an eraser) at one end. Turn the plastic container upside down and make a hole through the bottom, asking an adult for help if you need to. Stick the pencil through this hole, writing side down, and into the pebbles or sand to keep it from slipping.


Add glue or putty around the hole if the pencil is still falling over.

, Take a thumbtack or a sharp pin. Stick it through the center of the drinking straw, then into the eraser. If the straw won't spin when you blow on the paper square, or if it falls over, try sticking the pin closer to the center of the straw, or cut a small piece off the paper on the end that falls over.

, If you have the kind of compass that finds directions, use it to find out where north is. Write ""North"" on that side of your plastic container, or on that side of the lid. You can skip this step if you don't need to know the compass direction of the wind.


Remember, if you move the container, you'll need to use a compass again so you can line the ""north"" side in the right direction.
You can also write ""east"", ""south"", and ""west"" around the container, in clockwise order when looking down from above.

, Take the wind vane outside, away from walls and large objects that might block the wind. If there's any wind, it should push against the paper square, spinning the straw until the arrow points in the direction the wind is blowing from. If the arrow is pointing west, that means the wind is a ""west wind"", blowing from west to east.

 Identify the path of the charged particle.,
 Consider three parameters: The velocity of the charged particle (v{\displaystyle v}), the magnetic field the particle is moving within (B{\displaystyle B}), and the force acting upon the particle by the magnetic field (F{\displaystyle F}).
,
 Represent the three parameters by vectors.,
Use the Right Hand Rule to determine the direction of magnetic field vector.,
 Consider the charge.",How to Specify the Direction of the Magnetic Field by Tracking a Charged Particle That Obeys Uniform Circular Motion," In this case, the path is circular.

,, Each vector has a direction.

 The velocity vector of the charged particle is always tangential to the path of the charged particle.  





 In this case, magnetic field vector has only two possible directions; into the page and out of the page. 





 Force vector is always pointed towards the center of curvature of the circular path.  





 At least two vector directions need to be known in order to find the other. In this case, the directions of velocity vector (v{\displaystyle v}) and force vector (F{\displaystyle F}) are given and magnetic field vector (B{\displaystyle B}) is to be determined.






,

 Situate your right hand as illustrated in the picture. Thumb finger corresponds to the velocity vector, index finger corresponds to magnetic field vector, and middle finger corresponds to force vector.






, After determining the whether the direction of magnetic field vector is either into the page or out of the page, it is time to look at the charge of the particle.

 If the particle has a positive charge, keep the direction of the magnetic field vector as is.

 If the particle has a negative charge, reverse the direction of the magnetic filed vector.

 If the direction of the magnetic filed vector is pointing into the page, reverse it to be out of the page.

 If the direction of the magnetic filed vector is pointing out of the page, reverse it to be into the page.

Create a design for the arrow.,
Cut the design from wood.,
Paint the design.,
Use a dowel and block of wood to create a base.,
Find the center of balance of the arrow.,
Drill a hole at that point.,
Attach the arrow loosely to the dowel, making adjustments if necessary.,
Mark the base with compass directions (optional).,
Test and mount the wind vane.",How to Make a Wind Vane2," Wind vane designs have two requirements: one side of the vane must have a larger surface area than the other, and you must be able to balance the vane.Both of these are easiest to accomplish if the vane is composed of a narrow stick with a decoration at each end, usually a pointing arrow at one end and a larger design at the other.


Alternatively, purchase a wind vane design online or from a metalworker or woodcarver.
Three-dimensional designs are not recommended unless you are an experienced craftsman, since the vane must be balanced from side-to-side as well as front-to-back.

, Trace your design onto a flat piece of wood at least 5 cm (2 in.) thick, using a lightweight but strong material such as balsa wood. Use a jigsaw or coping saw to cut out your design.


Optionally, use sandpaper to smooth the edges of your design after cutting.

, Painting your wood will help preserve it from decay. Choose a color that will stand out against the sky and the roof, if you are mounting the wind vane in a high location.


Optionally, decorate it with multiple colors of paint, letting each color dry before applying the next.

, Take a wooden block, heavier than the wind vane. This will be the base of the wind vane. Select a thick, sturdy dowel or rod, then drill a hole of the same size into the block. Fit the dowel into the hole, using wood glue to fix it in place.

, Hold your hands with your palms facing each other. Place the wind vane arrow on top of your index fingers, then move your hands together until they touch. When your arrow is balanced in this position, mark that point.

, This hole will fit the other end of the dowel, so use the same size drill bit. Drill the hole partway through the arrow at the balance point, from the underside of the arrow.

, Lower the hole in the arrow over the top end of the dowel or rod, but don't force it in. This fit should be loose, so the arrow can spin freely. Use sandpaper to narrow the dowel at this end if necessary. If you are using a metal rod instead, use your drill to widen the hole in the arrow.If the arrow feels unsteady or falls off the dowel or rod, make the hole deeper.

, Adding the cardinal directions can be useful if winds from a particular direction are associated with storms, cold, or other weather phenomena. If you decide to do this, make sure you've decided where to mount the vane, and create North, East, South, and West markers. Depending on how visible the wind vane will be from the ground, you may carve or paint these onto the base, or cut out four flat pieces of wood with ""N"", ""E"", ""S"", and ""W"" designs at the end, and nail them into the base.

, Place the finished wind vane on a hilltop or high stand, and watch it move with the wind. Once you're satisfied that the fit is sturdy, but loose enough for the vane to spin, you can mount the vane permanently. Nail the wooden block to wooden surfaces, tie the vane with wire onto fence posts, or come up with your own method of attachment.


The higher the wind vane is located, the more it will spin.

Understand why Ohm's law is used.,
Know the basic abbreviations used in relation to Ohm's Law.,
Understand the purpose of Ohm's law.,
Learn through examples.,
Understand the two fundamentals of Joule's law.,
Know the equation when dealing with Joule's law.,
Know what each part of the equation means.,
Understand the differences:

Joule's law is about thermodynamics, while Ohm's law is about finding missing values in an operating circuit.",How to Understand the Difference Between Ohm's Law and Joule's Law," Ohm's law is used because resistance cannot be measured in an operating circuit, so Ohm's law is useful when it needs to be calculated.
,

Voltage is represented by E in Ohm's law
Ampere is represented by I in Ohm's law
Ohm is represented by R in Ohm's law

, Ohm's law is using two electromagnetic variables to find the unknown one.

R = E/I
I = E/R
E = IR (I x R but in mathematical equations the multiplication sign can be confusing with the option of a variable x)

, Examples are important because they provide practice in both converting into Ohm's law and how to calculate it.

I = 6A and E = 24V. What is R (resistance/Ohm's)?

Voltage and current/amperes are known. R = E/I as expressed earlier in the article. E = voltage and I = current/amperes. R = E/I is R = 24/6 in this aspect. 24/6 = 4, so R (or Ohm's) is equal to 4 units.


R = 6Ω and E = 12V. What is I (ampere/current)?

The resistance and voltage are known. The correct formula to find the answer would be I = E/R. So we then order the different units to solve. I = 12V/6Ω. 12/6 is 2, so I (ampere/current) = 2.


I = 5A and R = 8Ω . What is E (voltage)?

The formula for finding E is E = IR. Rearrange the variables to fit the formula, as done with the other examples. E = 5A(8Ω). 5 multiplied by 8 equals 40, so the E (voltage) = 40.



,

Heat is produced by an electric current
Energy and gas relate to pressure, volume, and temperature. An important part of this is that Joule found that internal energy of an ideal gas does not change if pressure or volume is influenced, but does with temperature. This is important in later physics and science studies.

,

Q = I (to the power of 2) * R * T

,

Q = heat
I = ampere
R = resistance/Ohm's
T = time

,
Ohm's law may be needed before Joule's law. You need the same values as I and R that are in Ohm's law needed in Joule's law. This means that if I or R are missing, you need to perform Ohm's law first before performing Joule's law.
Joule's law has another value than Ohm's to determine heat: time. This is important because if you take a boiling pot of water away from a heat source, it will eventually cool.

A single stream of electrons divides to flow through multiple branches, then merge back into one stream on the other side. Most problems involving parallel circuits will ask you to identify the total voltage, resistance, or current across the circuit (point A to point B).


Components ""connected in parallel"" are each located on a separate branch.;
, Imagine a freeway with multiple lanes, and toll booths in each lane slowing down traffic. Building a new lane gives the cars another path to take, so it will always speed up traffic even though you're adding a new toll booth as well. Similarly, adding a new branch to a parallel circuit gives current an additional path to take. No matter how much resistance that new branch has, the total resistance of the circuit will decrease, and total current of the circuit will increase.

, If you know the current in each branch, just add them together to find the total current. This is the amount of current flowing in the circuit after all the branches come together. In formulaic terms: IT = I1 + I2 + I3 + ...

, To find total resistance RT across the circuit, solve for it in the equation 1/RT = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... where each R on the right-hand side represents the resistance on one branch of the circuit.


For example, a circuit has two resistors in parallel, each with 4Ω resistance. 1/RT = 1/4Ω + 1/4Ω → 1/RT = 1/2Ω → RT = 2Ω. In other words, two branches of equal resistance are exactly twice as easy to get through as one branch alone.
If one branch has no resistance (0Ω), all the current goes through that branch. The total resistance is 0., Voltage is the difference in electric potential between two points. Since you're comparing two points, not examining a path of movement, the voltage will remain the same no matter which branch you're looking at. VT = V1 = V2 = V3 = ...

, Ohm's Law describes the relation between voltage V, current I, and resistance R: V = IR. If you know two of these values, use this formula to solve for the third.


Make sure every value refers to the same portion of the circuit. You may use Ohm's Law to examine the total circuit (V = ITRT) or a single branch (V = I1R1).

, If you have a parallel circuit with several unknown values, a chart will help you organize your information.Here's an example chart for a circuit with three parallel branches. Note that branches are often referred to as R followed by a subscript number.

, As in any circuit, power P = IV. If you've solved for power along each of the branches, the total power PT equals the sum of all branch power values (P1 + P2 + P3 + ...).

, If there are exactly two resistors in parallel, you can simplify the equation to the ""product over sum"" equation:


RT = R1R2 / (R1 + R2), If every resistor in parallel has the same resistance value, the equation becomes much simpler. RT = R1 / N, where N is the number of resistors.For example, two identical resistors in parallel provides ½ the total resistance of one resistor alone. Eight identical resistors provide ⅛ of the total resistance.

, This equation, called Kirchhoff's current divider rule, lets you solve for individual branch currents even if you don't know the circuit voltage.You'll need to know the resistance of each branch, and the total current f the circuit:


Two resistors in parallel: I1 = ITR2 / (R1 + R2)
More than two resistors in parallel: To solve for I1, find the combined resistance of all resistors besides R1. Remember to use the formula for resistors in parallel. Now use the equation about, replacing R2 with your answer.

Begin with Poisson’s equation.,
Write out the FTs and inverse FTs of the potential and charge density.,
Relate ϕ~(k){\displaystyle {\tilde {\phi }}({\mathbf {k} })} with ρ~(k){\displaystyle {\tilde {\rho }}({\mathbf {k} })}.,
Write ϕ(x){\displaystyle \phi ({\mathbf {x} })} in terms of ρ(x){\displaystyle \rho ({\mathbf {x} })}.,
Evaluate the k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }} space integral.,
Substitute into the equation of the potential ϕ(x){\displaystyle \phi ({\mathbf {x} })}.",How to Solve Poisson's Equation Using Fourier Transforms," Recall that the electric field E{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }} can be written in terms of a scalar potential E=−∇ϕ.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }=-\nabla \phi .} We can then use Gauss’ law to obtain Poisson’s equation as seen in electrostatics.


∇2ϕ=−ρϵ0{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi =-{\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}}}} 

In this equation, it is often the case that we know the charge density ρ,{\displaystyle \rho ,} called the source function, and wish to know the potential ϕ.{\displaystyle \phi .} Therefore, we need to find some way to invert this equation.
;
, Since we are dealing with three dimensions, the FTs are adjusted accordingly, with the constant factor there for normalization purposes. The bounds will differ depending on conventions on where to set the potential to 0. Although we will not explicitly write the boundaries until evaluating the integrals, we will set the potential to 0 at infinity, so that we are integrating over all space.

, The result will relate the potential and charge density in the k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }} space, and as it will turn out, the relation is algebraic, which is considerably simpler. 

Take the Laplacian of ϕ(x).{\displaystyle \phi ({\mathbf {x} }).} We can differentiate under the integral here because the integral is being taken with respect to k,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} },} and x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} is an independent variable.

By direct comparison, we see that the below relation holds. 


k2ϕ~(k)=ρ~(k)ϵ0{\displaystyle k^{2}{\tilde {\phi }}({\mathbf {k} })={\frac {{\tilde {\rho }}({\mathbf {k} })}{\epsilon _{0}}}}



If we were given charge density in the k{\displaystyle {\mathbf {k} }} space and wanted to find potential in the same space, it would be very easy. However, we are interested in finding these quantities in the x{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }} space. Therefore, we will need to transform a second time.

, This is the general solution to Poisson's equation up to a charge density, where ϕ(∞)=0.{\displaystyle \phi (\infty )=0.} The general solution to this equation cannot be written in closed form. Thus, we opt for the integral form, where we integrate the known charge density over all space to find the corresponding potential, though the integration for more complicated charge distributions becomes rather impractical.

In this section, we investigate the case without this source to obtain the solution to a homogeneous equation. We then tackle the slightly more complicated task of finding the steady-state solution. The diagram above shows an example of an RLC circuit.

Electric current I{\displaystyle I} is related to charge by the relation I=Q˙,{\displaystyle I={\dot {Q}},} where Q{\displaystyle Q} is electric charge and the dot signifies a time derivative.

Ohm's law says that the voltage across a resistor is linearly proportional to the current: VR=IR.{\displaystyle V_{R}=IR.} This can be written as VR=RQ˙.{\displaystyle V_{R}=R{\dot {Q}}.}

The voltage across an inductor is given by VI=LI˙,{\displaystyle V_{I}=L{\dot {I}},} where L{\displaystyle L} is the inductance. As before, we can write this as VI=LQ¨.{\displaystyle V_{I}=L{\ddot {Q}}.}

The voltage across a capacitor is given by the relation VC=1CQ.{\displaystyle V_{C}={\frac {1}{C}}Q.}

The governing differential equation is then given below.


LQ¨+RQ˙+1CQ=0{\displaystyle L{\ddot {Q}}+R{\dot {Q}}+{\frac {1}{C}}Q=0}


;
,

This more applicable form of the equation is given below. We can see from inspection that ω02=1LC{\displaystyle \omega _{0}^{2}={\frac {1}{LC}}} and β=R2L.{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {R}{2L}}.} ω0{\displaystyle \omega _{0}} refers to the frequency of the system, while β{\displaystyle \beta } is a parameter, also in units of angular frequency, that simplifies calculations. This parameter is called the attenuation and measures how quickly the transient response of the circuit dies away. We can apply this equation to the classical harmonic oscillator as well, or any system whose behavior is predominantly oscillatory in nature. 


Q¨+2βQ˙+ω02Q=0{\displaystyle {\ddot {Q}}+2\beta {\dot {Q}}+\omega _{0}^{2}Q=0}




,

The solutions to the characteristic equation are very simple, and we can see why we deal with this equation instead.


r2+2βr+ω02=0{\displaystyle r^{2}+2\beta r+\omega _{0}^{2}=0}


r=−β±β2−ω02{\displaystyle r=-\beta \pm {\sqrt {\beta ^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}}}}



We know that physically, the capacitance is usually a very small quantity. Capacitors are usually measured in nanofarads or microfarads, whereas resistors can be on the order of ohms to megaohms. It is therefore not unreasonable to suggest that ω02>β2{\displaystyle \omega _{0}^{2}>\beta ^{2}} so that the square root is negative and the solutions are oscillatory rather than exponential in nature. From the theory of differential equations, we obtain the complementary solution, where we write ωd=ω02−β2{\displaystyle \omega _{d}={\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}} as the damped frequency.


Qc(t)=e−βt(c1cos⁡ωdt+c2sin⁡ωdt){\displaystyle Q_{c}(t)=e^{-\beta t}\left(c_{1}\cos \omega _{d}t+c_{2}\sin \omega _{d}t\right)}




, We can convert this solution into a slightly more familiar form by performing the following manipulation.

Multiply the solution by c12+c22c12+c22.{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}.}


e−βtc12+c22(c1c12+c22cos⁡ωdt+c2c12+c22sin⁡ωdt){\displaystyle e^{-\beta t}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}\left({\frac {c_{1}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}\cos \omega _{d}t+{\frac {c_{2}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}\sin \omega _{d}t\right)}



Draw a right triangle with angle ϕ,{\displaystyle \phi ,} hypotenuse length c12+c22,{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}},} opposite side length c1,{\displaystyle c_{1},} and adjacent side length c2.{\displaystyle c_{2}.} Replace the constant c12+c22{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}} with a new constant A,{\displaystyle A,} denoting amplitude. Now we can simplify the quantities in parentheses. The result is that the second arbitrary constant has been replaced with an angle. 


Qc(t)=Ae−βt(sin⁡ϕcos⁡ωdt+cos⁡ϕsin⁡ωdt)=Ae−βtsin⁡(ωdt+ϕ){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Q_{c}(t)&=Ae^{-\beta t}(\sin \phi \cos \omega _{d}t+\cos \phi \sin \omega _{d}t)\\&=Ae^{-\beta t}\sin(\omega _{d}t+\phi )\end{aligned}}}



Because ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is arbitrary, we can also use the cosine function as well. (Mathematically, the two phase factors are different, but in terms of finding the equation of motion given initial conditions, only the form of the solution matters.)


Qc(t)=Ae−βtcos⁡(ωdt+ϕ){\displaystyle Q_{c}(t)=Ae^{-\beta t}\cos(\omega _{d}t+\phi )}




, Current is just one derivative away, which is why we solved the problem in terms of charge. In practice, however, it is much easier to measure current than it is to measure charge.


Ic(t)=Aβe−βtcos⁡(ωdt+ϕ)−Aωde−βtsin⁡(ωdt+ϕ){\displaystyle I_{c}(t)=A\beta e^{-\beta t}\cos(\omega _{d}t+\phi )-A\omega _{d}e^{-\beta t}\sin(\omega _{d}t+\phi )}

It turns out that in practice, the attenuation β{\displaystyle \beta } is very small, so ωd≈ω0.{\displaystyle \omega _{d}\approx \omega _{0}.} This approximation gets better the smaller β{\displaystyle \beta } is.

This form of the solution, a linear combination of sine and cosine, suggests that we can again rewrite the solution in terms of just one term. Note that the amplitude and phase factor are mathematically different from the previous term, but as we are not given initial conditions, there is no physical difference.


Ic(t)=Ae−βtcos⁡(ωdt+ϕ){\displaystyle I_{c}(t)=Ae^{-\beta t}\cos(\omega _{d}t+\phi )}




, This voltage source is in the form V(t)=V0cos⁡ωt,{\displaystyle V(t)=V_{0}\cos \omega t,} where V0{\displaystyle V_{0}} is the amplitude of the voltage and ω{\displaystyle \omega } is the frequency of the signal. The differential equation is now inhomogeneous. By linearity, any solution to the inhomogeneous equation added to the complementary solution gives the general solution.


Q¨+2βQ˙+ω02Q=V0Lcos⁡ωt{\displaystyle {\ddot {Q}}+2\beta {\dot {Q}}+\omega _{0}^{2}Q={\frac {V_{0}}{L}}\cos \omega t}


, From the theory of differential equations, we compare the source term to Qc{\displaystyle Q_{c}} and find if the source contains a term that is tn{\displaystyle t^{n}} times a term in Qc{\displaystyle Q_{c}} or not, where n{\displaystyle n} is 0 or a positive integer. Because there aren't any, the particular solution will take on the following form.


Qp=acos⁡ωt+bsin⁡ωt{\displaystyle Q_{p}=a\cos \omega t+b\sin \omega t}


, 

After some algebra and comparing the coefficients of cos⁡ωt{\displaystyle \cos \omega t} and sin⁡ωt,{\displaystyle \sin \omega t,} we arrive at a system of algebraic equations.


−ω2a+2βωb+ω02a=V0L{\displaystyle -\omega ^{2}a+2\beta \omega b+\omega _{0}^{2}a={\frac {V_{0}}{L}}}


−ω2b−2βωa+ω02b=0{\displaystyle -\omega ^{2}b-2\beta \omega a+\omega _{0}^{2}b=0}



These two equations can be written in a more suggestive form. 


(ω02−ω2)a+(2βω)b=V0L{\displaystyle (\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})a+(2\beta \omega )b={\frac {V_{0}}{L}}}


(−2βω)a+(ω02−ω2)b=0{\displaystyle (-2\beta \omega )a+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})b=0}




, We solve for b{\displaystyle b} in terms of a,{\displaystyle a,} find a,{\displaystyle a,} then find b{\displaystyle b} as a result.

Use the second equation to solve for b{\displaystyle b} in terms of a.{\displaystyle a.}


b=(2βω)aω02−ω2{\displaystyle b={\frac {(2\beta \omega )a}{\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}}}



Substitute back into the first equation to find a.{\displaystyle a.}


(ω02−ω2)a+4β2ω2ω02−ω2a=V0L{\displaystyle (\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})a+{\frac {4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}{\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}}a={\frac {V_{0}}{L}}}


a=V0L(ω02−ω2)(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2{\displaystyle a={\frac {{\frac {V_{0}}{L}}(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}}



From here, we immediately find b.{\displaystyle b.}


b=2βωV0/L(ω02−ω2)2+4β2ω2{\displaystyle b={\frac {2\beta \omega V_{0}/L}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}+4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}}}}




, The coefficients give us the terms that we need in the steady-state solution. The general solution is now simply the sum of the transient and steady-state solutions.


Q(t)=Ae−βtcos⁡(ωdt+ϕ)+acos⁡ωt+bsin⁡ωt{\displaystyle Q(t)=Ae^{-\beta t}\cos(\omega _{d}t+\phi )+a\cos \omega t+b\sin \omega t}


, We have already found the steady-state solution in terms of parameters that we know. Our form of the steady-state solution, a linear combination of sine and cosine, suggests that we can also write it in terms of amplitude and phase factor, just as we did with the transient term. As we will shortly see, this provides a more useful formulation with which to analyze resonance. 
, Now, we solve for the amplitude Q(ω){\displaystyle Q(\omega )} and phase δ(ω),{\displaystyle \delta (\omega ),} both functions of the driving frequency ω.{\displaystyle \omega .} 

We must make use of the following trigonometric identities in our work.


cos⁡(ωt+δ(ω))=cos⁡ωtcos⁡δ(ω)−sin⁡ωtsin⁡δ(ω){\displaystyle \cos(\omega t+\delta (\omega ))=\cos \omega t\cos \delta (\omega )-\sin \omega t\sin \delta (\omega )}


sin⁡(ωt+δ(ω))=sin⁡ωtcos⁡δ(ω)+cos⁡ωtsin⁡δ(ω){\displaystyle \sin(\omega t+\delta (\omega ))=\sin \omega t\cos \delta (\omega )+\cos \omega t\sin \delta (\omega )}



After substituting and making use of the summation identities, we arrive at the following system of equations.


−ω2Q(ω)cos⁡ωtcos⁡δ(ω)−2βωQ(ω)sin⁡δ(ω)+ω02Q(ω)cos⁡δ(ω)=V0L{\displaystyle -\omega ^{2}Q(\omega )\cos \omega t\cos \delta (\omega )-2\beta \omega Q(\omega )\sin \delta (\omega )+\omega _{0}^{2}Q(\omega )\cos \delta (\omega )={\frac {V_{0}}{L}}}


ω2Q(ω)sin⁡δ(ω)−2βωQ(ω)cos⁡δ(ω)−ω02Q(ω)sin⁡δ(ω)=0{\displaystyle \omega ^{2}Q(\omega )\sin \delta (\omega )-2\beta \omega Q(\omega )\cos \delta (\omega )-\omega _{0}^{2}Q(\omega )\sin \delta (\omega )=0}


, We can use the second equation to do this.


(ω2−ω02)sin⁡δ(ω)=2βωcos⁡δ(ω){\displaystyle (\omega ^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2})\sin \delta (\omega )=2\beta \omega \cos \delta (\omega )}


tan⁡δ(ω)=2βωω2−ω02{\displaystyle \tan \delta (\omega )={\frac {2\beta \omega }{\omega ^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}}}}

Our previous results suggest that we write out the denominator as ω02−ω2.{\displaystyle \omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}.} The difference is primarily one of bookkeeping. 


δ(ω)=tan−1−2βωω02−ω2{\displaystyle \delta (\omega )=\tan ^{-1}{\frac {-2\beta \omega }{\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}}}




, We use the first equation to do this. 

To find sin⁡δ(ω){\displaystyle \sin \delta (\omega )} and cos⁡δ(ω),{\displaystyle \cos \delta (\omega ),} draw a right triangle with angle δ,{\displaystyle \delta ,} adjacent side length ω02−ω2,{\displaystyle \omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2},} opposite side length 2βω,{\displaystyle 2\beta \omega ,} and hypotenuse. Make sure to draw the triangle so that sin⁡δ(ω){\displaystyle \sin \delta (\omega )} is negative.


cos⁡δ(ω)=ω02−ω24β2ω2+(ω02−ω2)2{\displaystyle \cos \delta (\omega )={\frac {\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}{\sqrt {4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}}}}}


sin⁡δ(ω)=−2βω4β2ω2+(ω02−ω2)2{\displaystyle \sin \delta (\omega )={\frac {-2\beta \omega }{\sqrt {4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}}}}}



We now have all the information needed to find Q(ω).{\displaystyle Q(\omega ).}


Q(ω)=V0/L(ω02−ω2)cos⁡δ(ω)−2βωsin⁡δ(ω){\displaystyle Q(\omega )={\frac {V_{0}/L}{(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})\cos \delta (\omega )-2\beta \omega \sin \delta (\omega )}}}



After some simplification, we arrive at the following result.


Q(ω)=V0/L4β2ω2+(ω02−ω2)2{\displaystyle Q(\omega )={\frac {V_{0}/L}{\sqrt {4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}}}}}




, Current is once again a derivative away. Note that tan−1⁡x{\displaystyle \tan ^{-1}x} is an odd function.


I(t,ω)=−ωV0/L4β2ω2+(ω02−ω2)2sin(ωt−tan−12βωω02−ω2){\displaystyle I(t,\omega )=-{\frac {\omega V_{0}/L}{\sqrt {4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2}}}}\sin \left(\omega t-\tan ^{-1}{\frac {2\beta \omega }{\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}}\right)}


,

Assume that the attenuation is set to 0, or β=0.{\displaystyle \beta =0.} Then the magnitude of the amplitude of the steady-state term is given as the following.


I(ω)=ωV0/Lω02−ω2{\displaystyle I(\omega )={\frac {\omega V_{0}/L}{\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}}}



We see that as ω→ω0,{\displaystyle \omega \to \omega _{0},} the amplitude increases without bound. This condition is called resonance. An RLC circuit satisfies resonance under the following condition.


ω=ω0=1LC{\displaystyle \omega =\omega _{0}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {LC}}}}



The driving force will also have a phase shift of π/2{\displaystyle \pi /2} relative to the steady-state response when resonance is met.


limω→ω0tan−1−2βωω02−ω2=π2{\displaystyle \lim _{\omega \to \omega _{0}}\tan ^{-1}{\frac {-2\beta \omega }{\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2}}}={\frac {\pi }{2}}}




, One only take the derivative, set it to 0, and solve for ω.{\displaystyle \omega .} Notice that the β{\displaystyle \beta } term means that the maximum amplitude occurs at a frequency slightly lower than the resonant frequency. But also note that as β{\displaystyle \beta } gets smaller, ωmax{\displaystyle \omega _{max}} gets closer to ω0.{\displaystyle \omega _{0}.}


Q˙(ω)=−V02L(4β2ω2+(ω02−ω2)2)−3/2(8β2ω+2(ω02−ω2)(−2ω)){\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}(\omega )=-{\frac {V_{0}}{2L}}(4\beta ^{2}\omega ^{2}+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})^{2})^{-3/2}(8\beta ^{2}\omega +2(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})(-2\omega ))}


8β2ω−4ω(ω02−ω2)=0{\displaystyle 8\beta ^{2}\omega -4\omega (\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega ^{2})=0}


ωmax=ω02−2β2{\displaystyle \omega _{max}={\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-2\beta ^{2}}}}


, Simply substitute our result, and simplify.


Qmax=V0/L4β2(ω02−2β2)+(ω02−ω02+2β2)2=V0/L4β2ω02−4β4=V0/L2βω02−β2=V0/L2βωd=V0Rωd{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}Q_{max}&={\frac {V_{0}/L}{\sqrt {4\beta ^{2}(\omega _{0}^{2}-2\beta ^{2})+(\omega _{0}^{2}-\omega _{0}^{2}+2\beta ^{2})^{2}}}}\\&={\frac {V_{0}/L}{\sqrt {4\beta ^{2}\omega _{0}^{2}-4\beta ^{4}}}}\\&={\frac {V_{0}/L}{2\beta {\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}}}\\&={\frac {V_{0}/L}{2\beta \omega _{d}}}\\&={\frac {V_{0}}{R\omega _{d}}}\end{aligned}}}

We may also write our solution in terms of the amplitude at resonance.


Qmax=Qresω0ω02−β2{\displaystyle Q_{max}=Q_{res}{\frac {\omega _{0}}{\sqrt {\omega _{0}^{2}-\beta ^{2}}}}}

Draw the circuit neatly.,
At each junction, use Kirchhoff's First Law to equate the current flowing in to the current flowing out, i.e.,

To check if you have the right number of loops, count the number of currents you have.,
For each numbered loop, write the loop equation using Kirchhoff's Second Law.,
Solve the system of N equations to get the N currents.",How to Solve Circuits Using Kirchhoff's Laws," Label the currents flowing through each branch. For each branch, there should be current 'name' and direction.;
, sum of currents flowing into the junction = sum of currents flowing out. This should give as many equations as there are junctions.

, The loops should cover every possible branch. To check if the loops are independent, see if adding or subtracting two loop equations already written would give the new loop's equation you are looking for.


In other words, if you take two loops already written, any loop that you can form by super-imposing them is not an independent loop. Label the independent loops with numbers.
If any two loops have a common source they must be solved as a single loop by super imposing them.

, If you had labelled N currents in the branches, you should have N equations to solve all of them completely. With J number of junctions, you get J equations from step 2. Therefore, you should get (N - J) loops to solve for the currents.

, This can be done as follows. Pick a direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Start at some point on the loop and go along the loop in this direction.


For every battery/power cell you encounter, if you are going from the negative plate to the positive plate, write +V, where V is the potential difference of the battery. If you are going from the positive to the negative, write -V.
For every resistor with current I flowing through it, write + I R, if you are going against the current as you go along the loop, and - I R if you are going with the current. (Replace I with whatever the label of the current in that particular branch is).
For every capacitor you encounter, if you are going from the negative plate to the positive plate, write +q/C, where q is the charge on the positive plate of the capacitor and C is the capacitance. If you are going from the positive to the negative, write -q/C.
Inductors do not affect steady state DC circuits, and need a variable current to be of any effect.

, This can be easily done on any mathematical computation platform, like Mathematica, MATlab, Python etc. For reasonable values of N, it can be solved by hand just as any simultaneous system of equations. This can get difficult for large N.


To solve by hand, multiply by constants and subtract equations to eliminate variables successively until you get one of the currents. Substitute this back in the system of equations and repeat the process until every current is determined.

Inflate the balloon.,
Rub the balloon 5 times across the surface of a material.,
Place the balloon on the cut pieces of paper.,
Count and record the number of paper pieces stuck to the balloon.,
Compare the results of the different materials.",How to Measure Static Electricity1," For this experiment you will need a small copper plate, a ground connection, jumper wires with alligator clips, white paper, scissors, a ruler, a balloon, hair, a cotton t-shirt, a polyester t-shirt, carpet, and a ceramic tile.This experiment will test the relative amount of static electricity in an object.


A small copper sheet plate can be purchased relatively cheaply online or at a hardware store.
The ground connection and alligator clip jumper wire will need to be purchased at a hardware or electronics store.;
, Take one end of the alligator clip and attach it to the ground connection. Attach the other alligator clip to the copper plate. It doesn’t matter where the clip is placed, just so that it is connected to the grounding wire.


Touching an object to the plate removes any residual static electricity an object may have.

, Using a ruler, measure out 5 millimeter by 5 millimeter squares and cut them out. Try to cut them as close to identical in size as possible. This process will be more accurate and go faster if you have access to a paper cutter.


Remove any lingering static electricity in the paper by placing them on the copper plate.After removing any residual static, put the pieces of paper onto a flat tray for the remainder of the experiment.

, Blow up the balloon to a medium-to-large size. The size is not important as long as you use the same balloon for every material. If you pop the balloon during one of the tests, you will need to blow up a new balloon and start at the beginning to maintain consistency during the experiment.


Discharge the balloon of any lingering static electricity by rolling it across the copper plate., First, choose the material you want to measure the static charge. Some good materials to test are hair, carpet, a cotton t-shirt, a polyester t-shirt, and a ceramic tile.Rub the balloon in the same direction each time across the surface of the material.

, As the balloon is rubbed across the surfaces, it will be charged with varying amounts of static electricity. When you place the balloon in the paper, the pieces will stick based on the amount of static electricity the balloon holds.


Avoid rolling the balloon around the pile of paper, just set it on top and see how many pieces stick.

, Peel the pieces of paper off the balloon and count them as you do. Different materials will lead to more or fewer pieces sticking. Repeat the procedure with the various different materials to see how they differ.


Be sure to discharge the paper and the balloon before beginning again.

, Look at the information you have recorded and compare how many pieces of paper stick to the balloon after being rubbed across the various materials. When more pieces of paper stick to the balloon, it indicates that the material has a higher static charge.


Look at the list and see which materials caused the balloon to attract the most paper. Hair has a lot of static electricity and will likely have led to the most paper pieces sticking.Although this method does not tell you the exact amount of static electricity an object has, it does allow you to see the relative amounts of static electricity the material contains.

Attach the ball to the rod by wrapping foil around both and twisting together.,
Drill a hole in the plastic lid of the jar.,
Secure the foil rod/sphere to the lid.,
Cut out a triangle shape from folded foil.,
Hang the foil triangles on the bend of the rod.,
Observe your device in action.",How to Measure Static Electricity2," An electroscope is a device that can detect static electricity by using thin metal pieces that separate in the presence of an electrical charge.You can build a very simple electroscope using a few simple household items. You’ll need a glass jar with a plastic lid, aluminum foil, and a drill.

, Cut off a sheet of aluminum foil about 10 inches by 10 inches. The exact dimensions of the piece of foil are not important. Crumple the sheet of foil into a sphere.Try to keep the ball as round as possible.


The size of the ball should be about 2 inches in diameter. Again, exact dimensions are not important, but you don’t want the ball to be too big or too small.

, Take another sheet of foil and twist it into a rod shape that is a little bit less than the length of your jar. You want the aluminum rod to be about 3 inches above the bottom of the jar and stick out about 4 inches above the top of the jar.

, Using another sheet of foil, place the ball and the rod together and wrap the larger sheet around both pieces. Twist the foil around the rod to secure everything tightly in place.

, Using a drill, make a hole in the center of lid that is big enough for the foil rod to slide through. If you do not have a drill on hand, you can use a hammer and a nail to punch a hole through the lid.


Use caution with the drill or hammer. Adult supervision is recommended.

, Slide the foil rod through the hole in the lid with the foil sphere sticking out of the top end of the lid. Tape the rod in place from the bottom and the top. A half inch from the bottom of the rod, make a 90° (right angle) bend.

, Cut out a piece of foil that is around 6 inches by 3 inches. Fold the foil length-wise so that it is now a 3 in by 3 in square. Cut out a triangle shape, with the point of the triangle almost reaching the folded age. Leave the triangles attached at the point by not cutting all the way to the fold.When you are finished cutting you should have two triangles connected by a little bit of foil at the top.


If you cut through the fold, cut a new piece of foil and start again.

, Drape the foil triangles over the rod so that they hang almost touching each other. Screw the lid onto the jar, being careful not to knock the foil triangles off the rod as you do. Keep the electroscope upright.


If the triangles do fall off, simply unscrew the lid and reposition them.

, Rub a balloon against your hair and place it near the sphere at the top of your electroscope. You should see the triangles move apart from each other. As the device comes in contact with static electricity, the two triangles will have opposite charges and will push each other apart. When there is no static electricity, the triangles will sit close to each other.


Wander around your home placing the sphere near different objects to see how charged they are.

Learn the formula for electrical power.,
Solve for power using resistance.,
Multiply power by time to find energy.",How to Solve a Series Circuit," Most problems involve three characteristics of a circuit: resistance R, voltage V, and current I. Ohm's Law tells you that they are related in a simple way: V = IR. If you get stuck at any point and don't have enough information for the steps below, look for a chance to use Ohm's Law:

If you know any two of these values, use Ohm's Law to solve for the third. For example, if you know the resistance and voltage of a circuit, rearrange V = IR to I = V / R, and plug in the known values to solve for I, the current.

Always use values form the same part of the circuit. If you are trying to solve for the resistance of a single resistor, you will need to know the voltage and current for that resistor. Do not use the voltage for the whole circuit.
;
, In a series circuit, all of the current passes through every resistor in turn. This means each resistor contributes its full resistance to the circuit. If you know each individual resistance value, just add them together to find the total resistance of the circuit.Example 1: A series circuit has two resistors. One resistor R1 has 3Ω (ohms) of resistance, and the second resistor R2 has 6Ω of resistance. Find the total resistance.The total resistance of the circuit is equivalent to the sum of the two individual resistances:Rtotal=R1+R2=3+6=9{\displaystyle R_{total}=R_{1}+R_{2}=3+6=9}Ω.

On a circuit diagram, a resistor looks like a zig-zag in the wire.


, The voltage drop across the total circuit is determined by the voltage source, typically a battery. This is often labeled on your circuit diagram, next to two or more parallel lines of different length.The voltage drops across each component of the series circuit add up to the total voltage drop across the circuit.Example 2: A series circuit is powered by a 9 volt battery and has two resistors R1 and R2. The voltage drop across R1 is 5V. What is the voltage drop across R2?Vtotal=V1+V2{\displaystyle V_{total}=V_{1}+V_{2}}9=5+V2{\displaystyle 9=5+V_{2}}V2=9−5=4{\displaystyle V_{2}=9-5=4} volts.

Old-fashioned textbooks may use E to represent voltage instead of V. You may also see ΔV, meaning ""change in voltage."" The symbol Δ is the Greek letter delta, and means ""change.""


, Electrical charge flows constantly around the circuit, creating the current. A series circuit only has one path for this flow, so the current is the same at all points on the circuit. (There are no branches to split the current.) As long as you know the voltage and resistance at any point on the circuit (or for the circuit as a whole), you can use Ohm's Law to find the current: I = V / R.


Example 3: A series circuit plugged into a 220V source is connected to several light bulbs. You measure the voltage drop across a light bulb with resistance 100 Ω and get a result of 80V. How much current flows through this circuit?You know the values of V and R for the light bulb, so you can use Ohm's Law to solve for the current:I = 80V / 100Ω = 0.8 A (amps)Because the current is the same anywhere on a series circuit, the answer is 0.8 amps.Be careful: you cannot use the circuit's total voltage drop 220V. Ohm's Law only works if you use values for the same portion of the circuit, and this problem does not tell you the total resistance of the circuit.


, Some tough problems require you to calculate the values of multiple components before you can solve for the whole circuit. It may help to fill out a ""VIR"" chart as you go, with a separate row for each component and the whole circuit. Here's an example for a circuit with three components A, B, and C:


{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}&{\underline {\mathbf {V} }}&{\underline {\mathbf {I} }}&{\underline {\mathbf {R} }}\\{\mathbf {A} }:&V_{a}&I_{a}&R_{a}\\{\mathbf {B} }:&V_{b}&I_{b}&R_{b}\\{\mathbf {C} }:&V_{c}&I_{c}&R_{c}\\{\mathbf {Total} }:&V_{total}&I_{total}&R_{total}\end{bmatrix}}}

Fill out the chart with all values provided in the problem.

Ohm's Law works with values in the same row. For example, Vb=IbRb{\displaystyle V_{b}=I_{b}R_{b}}. Use this to complete any rows that have 2 out of 3 cells filled.

Use the properties of series circuits to fill blank spaces in columns:


Rtotal=Ra+Rb+Rc{\displaystyle R_{total}=R_{a}+R_{b}+R{c}}


Vtotal=Va+Vb+Vc{\displaystyle V_{total}=V_{a}+V_{b}+V{c}}


Itotal=Ia=Ib=Ic{\displaystyle I_{total}=I_{a}=I_{b}=I_{c}}




, Power is a measurement of how quickly the circuit draws electrical energy from the battery or outlet. Power and energy are useful quantities to know if you are trying to power another device with the electrical circuit, or if you are calculating your electricity bill. In the classroom, however, you do not need to find the power and energy unless the problem asks you to. If the problem only tells you to fill out a circuit diagram, use the method above to find resistance, voltage, and current.
, Power in an electrical circuit depends on two quantities: current and voltage. A higher current (faster electrical charge) transfers electrical energy more quickly, increasing power. A higher voltage means each unit of charge transfers more energy as it moves, also increasing power. You can sum up both relationships in one formula: P = VI.All the formulas in this section work for the circuit as a whole, or for individual components. Just make sure to use quantities that refer to the same portion of the circuit.


, To find the power dissipated across a resistor, use the formula P=I2R{\displaystyle P=I^{2}R}, or the formula P=V2R{\displaystyle P={\frac {V^{2}}{R}}}. You can derive both these formulas by combining P=VI and Ohm's Law:We know V = IR from Ohm's Law, so we can replace V with IR in other equations:P=VI{\displaystyle P=VI} → P=(IR)(I)=I2R{\displaystyle P=(IR)(I)=I^{2}R}

Rearrange Ohm's Law to I = V / R and use the same trick:P=VI{\displaystyle P=VI} → P=(V)(VR)=V2R{\displaystyle P=(V)({\frac {V}{R}})={\frac {V^{2}}{R}}}


, The longer a circuit is on, the more energy it consumes. Multiply power and time together to find energy.

The equations above give you a power result in watts. Multiply by seconds to get an energy result in Joules.

;
, From Gauss' Law of Magnetism, we see that magnetic fields are divergenceless via ∇⋅B=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {B} }=0.} In vector calculus, a theorem is that the divergence of a curl is always zero. Therefore, we can rewrite B{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }} in terms of a magnetic potential A.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {A} }.}


B=∇×A{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }=\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} }}

From here, we see that magnetic potential is a vector potential. This definition automatically satisfies Gauss' Law of Magnetism through the aforementioned vector identity ∇⋅(∇×F)=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times {\mathbf {F} })=0.}


, Recall back in electrostatics that E{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }} was a conservative field (i.e. ∇×E=0{\displaystyle \nabla \times {\mathbf {E} }=0}), which allowed us to write it in terms of a scalar potential E=−∇ϕ.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }=-\nabla \phi .} In electrodynamics, E{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }} is no longer conservative, due to the presence of a changing B{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }} field induced by moving charged particles. However, substituting B=∇×A{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }=\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} }} into Faraday's Law returns an equation which we can take the scalar gradient of. By doing so, our potential definition automatically satisfies another of Maxwell's equations.


∇×E=−∂∂t(∇×A)∇×E=∇×−∂A∂t∇×(E+∂A∂t)=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla &\times {\mathbf {E} }=-{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} })\\\nabla &\times {\mathbf {E} }=\nabla \times -{\frac {\partial {\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t}}\\\nabla &\times \left({\mathbf {E} }+{\frac {\partial {\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t}}\right)=0\end{aligned}}}

Now, we can write the quantity in parentheses in terms of a scalar potential.


E+∂A∂t=−∇ϕ{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }+{\frac {\partial {\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t}}=-\nabla \phi }



Solve for E{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }} to obtain the electric field in terms of potentials. 


E=−∇ϕ−∂A∂t{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }=-\nabla \phi -{\frac {\partial {\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t}}}




, Now that we are done with the two homogeneous equations, we can work our way with the other two.


∇⋅(−∇ϕ−∂A∂t)=ρϵ0−∇2ϕ−∂∂t(∇⋅A)=ρϵ0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \cdot \left(-\nabla \phi -{\frac {\partial {\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t}}\right)&={\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}}}\\-\nabla ^{2}\phi -{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} })&={\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}}}\end{aligned}}}


,


∇×(∇×A)=μ0J+μ0ϵ0∂∂t(−∇ϕ−∂A∂t){\displaystyle \nabla \times (\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} })=\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }+\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(-\nabla \phi -{\frac {\partial {\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t}}\right)}

Make use of the BAC-CAB identity. For the vector calculus form, it reads as ∇×(∇×F)=∇(∇⋅F)−∇2F.{\displaystyle \nabla \times (\nabla \times {\mathbf {F} })=\nabla (\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {F} })-\nabla ^{2}{\mathbf {F} }.}


∇(∇⋅A)−∇2A=μ0J−μ0ϵ0∇(∂ϕ∂t)−μ0ϵ0∂2A∂t2{\displaystyle \nabla (\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} })-\nabla ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }=\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }-\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}\nabla \left({\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t}}\right)-\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t^{2}}}}



Rearrange so that the Laplacian and the gradient terms are together.


(μ0ϵ0∂2A∂t2−∇2A)+∇(∇⋅A+μ0ϵ0∂ϕ∂t)=μ0J{\displaystyle \left(\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }\right)+\nabla \left(\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} }+\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t}}\right)=\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }}



Through rewriting Gauss' Law and the Ampere-Maxwell Law in terms of potentials, we have reduced Maxwell's equations from four equations to two. Furthermore, we have reduced the number of components to just four - the scalar potential and the three components of the vector potential. 

However, no one ever encounters Maxwell's equations written like this. 


, It turns out that A{\displaystyle {\mathbf {A} }} and ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } are not uniquely defined, since an appropriate change in these quantities results in the same E{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }} and B{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }} fields. These changes in the potentials are called gauge transformations. In this section, we outline two of the most common gauge transformations that greatly simplify Maxwell's equations.
, Let's label the changes as α{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}} and β.{\displaystyle \beta .}


A→A+αϕ→ϕ+β{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathbf {A} }&\to {\mathbf {A} }+{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}\\\phi &\to \phi +\beta \end{aligned}}}

If the vector potentials give the same B,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} },} then ∇×α=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \times {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}=0.} Then, we can write α{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}} in terms of a scalar χ.{\displaystyle \chi .}


α=∇χ{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}=\nabla \chi }



Similarly, if both potentials give the same E,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} },} then ∇β+∂α∂t=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \beta +{\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}}{\partial t}}=0.}


∇(β+∂χ∂t)=0{\displaystyle \nabla \left(\beta +{\frac {\partial \chi }{\partial t}}\right)=0}



Solving for β{\displaystyle \beta } by integrating both sides adds a constant that depends on time. However, this constant does not affect the gradient of χ,{\displaystyle \chi ,} so we can neglect it.


β=−∂χ∂t{\displaystyle \beta =-{\frac {\partial \chi }{\partial t}}}




, By manipulating these transformations in an appropriate manner, we can change the divergence of A{\displaystyle {\mathbf {A} }} to simplify Maxwell's equations by choosing a χ{\displaystyle \chi } that satisfies the conditions we want.


A→A+∇χϕ→ϕ−∂χ∂t{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathbf {A} }&\to {\mathbf {A} }+\nabla \chi \\\phi &\to \phi -{\frac {\partial \chi }{\partial t}}\end{aligned}}}


, Set ∇⋅A=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} }=0.}


∇2ϕ=−ρϵ0{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi =-{\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}}}} 


(μ0ϵ0∂2A∂t2−∇2A)+μ0ϵ0∇(∂ϕ∂t)=μ0J{\displaystyle \left(\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }\right)+\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}\nabla \left({\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t}}\right)=\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }}

This is the Coulomb gauge, which reduces the scalar potential equation to Poisson's equation, but results in a rather complicated vector potential equation.


, Set ∇⋅A=−μ0ϵ0∂ϕ∂t.{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} }=-\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial t}}.}


μ0ϵ0∂2ϕ∂t2−∇2ϕ=ρϵ0{\displaystyle \mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}\phi }{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}\phi ={\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}}}}


μ0ϵ0∂2A∂t2−∇2A=μ0J{\displaystyle \mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }}{\partial t^{2}}}-\nabla ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }=\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }}

This is the Lorenz gauge, which results in manifest Lorentz covariance. The two potential equations are now in the same form of the inhomogeneous wave equation.

Consider a magnet's characteristics.,
Note the material a permanent magnet is made from.,
Count the number of turns in an electromagnet's coil.,
Check the amount of current flowing through the electromagnetic coil.",How to Determine the Strength of Magnets1," Magnetic properties are described using these characteristics:


Coercive magnetic field strength, abbreviated Hc. This represents the point at which the magnet can be demagnetized (degaussed) by another magnetic field. The higher this number, the more difficult it is to degauss the magnet.
Residual magnetic flux density, abbreviated Br. This is the maximum magnetic flux the magnet can produce.
Related to magnetic flux density is overall energy density, abbreviated Bmax. The higher this number is, the more powerful the magnet.
The temperature coefficient of the residual magnetic flux density, abbreviated Tcoef of Br and expressed as a percentage of degrees Celsius, describes how the magnetic flux decreases as the magnet's temperature rises. A Tcoef of Br of 0.1 means that if the magnet's temperature rises 100 degrees Celsius (180 degrees Fahrenheit), its magnetic flux decreases by 10 percent.
The maximum operating temperature (abbreviated Tmax) is the highest temperature the magnet can be operated at without losing any of its field strength. Once the temperature falls below Tmax, the magnet recovers its full field strength. If the magnet is heated above Tmax, it will lose some of its field strength permanently after cooling to its normal operating temperature. If, however, the magnet is heated to its Curie temperature, abbreviated Tcurie, it will become demagnetized.;
, Permanent magnets are typically made from one of the following materials:


Neodymium iron boron. This has the highest magnetic flux density (12,800 gauss), coercive magnetic field strength (12,300 oersted), and overall energy density (40). It has the lowest maximum operating temperature and Curie temperature, at 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit) and 310 degrees Celsius (590 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively, and a temperature coefficient of -0.12.
Samarium cobalt has the next highest coercive field strength, at 9,200 oersted. But it has a magnetic flux density of 10,500 gauss and an overall energy density of 26. Its maximum operating temperature is much higher than for neodymium iron boron at 300 degrees Celsius (572 degrees Fahrenheit), as is its Curie temperature of 750 degrees Celsius (1,382 degrees Fahrenheit). Its temperature coefficient is 0.04.
Alnico is an aluminum-nickel-cobalt alloy. It has a magnetic flux density close to that of neodymium iron boron (12,500 gauss), but a much lower coercive magnetic field strength (640 oersted) and consequently an overall energy density of only 5.5. It has a higher maximum operating temperature than samarium cobalt, at 540 degrees Celsius (1,004 degrees Fahrenheit), as well as a higher Curie temperature, 860 degrees Celsius (1,580 degrees Fahrenheit), and a temperature coefficient of 0.02.
Ceramic and ferrite magnets have much lower flux densities and overall energy densities than the other materials, at 3,900 gauss and 3.5. Their magnetic flux density, however, is much better than alnico at 3,200 oersted. Their maximum operating temperature is the same as for samarium cobalt, but their Curie temperature is much lower, at 460 degrees Celsius (860 degrees Fahrenheit), and their temperature coefficient is -0.2. Therefore, they lose field strength faster in heat than do any of the other materials.

, The more coil turns per length of the core, the greater the magnetic field strength. Commercial electromagnets have sizable cores of one of the magnetic materials described above and large coils around them. However, a simple electromagnet can be made by wrapping a coil of wire around a nail and attaching its ends to a 1.5-volt battery., Use a multimeter to do this. The stronger the current, the stronger the magnetic field generated.


Ampere-turn per meter is another metric unit for measuring magnetic field strength. This represents how if the current, the number of coils, or both are increased, the magnetic field strength increases.

Add paperclips to the hook until it falls off the magnet.,
Write down how many clips it took to make the hook fall this time.,
Repeat the previous steps several times with more strips of masking tape.",How to Determine the Strength of Magnets2," You can make a simple magnet holder using a clothespin and a paper or Styrofoam cup. This method would be suitable for teaching elementary school-age students about magnetic fields.


Tape one of the long ends of a clothespin to the bottom of the cup.
Place the cup with the attached clothespin on the table upside down.
Insert the magnet into the clothespin.

, The easiest way to do this is to pull out the outer end of the paperclip. You will need to be able to hang more paperclips from the hook.

, Touch the bent paperclip to the magnet at one of its poles. The hook portion should hang free. Hang paperclips from the hook. Keep doing this until the weight of the clips causes the hook to fall.

, When you have added a sufficient number of paperclips and the hook falls off the magnet, carefully write down the exact number of paperclips that caused this to happen.

, Put 3 small strips of masking tape over the magnet's pole and hang the hook from it again.

, Repeat the previous method of hanging paperclips from the original paperclip hook, until it eventually falls off the magnet.

, Make sure you note both the number of masking tape strips and the number of paperclips used.

, Each time, note the number of paperclips it took to make the hook fall off the magnet. You should notice that as you added strips, it took fewer and fewer clips to make the hook fall off.

Calculate the baseline or original voltage.,
Touch the meter's sensor to one of the magnet's poles.,
Record the new voltage.,
Find the difference between the original and the new voltage.,
Divide the result by the sensitivity value of the sensor.,
Repeat to test the field strength at varying distances from the magnet.",How to Determine the Strength of Magnets3," This can be done using a gaussmeter, also known as a magnetometer or an EMF detector (electromagnetic field detector), which is a hand-held device that measures the strength and direction of a magnetic field strength. They are readily available to buy and simple to use. The gaussmeter method is suitable for teaching middle school and high school students about magnetic fields. Here's how to start using one:


Set the maximum voltage to be read at 10 volts DC.
Read the voltage display with the meter away from a magnet. This is the baseline or original voltage, represented as V0.

, On some gaussmeters, this sensor, called a Hall sensor, is built into an integrated circuit chip, so you actually touch the magnet's pole to a sensor., Represented by V1, the voltage will either go up or down, depending on which pole of the magnet is touching the Hall sensor. If the voltage goes up, the sensor is touching the magnet's south-seeking pole. If the voltage goes down, the sensor is touching the magnet's north-seeking pole.

, If the sensor is calibrated in millivolts, divide by 1,000 to convert from millivolts to volts.

, For example, if the sensor has a sensitivity of 5 millivolts per gauss, you would divide by 5. If it has a sensitivity of 10 millivolts per gauss, you would divide by 10. The value you receive is the field strength of the magnet in gauss.

, Place the sensor at a series of defined distances from the magnet's pole and record the results.

Here, f{\displaystyle f} and g{\displaystyle g} are two arbitrary functions that describe a wave propagating in the positive and negative directions, respectively. Since this is quite general, we can opt for the most common solution of just a sinusoidal function traveling in the direction of propagation. So we can write the solution as E=E0sin(2πλ(x−vt)),{\displaystyle E=E_{0}\sin \left({\frac {2\pi }{\lambda }}(x-vt)\right),} where E0{\displaystyle E_{0}} is the amplitude of the electric field (this quantity will cancel out later).

Begin with the definition of the vector potential.,
Rewrite Ampere's law in terms of potentials to obtain Poisson's equation.,
Solve Poisson's equation.,
Take the curl of A{\displaystyle {\mathbf {A} }}.,
Use the product rule ∇×(fv)=∇f×v+(∇×v)f{\displaystyle \nabla \times (f{\mathbf {v} })=\nabla f\times {\mathbf {v} }+(\nabla \times {\mathbf {v} })f} to simplify the above expression.",How to Derive the Biot‐Savart Law," Gauss' law of magnetism tells us that magnetic fields are always divergence-free, via ∇⋅B=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {B} }=0.} From vector calculus, we also recognize the identity ∇⋅(∇×F)=0,{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times {\mathbf {F} })=0,} for any vector field F.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }.} In other words, the divergence of a curl is always zero. Therefore, we can write a divergence-free field in terms of the curl of another vector field, called the vector potential.


B=∇×A{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }=\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} }}
;
, In doing so, we have a certain degree of freedom in how we write this. Potentials are not unique, and in the case of the vector potential, we can arbitrarily add a gradient of a scalar field without affecting the magnetic field, since the curl of a gradient is always zero. This is called a gauge transformation. This means that we can choose a potential that is convenient for us. Here, we will choose the Coulomb gauge, where ∇⋅A=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} }=0.}


∇×B=μ0J∇×(∇×A)=μ0J{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \times {\mathbf {B} }=\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }\\\nabla \times (\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} })=\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }\end{aligned}}}

An identity for simplifying the vector triple product is BAC-CAB. For curls, this is ∇×(∇×A)=∇(∇⋅A)−∇2A.{\displaystyle \nabla \times (\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} })=\nabla (\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} })-\nabla ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }.} Now, we remember that we chose ∇⋅A=0.{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {A} }=0.}


∇2A=−μ0J{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}{\mathbf {A} }=-\mu _{0}{\mathbf {J} }}



This is Poisson's equation for the vector potential. Though the expression above is actually three equations, we can solve for all three components simultaneously without having to worry about any pesky dependencies.


, One way to do this is via Fourier transforms. See the article linked for more details. Assuming you transformed correctly, you should obtain the general solution below.


A=μ04π∫J(x′)|x−x′|d3x′{\displaystyle {\mathbf {A} }={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}\int {\frac {{\mathbf {J} }({\mathbf {x} }^{\prime })}{|{\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }|}}{\mathrm {d} }^{3}{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }}

Notice that this is very similar in form to the solution for the scalar potential, of which a charge density ρ{\displaystyle \rho } associated with a stationary point charge allows us to reduce the solution to Coulomb's law, the law that describes electrostatics. Now, we wish to obtain the Biot-Savart law, the law that describes magnetostatics.


, Doing so recovers the magnetic field. Note that all the variables with primes in them are dummy variables, so the curl is taken with respect to x,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} },} allowing us to put the del operator under the integral.

, Since J(x′){\displaystyle {\mathbf {J} }({\mathbf {x} }^{\prime })} does not depend on x,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} },} that term vanishes. Note the chain rule when taking the gradient.


B(x)=∇×A=μ04π∫∇(1|x−x′|)×J(x′)d3x′=μ04π∫−(x−x′)|x−x′|3×J(x′)d3x′=μ04π∫J(x′)×(x−x′)|x−x′|3d3x′{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathbf {B} }({\mathbf {x} })&=\nabla \times {\mathbf {A} }\\&={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}\int \nabla \left({\frac {1}{|{\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }|}}\right)\times {\mathbf {J} }({\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }){\mathrm {d} }^{3}{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }\\&={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}\int {\frac {-({\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime })}{|{\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }|^{3}}}\times {\mathbf {J} }({\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }){\mathrm {d} }^{3}{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }\\&={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}\int {\frac {{\mathbf {J} }({\mathbf {x} }^{\prime })\times ({\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime })}{|{\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }|^{3}}}{\mathrm {d} }^{3}{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }\end{aligned}}}

The above expression is the Biot-Savart law. It takes into account the thickness of the conductor through which the current is going through. Although it appears as an inverse cube law, the presence of the displacement vector x−x′{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }} in the numerator ensures that the magnetic field falls off as the square of the distance and points in the proper direction.

For an infinitely narrow wire, we can neglect the thickness and replace J(x′)d3x′{\displaystyle {\mathbf {J} }({\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }){\mathrm {d} }^{3}{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }} with Idl{\displaystyle I{\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {l} }} and convert the integral to a line integral. Letting r=x−x′{\displaystyle {\mathbf {r} }={\mathbf {x} }-{\mathbf {x} }^{\prime }} be the displacement vector, we recover the familiar form of the Biot-Savart law.


B=μ04π∫Idl×r|r|3{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}\int {\frac {I{\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {l} }\times {\mathbf {r} }}{|{\mathbf {r} }|^{3}}}}

A breadboard is a piece of plastic with many holes that can be connected together to form circuits.The banana plug connectors make it easier to construct the circuit.
Alternatively, you can use two multimeters instead of one voltmeter and one ammeter. Set one multimeter to the voltage setting (positions labeled V) and one multimeter to the ammeter setting (positions labeled A).
It’s recommended to get the banana plug wires in five different colors to easily spot errors in the circuit setup (white, black, purple, green, and orange).;
, Make sure the power supply and ammeter are off during the construction of the circuit. Using the white banana plug wire, attach one end of the wire to the port of the multimeter that reads 10ADC and plug the other end into the positive terminal of the DC power supply.Make sure the multimeter is set to a position labeled “A”.
Use caution setting up the circuit. If the power supply is left on, it can damage your instruments and you could get a small shock while plugging things in.

, Using a second wire with banana plugs (black), plug in one end of the wire to the COM port of the multimeter and then insert the other end to the plug connector attached to the breadboard.The ammeter will be connected in series with the rest of the circuit.

, Taking a new wire with banana plug ends (purple), insert one end into the VΩ port of the voltmeter. Take the other end and insert it into the top of the black banana plug that connects the ammeter to the breadboard., Next to the black/purple stack insert one end of the wire into one slot of the breadboard and the other end further down on the breadboard.If the wire is insulated (has a plastic coating) make sure to remove enough of the insulation from the ends so that only exposed wire is inserted into the breadboard.

, With the green wire, plug one end of the wire into the negative terminal of the power supply and insert the other end of the banana plug wire directly next to the wire that you’re testing.At this stage, the positive terminal of the power supply should be connected to the ammeter and the negative terminal connected to the breadboard next to the experimental wire.

, This is the final connection to complete the circuit. With the orange wire plug one end into the COM port of the voltmeter and then insert the other end into the top of the green wire that is connected to the power supply.This configuration is essential to the entire circuit working properly.


The voltmeter is now connected in parallel to the rest of the circuit.

, Make sure the ammeter is set to DC. Also set the ammeter to the highest amperage setting (usually 10A) to avoid damaging the equipment.If you don’t see any readings after turning the power supply on, turn it down to the lower amperage setting (usually 400mA).

, Make sure the voltmeter is turned to the position labeled V with two lines over it: one dashed and one solid. This indicates DC voltage which is what you are working with.If don’t see any readings try changing the settings from V (volts) to mV (millivolts).

, Make sure the power supply is plugged in and turn it on. You should immediately see readings on both the ammeter and the voltmeter. With the circuit set up this way, you can use the readings from both of these meters to calculate the resistance through the wire.Record the readings for current from the ammeter and voltage from the voltmeter.
Ensure everything is properly connected and tightly plugged in before turning on the power supply.

, Ohm’s law states that I = V/R where “I” is the current flowing through the circuit, “V” is the voltage applied to the circuit, and “R” is the resistance.Resistance is the measure of how difficult it is for electrons to flow through a wire., Because you want to calculate the resistance of the wire, you will need to rearrange the equation to solve for resistance. This yields R = V/I. If you experimentally determine the amount of current and voltage going through the wire, you can calculate the resistance., Using the experimental results you obtained from your circuit, you can calculate the resistance of the wire in question. Plug in the numbers for the current (I) obtained from the ammeter and voltage (V) obtained from the voltmeter from your circuit into the equation.


For example: After setting up your circuit, you found that the current was 10 amps and the voltage was 100 volts. R = V/I = 100/10.

, Once you have plugged in the numbers, simply take voltage divided by current to solve for the resistance of the wire.


For example: R = V/I = 100/10 = 10 ohms. The resistance of the wire is 10 ohms.

, Tight connections are essential to completing the circuit. If one of the components is loosely connected you might end up with an open circuit, or a place where the electricity cannot continue to flow. Making sure everything is tight ensures a closed circuit.

, All of the components of the circuit must be arranged in the proper order or it will not work. You could end up with an incomplete circuit or components in the wrong sequence which can lead to equipment failure.Check each step and make sure you connected everything exactly as it says to do.
Draw a circuit diagram to use a map for all of your components and connections.

, If the wire you are testing has a plastic coating on it (insulation) this can impede the flow of electrons through the circuit. Any pieces of wire that are plugged into the breadboard need to be free of insulation.Use wire strippers to cut away the insulation from the ends of the wire before inserting into the breadboard.If you’re still having trouble, try trimming more of the insulation off the wire.

, This may seem obvious, but checking the power supply is an easy fix if that’s what is wrong. Make sure it is plugged in and that the outlet it is plugged into is working. If it’s plugged in and doesn’t turn on, you might need to replace the power source.

Recall the Lorentz transformations for electric and magnetic fields.,
Lorentz boost the electric field.,
Find z−ct{\displaystyle z-ct} in terms of the boosted frame.,
Substitute into the expression for the boosted electric field.,
Write in terms of the Doppler factor.",How to Lorentz Boost Electromagnetic Plane Waves," The magnitude of the two fields only differ by a constant via the relationship |E|=c|B|.{\displaystyle |{\mathbf {E} }|=c|{\mathbf {B} }|.} We also know that the two fields and the direction of propagation must be orthogonal to each other via B=1ck^×E,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }={\frac {1}{c}}{\hat {\mathbf {k} }}\times {\mathbf {E} },} where k^{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {k} }}} points in the direction of propagation - in our case, the z direction. Both of these insights suggests that the magnetic field can be written like so.


cBy=E0sin⁡(k(z−ct)){\displaystyle cB_{y}=E_{0}\sin(k(z-ct))}
;
, Since we are boosting in one direction only, we can ignore the other two dimensions perpendicular to the direction of propagation.


ct′=γ(ct−βz){\displaystyle ct^{\prime }=\gamma (ct-\beta z)}


z′=γ(z−βct){\displaystyle z^{\prime }=\gamma (z-\beta ct)}


, These transformations can be derived by transforming the Faraday tensor. You may be familiar with boosting in the x direction - in the case of the z direction, all that is needed is to perform a cyclic permutation of the components in the transformations, as the coordinate system can be arbitrarily chosen. Of special note here is the intricacy with which the two fields are related under a Lorentz boost.


Electric fields


Ez′=Ez{\displaystyle E_{z}^{\prime }=E_{z}}


Ex′=γ(Ex−βcBy){\displaystyle E_{x}^{\prime }=\gamma (E_{x}-\beta cB_{y})}


Ey′=γ(Ey+βcBx){\displaystyle E_{y}^{\prime }=\gamma (E_{y}+\beta cB_{x})}




Magnetic fields


cBz′=cBz{\displaystyle cB_{z}^{\prime }=cB_{z}}


cBx′=γ(cBx+βEy){\displaystyle cB_{x}^{\prime }=\gamma (cB_{x}+\beta E_{y})}


cBy′=γ(cBy−βEx){\displaystyle cB_{y}^{\prime }=\gamma (cB_{y}-\beta E_{x})}




, The first step to writing an expression for the boosted electric field is to simply write Ex′.{\displaystyle E_{x}^{\prime }.}


Ex′=γ(Ex−βcBy)=γ=γ(1−β)E0sin⁡(k(z−ct)){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}E_{x}^{\prime }&=\gamma (E_{x}-\beta cB_{y})\\&=\gamma \\&=\gamma (1-\beta )E_{0}\sin(k(z-ct))\end{aligned}}}


, While the above electric field is true, it is incomplete, as we want to write all quantities in terms of the boosted frame. This step requires that you write the Lorentz transformations from step 2 in inverse form. 


ct=γ(ct′+βz′){\displaystyle ct=\gamma (ct^{\prime }+\beta z^{\prime })}


z=γ(z′+βct′){\displaystyle z=\gamma (z^{\prime }+\beta ct^{\prime })}


z−ct=γ(z′+βct′)−γ(ct′+βz′)=γ(z′+βct′−ct′−βz′)=γ(z′(1−β)+ct′(1−β))=γ(1−β)(z′−ct′){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z-ct&=\gamma (z^{\prime }+\beta ct^{\prime })-\gamma (ct^{\prime }+\beta z^{\prime })\\&=\gamma (z^{\prime }+\beta ct^{\prime }-ct^{\prime }-\beta z^{\prime })\\&=\gamma (z^{\prime }(1-\beta )+ct^{\prime }(1-\beta ))\\&=\gamma (1-\beta )(z^{\prime }-ct^{\prime })\end{aligned}}}


, By the relationships established in step 1, the magnitude of the quantity below is also equal to the magnetic field cBy′.{\displaystyle cB_{y}^{\prime }.}


Ex′=γ(1−β)E0sin⁡{\displaystyle E_{x}^{\prime }=\gamma (1-\beta )E_{0}\sin}


, The quantity γ(1−β){\displaystyle \gamma (1-\beta )} can be simplified to the reciprocal of the Doppler factor. We make use of the relation γ=11−β2{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}} below.


γ(1−β)=1−β1−β2=1−β1−β1+β1−β1κ=1−β1+β{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\gamma (1-\beta )&={\frac {1-\beta }{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}\\&={\frac {{\sqrt {1-\beta }}{\sqrt {1-\beta }}}{{\sqrt {1+\beta }}{\sqrt {1-\beta }}}}\\{\frac {1}{\kappa }}&={\sqrt {\frac {1-\beta }{1+\beta }}}\end{aligned}}}

Above, κ=1+β1−β{\displaystyle \kappa ={\sqrt {\frac {1+\beta }{1-\beta }}}} (note the sign changes) is the Doppler factor - the factor by which the wavelength as detected by an observer changes with respect to the source. This makes intuitive sense in the problem outlined in this article, as we were dealing with plane waves, so it is not a surprise that the Doppler factor should come up. The boosted electric and magnetic fields can therefore be written as such.


Ex′=cBy′=1κE0sin(kκ(z′−ct′)){\displaystyle E_{x}^{\prime }=cB_{y}^{\prime }={\frac {1}{\kappa }}E_{0}\sin \left({\frac {k}{\kappa }}(z^{\prime }-ct^{\prime })\right)}



We see clearly now how the electric and magnetic fields transform - the amplitudes become smaller (decreased intensity) and the frequencies become smaller, corresponding to longer wavelengths (redshifting).

Become more familiar with the clouds.,
If you enjoy outdoor activities, take time to learn to tell the weather from clouds.",How to Distinguish the Different Types of Clouds1," There are many different types of clouds, and clouds are a great ""collectible"" for record-keeping. Cloud knowledge is fun for dinner party chats, and, for some people pursuing activities like hiking or boating that can be dangerous if the weather turns sour, cloud knowledge is vital for survival. Reading cloud shapes can help you to determine the weather headed your way without having to use additional instruments.


The shape of clouds will tell you a lot about the stability of the atmosphere.
The height of the clouds will tell you the distance of any approaching storm.
Shape and height of clouds together will tell you the likelihood of precipitation (rain/snow/hail).
Fun facts: Some UFO sightings are actually the result of cloud shapes. Lenticular (lens-shaped) clouds in particular are typically associated with warm fronts on the lee side of mountain ranges.

, While this article isn't specifically about forecasting, it's helpful to know that the seasoned outdoors person can tell what each type of cloud means for the weather. Different types of clouds form along warm fronts and cold fronts, and a field forecaster should be able to tell what weather is coming by reading the cloud shapes and height. For more information, read How to forecast the weather using clouds.

Convert between units of pressure.If you are not reading directly from a barometer, then you've probably been asked to convert a measurement from one unit of pressure to another.,
Know the units of pressure.,
Understand the origins of barometric measurement.",How to Calculate Barometric Pressure1," Learn the multipliers to convert between millibars, psi, atmospheres, and mm of mercury.Convert from inches of mercury to millibars: if you know the inches of mercury, simply multiply by 34.433. 1033/30=34.433{\displaystyle 1033/30=34.433}

Convert from psi to mm of mercury: multiply the psi by 51.7. 760/14.7=51.7{\displaystyle 760/14.7=51.7}

Convert from psi to inches of mercury: multiply the psi measurement by 2.041. 30/14.7=2.041{\displaystyle 30/14.7=2.041}

Convert from inches of Hg (mercury) to mm Hg: multiply the measurement in inches by 25.33. 760/30=25.33{\displaystyle 760/30=25.33}
;
, Pressure is a measure of force per unit area, and there are various ways to describe both the force and the area.Atmospheric pressure is usually expressed in psi: pounds per square inch. It can also be expressed in ""atmospheres"" – one atmosphere is 14.7 psi. In the U.S., it is common to speak of air pressure in ""inches of mercury,"" as one might read the pressure from a barometer. In meteorology, air pressure is most often expressed in ""millibars:"" each millibar is exactly one dyne (gm-cm/sec^2) per square centimeter in the c.g.s. system of units.14.7 psi is a rough average of barometric pressure at sea level and at STP (standard temperature and pressure.) STP is an internationally-accepted ""general state"" of the atmosphere. The 14.7 figure has been averaged over a large number of measurements, all either taken at sea level or corrected to sea level. Atmospheres are rarely used in meteorology.The millibar is an especially convenient unit of pressure for atmospheric studies. 1033 millibars is the pressure equivalent to one atmosphere, 14.7 psi, or 30 inches of mercury. Most weather maps and all aeronautical weather charts are in millibars, and the pressure at sea level is usually very close to 1000 millibars. 

Nearly all barometers in the U.S. are graduated in units of inches of mercury. The barometer is read to the nearest hundredth of an inch, such as ""29.93 inches."" Similarly, aircraft altimeter settings are universally given by control towers in inches of mercury corrected to sea level, regardless of the altitude of the airfield.


, The Italian physicist Torricelli conceived the first barometer from the fact that the average pressure of the atmosphere is capable of ""sucking"" 76 centimeters (760 mm) of mercury (Hg, which is a liquid metal at STP) up the inside bore of an evacuated glass tube. Later mathematicians have come up with other units of pressure, but the traditional unit remains mm Hg: millimeters of mercury."

Watch the sky for a flash of lightning.

,
Count the number of seconds until you hear thunder.,
Calculate the distance from lightning in miles or kilometers.,
Calculate the distance from lightning in feet or meters.",How to Calculate the Distance from Lightning,", If you have a digital or analog watch, begin timing as soon as you see the lightning and stop as soon as you hear the thunder. If you don’t have a watch, do your best to count the seconds accurately. Say ""One one thousand, two one thousand..."" in your mind as you count.

, Sound travels one mile every five seconds and one kilometer every three seconds. Therefore, if you want to find out how far you are from lightning, divide the number of seconds by 5 if you want the answer in miles and divide it by 3 if you want the answer in kilometers. The delay between when you see lightning and when you hear thunder occurs because sound travels much more slowly than light. Here's what you do:


Let's say you counted 18 seconds. To find your distance from the lightning in miles, divide 18 by 5 to get 3.6 miles. To find your distance from the lightning in kilometers, divide 18 by 3 to get 6 kilometers.
Though you won't be able to get a completely accurate result because the weather may vary in temperature and humidity, which will slightly affect the speed of sound, this is a good way to estimate how far you are from the lightning.

, Sound travels at a speed of about 344 meters, or 1,129 feet, per second. To calculate your distance from the lightning in meters, just round 344 down to 340 and multiply the number of seconds by 340. To calculate your distance from the lightning in feet, just round 1,129 up to 1130 and multiply the number of seconds by 1130. Here's how you do it:


Let's say you counted 3 seconds. Multiply that number by 340 to get your distance in meters. 3 x 340 = 1020 meters. Multiply that number by 1130 to get your distance in feet. 3 x 1130 = 3,390 feet.

Identify clouds by shape.",How to Distinguish the Different Types of Clouds2," The two shapes are cumulus and stratus:


Cumulus clouds: These are the big, ""fluffy"" clouds that look a bit like cotton balls. These clouds have a thickness that is usually equal to or greater than their width and they have very distinct edges. Cumulus clouds tend to indicate that the atmosphere is unstable at the altitude where they are found.
Stratus clouds: These clouds are layered and often look flat. They're usually much wider horizontally than vertically. Stratus clouds typically indicate a stable atmosphere but can also herald the onset of a non-violent storm. When fog appears it is usually accompanied by stratus clouds.;
"
"
Look for high altitude clouds (also known simply as ""high clouds"").,
Know your cirrus cloud.,
Spot a cirrocumulus cloud.,
Look for cirrostratus clouds.,
Learn how to tell the difference between cirrus clouds and cirrostratus clouds.,
Watch for contrails.",How to Distinguish the Different Types of Clouds3," These are considered to be clouds that are between 19,500 feet (5,943 meters) and 42,500 feet (12,954 meters). This encompasses cirrus, cirrostratus and cirrocumulus clouds. These clouds tend to be frozen (filled with ice crystals) and have blurry outlines; they are generally thin and wispy to the human eye.



Contrails from jet airplanes are also found at this level in the Earth's atmosphere.
High clouds produce beautiful red, orange and yellow colors in the sky at sunrise and sunset.
Rings of light around the moon or the sun are caused by cirrus clouds. A halo around the sun or moon can suggest rain or snow on the way, especially if accompanied by thickening lower clouds.
Cirrus clouds often partially obscure the sun.

, Cirrus clouds are distinguishable by their thin, white and wispy appearance. They generally reach an altitude above 20,000 feet (6,000 meters). The thinness tends to be due to the frigid winds in the upper atmosphere. Cirrus clouds are made up of ice crystals formed by supercooled water droplets.


Cirrus clouds that are sparse and stay that way usually show signs of fair weather. When cirrus clouds change into cirrostratus clouds, wind and precipitation are probably on their way within the next 24-36 hours. Cirrus indicates moisture above; if cirrus changes to altostratus and then stratus, a storm approaches soon.
You'll see cirrus clouds as a warm front advances.
The direction in which cirrus clouds move will usually tell you the direction of air movement, namely the weather coming your way.
Cirrus clouds are sometimes referred to as horse's or mare's tails because they curl out like a horse's tail.

, These clouds are often found in rows and they look like little puffed-up ripples. Some people think these clouds look like fish scales. The broken or rippled nature of these clouds is caused by air turbulence; it's bad news for anyone flying through them, but great news on the ground because these clouds usually mean that the weather is going to stay the same with no major sudden changes.

, These clouds tend to lack shape and have a hazy appearance. They usually spread across much of the sky. They suggest moisture is present in a large part of the sky, indicating that rain might be due soon. Thicker cirrostratus clouds can come from the top of an advancing storm system.

, Cirrostratus clouds are made up of ice crystals as well, but unlike cirrus clouds they can cover the entire sky and be up to several-thousand feet thick. Cirrostratus clouds are sheetlike and nearly transparent.

, Although these are machine made by jet airplanes, contrails can help you to know the weather in the heights above. Contrails are condensation, formed when the jet's warm exhaust mixes with the very cool air surrounding the jet in the upper atmosphere.


If the contrail disappears quickly, or you see a jet with no contrail, this means that the upper atmosphere you're observing is dry. On a lovely day, you can usually take this as a sign that the weather is going to remain fine for a while.
On the other hand, if the contrail is obvious for a time, is long and spreads, the upper atmosphere you're observing is wet. Grab your coat and umbrella because the weather will probably change soon, if it hasn't already.

Get acquainted with middle or mid-level altitude clouds.,
Discover altocumulus clouds.,
Look for altostratus clouds.,
Look for lenticular clouds around mountain ranges.",How to Distinguish the Different Types of Clouds4," These clouds usually have a height between 6,500 feet and 19,500 feet (1,981 meters and 5,943 meters). They are prefaced with the prefix ""alto,"" and are known as either altocumulus or altostratus clouds. They tend to be less defined than lower clouds, although warmer middle clouds will display sharp edges due to water content, and colder middle clouds will show distinct edges shaped by ice crystals.


Scattered middle clouds against a blue sky indicate continued fair weather, and are often succeeded by clear skies and a high pressure system.
Altostratus clouds that are becoming lower and have southerly winds in the northern hemisphere (vice versa for the southern hemisphere) can indicate an oncoming storm, but this will usually be several hours away.

, Altocumulus clouds are the clouds that you usually see during summer days. They come in many small clouds that are spread across the sky. Altocumulus clouds form by convection (vertical atmospheric motions) and cold fronts. Altocumulus clouds usually are followed by warm and humid summer mornings then a thunderstorm in the afternoon.


You can tell the difference between altocumulus clouds and high level clouds by noting the shading. Altocumulus clouds usually have shading underneath portions of the clouds.

, This middle cloud isn't very exciting––it tends to be grayish and sheet-like without shape. You might spot a glow of the sun behind this cloud. It's a good idea to prepare for wet or snowy weather when this type of cloud crosses the sky.

, These lens-shaped clouds or ""cloud caps"" don't happen everywhere––they tend to only form over mountain ranges and peaks due to the way that winds travel up the slopes. You're probably okay on the ground, but if you're up on the mountain or flying overhead, expect strong winds or turbulence. If you are on a mountain and a cloud cap descends, expect bad weather and seek suitable shelter.

Check out the low clouds.,
Look for nimbostratus clouds.,
Check the skies for the cumulonimbus cloud.",How to Distinguish the Different Types of Clouds5," These clouds are usually under 6,500 feet (1,981 meters), and they help to cool the Earth through reflecting back the Sun's heat away from the Earth's surface. They're usually a grayish-blue color and they are often rain clouds because they are filled with water droplets. Early morning low clouds might dry out before they have a chance to rain if the sun is able to evaporate them, which will result in a clear day, but expect rain if this is not the case. In fact, low clouds are the most likely source of rain or snow because their precipitation doesn't have a chance to evaporate before reaching the ground.


Rain or snow is fairly guaranteed if you see a lot of low clouds with dark bases. Low clouds of 3,000 feet (914 meters) thickness tend to mean precipitation; since you probably can't guess that height accurately from your observation point, look for the darkness.

, Nimbostratus clouds are dark, low level clouds, followed by light to moderate rainfall, and often continuous in nature. This cloud type frequently forms what looks like a sheet of cloud. Low lying clouds are generally made of water droplets, and can bring snow as well as rain. They're distinguishable from the aforementioned clouds because of their dark, big, and gloomy looking appearance.

, This cloud is easily distinguished from other clouds by its massive nature. Cumulonimbus clouds can fill up much of the sky with their massive and puffy pile, making it easy to tell them apart from cirrus or altocumulus clouds. Cumulonimbus clouds are mostly affiliated with thunderstorms, lightning, heavy rainfall, blizzard or hail. They can turn into super cells or tornadoes.


This cloud type can look like a big explosion or some see a resemblance to an anvil; the anvil tip points the direction that the weather is moving in.
In the event of extreme atmospheric instability, you might see what is known as a towering cumulus cloud. This cloud can have its base as low as a low cloud (6,500 feet) and reach as high as a high cloud. It's a warning sign because it can indicate gusting high winds, lightning, heavy rainfall and hail. In some areas, this cloud can also indicate an oncoming tornado.
This cloud brings with it a nasty weather system, but usually it is short lived. The weather following this cloud is often clear.

"
"
Look for the trend.,
Look at the reading.,
Know that atmospheric pressure decreases more or less exponentially with altitude.",How to Calculate Barometric Pressure2," In gauging weather trends and analysis, the absolute value of the pressure is nowhere nearly as significant as its ""trend."" Namely: is the barometric pressure rising, is it falling, or is it holding steady? Watch the barometer needle and record its movements.

The dials of older barometers often feature artistically-drawn backgrounds to indicate weather conditions like storms, strong winds, and clear skies. For all their aesthetic, these backgrounds can be misleading. The movement of the barometer needle has far more bearing upon the coming weather. 

If you have an old, traditional mercury tube-type barometer, then you may need to watch the meniscus: the highest curve of the liquid mercury that fills the cylinder.


, To determine the trend in a barometer, you need to compare the current pressure reading to a past pressure reading. Calculate the difference in pressure between the current reading and the reading from an hour ago.

In many barometers, you can manually set a needle to mark a point on the pressure gauge. The needle will remain at this point to help you gauge recent trends in the pressure.


, The higher you go, the lesser the pressure. This means that a barometric pressure that would send someone straight through the trapdoors of a storm cellar at sea level along the coast of Costa Rica would be perfectly commonplace in the midst of summer in the mile-high city of Denver.

Identify a series circuit.,
Add all resistances together.,
Start with current and voltage instead.,
Insert these values into Ohm's Law.",How to Calculate Total Resistance in Circuits1," A series circuit is a single loop, with no branching paths. All the resistors or other components are arranged in a line.

, In a series circuit, the total resistance is equal to the sum of all resistances.The same current passes through each resistor, so each resistor does its job as you would expect.

For example, a series circuit has a 2 Ω (ohm) resistor, a 5 Ω resistor, and a 7 Ω resistor. The total resistance of the circuit is 2 + 5 + 7 = 14 Ω.


, If you don't know the individual resistance values, you can rely on Ohm's Law instead: V = IR, or voltage = current x resistance. The first step is to find the circuit's current and total voltage:

The current of a series circuit is the same at all points on the circuit.If you know the current at any point, you can use that value in this equation.

The total voltage is equal to the voltage of the supply (the battery). It is not equal to the voltage across one component., Rearrange V = IR to solve for resistance: R = V / I (resistance = voltage / current). Plug the values you found into this formula to solve for total resistance.

For example, a series circuit is powered by a 12 volt battery, and the current is measured at 8 amps. The total resistance across the circuit must be RT = 12 volts / 8 amps = 1.5 ohms.

"
Understand parallel circuits.,
Calculate the total resistance from the resistance of each branch.,
Begin with total current and voltage instead.,
Use these values in Ohm's Law.,
Watch out for branches with zero resistance.",How to Calculate Total Resistance in Circuits2," A parallel circuit branches into multiple paths, which then join back together. Current flows through each branch of the circuit.

If your circuit has resistors on the main path (before or after the branched area), or if there are two or more resistors on a single branch, Skip down to the combination circuit instructions instead.


, Since each resistor only slows current passing through one branch, it only has a small effect on the total resistance of the circuit. The formula for total resistance RT is 1RT=1R1+1R2+1R3+...1Rn{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\frac {1}{R_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{2}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{3}}}+...{\frac {1}{R_{n}}}}, where R1 is the resistance of the first branch, R2 is the resistance of the second branch, and so on up to the last branch Rn.

For example, a parallel circuit has three branches, with resistances of 10 Ω, 2 Ω, and 1 Ω.Use the formula 1RT=110+12+11{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\frac {1}{10}}+{\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{1}}} and solve for RT:Convert fractions to a common denominator: 1RT=110+510+1010{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\frac {1}{10}}+{\frac {5}{10}}+{\frac {10}{10}}}1RT=1+5+1010=1610=1.6{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\frac {1+5+10}{10}}={\frac {16}{10}}=1.6}Multiply both sides by RT: 1 = 1.6RTRT = 1 / 1.6 = 0.625 Ω.


, If you don't know the individual resistances, you'll need the current and voltage instead:

In a parallel circuit, the voltage across one branch is the same as the total voltage across the circuit.As long as you know the voltage across one branch, you're good to go. The total voltage is also equal to the voltage of the circuit's power source, such as a battery.

In a parallel circuit, the current may be different along each branch. You need to know the total current, or you won't be able to solve for total resistance.


, If you know the total current and the voltage across the whole circuit, you can find the total resistance using Ohm's Law: R = V / I.

For example, a parallel circuit has a voltage of 9 volts and total current of 3 amps. The total resistance RT = 9 volts / 3 amps = 3 Ω.


, If a branch on the parallel circuit has no resistance, all of the current will flow through that branch. The resistance of the circuit is zero ohms.

In practical applications, this usually means a resistor has failed or been bypassed (short-circuited), and the high current could damage other parts of the circuit."
"
Break down your circuit into series sections and parallel sections.,
Find the resistance of each parallel section.,
Simplify your diagram.,
Add up resistances in series.,
Use Ohm's Law to find unknown values.",How to Calculate Total Resistance in Circuits3," A combination circuit has some components linked together in series (one after the other), and others in parallel (on different branches). Look for areas of your diagram that simplify to a single series or parallel section. Circle each one to help you keep track of them.

For example, a circuit has a 1 Ω resistor and a 1.5 Ω resistor connected in series. After the second resistor, the circuit splits into two parallel branches, one with a 5 Ω resistor and the other with a 3 Ω resistor.Circle the two parallel branches to separate them from the rest of the circuit.


, Use the parallel resistance formula 1RT=1R1+1R2+1R3+...1Rn{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{T}}}={\frac {1}{R_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{2}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{3}}}+...{\frac {1}{R_{n}}}} to find the total resistance of a single parallel section of the circuit.

The example circuit has two branches with resistance R1 = 5 Ω and R2 = 3 Ω.1Rparallel=15+13{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{parallel}}}={\frac {1}{5}}+{\frac {1}{3}}}1Rparallel=315+515=3+515=815{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{parallel}}}={\frac {3}{15}}+{\frac {5}{15}}={\frac {3+5}{15}}={\frac {8}{15}}}Rparallel=158=1.875{\displaystyle R_{parallel}={\frac {15}{8}}=1.875}Ω


, Once you've found the total resistance of a parallel section, you can cross out that whole section on your diagram. Treat that area as a single wire with resistance equal to the value you found.

In the example above, you can ignore the two branches and treat them as one resistor with resistance 1.875Ω.


, Once you've replaced each parallel section with a single resistance, your diagram should be a single loop: a series circuit. The total resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of all individual resistances, so just add them up to get your answer.

The simplified diagram has a 1 Ω resistor, 1.5 Ω resistor, and the section with 1.875 Ω you just calculated. These are all connected in series, so RT=1+1.5+1.875=4.375{\displaystyle R_{T}=1+1.5+1.875=4.375}Ω.


, If you do not know the resistance in one component of your circuit, look for ways to calculate it. If you know the voltage V and current I across that component, find its resistance using Ohm's Law: R = V / I.

Learn the formula for power.,
Solve for resistance using power and current.,
Find resistance from power and voltage.",How to Calculate Total Resistance in Circuits4," Power is the rate that the circuit consumes energy, and the rate it delivers energy to whatever the circuit is powering (such as a light bulb).The total power of a circuit is equal to the product of the total voltage and the total current. Or in equation form: P = VI.Remember, when solving for total resistance, you need to know the total power of the circuit. It's not enough to know the power flowing through one component.


, If you know these two values, you can combine two formulas to solve for resistance:

P = VI (power = voltage x current)

Ohm's Law tells us that V = IR.

Substitute IR for V in the first formula: P = (IR)I = I2R.

Rearrange to solve for resistance: R = P / I2.

In a series circuit, the current across one component is the same as the total current. This is not true for a parallel circuit.


, If you only know the power and voltage, you can use a similar approach to find resistance. Remember to use the total voltage across the circuit, or the voltage of the battery powering the circuit:

P = VI

Rearrange Ohm's Law in terms of I: I = V / R.

Substitute V / R for I in the power formula: P = V(V/R) = V2/R.

Rearrange to solve for resistance: R = V2/P.

In a parallel circuit, the voltage across one branch is the same as the total voltage. This is not true for a series circuit: the voltage across one component is not the same as the total voltage.

Solve for the potential inside the sphere.",How to Solve Laplace's Equation in Spherical Coordinates," In the most general case, the potential depends on all three variables. However, in many physical scenarios, there exists an azimuthal symmetry to the problem. For a physical example, an insulating sphere could have a charge density that is only dependent on θ,{\displaystyle \theta ,} so the potential must not depend on ϕ.{\displaystyle \phi .} This assumption greatly simplifies the problem so that we do not have to deal with spherical harmonics. 

First, we simply substitute.


Θr2∂∂r(r2∂R∂r)+Rr2sin⁡θ∂∂θ(sin⁡θ∂Θ∂θ)=0{\displaystyle {\frac {\Theta }{r^{2}}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(r^{2}{\frac {\partial R}{\partial r}}\right)+{\frac {R}{r^{2}\sin \theta }}{\frac {\partial }{\partial \theta }}\left(\sin \theta {\frac {\partial \Theta }{\partial \theta }}\right)=0}



Divide the equation by V.{\displaystyle V.} What remains is a term that only depends on r{\displaystyle r} and a term that only depends on θ.{\displaystyle \theta .} The derivatives then become ordinary derivatives.


1Rddr(r2dRdr)+1Θsin⁡θddθ(sin⁡θdΘdθ)=0{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }r}}\left(r^{2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }r}}\right)+{\frac {1}{\Theta \sin \theta }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\left(\sin \theta {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\Theta }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\right)=0}


;
, An argument must be made here. We have a term that only depends on r{\displaystyle r} and a term that only depends on θ.{\displaystyle \theta .} Their sum, however, must always equal 0. Since these derivatives are varying quantities in general, the only way that this can be true for all values of r{\displaystyle r} and θ{\displaystyle \theta } is if the terms are both constant. We will see very shortly that it is convenient for us to denote the constant by l(l+1).{\displaystyle l(l+1).}


1Rddr(r2dRdr)=l(l+1){\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }r}}\left(r^{2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }r}}\right)=l(l+1)}


1Θsin⁡θddθ(sin⁡θdΘdθ)=−l(l+1){\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\Theta \sin \theta }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\left(\sin \theta {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\Theta }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\right)=-l(l+1)}

We have now converted Laplace's equation, assuming azimuthal symmetry, into two noncoupled ordinary differential equations. 


, After multiplying and using the product rule, we find that this is simply the Euler-Cauchy equation.


r2d2Rdr2+2rdRdr−l(l+1)R=0{\displaystyle r^{2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}R}{{\mathrm {d} }r^{2}}}+2r{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }R}{{\mathrm {d} }r}}-l(l+1)R=0}

The standard method of solving this equation is to assume the solution of the form R=rn{\displaystyle R=r^{n}} and solve the resulting characteristic equation. In particular, we expand the quantity in the square root and factor. 


n2+n−l(l+1)=0{\displaystyle n^{2}+n-l(l+1)=0}


n=−12±1+4l(l+1)2=l, −l−1{\displaystyle n=-{\frac {1}{2}}\pm {\frac {\sqrt {1+4l(l+1)}}{2}}=l,\ -l-1}



The roots of the characteristic equation suggest our choice of constant. 

Since the Euler-Cauchy equation is a linear equation, the solution to the radial part is as follows.


R(r)=Arl+Brl+1{\displaystyle R(r)=Ar^{l}+{\frac {B}{r^{l+1}}}}




, This equation is the Legendre differential equation in the variable cos⁡θ.{\displaystyle \cos \theta .}


1sin⁡θddθ(sin⁡θdΘdθ)+l(l+1)Θ=0{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\left(\sin \theta {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\Theta }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\right)+l(l+1)\Theta =0}

To see this, we begin with the Legendre equation in the variable x{\displaystyle x} and make the substitution x=cos⁡θ,{\displaystyle x=\cos \theta ,} implying that dx=−sin⁡θdθ.{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }x=-\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta .}


ddx((1−x2)dΘdx)+l(l+1)Θ=0d−sin⁡θdθ(sin2⁡θdΘ−sin⁡θdθ)+l(l+1)Θ=01sin⁡θddθ(sin⁡θdΘdθ)+l(l+1)Θ=0{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}\left((1-x^{2}){\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\Theta }{{\mathrm {d} }x}}\right)+l(l+1)\Theta &=0\\{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{-\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\left(\sin ^{2}\theta {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\Theta }{-\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\right)+l(l+1)\Theta &=0\\{\frac {1}{\sin \theta }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\left(\sin \theta {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\Theta }{{\mathrm {d} }\theta }}\right)+l(l+1)\Theta &=0\end{aligned}}}



This equation can be solved using the method of Frobenius. In particular, the solutions are Legendre polynomials in cos⁡θ,{\displaystyle \cos \theta ,} which we write as Pl(cos⁡θ).{\displaystyle P_{l}(\cos \theta ).} These are orthogonal polynomials with respect to an inner product, which we elaborate on shortly. This orthogonality means that we can write any polynomial as a linear combination of Legendre polynomials. 


Θ(θ)=Pl(cos⁡θ){\displaystyle \Theta (\theta )=P_{l}(\cos \theta )}



The first few Legendre polynomials are given as follows. Notice that the polynomials alternate between even and odd. These polynomials will be very important in the next sections.


P0(x)=1{\displaystyle P_{0}(x)=1} 


P1(x)=x{\displaystyle P_{1}(x)=x}


P2(x)=12(3x2−1){\displaystyle P_{2}(x)={\frac {1}{2}}(3x^{2}-1)}


P3(x)=12(5x3−3x){\displaystyle P_{3}(x)={\frac {1}{2}}(5x^{3}-3x)}


P4(x)=18(35x4−30x2+3){\displaystyle P_{4}(x)={\frac {1}{8}}(35x^{4}-30x^{2}+3)}



It turns out that there is another solution to the Legendre differential equation. However, this solution cannot be part of the general solution because it blows up at θ=0{\displaystyle \theta =0} and θ=π,{\displaystyle \theta =\pi ,} so it is omitted.


Θ(θ)=lntanθ2{\displaystyle \Theta (\theta )=\ln \tan {\frac {\theta }{2}}}




, We now have our solutions to both the radial and angular equations. We can then write out the general solution as a series, since by linearity, any linear combination of these solutions is also a solution.


V(r,θ)=∑l=0∞(Alrl+Blrl+1)Pl(cos⁡θ){\displaystyle V(r,\theta )=\sum _{l=0}^{\infty }\left(A_{l}r^{l}+{\frac {B_{l}}{r^{l+1}}}\right)P_{l}(\cos \theta )}


, This is an example of a Dirichlet boundary condition, where the value everywhere on the boundary is specified. We then proceed to solve for the coefficients Al{\displaystyle A_{l}} and Bl.{\displaystyle B_{l}.}


V(R,θ)=V0(θ){\displaystyle V(R,\theta )=V_{0}(\theta )}


V0(θ)=∑l=0∞(AlRl+BlRl+1)Pl(cos⁡θ){\displaystyle V_{0}(\theta )=\sum _{l=0}^{\infty }\left(A_{l}R^{l}+{\frac {B_{l}}{R^{l+1}}}\right)P_{l}(\cos \theta )}


, Physically, the potential cannot blow up at the origin, so Bl=0{\displaystyle B_{l}=0} for all l.{\displaystyle l.}

Multiply both sides by Pl′(cos⁡θ)sin⁡θ{\displaystyle P_{l'}(\cos \theta )\sin \theta } and integrate from 0{\displaystyle 0} to π{\displaystyle \pi }. The Legendre polynomials are orthogonal with respect to this inner product.


∫0πV0(θ)Pl′(cos⁡θ)sin⁡θdθ=∑l=0∞AlRl∫0πPl(cos⁡θ)Pl′(cos⁡θ)sin⁡θdθ{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }V_{0}(\theta )P_{l'}(\cos \theta )\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta =\sum _{l=0}^{\infty }A_{l}R^{l}\int _{0}^{\pi }P_{l}(\cos \theta )P_{l'}(\cos \theta )\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta }

We take advantage of the very important relation, written below. δll′{\displaystyle \delta _{ll'}} is the Kronecker delta, meaning that the integral is nonzero only when l=l′.{\displaystyle l=l'.}


∫0πPl(cos⁡θ)Pl′(cos⁡θ)sin⁡θdθ=22l+1δll′{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }P_{l}(\cos \theta )P_{l'}(\cos \theta )\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta ={\frac {2}{2l+1}}\delta _{ll'}}




∫0πV0(θ)Pl(cos⁡θ)sin⁡θdθ=∑l=0∞AlRl22l+1{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi }V_{0}(\theta )P_{l}(\cos \theta )\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta =\sum _{l=0}^{\infty }A_{l}R^{l}{\frac {2}{2l+1}}}


, Knowing the coefficients, we have our potential inside the sphere in terms of a series, with the coefficients written in terms of integrals that, in principle, can be calculated. Note that this method only works because the Legendre polynomials constitute a complete set on the interval 0≤θ≤π.{\displaystyle 0\leq \theta \leq \pi .}


Al=2l+12Rl∫0πV0(θ)Pl(cos⁡θ)sin⁡θdθ{\displaystyle A_{l}={\frac {2l+1}{2R^{l}}}\int _{0}^{\pi }V_{0}(\theta )P_{l}(\cos \theta )\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta }


, We typically set the potential to 0 at infinity. This means that Al=0.{\displaystyle A_{l}=0.} Using the same method, we can find the coefficients of Bl.{\displaystyle B_{l}.}


Bl=2l+12Rl+1∫0πV0(θ)Pl(cos⁡θ)sin⁡θdθ{\displaystyle B_{l}={\frac {2l+1}{2}}R^{l+1}\int _{0}^{\pi }V_{0}(\theta )P_{l}(\cos \theta )\sin \theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta }


, The surface has a potential V0(θ)=kcos⁡4θ,{\displaystyle V_{0}(\theta )=k\cos 4\theta ,} where k{\displaystyle k} is a constant. The goal of problems like these is to solve for the coefficients Al{\displaystyle A_{l}} and Bl.{\displaystyle B_{l}.} From the previous section, we could in principle just do the integrals...but we opt to save some labor by comparing coefficients.


V(R,θ)=V0(θ)=∑l=0∞(AlRl+BlRl+1)Pl(cos⁡θ){\displaystyle V(R,\theta )=V_{0}(\theta )=\sum _{l=0}^{\infty }\left(A_{l}R^{l}+{\frac {B_{l}}{R^{l+1}}}\right)P_{l}(\cos \theta )}


, This step is crucial in comparing coefficients, and we can use trigonometric identities to do this. We then refer to the zeroth, second, and fourth polynomials to write V0{\displaystyle V_{0}} in terms of them.


kcos⁡4θ=k(8cos4⁡θ−8cos2⁡θ+1)=k(6435P4(cos⁡θ)−1621P2(cos⁡θ)−115P0(cos⁡θ)){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}k\cos 4\theta &=k(8\cos ^{4}\theta -8\cos ^{2}\theta +1)\\&=k\left({\frac {64}{35}}P_{4}(\cos \theta )-{\frac {16}{21}}P_{2}(\cos \theta )-{\frac {1}{15}}P_{0}(\cos \theta )\right)\end{aligned}}}


, Physically, the potential should go to 0 as r→∞.{\displaystyle r\to \infty .} This means that outside the sphere, Al=0.{\displaystyle A_{l}=0.}


V(r≥R,θ)=∑l=0∞Blrl+1Pl(cos⁡θ){\displaystyle V(r\geq R,\theta )=\sum _{l=0}^{\infty }{\frac {B_{l}}{r^{l+1}}}P_{l}(\cos \theta )}

We then compare coefficients (there are three of them) to match boundary conditions.


B0R=−k15, B0=−k15R{\displaystyle {\frac {B_{0}}{R}}=-{\frac {k}{15}},\ B_{0}=-{\frac {k}{15}}R}


B2R3=−16k21, B2=−16k21R3{\displaystyle {\frac {B_{2}}{R^{3}}}=-{\frac {16k}{21}},\ B_{2}=-{\frac {16k}{21}}R^{3}}


B4R5=64k35, B4=64k35R5{\displaystyle {\frac {B_{4}}{R^{5}}}={\frac {64k}{35}},\ B_{4}={\frac {64k}{35}}R^{5}}



Plugging back into the solution, we have the potential outside the sphere.


V(r≥R,θ)=k(−R15r−16R321r3P2(cos⁡θ)+64R535r5P4(cos⁡θ)){\displaystyle V(r\geq R,\theta )=k\left(-{\frac {R}{15r}}-{\frac {16R^{3}}{21r^{3}}}P_{2}(\cos \theta )+{\frac {64R^{5}}{35r^{5}}}P_{4}(\cos \theta )\right)}


, Since there is no charge density inside the sphere, the potential cannot blow up, so Bl=0.{\displaystyle B_{l}=0.} Furthermore, the boundary conditions and this technique ensure that the potential is continuous - in other words, the potential infinitesimally near the surface is the same when approached from both outside and inside the sphere.


V(r≤R,θ)=∑l=0∞AlrlPl(cos⁡θ){\displaystyle V(r\leq R,\theta )=\sum _{l=0}^{\infty }A_{l}r^{l}P_{l}(\cos \theta )}

Again, we compare coefficients to match boundary conditions.


A0=−k15{\displaystyle A_{0}=-{\frac {k}{15}}}


A2=−16k21R2{\displaystyle A_{2}=-{\frac {16k}{21R^{2}}}}


A4=64k35R4{\displaystyle A_{4}={\frac {64k}{35R^{4}}}}



We now have the potential inside the sphere.


V(r≤R,θ)=k(−115−16r221R2P2(cos⁡θ)+64r435R4P4(cos⁡θ)){\displaystyle V(r\leq R,\theta )=k\left(-{\frac {1}{15}}-{\frac {16r^{2}}{21R^{2}}}P_{2}(\cos \theta )+{\frac {64r^{4}}{35R^{4}}}P_{4}(\cos \theta )\right)}

We can substitute r=R{\displaystyle r=R} in both equations to check for equality. As mentioned before, the potential must be continuous.

, Recall that current is the time rate of change of charge. Below, J{\displaystyle {\mathbf {J} }} is the current density. Integrating J{\displaystyle {\mathbf {J} }} over the entire surface gives current. However, there is an additional negative sign attached to the expression below, because when charge flows out as described by a positive derivative, it corresponds to a decrease in charge.

−∮SJ⋅dS=−∫V(∇⋅J)dV{\displaystyle -\oint _{S}{\mathbf {J} }\cdot {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {S} }=-\int _{V}(\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {J} }){\mathrm {d} }V}

, Because the only quantity for which the integral is 0, is 0 itself, the expression in the integrand can be set to 0. This leads us to the continuity equation describing local conservation of charge.


∂ρ∂t=−∇⋅J{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}=-\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {J} }}

, There are two things to recognize here. First, the divergence of a curl is always 0, so the left side vanishes. Second, given well-behaved vector functions (in this case, vector functions on simply-connected domains), partial derivatives commute. In physics and engineering, we almost always deal with continuous, well-behaved functions, so this symmetry of mixed partials holds.


∇⋅(∇×B)=μ0∇⋅J+μ0ϵ0∇⋅∂E∂tμ0ϵ0∂∂t(∇⋅E)=−μ0∇⋅J{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times {\mathbf {B} })&=\mu _{0}\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {J} }+\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}\nabla \cdot {\frac {\partial {\mathbf {E} }}{\partial t}}\\\mu _{0}\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {E} })&=-\mu _{0}\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {J} }\end{aligned}}}


, 


∇⋅E=ρϵ0{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {E} }={\frac {\rho }{\epsilon _{0}}}}

By substituting Gauss' Law and simplifying, we recover the continuity equation describing conservation of charge.

Each corn kernel is an electron, and the stream of kernels flowing into the bowl is the current.When talking about the flow, you describe it by saying how many kernels are flowing each second. When talking about a current, you measure it in amperes (amps), or a certain (very large) number of electrons flowing per second.;
, Electrons have a ""negative"" electrical charge. This means they attract (or flow toward) objects with a positive charge, and repel (or flow away from) objects with a negative charge. Since they're all negative, electrons are always trying to push away from other electrons, spreading out wherever they can.

, Voltage measures the difference in electrical charge between two points. The greater the difference, the more energetically the two sides attract each other. Here's an example with an everyday battery:


Inside a battery, chemical reactions happen that produces a buildup of electrons. The electrons go to the negative end, while the positive end stays mostly empty. (These are called the negative and positive terminals.) The longer this goes on, the larger the voltage between the two ends.
When you connect a wire between the negative and positive ends, the electrons at the negative end suddenly have somewhere to go. They shoot toward the positive end, creating a current. The larger the voltage, the more electrons move to the positive end each second.

, Resistance is exactly what it sounds like. The more resistance something has, the harder it is for the electrons to push through. This slows the current, since fewer electrons can push through each second.


A resistor is anything in the circuit that adds resistance. You can buy an actual ""resistor"" at an electronics store, but in a circuits problem it might represent a light bulb or anything else with resistance.

, There's a very simple relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. Write this down or memorize it; you'll use it often when solving circuit problems:


Current = voltage divided by resistance
This is usually written: I = V / R

Think about what happens when you increase V (voltage) or R (resistance). Does this match what you learned in the explanations above?

, A series circuit is easy to identify. It's just one loop of wire, with everything arranged in a row. The current flows around the entire loop, going through each resistor or element in order.


The current is always the same at any point along the circuit.When calculating voltage, it doesn't matter where the resistor is on the circuit. You can pick up the resistors and move them around, and you'll still have the same voltage across each one.
We'll use an example circuit with three resistors in series: R1, R2, and R3. This is powered by a 12 volt battery. We'll find the voltage across each one.

, Add together all resistance values on the circuit. The answer is the total resistance of the series circuit.


For example, the three resistors R1, R2, and R3 have resistances of 2 Ω (ohms), 3 Ω, and 5 Ω respectively. The total resistance is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 ohms.

, Use Ohm's Law to find the current of the entire circuit. Remember, the current is the same anywhere on a series circuit. Once we calculate the current this way, we can use it for all our calculations.


Ohm's Law says that the current I = V / R. The voltage across the whole circuit is 12 volts, and the total resistance is 10 ohms. The answer is I = 12 / 10 = 1.2 amperes.

, With basic algebra, we can change Ohm's Law to solve for voltage instead of current:


I = V / R

IR = VR / R

IR = V
V = IR

, We know the resistance, we know the current, and we have our equation. Plug in the numbers and solve. Here's our example problem solved for all three resistors:


Voltage across R1 = V1 = (1.2A)(2Ω) = 2.4 volts.
Voltage across R2 = V2 = (1.2A)(3Ω) = 3.6 volts.
Voltage across R3 = V3 = (1.2A)(5Ω) = 6.0 volts.

, In a series circuit, the sum of all your answers must equal the total voltage.Add up every voltage you calculated and see if you get the voltage of the entire circuit. If you didn't, go back and check for mistakes.


In our example, 2.4 + 3.6 + 6.0 = 12 volts, the voltage across the whole circuit.
If your answer is slightly off (for instance, 11.97 instead of 12), you probably rounded a number at some point. Your answer is still correct.
Remember, voltage measures the differences in charge, or numbers of electrons. Imagine counting the number of new electrons you see as you travel along the circuit. If you count them correctly, you're going to end up with the total change in electrons from the beginning to the end.

, Imagine a wire leaving one end of a battery, then splitting into two separate wires. These two wires run parallel to each other, then join up again before they reach the other end of the battery. If there's a resistor on the left wire and a resistor on the right wire, those two resistors are connected ""in parallel.""You can have any number of wires in a parallel circuit. These instructions will still work for a circuit that splits into one hundred wires and comes back together.

, In a parallel circuit, the current flows across each path available to it. Current will flow through the wire on the left, cross the left resistor, and reach the other end. At the same time, current will flow through the wire on the right, cross the right resistor, and reach the end. No part of the current doubles back or flows through two parallel resistors.

, If you know the voltage across the whole circuit, the answer is surprisingly easy. Each parallel wire has the same voltage as the entire circuit.Let's say a circuit with two parallel resistors is powered by a 6 volt battery. The voltage across the left resistor is 6 volts, and the voltage across the right resistor is 6 volts. It doesn't even matter how much resistance there is. To understand why, think back to the series circuits described above:


Remember that adding voltage drops in a series circuit always results in the total voltage across the circuit.
Think of each path the current takes as a series circuit. The same holds true for this: if you count up all the voltage drops, you'll end up with the total voltage.
Since the current through each of the two wires only passes through one resistor, the voltage across that resistor must equal the total voltage.

, If the problem doesn't tell you what the total voltage of the circuit is, you'll need to complete a few more steps. Start by finding the total current passing through the circuit. In a parallel circuit, the total current is equal to the sum of the current running through each parallel path.In mathematical terms: Itotal = I1 + I2 + I3...
If you're having trouble understanding this, imagine a water pipe split into two paths. The total amount of water flow is just the amount of water flow in each pipe, added together.

, Resistors are not as effective in a parallel circuit, because they only block the current going along one wire. In fact, the more wires there are, the easier it is for the current to find a way through. To find the total resistance, solve for Rtotal in this equation:



1 / Rtotal = 1 / R1 + 1 / R2 + 1 / R3 ...
For example, a circuit has a 2 ohm and a 4 ohm resistor in parallel. 1 / Rtotal = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4 → 1 = (3/4)Rtotal → Rtotal = 1/(3/4) = 4/3 = ~1.33 ohms.

, Remember, once we find the total voltage of the circuit, we have found the voltage across any one of the parallel wires. Solve for the whole circuit using Ohm's law. Here's an example:


A circuit has 5 amperes of current running through it. The total resistance is 1.33 ohms.
According to Ohm's Law, I = V / R, therefore V = IR
V = (5A)(1.33Ω) = 6.65 volts.

What it is.",How to Calculate Series and Parallel Resistance2," Series resistance is simply connecting the ""out"" side of one resistor to the ""in"" side of another in a circuit. Each additional resistor placed in a circuit adds to the total resistance of that circuit.


The formula for calculating a total of n number of resistors wired in series is:
Req = R1 + R2 + .... Rn
That is, all the series resistor values are simply added. For example, consider finding the equivalent resistance in the image below

In this example,
R1 = 100 Ω and R2 = 300Ω are wired in series. Req = 100 Ω + 300 Ω = 400 Ω


"
"
What it is.",How to Calculate Series and Parallel Resistance3," Parallel resistance is when the ""in"" side of 2 or more resistors are connected, and the ""out"" side of those resistors are connected.


The equation for combining n resistors in parallel is:
Req = 1/{(1/R1)+(1/R2)+(1/R3)..+(1/Rn)}
Here is an example, given R1 = 20 Ω, R2 = 30 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.

The total equivalent resistance for all 3 resistors in parallel is:
Req = 1/{(1/20)+(1/30)+(1/30)}
= 1/{(3/60)+(2/60)+(2/60)}
= 1/(7/60)=60/7 Ω = approximately 8.57 Ω.


"
"
What it is.",How to Calculate Series and Parallel Resistance4," A combined network is any combination of series and parallel circuits wired together. Consider finding the equivalent resistance of the network shown below.


We see the resistors R1 and R2 are connected in series. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by Rs) is:
Rs = R1 + R2 = 100 Ω + 300 Ω = 400 Ω.

Next, we see the resistors R3 and R4 are connected in parallel. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by Rp1) is:
Rp1 = 1/{(1/20)+(1/20)} = 1/(2/20)= 20/2 = 10 Ω

Then we see the resistors R5 and R6 are also connected in parallel. So their equivalent resistance (let us denote it by Rp2) is:
Rp2 = 1/{(1/40)+(1/10)} = 1/(5/40) = 40/5 = 8 Ω

So now we have a circuit with the resistors Rs, Rp1, Rp2 and R7 connected in series. These can now simply be added to get the equivalent resistance R7 of the network given to us originally.
Req = 400 Ω + 20Ω + 8 Ω = 428 Ω.

Understand the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.,
Measure the mass of a given object.,
Measure the object's acceleration.,
Multiply the object's mass by its acceleration.",How to Measure Force1," The force of an object is simply the product of its mass and acceleration. This relationship can be defined by the following formula: Force = Mass x Acceleration. Here are a few other things to keep in mind as you measure force:


The standard unit for mass is kilograms (kg).
The standard unit for acceleration is m/s2.
The standard unit for force is the newton (N). The newton is a derived standard unit. 1N = 1 kg x 1m/s2.;
, An object's mass is the amount of matter that it contains. The mass of an object never changes, no matter what planet it's on; while weight fluctuates depending on gravitational pull, your mass is the same on Earth and on the Moon.In the metric system, mass can be expressed in grams or kilograms. Let's say the object we're working with is a truck that has a mass of 1000 kg.


To find the mass of a given object, place it on a triple beam or a double pan balance. This will calculate the mass in kilograms or grams.
In the English system, mass can be expressed in pounds. Because force can also be expressed in pounds, the term ""pound-mass"" has been coined to distinguish its usage. However, if you find the mass of an object using pounds in the English system, it's best to convert it to the metric system. If you know an object's mass in pounds, simply multiply it by .45 to find the mass in kilograms.

, In physics, acceleration is defined as a change in velocity, which is defined as speed in a given direction, per unit of time. In addition to the common definition of acceleration as speeding up, it also can mean an object is slowing down or changing direction. Just as velocity can be measured with a speedometer, acceleration is measured with an accelerometer. Let's say the acceleration of the 1000 kg truck we're working with is 3m/s2.


In the metric system, velocity is expressed in centimeters per second or meters per second, and acceleration is expressed as centimeters per second per second (centimeters per second squared) or meters per second per second (meters per second squared).
In the English system, one way to express velocity is as feet per second, so acceleration can be expressed in feet per second squared.

, This is the force's value. Simply plug in the known numbers into the equation and you will know the force of the object. Remember to state your answer in newtons (Ns).


Force = Mass x Acceleration
Force = 1000 kg x 3m/s2

Force = 3000N

Use Ohm’s law to find the total current.",How to Calculate Total Current," Current is the flow of electrically charged carriers like electrons or the flow of charge per unit of time. But what is a charge and what is an electron? An electron is a negatively charged particle. A charge is a property of matter that is used to classify whether a thing is positive or negatively charged. Like magnets, alike charges repel and opposites attract.


We can illustrate this by using water. Water is composed of the molecule, H2O – which stands for 2 atoms of Hydrogen and 1 atom of Oxygen bonded together. We know that the oxygen atom and hydrogen atoms make up the molecule, H2O.
A flowing body of water is composed of millions and millions of this molecule. We can compare the flowing body of water to the current; the molecule to electron; and the charge to the atoms.;
, Voltage is the “force” that drives the current to flow. To best illustrate voltage; we will use the battery as an example. Inside the battery is a series of chemical based reactions which create a buildup of electrons in the positive terminal of the battery.


If we now connect a medium (eg a wire) from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the battery, the electron buildup will now move to get away from each other because as we said, alike charges repel.
In addition, because of the law of conservation of charge, which states that the net charge of an isolated system should remain constant, the electrons will try to balance the charges by going from the higher concentration of electrons to the lower concentration of electrons or positive terminal to the negative terminal, respectively.
This movement causes a potential difference in each of the terminals which we can now call voltage.

, Resistance, on the other hand, is the opposition of certain elements to flow of charge.


Resistors are elements with significant resistance. They are placed in certain parts of a circuit to regulate the flow of charge or electrons.
If there are no resistors, the electrons are not regulated, the equipment may receive too much charge and it will be damaged or cause a fire due to overcharging.

, Imagine a straw you are drinking from. Pinch it several times. What do you notice? The water flowing will be lessened. Those pinches are the resistors. They block the water which is the current. Since the pinches are in a straight line, they are in series. Drawing from this example, the total resistance of resistors in a series is:


R(total) = R1 + R2 + R3.

, Most of the time, the total voltage is readily given, but in cases where individual voltages are given, we can use the equation:


V(total) = V1 + V2 + V3.
But why is this so? Using the straw analogy again, after pinching the straw, what do you expect? You need more effort to get water through the straw. The total effort you are delivering is brought about by the individual force the individual pinches need.
The “force” you need is the voltage, because it drives the flow of water or the current. Therefore it is only logical that the total voltage is brought about by adding up the individual voltages across each resistor.

, Using the straw analysis again, even in the presence of pinches, did the amount of water you get change? No. Although the speed at which you are getting the water changes, the amount of water you can drink is fixed. And if you look closer at the amount of water entering and leaving, the pinches are the same because of the fixed speed the water is flowing, therefore, we can say that:


I1 = I2 = I3 = I(total)

, But it doesn’t stop there! Remember we don’t have any of this data, so we can use the Ohm’s Law which relates voltage, current and resistance:


V = IR.

, Three resistors, R1 = 10Ω R2=2Ω R3 = 9Ω, are connected in series. A total voltage of 2.5V is applied to the circuit. Compute for the total current of the circuit. First let’s compute for the total resistance:


R(total) = 10Ω R2 + 2Ω R3 + 9Ω
Therefore R(total) = 21Ω


,

I(total) = V(total) / R(total).

I(total) = 2.5V / 21Ω.

I(total) = 0.1190A.

, Like it name, a parallel circuit contains elements that are arranged in a parallel way. This makes use of multiple wiring arrangements creating paths wherein current can travel.

, Since we have sorted out the terminologies in a previous section, we can now go directly to the computations. Take for an example a pipe split into two paths with different diameters. For the water to flow into both of the pipes, do you need to use unequal forces in each of the pipes? No. You just need enough force for the water to flow. Therefore, using the analogy that the water is the current and the force is the voltage, we can say that:



V(total) = V1 + V2 + V3.

, Say you want to regulate the water flowing in the pipes. How will you block the pipes? Do you put just one blockage on each path or do you put multiple blockages arranged consecutively to control the water flow? You would need to do the latter. For resistances, this analogy is the same. Resistors connected in series regulate current far better than those arranged in a parallel way. The equation for the total resistance in a parallel circuit is:



1/R(total) = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3).

, Going back to our example, the water flowing from the source to the split path is divided. The same is applicable for current. Since there are multiple paths where charges can flow, it can be said that to be split. The pathways do not necessarily receive equal amounts of charge. It is dependent on the resistances and the materials the elements have in each path. Therefore, the equation of the total current is just the summation of all the currents in all of the paths:


I(total) = I1 + I2 + I3.
Of course, we can’t use this yet because we do not have the individual currents. In this case Ohm’s Law can also be used.

, 4 resistors divided into two paths which are connected in parallel. Path 1 contains, R1 = 1Ω R2=2Ω while Path 2 contains, R3 = 0.5Ω R4=1.5Ω. The resistors in each path are connected in series. The voltage applied in path 1 is 3V. Find the total current.

, Since the resistors in each path are connected in series, we will find solve for the total resistance in each path.



R(total 1&2) = R1 +R2.

R(total 1&2) = 1Ω + 2Ω.

R(total 1&2) = 3Ω.

R(total 3&4) = R3 + R4.

R(total 3&4) = 0.5Ω + 1.5Ω.
R(total 3&4) = 2Ω.

, Now, we since the paths are connected in parallel, we will now use the equation for parallel connection



(1/R(total)) = (1/R(total 1&2)) + (1/R(total 3&4)).

(1/R(total)) = (1/3Ω) + (1/2Ω).

(1/R(total)) = ⅚.
R(total) = 1.2Ω.

, Now compute for the total voltage. Since the total voltage is equal to all the voltages:



V(total) = V1 = 3V.

, Now, we can compute for the total current using Ohm’s Law.



V(total) = I(total) x R(total).

I(total) = V(total)/R(total).

I(total) = 3V/1.2Ω.

I(total) = 2.5A.

Example: A runner reaches a speed of 6 m/s in 10 seconds. What is his acceleration?
The final velocity is 6 m/s. The original velocity is 0 m/s. The time is 10s.

, Because power is defined as work per unit time, and magnetic fields do no work, the Lorentz force can be written as F=qE.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F} }=q{\mathbf {E} }.} The usefulness of this relation will be seen later.


P=dEdt=F⋅v=qE⋅v{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}P={\frac {{\mathrm {d} }E}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}&={\mathbf {F} }\cdot {\mathbf {v} }\\&=q{\mathbf {E} }\cdot {\mathbf {v} }\end{aligned}}}

Do not be confused by E{\displaystyle E} in this context, which stands for energy, not electric field. 


, The Lorentz force, while true, is not very useful in its current state. The reason why this is the case is because coordinate time is not invariant in Minkowski space. We need to reformulate the Lorentz force in terms of proper time, for proper time is invariant. 


dt=γdτ,γ=11−v2c2{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }t=\gamma {\mathrm {d} }\tau ,\gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}

When derivatives are taken with respect to these variables, the relation is ddt=1γddτ.{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}={\frac {1}{\gamma }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}.} Therefore, in order to convert to proper time, we must multiply by γ.{\displaystyle \gamma .}


, The result is simply an extra γ{\displaystyle \gamma } factor on the right side.


dEdτ=γq(E⋅v){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }E}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=\gamma q({\mathbf {E} }\cdot {\mathbf {v} })}


dpdτ=γq(E+v×B){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {p} }}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=\gamma q({\mathbf {E} }+{\mathbf {v} }\times {\mathbf {B} })}


, This form is similar in appearance to a matrix equation, in which a matrix acting on a vector outputs another vector. We can rewrite it like this because the above two equations describe everything we need to know about the matrix. Recognize the 4-momentum and 4-velocity in component form below.


ddτ(E/cpxpypz)=γq(F00F01F02F03F10F11F12F13F20F21F22F23F30F31F32F33)(1vxvyvz){\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}{\begin{pmatrix}E/c\\p_{x}\\p_{y}\\p_{z}\end{pmatrix}}=\gamma q{\begin{pmatrix}F^{0}{}_{0}&F^{0}{}_{1}&F^{0}{}_{2}&F^{0}{}_{3}\\F^{1}{}_{0}&F^{1}{}_{1}&F^{1}{}_{2}&F^{1}{}_{3}\\F^{2}{}_{0}&F^{2}{}_{1}&F^{2}{}_{2}&F^{2}{}_{3}\\F^{3}{}_{0}&F^{3}{}_{1}&F^{3}{}_{2}&F^{3}{}_{3}\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}1\\v_{x}\\v_{y}\\v_{z}\end{pmatrix}}}

The matrix above is the Faraday tensor Fμν,{\displaystyle F^{\mu }{}_{\nu },} written out in its component form. (Don’t worry about the placement of the indices for now.) From here, it is clear that we need to find these components such that they satisfy dEdτ=γq(E⋅v){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }E}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=\gamma q({\mathbf {E} }\cdot {\mathbf {v} })} and dpdτ=γq(E+v×B).{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {p} }}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=\gamma q({\mathbf {E} }+{\mathbf {v} }\times {\mathbf {B} }).}


, It is easy to do this one equation at a time.


ddτ(E/c)=γq(F00+F01vx+F02vy+F03vz)=γqc(E⋅v){\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}(E/c)=\gamma q(F^{0}{}_{0}+F^{0}{}_{1}v_{x}+F^{0}{}_{2}v_{y}+F^{0}{}_{3}v_{z})={\frac {\gamma q}{c}}({\mathbf {E} }\cdot {\mathbf {v} })}

Here, the answer is trivial. F00=0,F01=Ex/c,F02=Ey/c,F03=Ez/c{\displaystyle F^{0}{}_{0}=0,F^{0}{}_{1}=E_{x}/c,F^{0}{}_{2}=E_{y}/c,F^{0}{}_{3}=E_{z}/c}




dpxdτ=γq(F10+F11vx+F12vy+F13vz){\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }p_{x}}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=\gamma q(F^{1}{}_{0}+F^{1}{}_{1}v_{x}+F^{1}{}_{2}v_{y}+F^{1}{}_{3}v_{z})}

Here, the answer is slightly less obvious, because we need to incorporate the B{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }} field as well. Since this is the x{\displaystyle x} component of the force, we have to look for fields that generate forces in that direction. We know E{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }} fields generate forces parallel to them, while a moving charged particle in a B{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }} field generates a force in the direction orthogonal to both v{\displaystyle {\mathbf {v} }} and B.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }.}

Of course, a particle moving in the x{\displaystyle x} direction cannot possibly generate a force in that same direction, given how B{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }} fields interact with them, so that term is 0.

Therefore, F10=Ex/c,F11=0,F12=Bz,F13=−By.{\displaystyle F^{1}{}_{0}=E_{x}/c,F^{1}{}_{1}=0,F^{1}{}_{2}=B_{z},F^{1}{}_{3}=-B_{y}.}



We can proceed to derive the last two rows of the tensor in the same manner. The important part is the antisymmetry exhibited in the lower-right 3x3 partition of the tensor, which stems from the cross product in the Lorentz force. In doing so, the diagonal elements of the tensor get sent to 0. The last two rows are as follows.


F20=Ey/c,F21=−Bz,F22=0,F23=Bx{\displaystyle F^{2}{}_{0}=E_{y}/c,F^{2}{}_{1}=-B_{z},F^{2}{}_{2}=0,F^{2}{}_{3}=B_{x}}


F30=Ez/c,F31=By,F32=−Bx,F33=0{\displaystyle F^{3}{}_{0}=E_{z}/c,F^{3}{}_{1}=B_{y},F^{3}{}_{2}=-B_{x},F^{3}{}_{3}=0}




, This tensor, also called the electromagnetic tensor, describes the electromagnetic field in spacetime. Two fields, previously thought of as separate, shown to be interconnected via Maxwell’s equations, are finally united by special relativity into a single mathematical object. The tensor shown below is in mixed-variant form because of how we have derived it from the Lorentz force.  


Fμν=(0Ex/cEy/cEz/cEx/c0Bz−ByEy/c−Bz0BxEz/cBy−Bx0){\displaystyle F^{\mu }{}_{\nu }={\begin{pmatrix}0&E_{x}/c&E_{y}/c&E_{z}/c\\E_{x}/c&0&B_{z}&-B_{y}\\E_{y}/c&-B_{z}&0&B_{x}\\E_{z}/c&B_{y}&-B_{x}&0\end{pmatrix}}}


, Index notation allows these quantities to be described more compactly and in a coordinate-independent manner.


dpαdτ=qFαβvβ{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }p^{\alpha }}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=qF^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }v^{\beta }}


pα′=Λα′βpβ{\displaystyle p^{\alpha \prime }=\Lambda ^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta }p^{\beta }}


vβ′=Λβ′δvδ{\displaystyle v^{\beta \prime }=\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\delta }v^{\delta }}

Above, Λ{\displaystyle \Lambda } is the Lorentz transformation tensor. For a boost in the x{\displaystyle x} direction, it can be written as below. Λ−1,{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{-1},} of course, has positive γβ{\displaystyle \gamma \beta } on the off-diagonal. 


Λ=(γ−γβ00−γβγ0000100001){\displaystyle \Lambda ={\begin{pmatrix}\gamma &-\gamma \beta &0&0\\-\gamma \beta &\gamma &0&0\\0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\end{pmatrix}}}




, The laws are physics are the same in every inertial reference frame, so the equations are of a similar form. The power of writing the above relations in the covariant form stems from the fact that the Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation.


dpα′dτ=qFα′β′vβ′{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }p^{\alpha \prime }}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=qF^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }v^{\beta \prime }}


, Then left-multiply each side by the inverse Lorentz tensor Λ−1.{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{-1}.} 


(Λ−1)μα′ddτΛα′βpβ=q(Λ−1)μα′Fα′β′Λβ′δvδ{\displaystyle (\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}\Lambda ^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta }p^{\beta }=q(\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }F^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\delta }v^{\delta }}


, Because the Lorentz tensor can be treated as a constant, it can be inserted inside the derivative operator. Observe that (Λ−1)αβ′Λβ′σ=δασ,{\displaystyle (\Lambda ^{-1})^{\alpha }{}_{\beta \prime }\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\sigma }=\delta ^{\alpha }{}_{\sigma },} where δ{\displaystyle \delta } is the Kronecker delta (not to be confused by the index below, which only represents numbers).


ddτ(Λ−1)μα′Λα′βpβ=q(Λ−1)μα′Fα′β′Λβ′δvδddτδμβpβ=q(Λ−1)μα′Fα′β′Λβ′δvδ{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}(\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }\Lambda ^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta }p^{\beta }&=q(\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }F^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\delta }v^{\delta }\\{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}\delta ^{\mu }{}_{\beta }p^{\beta }&=q(\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }F^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\delta }v^{\delta }\end{aligned}}}

When the Kronecker delta acts on a vector, the same vector is outputted. The only difference is that here, the β{\displaystyle \beta } index is contracted.


dpμdτ=q(Λ−1)μα′Fα′β′Λβ′δvδ{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }p^{\mu }}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=q(\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }F^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\delta }v^{\delta }}


, Notice that on the right-hand side, (Λ−1)μα′Fα′β′Λβ′δ{\displaystyle (\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }F^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\delta }} describes the Faraday tensor in the coordinate frame Fμλ,{\displaystyle F^{\mu }{}_{\lambda },} so that dpμdτ=qFμλvλ{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }p^{\mu }}{{\mathrm {d} }\tau }}=qF^{\mu }{}_{\lambda }v^{\lambda }} (where we originally started).

Therefore, (Λ−1)μα′Fα′β′Λβ′δ=Fμδ.{\displaystyle (\Lambda ^{-1})^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \prime }F^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }\Lambda ^{\beta \prime }{}_{\delta }=F^{\mu }{}_{\delta }.} However, this tells us how to boost from the moving frame to the coordinate frame. To perform the inverse operation, simply switch the Lorentz tensors by left-multiplying by Λ{\displaystyle \Lambda } and right-multiplying by Λ−1.{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{-1}.} The below equation gives us the relation that we want.


Fα′β′=Λα′αFαβ(Λ−1)ββ′{\displaystyle F^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\beta \prime }=\Lambda ^{\alpha \prime }{}_{\alpha }F^{\alpha }{}_{\beta }(\Lambda ^{-1})^{\beta }{}_{\beta \prime }}

Those familiar with linear algebra will recognize this expression to be similar in form to a change of basis.


, Below, we boost in the +x{\displaystyle +x} direction. Remember that in the process of evaluating, all the diagonal elements of the tensor must be 0.


(0Excγ(Eyc−βBz)γ(Ezc+βBy)Exc0γ(−βEyc+Bz)γ(−βEzc−By)γ(Eyc−βBz)γ(βEyc−Bz)0Bxγ(Ezc+βBy)γ(βEzc+By)−Bx0){\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0&{\frac {E_{x}}{c}}&\gamma ({\frac {E_{y}}{c}}-\beta B_{z})&\gamma ({\frac {E_{z}}{c}}+\beta B_{y})\\{\frac {E_{x}}{c}}&0&\gamma (-\beta {\frac {E_{y}}{c}}+B_{z})&\gamma (-\beta {\frac {E_{z}}{c}}-B_{y})\\\gamma ({\frac {E_{y}}{c}}-\beta B_{z})&\gamma (\beta {\frac {E_{y}}{c}}-B_{z})&0&B_{x}\\\gamma ({\frac {E_{z}}{c}}+\beta B_{y})&\gamma (\beta {\frac {E_{z}}{c}}+B_{y})&-B_{x}&0\end{pmatrix}}}


, There are two things of note here. First, from the above tensor, we see that the components of both fields parallel to the direction of motion remain unchanged. Second, and more importantly, the transformations for components perpendicular to the direction of motion show that a field that is zero in one reference frame may not be in another. In general, this will be the case (especially with electromagnetic waves, which cannot exist without mutual induction), so special relativity tells us that these two fields are really just two aspects of the same electromagnetic field. 


Electric fields (note that we have multiplied by c{\displaystyle c} to both sides)

Ey′=γ(Ey−βcBz){\displaystyle E_{y}^{\prime }=\gamma (E_{y}-\beta cB_{z})}

Magnetic fields

We can obtain the total energy by integrating over the entire volume. The expression below is the sum of the work required to assemble a static charge distribution against their Coulombic repulsion, and the work required to generate currents against the back emf. 


Uem=∫V(ue+um)dV=∫V(12ϵ0E2+12μ0B2)dV{\displaystyle U_{em}=\int _{V}(u_{e}+u_{m}){\mathrm {d} }V=\int _{V}\left({\frac {1}{2}}\epsilon _{0}E^{2}+{\frac {1}{2\mu _{0}}}B^{2}\right){\mathrm {d} }V}



While this may describe energy in the field, the energy is not located at any particular location. Rather, it is distributed throughout the volume being integrated over.

Keep in mind that uppercase U{\displaystyle U} is used for energy, while lowercase u{\displaystyle u} denotes energy density. This difference will be seen when converting Poynting's theorem into differential form in step 10.
;
, We will assume a charge and current setup that generates fields E{\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }} and B{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }} at time t.{\displaystyle t.} However, since we are dealing with electrodynamics, our charge will move a distance dl,{\displaystyle {\mathrm {d} }{\mathbf {l} },} representing an arbitrary infinitesimal direction. Therefore, the electromagnetic force will do work on the charge, though keep in mind that magnetic forces do no work.

, We know that q=ρV{\displaystyle q=\rho V} and J=ρv,{\displaystyle {\mathbf {J} }=\rho {\mathbf {v} },} so we can rewrite the right side as below.


dWdt=∫V(E⋅J)dV{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }W}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=\int _{V}({\mathbf {E} }\cdot {\mathbf {J} }){\mathrm {d} }V}


, We can get rid of J{\displaystyle {\mathbf {J} }} by invoking the Ampere-Maxwell law.

, This apparent complication is solved when we invoke Faraday’s law ∇×E=−∂B∂t.{\displaystyle \nabla \times {\mathbf {E} }=-{\frac {\partial {\mathbf {B} }}{\partial t}}.}


∇⋅(E×B)=B⋅(∇×E)−E⋅(∇×B){\displaystyle \nabla \cdot ({\mathbf {E} }\times {\mathbf {B} })={\mathbf {B} }\cdot (\nabla \times {\mathbf {E} })-{\mathbf {E} }\cdot (\nabla \times {\mathbf {B} })}


E⋅(∇×B)=−B⋅∂B∂t−∇⋅(E×B){\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }\cdot (\nabla \times {\mathbf {B} })=-{\mathbf {B} }\cdot {\frac {\partial {\mathbf {B} }}{\partial t}}-\nabla \cdot ({\mathbf {E} }\times {\mathbf {B} })}


, The extra ½ factor stems from the recognition of the product rule. Confirm this by taking the derivative of B⋅B.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }\cdot {\mathbf {B} }.}


B⋅∂B∂t=∂∂t(12B2){\displaystyle {\mathbf {B} }\cdot {\frac {\partial {\mathbf {B} }}{\partial t}}={\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left({\frac {1}{2}}B^{2}\right)}


E⋅∂E∂t=∂∂t(12E2){\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }\cdot {\frac {\partial {\mathbf {E} }}{\partial t}}={\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left({\frac {1}{2}}E^{2}\right)}


, Rewrite the equation in terms of power by integrating the right side over volume V.{\displaystyle V.} In the second line of the second bullet point, we invoke the divergence theorem to convert the second integral into a surface integral, and we recall the expression for the total energy from step 1.


E⋅J=−∂∂t(12ϵ0E2+12μ0B2)−1μ0∇⋅(E×B){\displaystyle {\mathbf {E} }\cdot {\mathbf {J} }=-{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left({\frac {1}{2}}\epsilon _{0}E^{2}+{\frac {1}{2\mu _{0}}}B^{2}\right)-{\frac {1}{\mu _{0}}}\nabla \cdot ({\mathbf {E} }\times {\mathbf {B} })}

, The above equation is obviously a bit complicated, so to simplify things a bit, we introduce the Poynting vector S.{\displaystyle {\mathbf {S} }.} This vector describes the energy per unit time, per unit area, transported by the field - in other words, it is the energy flux density. A simple example of how it works is that it points in the same direction as the direction of propagation of an electromagnetic wave. 


S=E×Bμ0{\displaystyle {\mathbf {S} }={\frac {{\mathbf {E} }\times {\mathbf {B} }}{\mu _{0}}}}


, The below equation is Poynting's theorem in integral form. It states that the work done on the charge distribution by the electromagnetic field (the left side) is equal to the decrease in energy stored in the field (first term on the right), minus the energy that flowed out through the surface that bounds volume V{\displaystyle V} (second term on the right).


dWdt=−dUemdt−∮SS⋅n^dA{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }W}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=-{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }U_{em}}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}-\oint _{S}{\mathbf {S} }\cdot {\hat {\mathbf {n} }}{\mathrm {d} }A}


, While this will not be as practical for calculations, it allows us to see conservation of energy more explicitly.

First, we recognize that work done on the charges will increase their mechanical energy, so we define mechanical energy density umech{\displaystyle u_{mech}} in dWdt=ddt∫VumechdV.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }W}{{\mathrm {d} }t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\int _{V}u_{mech}{\mathrm {d} }V.}

Now, we recall the energy density of the fields below.


uem=12ϵ0E2+12μ0B2{\displaystyle u_{em}={\frac {1}{2}}\epsilon _{0}E^{2}+{\frac {1}{2\mu _{0}}}B^{2}}



Substitute these into Poynting's theorem, and invoke the divergence theorem to convert the surface integral into a volume integral.


ddt∫V(umech+uem)dV=−∫V(∇⋅S)dV{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\int _{V}(u_{mech}+u_{em}){\mathrm {d} }V=-\int _{V}(\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {S} }){\text{d}}V}



Now, we can put the integrands under a single integral and obtain Poynting's theorem in differential form.


∂∂t(umech+uem)=−∇⋅S{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(u_{mech}+u_{em})=-\nabla \cdot {\mathbf {S} }}



Note that Poynting's theorem in this form is similar to the expression for conservation of charge.

Decide if your circuit is wired in series or parallel.,
Find the voltage of the circuit.,
Solve for the current of the circuit.,
Calculate the resistance of the circuit.,
Understand the “Table Method.” The table method is a great way to calculate the resistance of different resistors in the same circuit.",How to Analyze Resistive Circuits Using Ohm's Law1," When a circuit is wired in series, there is only one path for current to flow. When a circuit is wired in parallel, there are multiple paths that the current can move through simultaneously. These two types of circuits behave very differently, and it is important to recognize one from the other., Voltage can be calculated for resistive circuits by using Ohm’s Law. In order to do this calculation, you will need to know values for the current and resistance of the circuit. By multiplying these values together, you will find the voltage of the circuit.Take, as an example, a circuit that has a current of 3 Amperes (I = 3A) and a resistance of 2 Ohms (R = 2 ohms). The voltage (V) for this circuit would be found by using the following equation:


V=I×R{\displaystyle V=I\times R}


V=3 A×2 ohms{\displaystyle V=3{\rm {{\ A}\times 2{\rm {\ ohms}}}}}


V=6 V{\displaystyle V=6{\rm {\ V}}}




, Using Ohm’s Law, current can be calculated for a resistive circuit. To do this calculation, you will need to know the values for the resistance and voltage of the circuit. Divide the voltage by the resistance to obtain the current of the circuit.Take, as an example, a circuit that has a voltage of 6 volts (V = 6V) and a resistance of 2 Ohms (R = 2ohms). The current (I) for this circuit would be found by using the following equation:


V=I×R{\displaystyle V=I\times R}


V/I=R{\displaystyle V/I=R}


1/I=R/V{\displaystyle 1/I=R/V}


I=V/R{\displaystyle I=V/R}


I=(6 V)/(2 ohms){\displaystyle I=(6{\rm {{\ V})/(2{\rm {{\ ohms})}}}}}


I=3 A{\displaystyle I=3{\rm {\ A}}}




, Ohm’s Law will allow you to find the resistance of a resistive circuit. You must know the values of voltage and current of the circuit to calculate the resistance. When these values are known, you can find the resistance by dividing the voltage of the circuit by the current.Take, as an example, a circuit that has a voltage of 6 volts (V = 6V) and a resistance of 2 Ohms (R = 2ohms). The current (I) for this circuit would be found by using the following equation:


V=I×R{\displaystyle V=I\times R}


V/R=I{\displaystyle V/R=I}


1/R=I/V{\displaystyle 1/R=I/V}


R=V/I{\displaystyle R=V/I}


R=(6 V)/(3 A){\displaystyle R=(6{\rm {{\ V})/(3{\rm {{\ A})}}}}}


R=2 ohms{\displaystyle R=2{\rm {\ ohms}}}




, Make a table with three rows and a column for each resistor in the circuit, plus one for the overall circuit. For example, if you have a circuit with three resistors, you would make a table that is three rows by four columns. The first row will correspond to voltage across each resistor, the second will correspond to current through each resistor, and the third will correspond to the resistance of each resistor.For circuits in parallel: 

The voltage across all resistors is the same and is equal to the voltage of the total circuit. This means all values in Row 1 will be the same.

The current of the total circuit is the sum of the current through all resistors. This means that the final column in Row 2 will be equal to the sum of all other columns in Row 2.

The total resistance diminishes as resistors are added. For a circuit with “n” resistors, the last column in Row 3 will be found with the equation: 1 / ((1/R1) + (1/R2) … + (1/Rn-1) + (1/Rn)).

The Electric Flux through a surface A is equal to the dot product of the electric field and area vectors E and A.The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their respective magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them.;
,

In most cases of this type, it is already given in the problem.

Note that the surface area vector is always perpendicular and outward from the surface.

,


The cosine of the angle between the two vectors multiplied by the electric field vector is equal to the component of electric field that is perpendicular to the surface area vector.

Electric flux is the product of Newtons per Coulomb (E) and meters squared.
Proper units for electric flux are Newtons meters squared per coulomb.

Know that F (force) = m (mass) * a (acceleration).,
Convert weight into mass by following this example.Let's illustrate how to convert weight into mass by using an example.,
Convert mass into weight.",How to Measure Mass1," This simple equation is what you'll use to convert weight into mass (or mass into weight, if you want to). Don't be worried about what the letters mean — we'll tell you:


Force is the same thing as weight. Use Newtons (N) as weight.
Mass is what you're solving for, so it may not be defined to begin with. After solving the equation, your mass will be calculated as kilograms (kg).
Acceleration is the same thing as gravity. Gravity is on earth is a constant equaling 9.78 m/s2. If you're measuring gravity on other planets, this constant will be different.;
, Say you're on earth and you're trying to figure out how much mass your 50 kg soapbox racer has.


List your equation. F = m * a.
Fill in your variables and constants. We know that force is the same thing as weight, which is 50 N. We also know that the effect of gravity on earth is always 9.78 m/s2. Plug in both numbers and our equation looks like this: 50 N = m * 9.78 m/s2

Rearrange in order to solve. We can't solve the equation like this. We need to divide 50 kg by 9.78 m/s2 in order to isolate m.
50 N / 9.78 m/s2 = 5.11 kg. A soapbox racer that weighs 50 Newtons on Earth has a mass of about 5 kg, wherever you race it in the universe!

, Learn how to convert mass back into weight using this example. Let's say that you pick up a moon rock on the surface of the Moon (where else?). It has a mass of 1.25 kg. You want to know how much it will weigh when you bring it back to earth.


List your equation. F = m * a.
Fill in your variables and constants. We have mass and we have the gravitational constant. We know that F = 1.25 kg * 9.78 m/s2.
Solve the equation. Because the variable we're looking for is already isolated on one side of the equation, we don't have to do any moving around in order to solve the equation. We simply multiply 1.25 kg by 9.78 m/s2, giving us 12.23 Newtons.

Think of voltage as being similar to pressure.,
Know that current is the flow of charge.,
Consider how the material resists current.",How to Analyze Resistive Circuits Using Ohm's Law2," Voltage is defined as the difference in charge between one point and another point and is measured in volts, designated “V.” It is often conceptualized by picturing a full tank of water and an empty tank connected by a hose. The full tank of water is at a high pressure, and the empty tank at a low pressure. The difference in water pressure is a similar concept to the difference in charge between the two terminals of a circuit., When there is a difference in charge between two points, you will have current. This is is the movement of charge from a point of high charge to a point of low charge and is measured in amperes, shown as “A.” A good analogy is that of a full tank of water attached to an empty tank by a hose. Water will flow from the full tank (high pressure) to the empty tank (low pressure), just as current moves from a point of high charge (source) to a point of low charge (ground)., Resistance is a property inherent of the material through which current is flowing. It is different for different materials, and is measured in Ohms, designated “ohms”. Resistance describes the degree to which the material inhibits current moving through it. High resistance will impede current more, and low resistance will impede the current less."
"
Identify your power source.,
Understand the meaning of nodes.,
Define a resistor.,
Know that no other components are present.",How to Analyze Resistive Circuits Using Ohm's Law3," There must be a difference in charge before current will flow through a circuit. The point of highest charge in a power source is designated as the positive side, and the point of lowest charge is usually called the negative side. A circuit is run between the positive and negative side. Electricity is harnessed when other elements are put in the circuit to convert the flowing current into useful work., Nodes are simply the junctions between different parts of a circuit. In a typical circuit, the wires between the different parts of the circuit serve as the nodes. Things wired in parallel will have more nodes than things wired in series.
, A resistor is an electronic component that limits current. Resistors cannot generate power, but they do consume it. They also have a fixed value of resistance that they provide, and that value does not change.
, In an ideal resistive circuit, the only components present are the source, the resistor(s), and the nodes (or wires). No other components, capacitors for example, are present in an ideal resistive circuit. In these ideal circuits, current flows according to the principles in Ohm’s Law: V=I×R{\displaystyle V=I\times R}."

Net electric flux through a closed surface with enclosed charge q is the integral of the dot product between the electric field and the instantaneous surface area vector.
The integral of the instantaneous surface area is simply the surface area vector.
The electric field at a distance outside a Gaussian surface will be constant at that specific distance.

,


Choose one that best fits its dimensions.
A solid sphere or spherical shell of charge Q would require the use of a sphere, while a line or rod of charge would require a cylinder.
A solid sphere or hollow spherical shell with uniform charge distribution can be treated as if all charge were concentrated at the center (a point charge), therefore the radius of your Gaussian surface would be the radius of your sphere plus the distance away from the sphere's surface.

Measure gravitational mass.,
Measure inertial mass.",How to Measure Mass2," You can measure mass using a balance. A balance is different from a scale because it uses a known mass to measure the unknown mass where as a scale actually measures weight.


Finding mass with a triple-beam balance or a double-pan balance is a form of measuring gravitational mass. This is a static measurement, which means it is only accurate when the object being measured is at rest.
A balance can measure weight and mass. Because the measurement of the balance weights change by the same factor as the object being measured, a balance is able to accurately provide the mass of an object regardless of the specific gravity of the environment.

, Inertial mass is a dynamic measuring method, meaning that it can only be accomplished while the object being measured is in motion. The inertia of the object is used to quantify the amount of matter.


An inertial balance is used to measure inertial mass.
Secure the inertial balance to a table.
Calibrate the inertial balance by putting the container in motion counting the number of vibrations in a specified time period, for example 30 seconds.
Place an item of known mass in the container and repeat the experiment.
Continue using several items of known mass to finish calibrating the scale.

Multiply the object's mass and the acceleration of gravity.,
Write down your answer.",How to Find Normal Force1," Normal force refers to the amount of force use to counteract the force of gravity.


Imagine a block sitting on a table. The force of gravity pulls the block toward the Earth, but clearly, there is some force at work preventing the block from crashing through the table and finishing its descent toward the ground. The force responsible for stopping the block in spite of gravitational force is the normal force.;
, When calculating an object's normal force when that object is at rest on a flat surface, use the formula: N = m * gIn this equation, N refers to the normal force, m refers to the object's mass, and g refers to the acceleration of gravity.
For an object sitting on a flat surface, with no outside forces at work, the normal force is equal to the object's weight. In order to keep the object still, the normal force must be equal to the force of gravity at work on the object. The force of gravity at work on the object is that object's weight, or its mass multiplied by the acceleration of gravity.

Example: Find the normal force of a block with a mass of 4.2 kg.

, Doing so will give you the weight of the object, which ultimately equals the normal force of the object as it sits at rest.

Example: Find the normal force of a block with a mass of 4.2 kg, sitting on a ramp with an incline of 45 degrees.

, The cosign of an angle equals the sine of the complementary angle, or the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the incline.This value is often determined by a calculator, since the cosine of any angle is constant to that angle, but you can compute it manually, as well.

Know the basic equation for kinetic friction.,
Rearrange the equation to isolate the normal force.,
Divide the kinetic friction by the coefficient of friction.,
Record your answer.",How to Find Normal Force5," Kinetic friction, or the friction of an object in motion, is equal to the coefficient of friction multiplied by the normal force of an object. In equation format, that looks like: f = μ * N


In this equation, f stands for friction, μ refers to the coefficient of friction, and N refers to the normal force of the object.
A ""coefficient of friction"" is the ratio between frictional resistance to normal force, which is responsible for pressing the two opposing surfaces together.

, If you have a value for the kinetic friction of an object, as well as that object's coefficient of friction, you can calculate the normal force by using the formula: N = f / μ


Both sides of the original equation were divided by μ, thereby isolating normal force on one side while accounting for the coefficient of friction and kinetic friction on the opposite side.

Example: Find the normal force of a block when the coefficient of friction is 0.4 and the amount of kinetic friction itself is 40 N.

, This is essentially all you need to do to find the value of the normal force.



Example: N = f / μ = 40 / 0.4 = 100

, If desired, you can check your answer by plugging it back into the original equation for kinetic friction. Otherwise, you have completed the problem.

Calculate the magnitude of the net force vector.",How to Find Net Force," A free body diagram is a quick sketch of an object that illustrates all of the forces acting on it and the direction these forces are acting. Read through the problem and draw a simple sketch of the object in question and the arrows representing every force acting on that object.For example: Calculate the net force of an object weighing 20 N sitting on a table being pushed towards the right with 5 N of force, but staying still because of a friction force of 5 N.;
, The standard is to set arrows pointing upward or to the right as positive and arrows pointing downward or to the left as negative. Remember, you can have multiple forces working in the same direction. Forces that oppose each other will always have opposite signs (one positive, one negative).If you are working with multiple force diagrams, make sure you keep the directions consistent throughout.
Label the magnitude of each force with a “+” or “-“ sign based on the direction of the arrow you’ve drawn on the force diagram.
For example: The force of gravity is a downward force making it negative. The normal force is upward making it positive. The push force is to the right making it positive, while the friction force acts to oppose this force towards the left (negative).

, Be sure to label all of the forces that are acting on the object. When an object is resting on a surface there is a downward force of gravity (Fg) and an equal force in the opposite direction called the normal force (Fn). In addition to these two forces, label the rest of the forces stated in the problem. Write the magnitude of each force in Newtons next to the given label.A standard way to label forces is with a capital F and a subscript of first letter of the force. For example, if there is a force due to friction, label it Ff.
Force due to gravity: Fg = -20 N
Normal force: Fn = +20 N
Friction force: Ff = -5 N
Push force: Fp = +5 N

, Now that you have labelled all forces with both a direction and magnitude, you just need to add all of them together. Write an equation for net force (Fnet) where Fnet is equal to the sum of all the forces acting on the object.For example: Fnet = Fg + Fn + Ff + Fp = -20 + 20 -5 + 5 = 0 N. Because the net force is 0 N, the object is stationary.

, When you have a diagonal force acting at an angle on the object, you need to find the horizontal (Fx) and vertical (Fy) components of the force to find its magnitude. You'll have to use trigonometry and the directional angle (usually θ ""theta""). The directional angle θ is always measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis.Draw the force diagram including the angle of the diagonal force.
Sketch each arrow in the proper direction the force is acting and label it with the proper magnitude.
For example: Sketch the diagram for a 10 N object experiencing a 25 N force up and to the right at an angle of 45°. There is also a friction force to the left of 10 N.
Forces include: Fg = -10 N, Fn = + 10 N, Fp = 25 N, Ff = -10 N.

, Using the diagonal force (F) as the hypotenuse of a right-triangle and Fx and Fy as the legs of that triangle, you can calculate each in turn.Remember, CAH: cosine(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse. Fx = cos θ * F = cos(45°) * 25 = 17.68 N.
Remember, SOH: sine(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse. Fy = sin θ * F = sin(45°) * 25 = 17.68 N.
Note that there may be multiple diagonal forces acting on an object simultaneously, so you'll have to find Fx and Fy of each force in the problem. Then sum the Fx values to obtain the total force in the horizontal direction and sum the Fy values for the total force in the vertical direction.

, Now that you have calculated the individual horizontal and vertical components of the diagonal force, you can sketch a new force diagram representing these forces. Erase the diagonal force and instead, draw the arrows for the individual horizontal and vertical magnitudes.


For example, instead of one diagonal force, the diagram will now have one vertical force pointing up with a magnitude of 17.68 N and one horizontal force pointing to the right with a magnitude of 17.68 N.

, Once you have drawn a new force diagram, calculate the net force (Fnet) by adding all of the horizontal forces together and all of the vertical forces together. Remember to keep all of the directions of the vectors consistent throughout the problem.


For example: Horizontal vectors are all forces along the x axis: Fnetx = 17.68 – 10 = 7.68 N.
Vertical vectors are all forces along the y axis: Fnety = 17.68 + 10 - 10 = 17.68 N.

, At this stage, you have two forces: one in the x-direction and one in the y-direction. The magnitude of the force vector is the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by these two component vectors. Simply use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the hypotenuse: Fnet = √ (Fnetx2 + Fnety2).For example: Fnetx = 7.68 N and Fnety = 17.68 N
Plug into equation: Fnet = √ (Fnetx2 + Fnety2) = √ (7.682 + 17.682)
Solve: Fnet = √ (7.682 + 17.682) = √(58.98 + 35.36) = √94.34 = 9.71 N.
The magnitude of force is 9.71 N in a diagonal up and to the right.

Expand newtons to check your units.",How to Calculate Weight from Mass," Weight is defined as the force of gravity on an object. Scientists put that sentence into an equation by writing w = m x g, orw = mg.









Since weight is a force, scientists also write the equation as F = mg.

F = symbol for weight, measured in Newtons, N.

m = symbol for mass, measured in kilograms, or kg.

g = symbol for gravitational acceleration, expressed as m/s2, or meters per second squared.

If you're using meters, the gravitational acceleration at the earth's surface is 9.8 m/s2. This is the standard international unit, and the one you should probably be using.
If you're using feet because you have to, the gravitation acceleration is 32.2 f/s2. This is the same unit, it's just rearranged to reflect feet instead of meters.



, Because we're trying to get weight from mass, we know we already have mass. Mass is the fundamental amount of matter an object has, and is expressed in kilograms.








, In other words, figure out g. On the surface of the earth, g is 9.8 m/s2. Elsewhere in the universe, the acceleration of gravity changes. Your teacher should tell you, or the problem should indicate, where the gravity is acting from so that you know.









The gravitational acceleration on the moon is different from the gravitational acceleration on the earth. Acceleration due to gravity on the moon is about 1.622 m/s2, or about 1/6 of the acceleration that it is here on earth. That's why you weigh 1/6 of your earth-weight on the moon.
The gravitational acceleration on the sun is different from the gravitational acceleration on the earth and moon. Acceleration due to gravity on the sun is about 274.0 m/s2, or about 28 times the acceleration that it is here on earth. That's why you would weigh 28 times your earth-weight on the sun (if you could survive!).

, Now that you've got m and g, you'll be able to plug those values into the equation F = mg and be ready to go. You should get a number described in terms of Newtons, or N.








, Here's the question: ""An object has a mass of 100 kilograms. What is its weight on the surface of the earth?""









We have both m and g. m equals 100 kg, and g equals 9.8 m/s2, because we're looking for the weight of the object on the surface of the earth.
We set up our equation next: F = 100 kg x 9.8 m/s2.
This gives us the final answer. On the surface of the earth, an object with a mass of 100 kg will weigh approximately 980 Newtons. F = 980 N.

, Here's the question: ""An object has a mass of 40 kilograms. What is its weight on the surface of the moon?""









We have both m and g. m equals 40 kg, and g equals 1.6 m/s2, because we're looking for the weight of the object on the surface of the moon this time.
We set up our equation next: F = 40 kg x 1.6 m/s2.
This gives us the final answer. On the surface of the moon, an object with a mass of 40 kg will weigh approximately 64 Newtons. F = 64 N.

, Here's the question: ""An object weighs 549 Newtons on the surface of the earth. What is its mass?""









For this problem, we have to work backwards. We already have F and we have g. We just need m.
Let's set up our equation: 549 = m x 9.8 m/s2.
Instead of multiplying, we divide. Specifically, we divide F by g. An object weighing 549 Newtons on the surface of the earth will have a mass of about 56 kilograms. m = 56 kg.

, The number one mistake people make on these problems is confusing mass and weight. Remember that mass is the amount of ""stuff"" in an object, which stays the same no matter where you move it. Weight measures the force of gravity on that ""stuff,"" which changes if you move through space. Here's are a couple mnemonic to keep your units distinct:

Mass is in units of grams or kilograms. Both mass and gram contain an m. Weight is in units of newtons. Both weight and newton contain a w.
You only have weight while you're ""wait""ing on Earth, but even ""mass""tronauts have mass.

, Most physics problems use newtons (N) for weight, meters per second squared (m/s2) for gravitational force, and kilograms (kg) for mass. If you use a different unit for one of these values, you cannot use the same formula. Convert to scientific units before plugging them into the standard equation. These conversions may help you out if you're used to the imperial / U.S. system:

1 pound-force = ~4.448 newtons
1 foot = ~0.3048 meters

, If you're working on a complex problem, keep track of the units as you work through your solution. Remember that 1 newton is equivalent to 1 (kg*m)/s2. If necessary, make that substitution to help you cancel out units.

Example problem: Jeffrey weighs 880 newtons on Earth. What is his mass?
mass = (880 newtons)/(9.8 m/s2)
mass = 90 newtons/(m/s2)
mass = (90 kg*m/s2)/(m/s2)
Cancel units: mass = 90 kg
Kg is the expected unit for mass, so you arranged the problem correctly.

Define speed.,
Understand instantaneous speed.,
Understand average speed.,
Write down the formula.,
Calculate the total distance traveled.,
Calculate the total amount of time traveled.,
Divide the total distance by the total time traveled.,
Convert to miles per hour, if necessary.",How to Find Speed," The speed of an object is the total distance traveled divided by the time it took to travel that distance.Unlike a vector which is defined by having both a magnitude and direction, such as velocity, speed only has a magnitude.Magnitude is the size or amount of the term. Another way to think about magnitude is how far away the term is from zero.For example, if a car is moving at 15 miles per hour, it is 15 away from zero and therefore has a magnitude of 15.
The formula to calculate speed is speed = total distance/total time
;
, Instantaneous speed is the rate at which an object is moving in a given moment. Speed is expressed as the ratio of distance to time. When traveling in a car, your instantaneous speed is what the speedometer reads at any point in time. It is the rate you are traveling at that moment.


Common units for speed include miles per hour (mph) and kilometers per hour (kph).

, Average speed is the total distance traveled for a given amount of time.The formula for both average and instantaneous speed is the same, but average speed takes into account the whole trip, while instantaneous speed is only for a specific moment of time.The example used in the following steps will calculate average speed.

, The first step to solving any problem is writing down the formula needed to solve it. Start by writing the formula and determining the variables needed to solve it.


speed = total distance/total time
To solve, identify the total distance and the total time associated with the problem.

, Speed problems will usually give you the amount of distance someone travels over a period of time. Identify all the distances traveled in the problem. It can be helpful to circle the distances so you don’t miss one. Add these distances together for total distance traveled.


If you’re calculating the average speed of a road trip, use an online tool to provide route information and mileage.
Example: Keri travels 7 miles (11 km) in 10 minutes, takes a break, and then makes the return trip in 20 minutes. What was her average speed?
The total distance traveled in this problem is 7 miles (11 km) + 7 miles (11 km) = 14 miles (23 km).

, The problem will also tell you the various times it took to travel each distance. Identify all of the times and add them together to find the total time it took to travel all of the distances.


For our example, the first trip took 10 minutes and the second trip took 20 minutes, so 10 + 20 = 30 minutes total travel time.

, In order to finish the calculation you will take the total distance traveled and divide it by the amount of time it took to travel that distance.


Example: 14 miles/30 minutes = 0.46 miles/minute or 28 miles/hour.
Make sure to include the appropriate units with your answer.

, Sometimes you will be asked to convert your answer from the given units to miles per hour. To convert from miles per minute to miles per hour simply multiply by the conversion factor 60 min/1 hr. To convert from kilometers per hour to miles per hour, multiply by the conversion factor 0.62 miles/1 kilometer.


For example: (0.46 miles/min) * (60 min/1hr) = 28 miles/hr
For example: (10 km/1hr) * (0.62 miles/1 km) = 6.2 miles/hr

Identify the forces exerted on the body and their corresponding moment arms.,
Use the equation for torque, τ = Fr, to simply replace the variables with your given or obtained data.,
Make use of sign conventions (positive or negative) to show torque direction.",How to Calculate Torque1," If the force is not perpendicular to the moment arm being considered (i.e. it's mounted at an angle) you may need to find its components using trigonometric functions, such as sine or cosine.


The force component you consider will depend on the equivalent of the perpendicular force.
Imagine a horizontal bar, and you need to apply a force of 10N at an angle of 30° above the horizontal for to rotate it about its center.
Since you need to use a force that is perpendicular to the moment arm, you need a vertical force to rotate the bar.
Therefore, you need to consider the y-component, or use F = 10sin30° N.;
,


A simple example is: Imagine a 30 kg child sitting on one side of a seesaw. The length of one side of the seesaw is 1.5 m.
Since the rotation axis of the seesaw is at the center, you do not need to multiply the length.
You need to determine the force exerted by the child, by using mass and acceleration.
Since the given data is mass, you need to multiply it by the acceleration due to gravity, g, which is equal to 9.81 m/s2. Therefore:
Now, you have all the needed data to use the torque equation:

, When the force rotates the body clockwise, torque is negative. When the force rotates the body counterclockwise, torque is positive.


For multiple applied forces, just sum up all of the torques in the body.
Since each force tends to produce different rotational directions, the use of sign convention is important to keep track of which forces are acting in which directions.
For example, two forces, F1= 10.0 N clockwise and F2 = 9.0 N counterclockwise, are applied to the edge of a wheel with a diameter of 0.050m.
Since the given body is a circle, its fixed axis is the center. You need to divide the diameter and get the radius. The measurement of the radius will serve as the moment arm. Therefore the radius is equal to .025m.
For clarity, we can solve for the individual torques brought about by the forces.
For force 1, the action is clockwise so the torque produced is negative:
For force 2, the action is counterclockwise so the torque produced is positive:
Now we can just sum up the torques to get the net torque:

Understand how the moment of inertia of the body works to begin solving the problem.,
Choose which equation you will use to solve for the moment of inertia.,
Solve for the moment of inertia.,
Solve for the angular acceleration, α.,
Use the equation, τ = Iα, to find torque.",How to Calculate Torque2," Moment of inertia is the resistance of a body to rotational motion. Moment of inertia is dependent on both the mass and how the mass is distributed.


To clearly understand this, imagine two cylinders of the same diameter but different masses.
Imagine that you need to rotate the two cylinders at their centers.
Obviously, the cylinder with a greater mass will be harder to rotate than the other cylinder, since it is “heavier”.
Now, imagine two cylinders with different diameters but the same masses. To still appear cylindrical with the same mass, but at the same time accommodate different diameters, the shapes, or mass distributions, of both cylinders will differ from each other.
The cylinder with a larger diameter will look like a flat, circular plate while the smaller diameter cylinder will look like a solid tissue tube.
The cylinder with a larger diameter will be harder to rotate because you need a larger force to account for the longer moment arm.

, There are several equations available to solve for the moment of inertia.


First is the simple equation: or the summation of the mass and the moment arms of each particle.
This equation is used for points or ideal particles. A point particle is an object that has mass, but does not take up space.
In other words, the only relevant characteristic of the object is its mass; you do not need to know its size, shape or structure.
The concept of a point particle is commonly used in physics to simplify calculations and use ideal and theoretical scenarios.
Now, imagine objects such as a hollow cylinder or a solid uniform sphere. These objects have a clear and definite shape, size, and structure.
Therefore, you cannot regard them as a point particle.
Thankfully, you can use available equations that apply to some of these common objects:

, To begin finding torque, you need to solve for the moment of inertia. Use the following example problem to follow along:


Two small “weights” of mass 5.0 kg and 7.0 kg are mounted 4.0 m apart on a light rod (whose mass can be neglected). The axis of rotation is at the center of the rod. The rod is rotated from rest to an angular velocity of 30.0 rad/s in 3.00s. Calculate the torque produced.
Since the axis of rotation is at the center, the moment arm of both the weights is equal to half the length of the rod, which is 2.0 m.
Since there was no specified shape, size, and structure for the “weights”, we can assume that the weights are ideal particles.
The moment of inertia can be computed as:

, The formula, α= at/r or, can be used to solve for angular acceleration.


The first formula, α= at/r, can be used if the tangential acceleration and the radius are given.
The tangential acceleration is the acceleration that is tangent to the path of motion.
Imagine an object traveling along a curved path. The tangential acceleration is just its linear acceleration at any point along the path.
For the second formula, the easiest way to illustrate this is to relate it to kinematics: displacement, linear velocity, and linear linear acceleration.
Displacement is the distance traveled by an object (SI unit:meters, m); linear velocity is the rate of change of displacement over time (SI unit: m/s); linear acceleration is the rate of change of linear velocity over time (SI unit: m/s2).
Now, consider the counterparts in rotational motion: angular displacement, θ, the angle of the rotation of a certain point or line (SI unit: rad); the angular velocity, ω, time rate change of angular displacement (SI unit: rad/s); and the angular acceleration, α, the change in angular velocity per unit time (SI unit: rad/s2).
Going back to our example, you were given data for angular momentum and time. Since it started from rest, the initial angular velocity is 0. We can use the equation,, to solve:

, Simply replace the variables with the answers obtained from the previous steps.


You may notice that the unit ""rad"" does not fit in our units, because it is considered a dimensionless quantity.
This means you can disregard it and continue with your computation.
For the sake of dimensional analysis, we can express angular acceleration in the units s-2.

Find average velocity when acceleration is constant.,
Set up an equation with position and time instead.,
Find the distance between the start and end points.,
Calculate the change in time.,
Divide the total displacement by the total time.,
Solve problems in two dimensions.",How to Calculate Velocity1," If an object is accelerating at a constant rate, the formula for average velocity is simple: vav=vi+vf2{\displaystyle v_{av}={\frac {v_{i}+v_{f}}{2}}}. In this equation vi{\displaystyle v_{i}} is the initial velocity, and vf{\displaystyle v_{f}} is the final velocity. Remember, you can only use this equation if there is no change in acceleration.

As a quick example, let's say a train accelerates at a constant rate from 30 m/s to 80 m/s. The average velocity of the train during this time is 30+802=55m/s{\displaystyle {\frac {30+80}{2}}=55m/s}.
;
, You can also find the velocity from the object's change in position and time. This works for any problem. Note that, unless the object is moving at a constant velocity, your answer will be the average velocity during the movement, not the specific velocity at a certain time.

The formula for this problem is vav=xf−xitf−ti{\displaystyle v_{av}={\frac {x_{f}-x_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}}}, or ""final position - initial position divided by final time - initial time."" You can also write this as  vav{\displaystyle v_{av}} = Δx / Δt, or ""change in position over change in time.""


, When measuring velocity, the only positions that matter are where the object started, and where the object ended up. This, along with which direction the object traveled, tells you the displacement, or change in position.The path the object took between these two points does not matter.


Example 1: A car traveling due east starts at position x = 5 meters. After 8 seconds, the car is at position x = 41 meters. What was the car's displacement?

The car was displaced by (41m - 5m) = 36 meters east.




Example 2: A diver leaps 1 meter straight up off a diving board, then falls downward for 5 meters before hitting the water. What is the diver's displacement?

The driver ended up 4 meters below the starting point, so her displacement is 4 meters downward, or -4 meters. (0 + 1 - 5 = -4). Even though the diver traveled six meters (one up, then five down), what matters is that the end point is four meters below the start point.




, How long did the object take to reach the end point? Many problems will tell you this directly. If it does not, subtract the start time from the end time to find out.


Example 1 (cont.): The problem tells us that the car took 8 seconds to go from the start point to the end point, so this is the change in time.


Example 2 (cont.): If the diver jumped at t = 7 seconds and hits the water at t = 8 seconds, the change in time = 8s - 7s = 1 second.


, In order to find the velocity of the moving object, you will need to divide the change in position by the change in time. Specify the direction moved, and you have the average velocity.


Example 1 (cont.): The car changed its position by 36 meters over 8 seconds. vav=36m8s={\displaystyle v_{av}={\frac {36m}{8s}}=} 4.5 m/s east.


Example 2 (cont): The diver changed her position by -4 meters over 1 second. vav=−4m1s={\displaystyle v_{av}={\frac {-4m}{1s}}=} -4 m/s. (In one dimension, negative numbers are usually used to mean ""down"" or ""left."" You could say ""4 m/s downward"" instead.)


, Not all word problems involve movement back along one line. If the object turns at some point, you may need to draw a diagram and solve a geometry problem to find the distance.


Example 3: A man jogs for 3 meters east, then make a 90º turn and travels 4 meters north. What is his displacement?

Draw a diagram and connect the start point and end point with a straight line. This is the hypotenuse of a triangle, so solve for its length of this line using properties of right triangles. In this case, the displacement is 5 meters northeast.

At some point, your math teacher may require you to find the exact direction traveled (the angle above the horizontal). You can do this by using geometry or by adding vectors."
"
Understand the velocity formula for an accelerating object.,
Multiply the acceleration by the change in time.,
Add the initial velocity.,
Specify the direction of movement.,
Solve related problems.",How to Calculate Velocity2," Acceleration is the change in velocity. If the acceleration is constant, the velocity continues to change at the same rate. We can describe this by multiplying acceleration and time, and adding the result to the initial velocity:


vf=vi+at{\displaystyle v_{f}=v_{i}+at}, or ""final velocity = initial velocity + (acceleration * time)""

Initial velocity vi{\displaystyle v_{i}} is sometimes written as v0{\displaystyle v_{0}} (""velocity at time 0"").


, This will tell you how much the velocity increased (or decreased) over this time period.


Example: A ship sailing north at 2 m/s accelerates north at a rate of 10 m/s2. How much did the ship's velocity increase in the next 5 seconds?

a = 10 m/s2

t = 5 s

(a * t) = (10 m/s2 * 5 s) = 50 m/s increase in velocity.




, Now you know the total change in the velocity. Add this to the initial velocity of the object, and you have your answer.


Example (cont): In this example, how fast is the ship traveling after 5 seconds?


vf=vi+at{\displaystyle v_{f}=v_{i}+at}


vi=2m/s{\displaystyle v_{i}=2m/s}


at=50m/s{\displaystyle at=50m/s}


vf=2m/s+50m/s=52m/s{\displaystyle v_{f}=2m/s+50m/s=52m/s}




, Unlike speed, velocity always includes the direction of movement. Make sure to include this in your answer.

In our example, since the ship started going north and did not change direction, its final velocity is 52 m/s north.


, As long as you know the acceleration, and the velocity at any one point in time, you can use this formula to find the velocity at any other time. Here's an example solving for the initial velocity:

""A train accelerates at 7 m/s2 for 4 seconds, and ends up traveling forward at a velocity of 35 m/s. What was its initial velocity?""


vf=vi+at{\displaystyle v_{f}=v_{i}+at}35m/s=vi+(7m/s2)(4s){\displaystyle 35m/s=v_{i}+(7m/s^{2})(4s)}35m/s=vi+28m/s{\displaystyle 35m/s=v_{i}+28m/s}vi=35m/s−28m/s=7m/s{\displaystyle v_{i}=35m/s-28m/s=7m/s}

Learn the formula for circular velocity.,
Multiply the circular radius by 2π.,
Divide this product by the time period.",How to Calculate Velocity3," Circular velocity refers to the velocity that one object must travel in order to maintain its circular orbit around another object, usually a planet or other gravitating mass.The circular velocity of an object is calculated by dividing the circumference of the circular path by the time period over which the object travels.

When written as a formula, the equation is:

v = (2πr) / T



Note that 2πr equals the circumference of the circular path.


r stands for ""radius""


T stands for ""time period""


, The first stage of the problem is calculating the circumference. To do this, multiply the radius by 2π. If you are calculating this by hand, you can use 3.14 as an approximation for π.

Example: Find the circular velocity of an object traveling a circular path with a radius of 8 m over a full time interval of 45 seconds.

r = 8 m

T = 45 s

Circumference = 2πr = ~ (2)(3.14)(8 m) = 50.24 m




, In order to find the circular velocity of the object in question, you need to divide the calculated circumference by the time period over which the object traveled.

Example: v = (2πr) / T = 50.24 m / 45 s = 1.12 m/s

Determine the angle which the bullet is fired, relative to the ground.,
Determine the initial (starting) velocity of the bullet as soon as it leaves the barrel of the gun.,
With a writing utensil and paper, construct an x-y coordinate system with the origin located at the point where the bullet leaves the barrel.

,
Using trigonometry, determine the initial velocity in the x/y-direction.,
Using the equation y= yo + voy – ½ gt2, calculate the time it takes for the bullet to reach the ground.,
Calculate the distance travelled by the bullet.",How to Calculate the Distance Traveled by an Object Using Vector Kinematics," This can be done using a simple mathematical compass.;
, This information can usually be found on the gun’s package or the manufacturer's website. The initial velocity of the projectile varies, depending on the gun model and ammunition type.

,, This can be done using the sine and cosine functions. For example, if the angle of launch is 30o, then the sine of 30o, multiplied by the initial velocity, would be the initial velocity in the y-direction. This can easily be done by using this trigonometric function on a calculator: sin(30) * vo. Then, repeat this step, using the cosine function to determine the initial velocity in the x-direction.

, The definition of each variable is as follows: y=final (y-direction) position, yo=starting (y-direction position), voy=initial velocity in the y-direction (calculated in step 4.), g=force of gravity acting on the projectile (assuming we are on earth, this value should be (-9.80m/s2), and t=the time it takes for the projectile to hit the ground. To make this step simpler, solve for (t) using the following equation: t=((y – yo – voy)/.5g)1/2.

For example, assuming the final y-position was zero (because the bullet will lose momentum and hit the ground), the initial y-position was 1.5m, the initial y-velocity was 20m/s, and the force of gravity (g) was -9.80m/s2, it should've taken 13.6 seconds for the bullet to hit the ground.

, Using the equation x = vxo t, supply the missing variables vxo=initial (x-direction) velocity, calculated in step 4, t=time for projectile to travel (calculated in step 5). For example, if the initial x-velocity was 20m/s and the bullet's airtime was 15 seconds, the horizontal distance that the bullet travelled was 300 meters (984.3 ft).

Find the distance that an object has traveled.,
Find the time that the object took to travel that distance.,
Divide the distance by the time to find the speed.,
Don't forget your units.",How to Calculate Speed1," The basic equation that most people use to figure out how fast something is going is very easy to use. The first thing you'll need to know is how far the object traveled. In other words, how far is its starting point from its ending point?


This equation will be easier to understand with an example. Let's say that we are making a trip in a car to a theme park 100 miles away (about 161 kilometers). In the next few steps, we'll use this information to solve our equation.;
, The next piece of information you'll need is how long the object took as it traveled. In other words, how long did it take to get from its starting point to its ending point?


In our example, let's say that it took us almost exactly two hours to make our journey.

, All you need are these two pieces of information to find your speed for the trip. The distance over the time will give you the object's speed.


In our example, 100 miles/2 hours = 50 miles/hour (about 80 kilometers/hour).

, Labelling your answer with the proper units (like miles per hour, etc.) is critical. Without units, it can be hard for other people to understand what your answer means. You may also lose points if you're making this calculation for schoolwork.


Your units for speed will be your distance units over your time units. In our example, since we measured distance in miles and time in hours, our units are miles/hour (or ""miles per hour"").

"
"
Isolate the different variables to solve for distance and time.,
Convert your units as needed.,
Replace the ""distance"" variable with distance formulas as needed.,
Understand that s = d/t gives an average speed.",How to Calculate Speed2," Once you know the basics of the speed equation, you can use it to find more than just speed. For example, if you start out knowing speed and one of the other variables, you can rearrange the equation to find the missing piece of information.For example, let's say that we know that a train traveled at 20 kilometers per hour for four hours, but we need to know how far it went. In this case, we can rearrange the equation and solve like this:



speed = distance/time
speed × time = (distance/time) × time
speed × time = distance20 km/h × 4 h = distance = 80 kilometers






, Sometimes, you may calculate speed in one set of units but need it in another. In this case, you'll need to use conversion factors to get your answer into the correct units. To do this, just write the relationships between your units as a fraction and multiply. When you multiply, flip your fraction as needed to get rid of the units you don't want. This is a lot easier than it sounds!


For example, let's say that in the example problem above, we need our answer in miles instead of kilometers. There are about 1.6 kilometers in a mile, so we can convert like this:



80 kilometers × 1 mile/1.6 kilometers = 50 miles





Note that because kilometers appears on the bottom of the fraction, it cancels with the kilometers in the original answer, leaving the answer in miles.

This site contains conversions for most common units.

, Objects don't always travel in nice, convenient straight lines. In cases when they don't, you may not be able to simply plug a numerical value for distance into the standard speed equation. Instead, you may need to replace the d in s = d/t with a formula that models the distance the object traveled.


For example, let's say that an airplane flies in a circle that is 20 miles wide five times. The plane completes this journey in half an hour. In this example, we still need to find exactly how far the plane has traveled before we can find its speed. We can use the equation for the distance around a circle (its circumference) in place of d in our equation. This equation is circumference = 2πr where r = the circle's radius.We would solve like this:



s = (2 × π × r)/t
s = (2 × π × 10)/0.5
s = 62.83/0.5 = 125.66 miles/hour






, The simple, convenient equation we have been using to find speed has one significant flaw. The value it gives you is technically an average speed. This means that it assumes the object you're measuring went the same speed for the whole trip. As we'll see below, finding an object's speed at a single given moment can be more difficult.


To illustrate this difference, imagine the last trip you took in a car. It's highly unlikely that you traveled the same speed for the whole trip. Instead, you started out slow and gradually reached your cruising speed, slowing down at stoplights, traffic jams, and so on. If you use the standard speed equation to figure out your speed for the trip, these changes in speed won't be reflected. Instead, you'll get an answer that's somewhere in the middle of all the different speeds you traveled at."
"
Understand that speed is defined as the magnitude of velocity.,
Use absolute values for negative velocities.,
Take the derivative of a position function.,
Take the integral of an acceleration function.",How to Calculate Speed3," Higher-level speed calculations can get confusing because mathematicians and scientists use different definitions for ""speed"" and ""velocity"". A velocity has two components: a magnitude and a direction. The magnitude is equal to the object's speed. A change in the direction will cause a change in the velocity, but not in the speed.


For example, let's say that there are two cars moving in opposite directions. Both cars' speedometers read 50 km/hr, so they both have the same speed. However, since they are moving apart from each other, we say that one car has a velocity of -50 km/hr and one has a velocity of 50 km/hr.

, Objects can have velocities with a negative magnitude (if they are moving in a negative direction relative to something else). However, there's no such thing as a negative speed, so in these cases the absolute value of the magnitude gives the object's speed.


For this reason, in the example problem above, both cars have a speed of 50 km/hr.

, If you have a function s(t) that gives you the position of an object with regards to time, the derivative of s(t) will give you its velocity with regards to time. Just plug a time value into this equation for the variable t (or whatever the time value is) to get the velocity at this given time. From here, finding the speed is easy.


For example, let's say that an object's position in meters is given with the equation 3t2 + t - 4 where t = time in seconds. We want to know what the speed of the object is at t = 4 seconds. In this case, we can solve like this:



3t2 + t - 4
s'(t) = 2 × 3t + 1
s'(t) = 6t + 1




Now, we plug in t = 4:



s'(t) = 6(4) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 meters/second. This is technically a velocity measurement, but since it's positive and direction is not mentioned in the problem, we can essentially use it for speed.





, Acceleration is a way of measuring the change in an object's velocity over time. This topic is a little too complex to explain fully in this article. However, it's useful to note that when you have a function a(t) that gives acceleration with regards to time, the integral of a(t) will give you velocity with regards to time. Note that it's helpful to know the object's initial velocity so that you can define the constant that results from an indefinite integral.


For example, let's say that an object has a constant acceleration (in m/s2 given by a(t) = -30.Let's also say that it has an initial velocity of 10 m/s. We need to find its speed at t = 12 s. In this case, we can solve like this:



a(t) = -30
v(t)= ∫ a(t)dt = ∫ -30dt = -30t + C




To find C, we'll solve v(t) for t = 0. Remember that the object's initial velocity is 10 m/s.



v(0) = 10 = -30(0) + C
10 = C, so v(t) = -30t + 10




Now, we can just plug in t = 12 seconds.



v(12) = -30(12) + 10 = -360 + 10 = -350. Since speed is the absolute value of velocity, the object's speed is 350 meters/second.

The scientific unit of density is kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3), but you can use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) for smaller objects.


Use this formula to convert between these units: 1,000 kg/m3 = 1 g/cm3

The density of liquids is often measured in kilograms per liter (kg/L) or grams per milliliter (g/mL) instead. These units are equivalent: 1 kg/L = 1 g/mL.

Example: Diamond has a density of 3.52 g/cm3.;
, The volume is the amount of space the object occupies. Measure the volume of solids in cubic meters (m3) or cubic centimeters (cm3), and the volume of liquids in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). The formula for volume depends on the shape of the object. Refer to this article for common shapes.


Use the same unit that appears as part of your density measurement.

Example: Since we measured the density of diamond in g/cm3, we should measure our diamond's volume in cm3. Let's say our diamond's volume is 5,000 cm3.

, Multiply your two numbers together, and you'll know the mass of your object.Keep track of the units as you do this, and you'll see that you end up with units of mass (kilograms or grams).



Example: We have a diamond with volume 5,000 cm3 and density 3.52 g/cm3. To find the diamond's mass, multiply 5,000 cm3 x 3.52 g/cm3 = 17,600 grams.

, Newton's second law of motion states that force equals mass times acceleration: F = ma. If you know the net force on the object, and it's acceleration, you can rearrange this formula to find the mass: m = F / a.


Force is measured in N (newton), which you can also write as (kg * m)/ s2. Acceleration is measured in m/s2. When you calculate F / a, the units cancel to give you an answer in kilograms (kg)., Mass is the amount of matter in an object; this does not change unless you cut off part of the object, or attach more material. Weight is a measurement of gravity's effect on mass. If you move the object to an area with different gravity (such as from the earth to the moon), it's weight will change, but it's mass will not.An object with more mass does weigh more than an object with less mass, if they're experiencing the same gravity.

, If you're doing your chemistry homework, you may come across the term ""molar mass."" This is a related concept, but instead of measuring an object, you measure exactly one mole of a substance. Here's how to calculate it in most contexts:For an element: look up the atomic mass of the element or compound you are measuring. This will be in ""atomic mass units"" (amu). Multiply by the molar mass constant, 1 g/mol, to put it into standard molar mass units: g/mol.
For a compound: add the atomic masses of each atom in the compound to find the total amu of the molecule. Multiply this total by 1 g/mol.

, The balance is a device widely used to calculate an object's mass. The balance has three beams. These beams carry weights. The weights allow you to move known masses along the beams.The triple beam balance is not affected by gravity. Thus, it gives a true measurement of mass. It works by comparing a known mass to an unknown mass.
The middle beam reads in 100g increments. The far beam reads in 10g increments. The weights will sit in a notch. The weight on the front beam can read from 0 to 10 grams.
You should be able to get a very precise measurement of mass with this balance. The reading error for a triple-beam balance is only 0.06 grams. Think of the triple-beam balance as operating like a teeter-totter., You want to do this maneuver when the pan is empty. You want the balance to read zero.


If the indicator on the far right does not align with the fixed mark, you should calibrate the balance by turning the set screw that you will find on the left under the pan.
The reason you need to do this is because you need to make sure that the empty pan is 0.000g so its weight does not skew the mass reading you ultimately get. The weight of the container or pan is called its tare.
You can also set the pan to 0 by screwing the knob under the pan in or out. Again, the balance must read zero. Place the object to be measured on the pan. You are now ready to determine the object’s mass using the sliding beams.

, First, move the 100-gram slider along the beam to the right first. Do this until the indicator drops below the fixed mark. The position that is to the left of this point indicates the number of hundreds of grams. You are sliding it one notch at a time.


Move the 10-gram slider along the beam to the right. Do this until the indicator drops below the fixed mark. The notched position immediately to the left of this point indicates the number of tens of grams.
The beam in the front does not have notches. You can move the slider anywhere you want on the beam. The beam’s boldface numbers are grams. The tick marks between the boldface numbers indicate tenths of grams.

, You are now ready to find the mass of the object you placed in the pan. To do so, you should add the numbers from the three beams.


Read the front scale as you would a ruler. You can read it to the nearest half tick mark.
For example, let's say you are trying to measure a can of soda. If the rear weight is in the notch that reads 70g, if the middle weight is in the notch reading 300g, and if the the front beam weight is 3.34g, then the can of soda weighs 373.34g.

Calculate work.,
Define mechanical power.,
Determine the units you're using for work and power.,
Collect the available data.,
Multiply force by distance and divide by time.",How to Calculate Power Output1," In mechanical physics, work is the amount of force needed to move something over a selected distance. The formula for work is:Work=Force∗Distance{\displaystyle {\text{Work}}={\text{Force}}*{\text{Distance}}}

To understand this concept, think about a 100 pound cement block. Moving that block 2 feet requires twice as much work as moving the same block 1 foot. This is also the same amount of work required to move a 200 pound block for a distance of 6 inches (1/2 a foot). 
;
, Power is the rate at which work is performed over time.  The basic formula for defining power is:Power=WorkTime{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\frac {\text{Work}}{\text{Time}}}}

Think again about the 100 pound cement block. Moving that block 2 feet in 10 seconds requires twice as much power as moving the same block for the same distance in 20 seconds. Moving the same object faster requires more power. 


, You need to determine whether you are measuring work and power in traditional English units or in metric units.

The English unit for work is the “foot-pound.” This comes from multiplying the distance measured in feet by the force measured in pounds. The unit for power comes from dividing by time, in seconds. The power unit is the “foot-pound per second.” A more familiar term is the “horsepower,” which is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second.1 Horsepower=550foot-poundssec.{\displaystyle 1{\text{ Horsepower}}=550{\frac {\text{foot-pounds}}{\text{sec.}}}}



The metric unit for work is a joule. A joule is equal to one Newton-meter, which is the amount of work needed to move a 1 Newton force a distance of 1 meter. When you divide work by time, you get power, measured in units of joules per second. This is also called a Watt.1 Watt=1 Joule Sec.=1 Newton-Meter Sec.{\displaystyle 1{\text{ Watt}}=1{\frac {\text{ Joule}}{\text{ Sec.}}}=1{\frac {\text{ Newton-Meter}}{\text{ Sec.}}}}




, Whether you are solving a physics problem in class or are actually calculating power from a real-world application, you need to collect certain information first. You can learn the information that you need by reviewing the measurement units.

For example, suppose you want to calculate in the following problem: A student doing chin-ups lifts his 150 lb. body a distance of 1.5 feet in 2 seconds. How much power is the student exerting?


Force=150 lbs.{\displaystyle {\text{Force}}=150{\text{ lbs.}}}


Distance=1.5 feet{\displaystyle {\text{Distance}}=1.5{\text{ feet}}}


Time=2 sec.{\displaystyle {\text{Time}}=2{\text{ sec.}}}




, Whether in the metric system or the English system, once you have collected the data for the force, the distance and the time, apply them to the formula to find the mechanical power.



Power=Force∗DistanceTime{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\frac {{\text{Force}}*{\text{Distance}}}{\text{Time}}}}


Power=150lb.∗1.5feet2sec.{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\frac {150{\text{lb.}}*1.5{\text{feet}}}{2{\text{sec.}}}}}


Power=225ft-lb2sec.{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\frac {225{\text{ft-lb}}}{2{\text{sec.}}}}}


Power=112.5ft-lbsec.{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=112.5{\frac {\text{ft-lb}}{\text{sec.}}}}

Since 1 horsepower equals 550 ft-lb/sec., this is about equal to one-fifth of a horsepower.

Set up the formula for speed.,
Plug the total distance into the formula.,
Plug the total time into the formula.,
Divide the distance by the time.",How to Calculate Speed in Metres per Second1," The formula is speed=distancetime{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {\text{distance}}{\text{time}}}}.The distance refers to how far something or someone traveled, and the time refers to how long it took to travel that distance.

, This information should be given in meters. Sometimes, however, you might need to calculate the distance traveled using information provided in the problem, or you might need to convert another unit, such as  miles,  feet, or  kilometers, into meters.

For example, you might know that Henry drove his car for 48,000 meters. So, your formula will look like this: speed=48,000time{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {48,000}{\text{time}}}}. 


, Sometimes this information will be given; sometimes you need to calculate the time given a beginning and starting time. Find the difference between the beginning and starting time to find the total time it took to travel. In these instances, you will likely need to convert minutes traveled into seconds traveled by multiplying the number of minutes traveled by 60.For example, you might know that Henry began driving at 6:00p.m. He drove 48,000 meters, and arrived at his destination at 6:30 p.m. The difference between 6:00p.m. and 6:30p.m. is 30 minutes. To find the number of seconds, calculate 30×60=1,800{\displaystyle 30\times 60=1,800}. So, Henry traveled for 1,800 seconds. You formula should look like this: speed=48,0001,800{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {48,000}{1,800}}}.


, This will give you the speed in meters per second.

For example, speed=48,0001,800=26.67m/s{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {48,000}{1,800}}=26.67m/s}.

Estimate the slope for an infinitely small interval on the line.,
Find the instantaneous velocity at t = 4 given the displacement equation s = 5t3 - 3t2 + 2t + 9.,
Use graphical estimation to find the instantaneous velocity at (1,3) for the displacement equation s = 4t2 - t. For this problem, we'll use (1,3) as our P point, but we'll have to find a few other points near it to use as our Q points.",How to Calculate Instantaneous Velocity," To get an object's instantaneous velocity, first we have to have an equation that tells us its position (in terms of displacement) at a certain point in time. This means the equation must have the variable s on one side by itself and t on the other (but not necessarily by itself), like this:
s = -1.5t2 + 10t + 4



In this equation, the variables are:




Displacement = s . The distance the object has traveled from its starting position. For example, if an object goes 10 meters forward and 7 meters backward, its total displacement is 10 - 7 = 3 meters (not 10 + 7 = 17 meters).

Time = t . Self explanatory. Typically measured in seconds.



;
, The derivative of an equation is just a different equation that tells you its slope at any given point in time. To find the derivative of your displacement formula, differentiate the function with this general rule for finding derivatives: If y = a*xn, Derivative = a*n*xn-1.This rule is applied to every term on the ""t"" side of the equation.


In other words, start by going through the ""t"" side of your equation from left to right. Every time you reach a ""t"", subtract 1 from the exponent and multiply the entire term by the original exponent. Any constant terms (terms which don't contain ""t"") will disappear because they be multiplied by 0. This process isn't actually as hard as it sounds — let's derive the equation in the step above as an example:
s = -1.5t2 + 10t + 4
(2)-1.5t(2-1) + (1)10t1 - 1 + (0)4t0
-3t1 + 10t0-3t + 10



, To show that our new equation is a derivative of the first one, we replace ""s"" with the notation ""ds/dt"". Technically, this notation means ""the derivative of s with respect to t."" A simpler way to think of this is just that ds/dt is just the slope of any given point in the first equation. For example, to find the slope of the line made by s = -1.5t2 + 10t + 4 at t = 5, we would just plug ""5"" into t in its derivative.


In our running example, our finished equation should now look like this:
ds/dt = -3t + 10



, Now that you have your derivative equation, finding the instantaneous velocity at any point in time is easy. All you need to do is pick a value for t and plug it into your derivative equation. For example, if we want to find the instantaneous velocity at t = 5, we would just substitute ""5"" for t in the derivative ds/dt = -3 + 10. Then, we'd just solve the equation like this:
ds/dt = -3t + 10
ds/dt = -3(5) + 10
ds/dt = -15 + 10 = -5 meters/second



Note that we use the label ""meters/second"" above. Since we're dealing with displacement in terms of meters and time in terms of seconds and velocity in general is just displacement over time, this label is appropriate.

, In the section above, we mentioned that derivatives are just formulas that let us find the slope at any point for the equation you take the derivative for. In fact, if you represent an object's displacement with a line on a graph, the slope of the line at any given point is equal to the object's instantaneous velocity at that point.


To graph an object's displacement, use the x axis to represent time and the y axis to represent displacement. Then, just plot points by plugging values for t into your displacement equation, getting s values for your answers, and marking the t,s (x,y) points on the graph.
Note that the graph can extend below the x axis. If the line representing your object's motion drops below the x axis, this represents your object moving behind where it started. Generally, your graph won't extend behind the y axis - we don't often measure velocity for objects moving backward in time!

, To find a line's slope at a single point P, we use a trick called ""taking a limit."" Taking a limit involves taking two points (P, plus Q, a point near it) on the curved line and finding the slope of the line linking them over and over again as the distance between P and Q gets smaller.


Let's say that our displacement line contains the points (1,3) and (4,7). In this case, if we want to find the slope at (1,3), we can set (1,3) = P and (4,7) = Q.

, The slope between P and Q is the difference in y-values for P and Q over the difference in x-values for P and Q. In other words, H = (yQ - yP)/(xQ - xP), where H is the slope between the two points. In our example, the slope between P and Q is:
H = (yQ - yP)/(xQ - xP)
H = (7 - 3)/(4 - 1)
H = (4)/(3) = 1.33


, The smaller the distance between P and Q gets, the closer the slope of your tiny line segments will be to the slope at point P. Let's do this a few times for our example equation, using the points (2,4.8), (1.5,3.95), and (1.25,3.49) for Q and our original point of (1,3) for P:
Q = (2,4.8): H = (4.8 - 3)/(2 - 1)
H = (1.8)/(1) = 1.8Q = (1.5,3.95): H = (3.95 - 3)/(1.5 - 1)
H = (.95)/(.5) = 1.9Q = (1.25,3.49): H = (3.49 - 3)/(1.25 - 1)
H = (.49)/(.25) = 1.96


, As Q gets closer and closer to P, H will get closer and closer to the slope at point P. Eventually, at an infinitely small interval, H will equal the slope at P. Because we aren't able to measure or calculate an infinitely small interval, we just estimate the slope at P once it's clear from the points we've tried.


In our example, as we moved Q closer to P, we got values of 1.8, 1.9, and 1.96 for H. Since these numbers appear to be approaching 2, we can say that 2 is a good estimate for the slope at P.
Remember that the slope at a given point on a line is equal to the derivative of the line's equation at that point. Since our line is showing our object's displacement over time and, as we saw in the section above, an object's instantaneous velocity is the derivative of its displacement at a given point, we can also say that 2 meters/second is a good estimate for the instantaneous velocity at t = 1.

, This is just like our example in the first section, except that we're dealing with a cubic equation rather than a quadratic equation, so we can solve it in the same way.


First, we'll take our equation's derivative:
s = 5t3 - 3t2 + 2t + 9
s = (3)5t(3 - 1) - (2)3t(2 - 1) + (1)2t(1 - 1) + (0)9t0 - 1
15t(2) - 6t(1) + 2t(0)15t(2) - 6t + 2


Then, we'll plug in our value for t (4):
s = 15t(2) - 6t + 2
15(4)(2) - 6(4) + 2
15(16) - 6(4) + 2
240 - 24 + 2 = 22 meters/second



, Then, it's just a matter of finding our H values and making an estimation.


First, let's find Q points at t = 2, 1.5, 1.1 and 1.01.
s = 4t2 - tt = 2: s = 4(2)2 - (2)
4(4) - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14, so Q = (2,14)t = 1.5: s = 4(1.5)2 - (1.5)
4(2.25) - 1.5 = 9 - 1.5 = 7.5, so Q = (1.5,7.5)t = 1.1: s = 4(1.1)2 - (1.1)
4(1.21) - 1.1 = 4.84 - 1.1 = 3.74, so Q = (1.1,3.74)t = 1.01: s = 4(1.01)2 - (1.01)
4(1.0201) - 1.01 = 4.0804 - 1.01 = 3.0704, so Q = (1.01,3.0704)


Next, let's get our H values:
Q = (2,14): H = (14 - 3)/(2 - 1)
H = (11)/(1) = 11Q = (1.5,7.5): H = (7.5 - 3)/(1.5 - 1)
H = (4.5)/(.5) = 9Q = (1.1,3.74): H = (3.74 - 3)/(1.1 - 1)
H = (.74)/(.1) = 7.3Q = (1.01,3.0704): H = (3.0704 - 3)/(1.01 - 1)
H = (.0704)/(.01) = 7.04


Since our H values seem to be getting very close to 7, we can say that 7 meters/second is a good estimate for the instantaneous velocity at (1,3).

Rewrite the formula for power.,
Convert the units as needed.,
Multiply the force by the velocity.",How to Calculate Power Output2," The original formula for power focuses on work, as a force times distance, and divides by the time it takes to do that work. Another way to consider the same components is as follows:


Power=Force∗DistanceTime{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Force}}*{\frac {\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}}}

By grouping the terms differently, in this way, you should recognize that DistanceTime{\displaystyle {\frac {\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}}} is another way of representing velocity. Therefore, you can conclude that:


Power=Force∗Velocity{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Force}}*{\text{Velocity}}}

Consider a 2000 pound car. Moving that car at a speed of 50 miles per hour takes twice as much power as moving the same car at a speed of 25 miles per hour.


, The units of power are generally calculated in either Watts, which are Joules/sec. or Newton-meters per second, or in horsepower (hp) or foot-pounds per second. Recall that 1 hp = 550 ft-lb/sec. If your situation or problem presents data in different units, you will have to convert. Some of the most useful conversion factors are:

1 mile = 5280 feet

1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds

1 kg = 9.8 N (force)

For the moving car problem, the data is provided in miles, hours and pounds. You need to convert 50 miles into 50*5280=264,000 feet, and convert hours into 3600 seconds. Then you can restate the problem as calculating the power of moving a 2000 pound car at a velocity of 264,000/3,600 = 73.33 feet per second.


, When your data is in the correct format, you can calculate power as the product of force times velocity. For the car problem, this becomes:


Power=Force∗Velocity{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Force}}*{\text{Velocity}}}


Power=2000Pounds∗73.33feetsec{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=2000{\text{Pounds}}*73.33{\frac {\text{feet}}{\text{sec}}}}


Power=146,660foot-poundssec{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=146,660{\frac {\text{foot-pounds}}{\text{sec}}}}

You can report this as the car’s power, or convert to horsepower by dividing by 550. Power=146,660/550=266.65 horsepower{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=146,660/550=266.65{\text{ horsepower}}}

The engine exerted 266.65 horsepower in moving the 2000 pound car at a velocity of 50 mph.

Record the circuit’s voltage.,
Record the circuit’s current.,
Define electrical power.,
Calculate the power of a circuit.",How to Calculate Power Output3," A circuit’s voltage is analogous to the force applied in a mechanical movement. The voltage tells you how much electrical charge is being passed through a circuit. Just as moving a heavy block of cement requires great mechanical power, moving a high voltage requires a large electrical power output. Voltage is measured in units calls volts, abbreviated V. In equations, the voltage is represented by the symbol E.If you are reading a circuit diagram, the voltage will be written somewhere on the diagram. If you are building an actual circuit, the voltage is the power coming from the battery source. For example, a single 9 volt battery provides 9 volts to the circuit.


, The current of an electrical circuit is analogous to the velocity applied in a mechanical movement. The current tells you how fast the charge is being passed through the circuit. Current is measured in units called Amperes, abbreviated as Amps or just A. In calculations, current is symbolized by the capital letter I.Current can be measured directly using a reader called an ammeter.Alternatively, the problem you are working on may simply provide the number of Amps in the circuit.

For example, a circuit that has a current of 4 Amps is moving the charge twice as quickly as a circuit with a current only 2 Amps.


, Just as power can be defined in the mechanical sense as the amount of work exerted over time, electrical power is also an amount of work exerted over time. However, with electrical power, the work that is calculated is the work of moving electrons through an electrical circuit. A circuit that moves more electrons or moves them more quickly will be defined as having greater power.The unit of electrical power is the Watt. It is calculated as follows:


Power=Current∗Voltage{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Current}}*{\text{Voltage}}}


P=IE{\displaystyle P=IE}


, Suppose a given electrical circuit has a current of 6 Amps and a charge of 18 volts. To calculate the power in the circuit, you need to multiply as follows:Power=Current∗Voltage{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Current}}*{\text{Voltage}}}


Power=6∗18=108Watts{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=6*18=108Watts}

Multiply force x distance.",How to Calculate Joules1," If you push a box across the room, you've done work. If you lift it upward, you've done work. There are two important qualities that have to be there for ""work"" to happen:You're applying constant force.

The force is causing the object to move in the direction of the force.
;
, Work is easy to calculate. Just multiply the amount of force used, and the amount of distance traveled. Usually, scientists measure force in Newtons, and distance in meters. If you use these units, your answer will be work in units of Joules.

Whenever you read a word problem about work, stop and think where the force is being applied. If you lift a box, you're pushing upward, and the box is moving up — so the distance is however much it rises. But if you then walk forward holding the box, there's no work happening at all. You're pushing upward still, to keep the box from falling, but the box isn't moving up., You need to know the mass to figure out how much force you need to move it. For our first example, we'll use a person lifting a weight from the floor to her chest, and calculate how much work that person exerts on the weight. Let's say the weight has a mass of 10 kilograms (kg).

Avoid using pounds or other non-standard units, or your final answer won't be in terms of joules.


, Force = mass x acceleration. In our example, lifting a weight straight up, the acceleration we're fighting is due to gravity, which equals 9.8 meters/second2. Calculate the force required to move our weight upward by multiplying (10 kg) x (9.8 m/s2) = 98 kg m/s2 = 98 Newtons (N).

If the object is being moved horizontally, gravity is irrelevant. The problem may ask you to calculate the force required to overcome friction instead. If the problem tells you how fast the object is accelerating when it is pushed, you can multiply the acceleration given with the mass.


, For this example, let's say the weight is being lifted 1.5 meters (m). The distance must be measured in meters, or your final answer will not be written in Joules.
, To lift a 98 Newton weight 1.5 meters upward, you'll need to exert 98 x 1.5 = 147 Joules of work.
, Our example above was simple: someone exerted a force upward on the object, and the object moved upward. Sometimes, the direction of the force and the movement of the object aren't quite the same, due to multiple forces acting on the object. In the next example, we'll calculate the amount of Joules needed for a kid to drag a sled 20 meters across flat snow by pulling on a rope angled upward at 30º. For this scenario, Work = force x cosine(θ) x distance. The θ symbol is the Greek letter ""theta,"" and describes the angle between the direction of force and the direction of movement., For this problem, let's say the kid is pulling on the rope with a force of 10 Newtons.

If the problem gives you the ""rightward force,"" ""upward force,"" or ""force in the direction of motion,"" it has already calculated the ""force x cos(θ)"" part of the problem, and you can skip down to multiplying the values together


, Only some of the force is pulling the sled forward. Since the rope is at an angle upward, the rest of the force is trying to yank the sled upward, uselessly pulling against gravity. Calculate the force that applies in the direction of motion:

In our example, the angle θ between the flat snow and the rope is 30º.

Calculate cos(θ). cos(30º) = (√3)/2 = about 0.866. You can use a calculator to find this value, but make sure your calculator is set to the same unit as your angle measurement (degrees or radians).

Multiply the total force x cos(θ). In our example, 10N x 0.866 = 8.66 N of force in the direction of motion.


, Now that we know how much force is actually going toward the direction of motion, we can calculate work as usual. Our problem tells us the sled moved 20 meters forward, so calculate 8.66 N x 20 m = 173.2 joules of work.

Set up the formula for speed.,
Acquire your distance-time graph.,
Interpret the x-axis and the y-axis of the graph.,
Calculate the distance traveled by the person or object.,
Calculate the time spent travelling by the person or object.,
Divide the distance by the time.",How to Calculate Speed in Metres per Second2," The formula is speed=distancetime{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {\text{distance}}{\text{time}}}}., This should be presented to you in the form of a coordinate plane. The graph should have at least one line plotted. The line represents the distance and time traveled by a single person or object. If the graph has multiple lines, each line represents a different person or object.

The first endpoint of the line signifies when the person or object started moving. The second endpoint of the line signifies when the person or object stopped moving.


, The x-axis is the horizontal axis, and it indicates the time spent travelling. The y-axis is the vertical axis, and it indicates the distance traveled.If the units of the graph are not listed in terms of meters per second, you will need to  convert the units after you find the speed.

The steeper the line on a distance-time graph, the faster the speed.A horizontal line indicates that there was no change in distance. This would indicate a speed of 0 meters per second., To calculate the distance, find the appropriate line on the graph and note the point where the line ends. Find the y-coordinate of this point by moving your finger horizontally to the y-axis. This will show you the distance travelled.If the line does not start at the (0, 0) point, you need to find the distance by subtracting the y-values of the two endpoints of the line.

For example, if the line showing the distance and time traveled by Henry begins at (0, 0) and ends at the point (1,800, 48,000), the number of meters traveled is 48,000.


, To calculate the time, go back to the point where the line ends. Find the x-coordinate of this point by moving your finger vertically to the x-axis. This will show you the time spent traveling.For example, if the line showing the distance and time traveled by Henry ends at the point (1,800, 48,000), the number of seconds traveled is 1,800.


, Plug the two values into the formula and divide. This will give you the speed. If the units on the graph were listed in units other than meters per second, you will need to convert the units to find the speed in meters per second.

For example, speed=48,0001,800=26.67m/s{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {48,000}{1,800}}=26.67m/s}.

Calculate the speed in miles per hour.,
Convert miles per hour to miles per minute.,
Convert miles per minute to miles per second.,
Convert miles per second to feet per second.,
Convert feet per second to meters per seconds.,
Divide the numerator by the denominator.",How to Calculate Speed in Metres per Second3," Do this using the formula speed=distancetime{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {\text{distance}}{\text{time}}}}.Restate the speed as a ratio of miles over 1 hour.

For example, if Becky drove 50 miles in 1.25 hours at a constant speed, you would find the speed by calculating speed=50miles1.25hours=40mph{\displaystyle {\text{speed}}={\frac {50\;{\text{miles}}}{1.25\;{\text{hours}}}}=40mph}. As a ratio, you would state the speed as 40miles1hour{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{1\;{\text{hour}}}}}.


, To do this set up fractions to cancel the units. To cancel units, you need to multiply two fractions that share one unit, but not the other. In order for the unit to cancel, it needs to be in the numerator of one fraction, and the denominator of the other fraction.Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, you would multiply the speed in miles per hour by the fraction 1hour60minutes{\displaystyle {\frac {1\;{\text{hour}}}{60\;{\text{minutes}}}}}.

For example:40miles1hour×1hour60minutes{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{1\;{\text{hour}}}}\times {\frac {1\;{\text{hour}}}{60\;{\text{minutes}}}}}40miles1hour×1hour60minutes{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{1\;{\cancel {\text{hour}}}}}\times {\frac {1\;{\cancel {\text{hour}}}}{60\;{\text{minutes}}}}}40×1miles1×60minutes{\displaystyle {\frac {40\times 1\;{\text{miles}}}{1\times 60\;{\text{minutes}}}}}40miles60minutes{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{60\;{\text{minutes}}}}}


, Do this just as you did for the previous conversion. Multiply the two ratios to cancel units. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so your second fraction will be 1minute60seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {1\;{\text{minute}}}{60\;{\text{seconds}}}}}.

For example:40miles60minutes×1minute60seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{60\;{\text{minutes}}}}\times {\frac {1\;{\text{minute}}}{60\;{\text{seconds}}}}}40miles60minutes×1minute60seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{60\;{\cancel {\text{minutes}}}}}\times {\frac {1\;{\cancel {\text{minute}}}}{60\;{\text{seconds}}}}}40×1miles60×60seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {40\times 1\;{\text{miles}}}{60\times 60\;{\text{seconds}}}}}40miles3600seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{3600\;{\text{seconds}}}}}


, There are 5,280 feet in a mile.Thus, you will multiply the ratio of miles per second by 5280feet1mile{\displaystyle {\frac {5280\;{\text{feet}}}{1\;{\text{mile}}}}}.

For example:40miles3600seconds×5280feet1mile{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\text{miles}}}{3600\;{\text{seconds}}}}\times {\frac {5280\;{\text{feet}}}{1\;{\text{mile}}}}}40miles3600seconds×5280feet1mile{\displaystyle {\frac {40\;{\cancel {\text{miles}}}}{3600\;{\text{seconds}}}}\times {\frac {5280\;{\text{feet}}}{1\;{\cancel {\text{mile}}}}}}40×5280feet3600×1seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {40\times 5280\;{\text{feet}}}{3600\times 1\;{\text{seconds}}}}}211,200feet3600seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {211,200\;{\text{feet}}}{3600\;{\text{seconds}}}}}


, There are 3.28084 feet in 1 meter.So, you will multiply the ratio of feet per second by 1meter3.28084feet{\displaystyle {\frac {1\;{\text{meter}}}{3.28084\;{\text{feet}}}}}.

For example:211,200feet3600seconds×1meter3.28084feet{\displaystyle {\frac {211,200\;{\text{feet}}}{3600\;{\text{seconds}}}}\times {\frac {1\;{\text{meter}}}{3.28084\;{\text{feet}}}}}211,200feet3600seconds×1meter3.28084feet{\displaystyle {\frac {211,200\;{\cancel {\text{feet}}}}{3600\;{\text{seconds}}}}\times {\frac {1\;{\text{meter}}}{3.28084\;{\cancel {\text{feet}}}}}}211,200×1meters3600×3.28084seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {211,200\times 1\;{\text{meters}}}{3600\times 3.28084\;{\text{seconds}}}}}211,200meters11,811seconds{\displaystyle {\frac {211,200\;{\text{meters}}}{11,811\;{\text{seconds}}}}}.


, This will give you the speed in meters per second.

For example, 211,20011,811=17.88{\displaystyle {\frac {211,200}{11,811}}=17.88}. So, Becky drove at a rate of 17.88 meters per second.

Here m stands for mass, the measure of how much matter is in an object, and v stands for velocity of the object, or the rate at which the object changes its position.Your answer should always be stated in joules (J), which is the standard unit of measurement for kinetic energy. It is equivalent to 1 kg * m2/s2.;
, If you are solving a problem where the mass isn’t given, you will have to determine the mass yourself. This can be done by weighing the object on a balance and obtaining the mass in kilograms (kg).


Tare the balance. Before you weigh your object, you must set it to zero. Zeroing out the scale is called taring.Place your object on the balance. Gently, place the object on the balance and record its mass in kilograms.
If necessary, convert grams to kilograms. For the final calculation, the mass must be in kilograms.

, Oftentimes, the problem will give you the velocity of the object. If this is not the case, you can determine the velocity by using the distance an object travels and how long it takes to cover that distance.The units for velocity are meters per second (m/s).


Velocity is defined by the equation, displacement divided by time: V = d/t. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction. Magnitude is the number value that quantifies the speed, while direction is the direction in which the speed takes place during motion.
For example, an object’s velocity can be 80 m/s or -80 m/s depending on the direction of travel.
To calculate velocity, simply divide the distance the object traveled by the time it took to travel that distance.

, The formula for calculating kinetic energy (KE) is KE = 0.5 x mv2. Here m stands for mass, the measure of how much matter is in an object, and v stands for velocity of the object, or the rate at which the object changes its position.Your answer should always be stated in joules (J), which is the standard unit of measurement for kinetic energy. It is equivalent to 1 kg * m2/s2.

, If you don't know the mass or velocity of the object, then you'll have to calculate it. But let's say that you do know both quantities and are working to solve the following problem: Determine the kinetic energy of a 55 kg woman running with a velocity of 3.87m/s. Since you know the mass and velocity of the woman, you can plug it into the equation:KE = 0.5 x mv2
KE = 0.5 x 55 x (3.87)2

, Once you've plugged in the mass and velocity, you can solve for kinetic energy (KE). Square the velocity and then multiply all of the variables together. Remember to state your answer in joules (J). KE = 0.5 x 55 x (3.87)2
KE = 0.5 x 55 x 14.97
KE = 411.675 J

, The formula for calculating kinetic energy (KE) is KE = 0.5 x mv2. Here m stands for mass, the measure of how much matter is in an object, and v stands for velocity of the object, or the rate at which the object changes its position.Your answer should always be stated in joules (J), which is the standard unit of measurement for kinetic energy. It is equivalent to 1 kg * m2/s2.

, In some problems, you may know the kinetic energy and the mass or kinetic energy and velocity. The first step to solving this problem is to plug in all of the variables that are known.


Example 1: What is the velocity of an object with a mass of 30 kg and a kinetic energy of 500 J?

KE = 0.5 x mv2
500 J = 0.5 x 30 x v2


Example 2: What is the mass of an object with a kinetic energy of 100 J and a velocity of 5 m/s?

KE = 0.5 x mv2
100 J = 0.5 x m x 52



, Using algebra, you can solve for the unknown variable by rearranging all of the known variables to one side of the equation.


Example 1: What is the velocity of an object with a mass of 30 kg and a kinetic energy of 500 J?

KE = 0.5 x mv2
500 J = 0.5 x 30 x v2
Multiply mass by 0.5: 0.5 x 30 = 15
Divide kinetic energy by the product: 500/15 = 33.33
Square root to find velocity: 5.77 m/s


Example 2: What is the mass of an object with a kinetic energy of 100 J and a velocity of 5 m/s?

KE = 0.5 x mv2
100 J = 0.5 x m x 52
Square the velocity: 52 = 25
Multiply by 0.5: 0.5 x 25 = 12.5

Define the equation for the force of gravity that attracts an object, Fgrav = (Gm1m2)/d2 .In order to properly calculate the gravitational force on an object, this equation takes into account the masses of both objects and how far apart the objects are from each other.,

Determine the mass of the object in question.,
Measure the distance between the two objects.,
Solve the equation.,
Understand Newton’s Second Law of Motion, F = ma.,
Know the acceleration due to gravity on earth.,
Use the proper metric units.,
Determine the mass of the object in question.,
Solve the equation.",How to Calculate Force of Gravity," The variables are defined below.



Fgrav is the force due to gravity

G is the universal gravitation constant 6.673 x 10-11 Nm2/kg2m1 is the mass of the first object

m2 is the mass of the second object

d is the distance between the centers of two objects
Sometimes you will see the letter r instead of the letter d. Both symbols represent the distance between the two objects.;
, For this particular equation, you must use metric units. The masses of objects need to be in kilograms (kg) and the distance needs to be in meters (m). You must convert to these units before continuing with the calculation.

, For smaller objects, you can weigh them on a scale or balance to determine their weight in kilograms (kg). For larger objects, you will have to look-up the approximate mass in a table or online. In physics problems, the mass of the object will generally be provided to you.

, If you are trying to calculate the force of gravity between an object and the earth, you need to determine how far away the object is from the center of the earth.The distance from the surface of the earth to the center is approximately 6.38 x 106 m.You can find tables and other resources online that will provide you with approximate distances of the center of the earth to objects at various elevations on the surface., Once you have defined the variables of your equation, you can plug them in and solve. Be sure that all of your units are in metric and on the right scale. Mass should be in kilograms and distance in meters. Solve the equation using the proper order of operations.


For example: Determine the force of gravity on a 68 kg person on the surface of the earth. The mass of the earth is 5.98 x 1024 kg.Make sure all your variables have the proper units. m1 = 5.98 x 1024 kg, m2 = 68 kg, G = 6.673 x 10-11 Nm2/kg2, and d = 6.38 x 106 m
Write your equation: Fgrav = (Gm1m2)/d2 = /(6.38 x 106)2

Multiply the masses of the two objects together. 68 x (5.98 x 1024) = 4.06 x 1026

Multiply the product of m1 and m2 by the gravitational constant G. (4.06 x 1026) x (6.67 x 10-11) = 2.708 x 1016

Square the distance between the two objects. (6.38 x 106)2 = 4.07 x 1013

Divide the product of G x m1 x m2 by the distance squared to find the force of gravity in Newtons (N). 2.708 x 1016/4.07 x 1013 = 665 N
The force of gravity is 665 N.

, Newton’s second law of motion states that any object will accelerate when acted upon by a net or unbalanced force.In other words, if a force is acting upon an object that is greater than the forces acting in the opposite direction, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force.


This law can be summed up with the equation F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass of the object, and a is acceleration.
Using this law, we can calculate the force of gravity of any object on the surface of the earth, using the known acceleration due to gravity.

, On earth, the force of gravity causes objects to accelerate at a rate of 9.8 m/s2. On the earth’s surface, we can use the simplified equation Fgrav = mg to calculate the force of gravity.


If you want a more exact approximation of force, you can still use the above equation, Fgrav = (GMearthm)/d2 to determine force of gravity.

, For this particular equation, you must use metric units. The mass of the object needs to be in kilograms (kg) and the acceleration needs to be in meters per second squared (m/s2). You must convert to these units before continuing with the calculation.

, For smaller objects, you can weigh them on a scale or balance to determine its weight in kilograms (kg). For larger objects, you will have to look-up the approximate mass in a table or online. In physics problems, the mass of the object will generally be provided to you.

, Once you have defined the variables of your equation, you can plug them in and solve. Be sure that all of your units are in metric and on the right scale. Mass should be in kilograms and distance in meters. Solve the equation using the proper order of operations.


Let’s use the same equation from above and see how close the approximation is. Determine the force of gravity on a 68 kg person on the surface of the earth.
Make sure all your variables have the proper units: m = 68 kg, g = 9.8 m/s2.
Write your equation. Fgrav = mg = 68*9.8 = 666 N.
With F = mg the force of gravity is 666 N, while using the more exact equation yields a force of 665 N. As you can see, these values are almost identical.

Understand power and energy.,
Multiply watts by seconds to get joules.",How to Calculate Joules2," Watts are a measure of power, or how fast energy is used (energy over time). Joules is a measure of energy. In order to convert from watts to joules, you need to specify a length of time. The longer a current flows, the more energy it uses.
, A 1 Watt device consumes 1 Joule of energy every 1 second. If you multiply the number of watts by the number of seconds, you'll end up with joules. To find out how much energy a 60W light bulb consumes in 120 seconds, simply multiply (60 watts) x (120 seconds) = 7200 Joules.This formula works for any form of power measured in watts, but electricity is the most common application.

Enter these numbers into the following formula.",How to Calculate Joules3," Kinetic energy is the amount of energy in the form of motion. Like any unit of energy, it can be express in units of Joules.

Kinetic energy is equivalent to the amount of work done to accelerate a stationary object to a certain speed. Once it has reached that speed, the object retains that amount of kinetic energy until that energy transforms into heat (from friction), gravitational potential energy (from moving against gravity), or other types of energy.


, For example, we can measure the kinetic energy of a bicycle & bicyclist. Let's say the cyclist has a mass of 50 kg, and the cycle has a mass of 20 kg, for a total mass m of 70 kg. We can now treat them as one 70 kg object, since they'll be traveling together at the same speed.
, If you already know the bicyclist's speed or velocity, just write it down and move on. If you need to calculate it yourself, use one of these methods below. Note that we care about the speed, not the velocity (which is speed in a certain direction), even though the abbreviation v is often used. Ignore any turns the bicyclist makes and pretend all distance traveled is one straight line.

If the bicyclist moved at a constant rate (didn't accelerate), measure the distance the bicyclist traveled in meters, and divide it by the number of seconds it took to move that distance. This will give you the average speed, which in this scenario is the same as the speed at any given moment.

If the bicyclist is accelerating at constant acceleration and doesn't change direction, calculate his speed at time t with the formula ""speed at time t = (acceleration)(t) + initial speed. Use seconds to measure time, meters/second to measure speed, and m/s2 to measure acceleration.


, Kinetic energy = (1/2)mv2. For instance, if the bicyclist is traveling at 15 m/s, its kinetic energy K = (1/2)(70 kg)(15 m/s)2 = (1/2)(70 kg)(15 m/s)(15 m/s) = 7875 kgm2/s2 = 7875 newton meters = 7875 joules.

The kinetic energy formula can be derived from the definition of work, W = FΔs, and the kinematic equation v2 = v02 + 2aΔs.Δs refers to ""change in position,"" or the amount of distance traveled.

Find the mass of the object being heated.,
Find the object's specific heat capacity.,
Find the current temperature of the object.,
Heat the object and measure the temperature again.,
Subtract the original temperature from the heated temperature.,
Multiply the mass of the object by its specific heat capacity and by the amount of temperature change.",How to Calculate Joules4," Use a balance or spring scale for this. If the object is a liquid, first weigh the empty container the liquid will be held in and find its mass. You'll need to subtract this from the mass of the container and liquid together to find the liquid's mass. For this example, we'll assume the object is 500 grams of water.

Use grams, not any other unit, or the result will not be in Joules.


, This information can be found in a chemistry reference, either in book form or online. For water, the specific heat capacity c is 4.19 joules per gram for each degree Celsius it is heated – or 4.1855, if you need to be very precise.Specific heat capacity actually varies slightly based on temperature and pressure. Different organizations and textbooks use different ""standard temperatures,"" so you may see the specific heat capacity of water listed as 4.179 instead.

You can use Kelvin instead of Celsius, since a difference in temperature is the same in both units (heating something by 3ºC is the same as heating by 3 Kelvin). Do not use Fahrenheit, or your result will not be in Joules.


, If the object is a liquid, you can use a bulb thermometer. For some objects, you may need a probe thermometer.
, This will let use measure the amount of heat being added to the object during the heat.

If you want to measure the total amount of energy stored as heat, you can pretend the initial temperature was absolute zero: 0 Kelvin or -273.15ºC. This is not typically useful.


, This will produce the degrees of temperature change in the object. Assuming the water was originally at 15 degrees Celsius and heated to 35 degrees Celsius, the temperature change would be 20 degrees Celsius.
, This formula is written H = mcΔT, where ΔT means ""change in temperature."" For this example, this would be 500g x 4.19 x 20, or 41,900 joules.

Heat is more commonly expressed in the metric system in terms of either calories or kilocalories. A calorie is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius, while a Kilocalorie (or Calorie) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius. In the example above, raising 500 grams of water 20 degrees Celsius would expend 10,000 calories or 10 kilocalories.

Use the steps below to calculate energy flow in an electrical circuit.,
Choose a resistor.,
Connect the resistor to a current source.,
Run a current through the circuit for a set period of time.,
Measure the strength of the current.,
Use the formula P = I2 x R. To find the power, multiply the square of the current by the resistance.,
Multiply the power by the amount of time elapsed.",How to Calculate Joules5," The steps below are written as a practical example, but you can use the method to understand written physics problems as well. First, we'll calculate the power P using the formula P = I2 x R, where I is the current in amperes (amps) and R is the resistance in ohms.These units give us the power in watts, so from there, we' can use the formula in the previous step to calculate the energy in joules.
, Resistors are rated in ohms, with the rating either labeled directly or indicated with a series of colored bands. You can also test a resistor's resistance by connecting it to an ohmmeter or multimeter. For this example, we'll assume the resistor is rated at 10 ohms.
, Either connect wires to the resistor with Fahnestock or alligator clips, or plug the resistor into a testing board.
, For this example, we'll use a period of 10 seconds.
, Do this with an ammeter or a multimeter. Most household current is in milliamperes, or thousandths of an ampere, so we'll assume the current is 100 milliamperes, or 0.1 ampere.
, This yields the power output in watts. Squaring 0.1 gives 0.01, multiplied by 10, gives a power output of 0.1 watt, or 100 milliwatts.
, This gives the energy output in joules. 0.1 watt x 10 seconds equals 1 joule of electrical energy.

 As joules are small units, and because appliances commonly use watts, milliwatts, and kilowatts to indicate how much power they use, utilities commonly measure their energy output in kilowatt-hours. One watt equals 1 joule per second, or 1 joule equals 1 watt-second; a kilowatt equals 1 kilojoules per second and a kilojoule equals 1 kilowatt-second. As there are 3,600 seconds in an hour, 1 kilowatt-hour equals 3,600 kilowatt-seconds, 3,600 kilojoules, or 3,600,000 joules.

, Remember to substitute for the variable t{\displaystyle t}.

For example, if Ben drives for 3 hours, your formula will look like this: S=1503{\displaystyle S={\frac {150}{3}}}.


, This will give you the average speed per unit of time, usually hour.

For example:S=1503{\displaystyle S={\frac {150}{3}}}S=50{\displaystyle S=50}So, if Ben traveled 150 miles in 3 hours, his average speed is 50 miles per hour.

Multiply mass times acceleration.,
Convert figures to their SI values.,
Keep in mind that weight and mass mean different things in Physics.,
Find the force that is required to accelerate a 1,000 kg car at 5 m/s2.,
Calculate the force required for an 8 pound wagon to accelerate at 7 m/s2.,
Find the magnitude of force acting upon a cart weighing 100 N and accelerating at the rate of 2.5 m/s2.",How to Calculate Force," The force (F) required to move an object of mass (m) with an acceleration (a) is given by the formula F = m x a. So, force = mass multiplied by acceleration., The International System of Units (SI) unit of mass is the kilogram, and the SI unit of acceleration is m/s2 (meters per second squared). So when mass and acceleration are expressed in their SI units, we get the force in its SI units which is N (Newtons)


As an example, if the mass of the object is given to be 3 pounds, you'll need to convert those pounds to kilograms. 3 pounds make 1.36 kg, so the mass of the object is 1.36 kg.

, If the weight of an object is given in N (Newtons), then divide it by 9.8 to get the equivalent mass. For example, 10 N weight is equivalent to 10/9.8 = 1.02 kg.

,


Check to make sure all your values are in the correct SI unit.
Multiply your acceleration value (1000 kg) by 5 m/s2 to calculate your value.

,


First, convert all your units to SI. One pound is equal to .453 kg, so you'll need to multiply that value by your 8 pounds to determine the mass.
Multiply your new value for the mass (3.62 kg) by your acceleration value (7 m/s2).

,


Remember, 10 N is equal to 9.8 kg. So, convert Newtons to kg by dividing by 9.8 kg. Your new kg value should be 10.2 kg for the mass.
Multiply your new mass value (10.2 kg) times the acceleration (2.5 m/s2).

Substitute this value for d{\displaystyle d} in the formula.

For example, If Ben traveled 150 miles, 120 miles, and 70 miles, you would determine the total speed by adding the three distances together: 150+120+70=340{\displaystyle 150+120+70=340}. So, your formula will look like this: S=340t{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{t}}}.


, To do this, add up the times, usually hours, that were spent traveling. Substitute this value for t{\displaystyle t} in the formula.

For example, If Ben for 3 hours, 2 hours, and 1 hour, you would determine the total time by adding the three times together: 3+2+1=6{\displaystyle 3+2+1=6}. So, your formula will look like this: S=3406{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{6}}}.


, This will give you your average speed.

For example:S=3406{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{6}}}S=56.67{\displaystyle S=56.67}. So if Ben traveled 150 miles in 3 hours, 120 miles in 2 hours, and 70 miles in 1 hour, his average speed was about 57 mph.

For example, if Ben drives 40 mph for 2 hours, and 60 mph for another 2 hours, what is his average speed for the entire trip?


, The formula is s=a+b2{\displaystyle s={\frac {a+b}{2}}}, where s{\displaystyle s} equals the average speed, a{\displaystyle a} equals the speed for the first half of the time, and b{\displaystyle b} equals the speed for the second half of the time.In these types of problems, It doesn’t matter for how long each speed is driven, as long as each speed is used for half the total duration of time.

You can modify the formula if you are given three or more speeds for the same amount of time. For example, s=a+b+c3{\displaystyle s={\frac {a+b+c}{3}}} or s=a+b+c+d4{\displaystyle s={\frac {a+b+c+d}{4}}}. As long as the speeds were used for the same amount of time, your formula can follow this pattern.

Understand that displacement can be a negative value, unlike distance.,
Realize that sometimes distance and displacement values can be the same.",How to Calculate Displacement," Though distance is different than displacement, resultant displacement problems will specify how many ""feet"" or how many ""meters"" an object has traveled. You will use these units of measurement to calculate displacement, or how far out of position the object is based on its original point.


The resultant displacement formula is written as: S = √x²+y². ""S"" stands for displacement. X is the first direction that the object is traveling and Y is the second direction that the object is traveling.If your object only travels in one direction, then Y = 0.
An object can only travel in two directions maximum, since moving along the north/south or east/west axes will be considered neutral movement.;
, Use a ruler to make straight lines from point to point.


Also remember to connect your starting point to your end point using a straight line. This is the displacement we will be calculating.
For example, if an object travels east 300 feet and north 400 feet, it will form a right triangle. AB will form the first leg of the triangle and BC will form the second leg. AC will form the hypotenuse of the triangle, and its value will be the amount of the object's displacement. In this example, the two directions are ""east"" and ""north.""

, Now that you know the two directions your object is traveling in, input the values into their respective variables.


For example, x = 300 and y = 400. Your formula should look like this: S = √300² + 400².

, Square 300 and 400 first, then add them, and then find the square root of that sum.


For example: S = √90000 + 160000. S = √250000. S = 500. You now know that displacement is equal to 500 feet.

, Some math problems will not specify values of distance, but will tell you how long an object was moving and how fast it was moving. You can calculate displacement using these time and speed values.


In this case, the formula would be: S = 1/2(u + v)t. U = the object's initial velocity, or how fast it started going in a certain direction. V = the object's final velocity, or how fast it was going at its last location. T = the time the object took to get there.
For example: A car is traveling down the road for 45 seconds (time taken). The car turned west at 20 m/s (initial velocity) and by the end of the street, it was traveling at 23 m/s (final velocity).Calculate the displacement based on these factors.

, Now that you know how long the car drove for, how fast it moved in the beginning, and how fast it was moving in the end, you can find the distance from the initial location to the final location.


Your formula will look like this: S = 1/2(20 + 23)45.

, Remember to follow the order of operations, otherwise displacement will turn out to be a completely different value.


For this formula, it's okay if you accidentally switch initial and final velocity. Since you will be adding these numbers first, it doesn't matter where they are in the parentheses. For other formulas, however, switching initial with final velocity will give you a different displacement value.
Your formula will look like this: S = 1/2(43)45. First divide 43 by 2, which will give you 21.5 Then multiply 21.5 by 45, which should give you 967.5 meters. 967.5 is your displacement value, or how far your car is from its original spot.

, Some problems will only tell you how fast an object was moving in the beginning, how fast it began to accelerate, and how long the object traveled for. You will need the following formula.


The formula for this problem is as follows: S = ut + 1/2at². ""U"" still represents initial velocity; ""A"" is the object's acceleration, or how fast its velocity begins to change. ""T"" can either mean the total time taken, or it can be a certain amount of time an object accelerated for. Either way, it will be identified by units of time such as seconds, hours, etc.
Say a car traveling at 25 m/s (initial velocity) begins accelerating at 3 m/s2 (acceleration) for 4 seconds (time). What is the displacement of the car after 4 seconds?, Unlike the previous formula, only initial velocity is represented here, so be sure you input the correct data.


Based on the example data above, your formula should look like this: S = 25(4) + 1/2(3)4². It will help if you add parentheses around your acceleration and time values to help you keep the numbers separate.

, A quick way to help you remember the order of operations is the mnemonic ""Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally."" This represents the correct order of parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.


Let's revisit the formula: S = 25(4) + 1/2(3)4². First, square 4, which gives you 16. Then multiply 16 by 3, which gives you 48; also multiply 25 by 4, giving you 100. Divide 48 by 2, which is 24. Your equation should now look like this: S = 100 + 24. Once you add the two values together, displacement will equal 124 meters., Though you will still be calculating displacement using a straight line, you will need to find the difference between an object's initial and final location when it moves in an arc.


Think of a girl sitting on a merry-go-round. As she spins along the outside of the ride, she will travel in a curved path. Angular displacement seeks to measure the shortest distance between the initial location and final location when an object isn't moving in a straight line.
The formula for angular displacement is: θ = S/r, where ""S"" stands for linear displacement, ""r"" stands for radius, and ""θ"" represents angular displacement. Linear displacement is how far an object travels along an arc. Radius is the distance an object is from the center of a circle. Angular displacement is the value we are looking for.

, Remember that radius is the distance from the center of a circle; some problems may give you the circle's diameter, in which case you will need to divide it by 2 to find the radius.


Here is a sample problem: A girl rides a merry-go-round. Her seat is at a distance of 1 meter from the center (radius). If the girl moves along an arc length of 1.5 meters (linear displacement), what is her angular displacement?
Your equation should look like this: θ = 1.5/1.

, This will give you the angular displacement of the object.


After dividing 1.5 by 1, you are left with 1.5. The angular displacement of the girl is 1.5 radians.

Since angular displacement calculates how much an object has rotated from its original position, it will need to be measured as an angle, not a distance. Radians are units used to measure angles., Distance refers to how far an object has traveled in total.


Distance is what is known as a ""scalar quantity."" It refers to how much ground an object has covered without considering the direction the object is traveling.For example, if you walk 2 feet east, 2 feet south, 2 feet west, and then 2 feet north, you will be back in your original position. Though you will have traveled a total distance of 10 feet, you will have been displaced 0 feet because your final location is the same as your original location (your path resembles that of a box)., Displacement is not a total sum of motion like distance; it focuses on the area between your initial location and final location.


Displacement is called a ""vector quantity"" and refers to an object's change in position with regards to the direction an object is moving.
Say you head east for 5 feet. If you go back west 5 feet, you will be traveling in the opposite direction of your original location. Even though you will have walked 10 feet total, you won't have changed your position; your displacement then is 0 feet.

, Going in the opposite direction cancels out the displacement of an object.


Picture a football coach pacing back and forth along the sidelines.As he yells things at his players, he will have moved from left to right multiple times. If you watch him the entire time he is moving from left to right, you are observing the total distance he is traveling. But, say the coach stops to talk to the quarterback on the sidelines. If he is in a spot that is different than before he started pacing, you are looking at the coach's displacement.,


A curved path will lead you from your initial location to your final location, but it is not the shortest path. To help you visualize this, imagine you are walking in a straight line and encounter a pillar. You can't walk through this pillar, so you walk around it. Though you will end up in the same position as if you walked through the pillar, you will have needed to take extra steps to get to your destination.
Though displacement prefers a straight line, know that you can measure the displacement of an object that is traveling in a curved path. This is called ""angular displacement,"" and it can be calculated by finding the straightest path that leads from initial location to final location., If your final location is arrived at by moving in a direction opposite than when you started, you will be displaced negatively.


For example, say you walked 5 feet east and then 3 feet west. Though technically you are still 2 feet from your original location, your displacement would be -2 because you are moving in the opposite direction. Your distance will always be a positive value because you can't ""un-travel"" amount of feet, miles, etc.
Negative displacement does not mean that the displacement is getting decreased. It simply means that the displacement is taking an opposite direction.

, If you walk straight for 25 feet and stop, the amount of ground covered will be the same as how far you are from your original location.


This only applies to when you travel to one location from your initial location in a straight line.For example, say you live in San Francisco, California and land a new job in Las Vegas, Nevada. You need to move out to Las Vegas in order to be closer to your job. If you take a plane that flies straight from San Francisco to Las Vegas, you will have traveled 417 miles (671 km) and will be displaced 417 miles (671 km).
If you take a car from San Francisco to Las Vegas, however, you will be displaced 417 miles (671 km) but will have traveled 563 miles (906 km).Since driving usually involves changing directions (east on this highway, west on that highway), you will have traveled farther than the shortest distance between the two cities.

This has to do with how fast the object is traveling, but also in which direction. ""100 meters per second south"" is a different velocity than ""100 meters per second east.""


Quantities that include a direction are called vector quantities'.They can be distinguished from directionless or scalar quantities by writing an arrow over the variable. For example, v represents speed, while v→ represents velocity, or speed + direction.If a v is used in this article, it refers to velocity.
For scientific problems, you should use meters or another metric unit of distance, but for everyday life you can use whichever unit you're comfortable with.;
, The displacement is the object's change in position, or the distance and direction between its starting point and end point. It doesn't matter where the object moved in before reaching its final position; only the distance between the start point and end point matters. For our first example, we'll use an object moving at a constant speed in one direction:


Let's say a rocket traveled north for 5 minutes at a constant rate of 120 meters per minute. To calculate its final position, use the formula s = vt, or use common sense to realize the rocket must be at (5 minutes)(120 meters/minute) = 600 meters north of its starting point.
For problems involving constant acceleration, you could solve for s = vt + ½at2, or refer to the other section for a shorter method of finding the answer.

, In our example problem, the rocket moved forward for 5 minutes. You can express average velocity in any units of time, but seconds are the international scientific standard. We'll convert to seconds in this example: (5 minutes) x (60 seconds/minute) = 300 seconds.


Even in a scientific problem, if the problem uses units of hours or longer periods of time, it may be easier to calculate the velocity, then convert the final answer to meters/second.

, If you know how far the object traveled, and how long it took to get there, you know how fast it was going. So for our example, the rocket's average velocity was (600 meters north) / (300 seconds) = 2 meters/second north.


Remember to include the direction (such as ""forward"" or ""north"").
In formula form, vav = Δs/Δt. The delta symbol Δ just means ""change in,"" so Δs/Δt means ""change in position over change in time.""
Average velocity can be written vav, or as a v with a horizontal line over it.

, If an object turns or changes speed, don't get confused. Average velocity is still calculated only from the total displacement, and the total time. It doesn't matter what happens in between the start point. Here are a few examples of journeys with the exact same displacement and time, and therefore the same average velocity:


Anna walks west at 1 m/s for 2 seconds, then instantly accelerates to 3 m/s and keeps walking west for 2 seconds. Her total displacement is (1 m/s west)(2 s) + (3 m/s west)(2 s) = 8 meters west. Her total time is 2s + 2s = 4s. Her average velocity is 8m west / 4s = 2 m/s west.

Bart walks west at 5 m/s for 3 seconds, then turns around and walks east at 7 m/s for 1 second. We can treat the eastward movement as ""negative movement west,"" so total displacement = (5 m/s west)(3 s) + (-7 m/s west)(1 s) = 8 meters. Total time = 4s. Average velocity = 8 m west / 4s = 2 m/s west.

Charlotte walks north 1 meter, then walks west 8 meters, then south 1 meter. It takes her 4 seconds total to walk this distance. Draw a diagram on a piece of paper, and you'll see that she ends up 8 meters west of her starting point, so this is her displacement. Total time is 4 seconds again, so the average velocity is still 8 m west / 4s = 2 m/s west.


, Let's say your problem is ""The bike begins traveling to the right at 5 m/s, constantly accelerating at 2 m/s2. If it travels for 5 seconds, what is its average velocity?""


If the unit ""m/s2"" makes no sense to you, write it as ""m/s/s"" or ""meters per second per second.""An acceleration of 2 m/s/s means the velocity increases by 2 meters per second, each second.

, Acceleration, written a, is the rate of change in velocity (or speed). The velocity is rising at a constant rate of increase. You can draw a table using the acceleration to find out the velocity at different moments during this journey. We'll need to do this for the final moment in the problem (at t = 5 seconds), but we'll write a longer table to help you grasp this concept:


At the beginning (time t = 0 seconds ), the bike is traveling right at 5 m/s.
After 1 second (t = 1), the bike moves at 5 m/s + at = 5 m/s + (2 m/s2)(1 s) = 7 m/s.
At t = 2, the bike is moving right at 5+(2)(2) = 9 m/s.
At t = 3, the bike is moving right at 5+(2)(3) = 11 m/s.
At t = 4, the bike is moving right at 5+(2)(4) = 13 m/s.
At t = 5, the bike is moving right at 5+(2)(5) = 15 m/s.

, If and only if the acceleration is constant, the average velocity is the same as the average of the final velocity and the initial velocity: (vf + vi)/2. For our example, the bike's initial velocity vi is 5 m/s. As we worked out above, it ends up traveling at a final velocity vf of 15 m/s. Plugging these numbers in, we get (15 m/s + 5 m/s) / 2 = (20 m/s) / 2 = 10 m/s right.


Remember to include the direction, in this case ""right.""
These terms can instead be written as v0 (velocity at time 0, or initial velocity), and simply v (final velocity).

, To find the average velocity, we could take the velocity at every single moment and find the average of the entire list. (This is the definition of average.) Since that would require calculus or infinite time, let's build off of this for a more intuitive explanation instead. Instead of every moment in time, let's take the average of the velocity at just two points in time and see what we get. One point in time will be near the beginning of the journey, when the bike is traveling slow, and the other will be equally close to the end of the journey, when the bike is traveling fast.

, Use the table above for the velocities at different points in time. Some of the pairs that fit out criteria are at (t=0, t=5), (t=1, t=4), or (t=2, t=3). You can test this with non-integer values of t as well, if you like.


No matter which pair of points we choose, the average of the two velocities at those times will always be the same. For example, ((5+15)/2), ((7+13)/2), or ((9+11)/2) all equal 10 m/s right.

, If we used this method with a list of every moment in time (somehow), we would keep averaging one velocity from the first half with one velocity from the second half of the journey. There's an equal amount of time in each half, so no velocities would be unaccounted for after we were finished.


Since any one of these pairs average to the same amount, the average of all these velocities will be equal to this amount. In our example, the average of all of those ""10 m/s right"" will still be 10 m/s right.
We can find this amount by averaging any one of these pairs, for instance the initial and final velocities. In our example, those are at t=0 and t=5, and can be calculated using the formula above: (5+15)/2 = 10 m/s right.

, If you're more comfortable with a proof written as formulas, you can start with the formula for distance traveled assuming constant acceleration, and derive this formula from there:s = vit + ½at2. (Technically Δs and Δt, or change in position and change in time, but you'll be understood if you use s and t.)
Average velocity vav is defined as s/t, so let's put the formula in terms of s/t.
vav = s/t = vi + ½at
Acceleration x time equals the total change in velocity, or vf - vi. So we can replace ""at"" in the formula and get:
vav = vi + ½(vf - vi).
Simplify: vav = vi + ½vf - ½vi = ½vi + ½vf = (vf + vi)/2.

Determine the mass and radius of the planet you are on.,
Substitute values into the equation.,
Evaluate.",How to Calculate Escape Velocity," Escape velocity is the velocity of an object required to overcome the gravitational pull of the planet that object is on to escape into space.A larger planet has more mass and requires a much greater escape velocity than a smaller planet with less mass., Conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains unchanged. In the derivation below, we will work with an Earth-rocket system and assume that this system is isolated.

In conservation of energy, we equate the initial and final potential and kinetic energies K1+U1=K2+U2,{\displaystyle K_{1}+U_{1}=K_{2}+U_{2},} where K{\displaystyle K} is kinetic energy and U{\displaystyle U} is potential energy.


, 

Kinetic energy is energy of motion, and is equal to 12mv2,{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2},} where m{\displaystyle m} is the mass of the rocket and v{\displaystyle v} is its velocity. 

Potential energy is energy that results from where an object is relative to the bodies in the system. In physics, we typically define the potential energy to be 0 at an infinite distance from Earth. Since the gravitational force is attractive, the potential energy of the rocket will always be negative (and smaller the closer it is to Earth). Potential energy in the Earth-rocket system is thus written as −GMmr,{\displaystyle -{\frac {GMm}{r}},} where G{\displaystyle G} is Newton's gravitational constant, M{\displaystyle M} is the mass of Earth, and r{\displaystyle r} is the distance between the two masses' centers.


, When the rocket achieves the minimum velocity required to escape Earth, it will eventually stop at an infinite distance from Earth, so K2=0.{\displaystyle K_{2}=0.} Then, the rocket will not feel Earth's gravitational pull and will never fall back to Earth, so U2=0{\displaystyle U_{2}=0} as well. 


12mv2−GMmr=0{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}-{\frac {GMm}{r}}=0}


,

Note that the escape velocity is independent of the mass of the rocket m.{\displaystyle m.} The mass is reflected in both the potential energy provided by Earth's gravity as well as the kinetic energy provided by the movement of the rocket.


, 


v=2GMr{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\frac {2GM}{r}}}}

The equation assumes the planet you are on is spherical and has constant density.In the real world, the escape velocity depends on where you are at on the surface because a planet bulges at the equator due to its rotation and has slightly varying density due to its composition.


, 


G=6.67×10−11 N m2 kg−2{\displaystyle G=6.67\times 10^{-11}{\rm {\ N\ m^{2}\ kg^{-2}}}} is Newton’s gravitational constant. The value of this constant reflects the fact that gravity is an incredibly weak force. It was determined experimentally by Henry Cavendish in 1798,but has proven to be notoriously difficult to measure precisely.


G{\displaystyle G} can be written using only base units as 6.67×10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2,{\displaystyle 6.67\times 10^{-11}{\rm {\ m^{3}\ kg^{-1}\ s^{-2}}},} since 1 N=1 kg m s−2.{\displaystyle 1{\rm {\ N}}=1{\rm {\ kg\ m\ s^{-2}}}.}Mass M{\displaystyle M} and radius r{\displaystyle r} are dependent upon the planet you wish to escape from.


You must convert to SI units. That is, mass is in kilograms (kg) and distance is in meters (m). If you find values that are in different units, such as miles, convert them to SI.


, For Earth, assuming that you are at sea level, r=6.38×106 m{\displaystyle r=6.38\times 10^{6}{\rm {\ m}}} and M=5.98×1024 kg.{\displaystyle M=5.98\times 10^{24}{\rm {\ kg}}.}Search online for a table of masses and radii for other planets or moons. 


, Now that you have the necessary information, you can start solving the equation. 


v=2(6.67×10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2)(5.98×1024 kg)(6.38×106 m){\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\frac {2(6.67\times 10^{-11}{\rm {\ m^{3}\ kg^{-1}\ s^{-2}}})(5.98\times 10^{24}{\rm {\ kg}})}{(6.38\times 10^{6}{\rm {\ m}})}}}}


, Remember to evaluate your units at the same time and cancel them out as needed to obtain a dimensionally consistent solution.


v=2(6.67)(5.98)(6.38)×107 m2 s−2≈11200 m s−1=11.2 km s−1{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}v&={\sqrt {{\frac {2(6.67)(5.98)}{(6.38)}}\times 10^{7}{\rm {\ m^{2}\ s^{-2}}}}}\\&\approx 11200{\rm {\ m\ s^{-1}}}\\&=11.2{\rm {\ km\ s^{-1}}}\end{aligned}}}

Define the equation for average acceleration.,
Understand the variables.,
Use the formula to find acceleration.",How to Calculate Acceleration1," You can calculate the average acceleration of an object over a period of time based on its velocity (its speed traveling in a specific direction), before and after that time. To do this you need to know equation for acceleration: a = Δv / Δt where a is acceleration, Δv is the change in velocity, and Δt is the amount of time it took for that change to occur.The unit for acceleration is meters per second per second or m/s2.
Acceleration is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction.The magnitude is the total amount of acceleration whereas the direction is the way in which the object is moving. If it is slowing down the acceleration will be negative.;
, You can further define Δv and Δt: Δv = vf - vi and Δt = tf - ti where vf is the final velocity, vi is the initial velocity, tf is the ending time, and ti is the starting time.Because acceleration has a direction, it is important to always subtract the initial velocity from the final velocity. If you reverse them, the direction of your acceleration will be incorrect.
Unless otherwise stated in the problem, the starting time is usually 0 seconds.

, First write down your equation and all of the given variables. The equation is a = Δv / Δt = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti). Subtract the initial velocity from the final velocity, then divide the result by the time interval. The final result is your average acceleration over that time.


If the final velocity is less than the initial velocity, acceleration will turn out to be a negative quantity or the rate at which an object slows down.
Example 1: A race car accelerates uniformly from 18.5 m/s to 46.1 m/s in 2.47 seconds. What is its average acceleration?

Write the equation: a = Δv / Δt = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti)

Define the variables: vf = 46.1 m/s, vi = 18.5 m/s, tf = 2.47 s, ti = 0 s.
Solve: a = (46.1 – 18.5)/2.47 = 11.17 meters/second2.


Example 2: A biker traveling at 22.4 m/s comes to halt in 2.55 s after applying brakes. Find his deceleration.

Write the equation: a = Δv / Δt = (vf - vi)/(tf - ti)

Define the variables: vf = 0 m/s, vi = 22.4 m/s, tf = 2.55 s, ti = 0 s.
Solve: a = (0 – 22.4)/2.55 = -8.78 meters/second2.

Determine the function for angular position.,
Find the function for angular velocity.,
Find the function for angular acceleration.,
Apply the data to find instantaneous acceleration.",How to Calculate Angular Acceleration1," In some cases, you may be provided with a function or formula that predicts or assigns the position of an object with respect to time. In other cases, you may derive the function from repeated experiments or observations. For this article, we assume that the function has been provided or previously calculated.For the example illustrated above, studies have led to the function θ(t)=2t3{\displaystyle \theta (t)=2t^{3}}, where θ(t){\displaystyle \theta (t)} is the angular measure of the position of the rotation at a given time, and t{\displaystyle t} represents the time.
;
, Velocity is the measure of how fast an object changes its position. In layman’s terms, we think of this as its speed. In mathematical terms, the change of position over time can be found by finding the derivative of the position function. The symbol for angular velocity is ω{\displaystyle \omega }. Angular velocity is generally measured in units of radians divided by time (radians per minute, radians per second, etc.).In this example, find the first derivative of the position function θ(t)=2t3{\displaystyle \theta (t)=2t^{3}}:


ω(t)=dθdt=6t2{\displaystyle \omega (t)={\frac {d\theta }{dt}}=6t^{2}}



If desired, this function could be used to calculate the angular velocity of the spinning object at any desired time t{\displaystyle t}. For this particular calculation, the angular velocity function is just an intermediate step toward finding angular acceleration.


, Acceleration is the measure of how fast an object’s velocity is changing over time. You can mathematically calculate the angular acceleration by finding the derivative of the function for angular velocity. Angular acceleration is generally symbolized with α{\displaystyle \alpha }, the Greek letter alpha. Angular acceleration is reported in units of velocity per time, or generally radians divided by time squared (radians per second squared, radians per minute squared, etc.).In the previous step, you used the function for position to find the angular velocity ω(t)=6t2{\displaystyle \omega (t)=6t^{2}}. Now find the acceleration function as the derivative of ω{\displaystyle \omega }:


α=dωdt=12t{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {d\omega }{dt}}=12t}.




, Once you have derived the function for instantaneous acceleration as the derivative of velocity, which in turn is the derivative of position, you are ready to calculate the instantaneous angular acceleration of the object at any chosen time.For the sample problem in the illustration, suppose you know that the function for the position of the spinning object is θ(t)=2t3{\displaystyle \theta (t)=2t^{3}}, and you are asked for the object’s angular acceleration after it has been spinning for 6.5 seconds. Use the derived formula for α{\displaystyle \alpha } and insert the information as follows:


α=dωdt=12t{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {d\omega }{dt}}=12t}


α=(12)(6.5){\displaystyle \alpha =(12)(6.5)}


α=78.0{\displaystyle \alpha =78.0}



Your result should be reported in units of radians per second squared. Thus, the angular acceleration for this spinning object when it has been spinning for 6.5 seconds is 78.0 radians per second squared.

Define Newton’s Second Law of Motion.,
Find the mass of your object.,
Calculate the net force acting on your object.,
Rearrange the equation F = ma to solve for acceleration.,
Use the formula to solve for acceleration.",How to Calculate Acceleration2," Newton’s second law of motion states that when the forces acting on an object are unbalanced, the object will accelerate. This acceleration is dependent upon the net forces that act upon the object and the object’s mass.Using this law, acceleration can be calculated when a known force is acting on an object of known mass.


Newton’s law can be represented by the equation Fnet = m x a, where Fnet is the total force acting on the object, m is the object’s mass, and a is the acceleration of the object.
When using this equation, keep your units in the metric system. Use kilograms (kg) for mass, newtons (N) for force, and meters per second squared (m/s2) for acceleration.

, To find the mass of an object, simply place it on a balance or scale and find its mass in grams. If you have a very large object, you may need to find a reference that can provide you with the mass. Larger objects will likely have a mass with the unit of kilograms (kg).


For this equation, you will want to convert the mass into kilograms. If the mass you have is in grams simply divide that mass by 1000 to convert to kilograms.

, A net force is an unbalanced force. If you have two forces opposing each other and one is larger than the other, you will have a net force in the direction of the larger force.Acceleration happens when an unbalanced force acts on an object, causing it to change speeds towards the direction the force is pushing or pulling it.


For example: Let’s say you and your big brother are playing tug-of-war. You pull the rope to the left with a force of 5 newtons while your brother pulls the rope in the opposite direction with a force of 7 newtons. The net force on the rope is 2 newtons to the right, in the direction of your brother.
In order to properly understand the units, know that 1 newton (N) is equal to 1 kilogram X meter/second squared (kg X m/s2)., You can change this formula around to solve for acceleration by dividing both sides by the mass, so: a = F/m. To find the acceleration, simply divide the force by the mass of the object being accelerated.


Force is directly proportional to the acceleration, meaning that a greater force will lead to a greater acceleration.
Mass is inversely proportional to acceleration, meaning that with a greater mass, the acceleration will decrease.

, Acceleration is equal to the net force acting on an object divided by the mass of the object. Once you’ve established the values for your variables, do the simple division to find the acceleration of the object.


For example: A 10 Newton force acts uniformly on a mass of 2 kilograms. What is the object’s acceleration?
a = F/m = 10/2 = 5 m/s2

Direction of Acceleration.,
Direction of Force.,
Net Force.",How to Calculate Acceleration3," The physics concept of acceleration doesn't always match how we would use the term in everyday life. Every acceleration has a direction, usually represented as positive if it's UP or RIGHT, and negative if DOWN or LEFT. See if your answer makes sense based on this breakdown:



Behavior of a Car
How is Velocity Changing?
Direction of Acceleration


Driver moving right (+) hits gas pedal
+ → ++ (more positive)
positive


Driver moving right (+) hits brakes
++ → + (less positive)
negative


Driver moving left (-) hits gas pedal
- → -- (more negative)
negative


Driver moving left (-) hits brakes
-- → - (less negative)
positive


Driver moves at constant velocity
remains the same
acceleration is zero



, Remember, a force only causes acceleration in the direction of the force. Some problems may try to trick you with irrelevant values.


Example Problem: A toy boat with mass 10kg is accelerating north at 2 m/s2. A wind blowing due west exerts a force of 100 Newtons on the boat. What is the boat's new northward acceleration?
Solution: Because the force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, it does not have an effect on motion in that direction. The boat continues to accelerate north at 2 m/s2.

, If more than one force acts on an object, combine them into a net force before you calculate acceleration. For a problem in two dimensions, this looks something like this:


Example Problem: April is pulling a 400 kg container right with a force of 150 newtons. Bob stand on the left of the container and pushes with a force of 200 newtons. A wind blowing left exerts a force of 10 newtons. What is the acceleration of the container?
Solution: This problem uses tricky language to try and catch you. Draw a diagram and you'll see the forces are 150 newtons right, 200 newtons right, and 10 newtons left. If ""right"" is the positive direction, the net force is 150 + 200 - 10 = 340 newtons. Acceleration = F / m = 340 newtons / 400 kg = 0.85 m/s2.

Measure initial angular velocity.,
Measure final angular velocity.,
Measure the elapsed time.,
Calculate the average angular acceleration.",How to Calculate Angular Acceleration2," The first method for calculating angular acceleration (α{\displaystyle \alpha }) is to divide the change in angular velocity (ω{\displaystyle \omega }) over some period of time by the amount of time that is measured. The formula for this can be written as follows:α=ΔωΔt=final velocity-initial velocityelapsed time{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\text{final velocity-initial velocity}}{\text{elapsed time}}}}

Consider a compact disc at the moment you place it in the CD player. Its initial velocity is zero.

As an alternative example, suppose you know from test measurements that the wheels of a roller coaster spin at a velocity of 400 revolutions per second, which is equivalent to 2513 radians per second. To measure negative acceleration over a braking distance, you can use this measurement as the initial velocity.


, The second piece of information that you need is the angular velocity of the spinning or rotating object at the end of the time period that you want to measure. This is to be called the “final” velocity.A compact disc plays in the machine by rotating at an angular velocity of 160 radians per second. 

The roller coaster, after applying its brakes to the spinning wheels, ultimately reaches an angular velocity of zero when it stops. This will be its final angular velocity.


, To calculate the average angular velocity of the spinning or rotating object, you need to know the amount of time that passes during your observation. This can be found by direct observation and measurement, or the information can be provided for a given problem.The owner’s manual for the CD player provides the information that the CD reaches its playing speed in 4.0 seconds.

From observations of roller coasters being tested, it has been found that they can come to a complete stop within 2.2 seconds from when the brakes are initially applied.


, If you know the initial angular velocity, the final angular velocity, and the elapsed time, fill that data into the equation and find the average angular acceleration.For the example of the CD player, the calculation is as follows:


α=ΔωΔt=final velocity-initial velocityelapsed time{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\text{final velocity-initial velocity}}{\text{elapsed time}}}}


α=160−04.0{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {160-0}{4.0}}}


α=1604.0{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {160}{4.0}}}


α=40{\displaystyle \alpha =40} radians per second squared.



For the roller coaster example, the calculation looks like this:


α=ΔωΔt=final velocity-initial velocityelapsed time{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\text{final velocity-initial velocity}}{\text{elapsed time}}}}


α=0−25132.2{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {0-2513}{2.2}}}


α=−25132.2{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {-2513}{2.2}}}


α=−1142.3{\displaystyle \alpha =-1142.3} radians per second squared.



Note that acceleration is always going to be in units of some distance measurement “per” time squared. With angular acceleration, the distance is generally measured in radians, although you could convert that to number of rotations if you wish.

Understand the concept of angular motion.,
Visualize angular position.,
Measure angular motion in radians.,
Understand the concept of angular acceleration.",How to Calculate Angular Acceleration3," When people think of the speed of an object, they often consider linear motion - that is, objects traveling mostly in a straight line. This would include a car, a plane, a ball that is thrown or any number of other objects. However, angular motion describes objects that spin or rotate. Think of the earth spinning on its axis. The position or speed of the earth can be measured with angular quantities. A spinning compact disc (or record player, if you’re old enough), electrons on their axes, or the wheels of a car on the axle are other examples of rotating objects that can be measured through angular motion., When you measure the position of a moving vehicle, for example, you can measure the distance traveled in a straight line from the starting point. With a rotating object, the measurement is generally done in terms of the angle around a circle. By convention, the starting or “zero” point is generally a horizontal radius from the center to the right side of the circle. The distance traveled is measured by the size of the angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }, measured from that horizontal radius.The angle that is being measured is commonly represented by θ{\displaystyle \theta }, the Greek letter theta.

Positive motion is measured in a counterclockwise direction. Negative motion is measured in a clockwise direction.


, Linear travel is generally measured in some unit of distance, such as miles, meters, inches or some other unit of length. Rotational or angular motion is generally measured in units called radian. A radian is a fraction of the circle. For standard reference, mathematicians use the “unit circle,” which has a standard radius of 1 unit.One full rotation around the unit circle is said to measure 2π radians. Therefore, a half circle is π radians, and a quarter circle is π/2 radians.

Sometimes it is useful to convert from radians to degrees. If you recall that a full circle is 360 degrees, you can find the conversion as follows:


360 degrees=2π radians{\displaystyle 360\ {\text{degrees}}=2\pi \ {\text{radians}}}


3602π degrees=1 radian{\displaystyle {\frac {360}{2\pi }}\ {\text{degrees}}=1\ {\text{radian}}}


57.3 degrees=1 radian{\displaystyle 57.3\ {\text{degrees}}=1\ {\text{radian}}}



Thus, one radian is about equal to 57.3 degrees.


, Angular acceleration is the measurement of how fast or slow a rotating object is changing its velocity. In other words, is the spinning speeding up or slowing down? If you know the angular velocity at a starting time and then at a later ending time, you can calculate the average angular acceleration over that time interval. If you know the function for the object’s position, you can use calculus to derive the instantaneous angular acceleration at any chosen time.People often use the word “acceleration” to mean speeding up, and “deceleration” to mean slowing down. In mathematical and physical terms, however, only the word “acceleration” is used. If the object is speeding up, the acceleration is positive. If it is slowing down, the acceleration is negative.

Keep in mind that objects don't always move in line with the force being applied to them — for instance, if you pull a small wagon by its handle, you're applying a diagonal force (assuming you're taller than the wagon) to move it forward. In this section, however, we'll deal with situations in which the force and the object's displacement do have the same direction. For information on how to find the work when these things don't have the same direction, see below.


To make this process easy to understand, let's follow along with an example problem. Say that a toy train car is being pulled directly forward by the train in front of it. In this case, both the force vector and the direction of the train's motion point the same way — forward. In the next few steps, we'll use this information to help find the work done on the object.;
, The first variable we need for the work formula, D, or displacement, is usually easy to find. Displacement is simply the distance that the force has caused the object to move from its starting position. In academic problems, this information is usually either given to or is possible to deduce from other information in the problem. In the real world, all you have to do to find displacement is measure the distance the object travels.


Note that measures of distance must be in meters for the work formula.
In our toy train example, let's say that we're finding the work performed on the train as it travels along the track. If it starts at a certain point and ends at a spot about 2 meters (6.6 ft) up the track, we can use 2 meters (6.6 ft) for our ""D"" value in the formula.

, Next, find the magnitude of the force being used to move the object. This is a measure of the ""strength"" of the force — the bigger its magnitude, the harder it pushes the object and the quicker it accelerates.If the force's magnitude isn't provided, it can be derived from the mass and acceleration of the moving (assuming that there aren't other conflicting forces acting on it) with the formula F = M × A.Note that measures of force must be in newtons for the work formula.
In our example, let's say that we don't know the magnitude of the force. However, let's say that we do know that the toy train has a mass of 0.5 kilograms and that the force is causing it to accelerate at a rate of 0.7 meters/second2. In this case, we can find the magnitude by multiplying M × A = 0.5 × 0.7 = 0.35 Newtons.

, Once you know the magnitude of the force acting on your object and the distance it's been moved, the rest is easy. Simply multiply these two values by each other to get your value for work.


It's time to solve our example problem. With a value for force of 0.35 Newtons and a value for displacement of 2 meters (6.6 ft), our answer is a single multiplication problem away: 0.35 × 2 = 0.7 joules.
You may have noticed that, in the formula provided in the intro, there's an additional piece to the formula: Cosine(θ). As discussed above, in this example, the force and the direction of motion are in the same direction. This means the angle between them is 0o. Since Cosine(0) = 1, we don't need to include it — we're just multiplying by 1.

, In physics, values for work (and several other quantities) are almost always given in a unit of measurement called joules. One joule is defined as one newton of force exerted over one meter, or, in other words, one newton × meter.This makes sense — since you’re multiplying distance times force, it's logical that the answer that you get would have a unit of measurement equal to multiplying the units of your force and distance quantities.


Note that joules also has an alternate definition — one watt of power radiated over one second.See below for a more detailed discussion of power and its relationship to work.

, Above, we dealt with work problems in which the object is moving in the same direction as the force being applied to it. In reality, this isn't always the case. In cases where the force and the object's motion are in two different directions, the difference between these two directions must also be factored into the equation for an accurate result. To begin, find the magnitude of the force and the object's displacement as you normally would.


Let's look at another example problem. In this case, let's say that we're pulling a toy train forward as in the example problem above, but that this time we're actually pulling upward at a diagonal angle. In the next step, we'll take this into account, but for now, we'll stick to the basics: the train's displacement and the magnitude of the force acting on it. For our purposes, let's say that the force has a magnitude of 10 newtons and that it's moved the same 2 meters (6.6 ft) forward as before.

, Unlike in the examples above, with a force that's in a different direction than the object's motion, it's necessary to find the difference between these two directions in the form of the angle between them. If this information isn't provided to you, you may need to measure it yourself or deduce it from other information in the problem.


In our example problem, let's say that the force is being applied about 60o above the horizontal. If the train is still moving directly forward (that is, horizontally), the angle between the force vector and the train's motion is 60o.

, Once you know the object's displacement, the magnitude of the force acting on it, and the angle between the force vector and its motion, solving is almost as easy as it is without having to take the angle into account. Simply take the cosine of the angle (this may require a scientific calculator) and multiply it by force and displacement to find your answer in joules.


Let's solve our example problem. Using a calculator, we find that the cosine of 60o is 1/2. Plugging this into the formula, we can solve as follows: 10 newtons × 2 meters (6.6 ft) × 1/2 = 10 joules.

, The work formula provided above isn't just useful for finding work — it's also valuable for finding any of the variables in the equation when you already know your value for work. In these cases, simply isolate the variable you're looking for and solve according to basic algebra rules.


For example, let's say that we know that our train is being pulled with 20 newtons of force at a diagonal angle over 5 meters (16.4 ft) of track to perform 86.6 joules of work. However, we don't know the angle of the force vector. To solve for the angle, we'll just isolate that variable and solve as follows:



86.6 = 20 × 5 × Cosine(θ)
86.6/100 = Cosine(θ)
Arccos(0.866) = θ = 30o






, In physics, work is closely related to another type of measurement called ""power"". Power is simply a way of quantifying the rate at which work is spent in a certain system over time. Thus, to find power, all you need to do is divide the work used to displace an object by the time it takes to complete the displacement. Power measurements are labeled with the unit watts (which are equal to joules per second).For instance, for the example problem in the step above, let's say that it took 12 seconds for the train to move 5 meters (16.4 ft). In this case, all we need to do is divide the work done to move it 5 meters (86.6 joules) by 12 seconds to find our answer for power: 86.6/12 = '7.22 watts.

, Work can also be used to find the energy held within a system. In the formula above, TMEi = the initial total mechanical energy within the system, TMEf = the final total mechanical energy within the system, and Wnc = the work performed on the system due to non-conservative forces.. In this formula, if the force pushes with the direction of motion, it's positive, and if it pushes against it, it's negative. Note that both energy variables can be found with the formula (½)mv2 where m = mass and v = volume.


For instance, for the example problem in the two steps above, let's say that the train initially had a total mechanical energy of 100 joules. Since the force in the problem is pulling the train in the direction that it's already traveling, it's positive. In this case, the train's final energy is TMEi + Wnc = 100 + 86.6 = 186.6 joules.
Note that non-conservative forces are forces whose power to affect an object's acceleration depends on the path taken by the object. Friction is a good example — an object pushed over a short, direct path will feel the effects of friction for a short while, while an object pushed over a long, meandering path to the same ending location will feel more friction overall.

Time how long it takes you to run up the stairs.,
Use the formula (m*9.81*h)/t=HP to calculate your watts.,
Calculate your Horsepower.",How to Calculate Horsepower," Look under the “technical specs” section, or look for “torque” in the index of the owner’s manual, and it will give you the torque value. If you do not have the owner’s manual, try using a search engine to find your car’s torque. For instance, search “torque” and your car’s make, year, and model, and a helpful result should come up.;
, This can also be found in your owner’s manual. If your owner’s manual does not have this information or if you do not have the manual, type your car’s make, year, and model in a search engine followed by the words “engine speed.” An online resource should have this number.

, You will be using the formula (RPM * T) / 5252=HP, where RPM is the engine speed, T is the torque, and 5,252 is radians per second. The first calculation you want to do is multiply the torque and the engine speed.


For example, a Porsche generates 480 of torque at 2,500RPM. Expressed in terms of the equation, that is (2500 * 480), which equals 1,200,000.

, The result is your car’s horsepower. In the Porsche example, 1,200,000/5252 = 228.48, so the Porsche has 228 horsepower.

, The motor should have these units of measurement written on it.

, Multiply the voltage, the current, and the efficiency, then divide the result by 746. For example, the horsepower of a 230v motor pulling 4 amps and having 82% efficiency would equal 1 horsepower.



Convert the efficiency into a decimal before calculating. For example, a 82% efficiency would equal .82.

, Find out how much you weigh in pounds. Write your weight down. If your scale uses kilograms, multiply this number by 2.2 to find your weight in pounds.

, You’ll be running up these stairs with a stopwatch, so try to find a stairway that is not frequently used.

, Multiply these two numbers, and you will have the total height of the stairs. Write down the height.


If your ruler uses meters, multiply the height by 3.28 to convert the measurement into feet., Get a running start, and when your foot lands on the first step, start your stopwatch. When both feet are on the top step, stop your stopwatch. Write down the duration of your climb to the top in seconds. Remember, there are 60 seconds in every minute.

, In this instance, m = your weight, h = the height of staircase, 9.81 is the gravitational constant that must be taken into account, and t = time (in seconds) of your climb. The resulting number you get is expressed in watts.


For example, if you weigh 180 lbs, and climb a 12-foot staircase in 4 seconds, that equals ((180 * .454) * 9.81 * (12 * .3048)) / 4 = 733 watts.

, Divide the number of Watts by 746 to find out your horsepower rating. This result is usually between 1-2 horsepower.

Search for averages on Wikipedia; the site lists average temperatures in the “Climate” section on most pages for countries, states, and provinces. You might also Google the weather in a given city. For example, you can search “average temperature in Chicago in April” to get results that will be helpful for choosing what to pack. Check the specific forecast for each of the seven days that you’ll be gone. Many websites, like weather.com or AccuWeather, provide forecasts for anywhere in the world.Even though weather predictions are not always accurate, this is a good way to get a sense of what to expect.
Reach out. If you are still unsure about what kind of weather to expect and thus what kind of clothing to pack, reach out to a friend, family member, or colleague who has visited your destination for pointers. Additionally, many major cities have travel or tourism bureaus. Call or email one of these agencies to speak directly with a local and get their advice and pointers on what to expect and what kind of clothing to pack.;
, If you can, wash your clothes during your trip (even if it's just a quick sink-wash and hanging the clothes out to dry) so that you have to pack even fewer items. If you won’t have access to laundry while you’re gone, you should plan to bring a change of clothes for each day of the week.

, Some hotels, for example, will provide complimentary toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, and soap. Others will even provide a toothbrush and toothpaste. If so, that is at least a couple of items less that you have to worry about packing in your suitcase!

, Depending on your destination of choice, you may have to pack certain precautionary items or align your packing with the cultural sensitivities and traditions of your destination.


Learn whether certain diseases are common in your destination. Consider, for example, malaria. If your destination has malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, you are at a significant risk of getting the disease, so take the necessary precautions. These may range from insect repellent to malaria prevention medicines. You can learn more about malaria and whether it is a concern in your destination by visiting the CDC website., This is especially useful if you are traveling abroad. Take into account security considerations, such as whether it is generally safe for somebody of your nationality to travel to your destination of choice at this time. If you currently live in the U.S., the Department of State website is the go-to site for this information.Consider whether there will be any important local holidays while you are there. Knowing this ahead of time will allow you to better prepare and not be taken by surprise should there be any major closures, crowds, or events.

, If you are traveling abroad, it is important to know how to communicate basic information. For this, you can use an app like Duolingo or free online materials., Also bring a hat and use it to keep your face out of the sun.Don’t forget to bring a coat or jacket to wear at night when the temperature plummets, especially if you are traveling to a desert.

, Underneath, you can wear long sleeve shirts or thermals that you change each day. And don’t forget to pack warm socks!


Pack as lightly as you can. This includes packing lightweight clothes, if possible. Your baggage will be easier to carry and you will be able to fit more items in your suitcase.
Choose simple clothing items (e.g. solid colors plus a couple of standout pieces) so that you can easily mix and match them.This way you will have to pack fewer clothes.

, Planning on hiking? Don’t leave without a pair of sturdy boots. For the beach, you’ll want a pair of flip-flops. If you’re planning on attending a formal event or going to an upscale dinner, make sure to bring dressier shoes with you., Besides clothes, you’ll want to take a variety of other items with you. Start out by making a list of essential items that you use every day – things like your toothbrush and toothpaste, computer and cell phone chargers, deodorant, and hairbrush.Go over this list several times to make sure you’re not forgetting anything.

, If your travel plans include flying, you won’t be able to bring things like certain snacks or large bottles of liquids with you. Luckily, travel-sized versions of necessities such as toothpaste, lotion, shampoo, or conditioner are easy to find in local stores such as Walgreens or CVS. , If you’re traveling out of the country and plan to bring electronics with you, check to see what type of power adapter is used in your destination.Make sure to get your hands on the required adapter before you leave so you can plug everything in once you get there.

, Take these with you on your purse or carry-on luggage so that, if your bags are delayed or another such circumstance arises, you don't miss out on a dose.You may also want to bring a small amount of over-the-counter pain relievers and allergy medicine.

, If you don’t already have a suitcase, now’s the time to buy one. Ideally, your clothes and other items should all fit into a single suitcase.


If you’re traveling to a destination where the weather may be harsh or rainy, try to find a sturdy, weatherproof suitcase. That way you won’t have to worry about your clothes and electronics getting soaked.If you’re worried about the potential weight of your luggage, try to find a suitcase with spinner wheels. It’ll save you from straining your muscles getting from place to place. , There are a few tried-and-true packing methods, and the one you pick for a seven day trip comes down to your personal preferences.Keep your clothes from getting wrinkled by simply folding and stacking them, placing at the bottom the items you plan to use the least and at the top the ones you will use first or most.
Stay extra organized by folding your clothes and then grouping them into pre-planned outfits. That way you won’t have to spend time at your destination getting your outfits together and can instead use that time to enjoy your new surroundings.
Roll your clothes up into tight tubes and fit them snugly together if you’re tight on space. This method also reduces the amount of folds and wrinkles., If you’re traveling by plane, know that not all airlines are created equal: the weight and size limits vary per airline, so check the information online carefully to avoid incurring any undesired costs or paying hefty fees.Weigh your luggage before heading to the airport so you don’t overpack.

If you're taking a big road trip, it could be around 1 to 3 months. Reasons people go on these long trips include trying to find yourself, getting out of your comfort zone, having fun with your friends, or just traveling the USA before you can't. All are very good reasons.;
, Make a list of people who are eligible to you to come on the road trip. Ask those people about the trip once you're done. (Hint: it's easier to do this at least a year ahead of time so they have time to respond). However, there are things you will want to keep in mind:


Can you trust the people you want to come with? Furthermore, make sure you know these people and know them. It might not be good to invite strangers.
Will these people be able to contribute anything on the road trip?
Will they want to do anything? Chances are, you're going to be driving a long time, then walking around, visiting the sights to see. If they can't handle that, they might be dead weight on the trip.
Do these people have money they can contribute for gas, food, hotels, and things for themselves?
Will they be able to handle the time they'll be away from home?
Will they complain a lot like children when in the car for hours at a time? (To make sure this isn't an issue, see if they have experience being in a car for hours at a time.)
If they are underage, will they have permission from parents or guardian?

, Sometimes you go on a road trip without destinations. But if you like to plan things, list all the places in your country that you want to drive to. Do you want to go to Chicago? New York City? Las Vegas? Write down these places somewhere. You can even mark them on a map.

, You need to consider how long your trip is going to be, and if you really need to go to some places you write down. To do this, consider all the things you can do there. If there's tons of things to do and everyone wants to go, don't cut that place. However, if there's not much to do there, and nobody really wants to go, take it out of your road trip.


Almost every city you go to will have museums, art galleries, and gardens. Consider places with national memorials (like the 9/11 memorial in New York), natural phenomenon (Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, etc), or iconic monuments (Space Needle in Seattle).
Also consider the places your friends want to go, so they can be happy too.
Spend only 2 to 4 days at each destination, so you can keep the trip going and make it short as possible.

, Will you take someone's car? Will you pay for other transportation? Are you going to take a bus? Whatever you take, be sure it has enough room for everyone coming. Also keep in mind how much gas you'll be using.


If you take a car, make sure you have enough room for luggage and everyone coming. Figure out who's you're going to take as well.
If you pay for city buses or taxis, know where they are taking you and how much it will cost to ride. Although you might think you're saving money on gas, you might not be.
If you decide to buy a bus, consider remodeling in it and putting furniture in it. You can also put entertainment in it of some sort. A bus might be your best option, since they have lots of room ad people won't feel so cramped. You can even buy some with TVs, tables, passenger seats, and a back luggage area. You can also decorate the inside of the bus to make it pretty.

, Make sure you have enough money for hotels and motels, but there are other options.


Find campsites along the way. You can pull out sleeping bags and tents and sleep under the stars, or sleep in your vehicle. (There's more room in a bus to do that).
Find a Walmart parking lot to sleep in. They don't make you leave, and there's bathrooms and restaurants inside.
Find Hostels. People prefer these because they feel homier and cost less.
If you're still doing hotels, try to find a branch that has a point system. When you stay at their hotels long enough, you can earn enough points to earn a free night.

, It's bad to eat out all the way, because it's unhealthy and pricey. Instead, pack food or things to make food. This will keep everyone happy, and the trip shorter from not having to stop as much.

, If there's not going to be gas stations when you need them, then consider taking gas with you.


Make sure everyone chips in for gas.

, Take turns driving so you can sleep, socialize, etc. It's also unhealthy to drive the whole way without getting any rest.

, Get a job or two to raise money for you trip. Get others to do the same.


Try to raise $200-$300 for every destination. You may not need that much, but it's better to have too much than too little.

, If you're underage, get permission from your parents/guardians. If you have a job, get permission from your boss. If he/she says no, you may have to quit your job entirely. Make sure you're dedicated to this trip enough to do that.


To convince them, make sure you have enough money, know where you're going, and who's coming. This will make you seem more responsible.

, Be prepared.

, You may not have enough room to pack everything, but pack everything that you'll need.

, Have parents or others drop off your friends at whatever house has the mode of transportation. You can pack up the vehicle and leave the next morning.

, Things you can put in the backpack include:


Electronics
Books
Journals
Camera
Chargers
Brush (if you feel the need to brush your hair along the way or the morning of the trip)
Earbuds/headphones
Snacks for yourself.

, That way, you'll be able to snack anytime on the road.

,, You can put them on CDs, or make a playlist on an electronic. Get your friends to make them too.

, Make sure you didn't forget anything important! This can affect your road trip negatively.

, You'll be excited and it'll be hard to fall asleep, but you need to be well-rested in order to enjoy the ride and the destinations.

, It sounds too early, but you'll be so excited to get up and head on your journey, and won't be so bad.

, But put your backpack on your seat. If you have a pillow or a blanket, put it on your seat as well.

, Did you pack everything you needed? Is the food in the cooler and box? Is everyone here and ready to go? Do you have money? Your music? If yes, then you're ready to head off!

, Road trips are when you really get to know people, so talk! come up with ice breakers and would you rather questions. Talk about deep topics and memories you've had, and the road trip!

, If you're not talking, play music and sing or dance along. It's fun, and you get to know what kind of music people like.

, It kills time and makes the hours fly by. But don't watch movies the entire trip. Talk to your friends. It's also not fair to the driver.

, Have lots of fun, and remember them forever. Bring a camera to capture these memories.

,How to Calculate Center of Gravity1,
"
Calculate the weight of the object.,
Calculate the additional weights.",How to Calculate Center of Gravity2," When you're calculating the center of gravity, the first thing you should do is to find the weight of the object. Let's say that you're calculating the weight of a see-saw that has a weight of 30 lbs. Since it's a symmetrical object, its center of gravity will be exactly in its center if it's empty. But if the see-saw has people of different weights sitting on it, then the problem is a bit more complicated., To find the center of gravity of the see-saw with two children on it, you'll need to individually find the weight of the children on it. The first child has a weight of 40 lbs. and the second child's is 60 lbs.

"
"
Choose a datum.,
Measure the datum's distance from the center of the main object as well as from the two additional weights.",How to Calculate Center of Gravity3," The datum is an arbitrary starting point placed on one end of the see-saw. You can place the datum on one end of the see-saw or the other. Let's say the see-saw is 16 feet long. Let's place the datum on the left side of the see-saw, close to the first child.

, Let's say the children are each sitting 1 foot away from each end of the see-saw. The center of the see-saw is the midpoint of the see-saw, or at 8 feet, since 16 feet divided by 2 is 8. Here are the distances from the center of the main object and the two additional weights form the datum:


Center of see-saw = 8 feet away from datum.
Child 1 = 1 foot away from datum
Child 2 = 15 feet away from datum

"
"
Multiply each object's distance from the datum by its weight to find its moment.,
Add up the three moments.,
Add the weights of all the objects.,
Divide the total moment by the total weight.",How to Calculate Center of Gravity4," This gives you the moment for each object. Here's how to multiply each object's distance from the datum by its weight:


The see-saw: 30 lb. x 8 ft. = 240 ft. x lb.
Child 1 = 40 lb. x 1 ft. = 40 ft. x lb.
Child 2 = 60 lb. x 15 ft. = 900 ft. x lb.

, Simply do the math: 240 ft. x lb. + 40 ft. x lb. + 900 ft. x lb = 1180 ft. x lb. The total moment is 1180 ft. x lb.

, Find the sum of the weights of the seesaw, the first child, and the second child. To do this, add up the weights: 30 lbs. + 40 lbs. + 60 lbs. = 130 lbs.

, This will give you the distance from the datum to the center of gravity of the object. To do this, simply divide 1180 ft. x lb. by 130 lbs.


1180 ft. x lb. ÷ 130 lbs = 9.08 ft.
The center of gravity is 9.08 feet from the datum, or measured 9.08 feet from the end of the left side of the see-saw, which is where the datum was placed.

"
"
Find the center of gravity in the diagram.,
Check your math if you get a tiny answer.,
Troubleshoot if you have more than one center of gravity.,
Check your datum if your answer is off by a whole number.,
Make sure all your measurements are in straight lines.",How to Calculate Center of Gravity5," If the center of gravity you found is outside of the system of objects, you have the wrong answer. You may have measured the distances from more than one point. Try again with just one datum.


For example, for people sitting on a seesaw, the center of gravity has to be somewhere on the seesaw, not to the left or right of the seesaw. It does not have to be directly on a person.
This is still true with problems in two dimensions. Draw a square just large enough to fit all of the objects in your problem. The center of gravity must be inside this square.

, If you picked one end of the system as your datum, a tiny answer puts the center of gravity right next to one end. This can be the right answer, but it's often the sign of a mistake. When you calculated the moment, did you multiply the weight and distance together? That's the correct way to find the moment. If you accidentally added them together instead, you'll usually get a much smaller answer.

, Every system only has a single center of gravity. If you find more than one, you might have skipped the step where you add all the moments together. The center of gravity is the total moment divided by total weight. You do not need to divide each moment by each weight, which only tells you the position of each object.

, The answer to our example is 9.08 ft. Let's say you try it and get the answer 1.08 ft., 7.08 ft, or another number ending in "".08."" This most likely happened because we chose the left end of the seesaw as the datum, while you chose the right end or some other point an integer distance from our datum. Your answer is actually correct no matter which datum you choose! You just need to remember that the datum is always at x = 0. Here's an example:


The way we solved it, the datum is at the left end of the seesaw. Our answer was 9.08 ft, so our center of mass is 9.08 ft from the datum at the left end.
If you pick a new datum 1 ft from the left end, you get the answer 8.08 ft for the center of mass. The center of mass is 8.08 ft from the new datum, which is 1 ft from the left end. The center of mass is 8.08 + 1 = 9.08 ft from the left end, the same answer we got before.
(Note: When measuring distance, remember that distances to the left of the datum are negative, while distances to the right are positive.)

, Let's say you see another ""kids on the seesaw"" example, but one kid is much taller than the other, or one kid is hanging underneath the seesaw instead of sitting on top. Ignore the difference and take all your measurements along the straight line of the seesaw. Measuring distances at angles will lead to answers that are close but slightly off.


For seesaw problems, all you care about is where the center of gravity is along the left-right line of the seesaw. Later, you might learn more advanced ways to calculate the center of gravity in two dimensions.

Hold a family meeting.,
Ask them where they want to go.,
Guide their options.,
Encourage them to research.",How to Involve Your Child in Vacation Planning1," At this meeting, everyone in the family will be able to express an opinion about the vacation. Even if the child is too young to participate, just being at the meeting will make them feel included.You might announce the meeting by saying, ""We're trying to come up with ideas for our next vacation, and we want everyone's input.""
You can have this meeting during dinner or another communal family activity, or you can call a special meeting when everyone is home after school and work.;
, If you don’t have any plans for your next vacation, try asking your child if they have anywhere they want to go. Younger children might give you some idea of activities while older children and teenagers can come up with creative ideas for destinations.To younger children, you might just say, “If you could visit anywhere, where would you go?” If they come up with a good idea, you can say, “We’ll consider that for our next vacation.”
To older children and teenagers, you can say, “We’re trying to think of ideas for our next family vacation. Do you have any opinions?” If they come up with something that is unreasonable, you can say, “That sounds fun, but I think that might be a little out of our price range.”

, If you already have a few places in mind, you should give the child two or three options. Ask them which they would prefer for the next family vacation. This will give the child some control while still letting you choose the destination.You can say, “Would you rather go camping in the woods this summer or visit the beach?”
If you have a very specific destination in mind, you should still phrase it as a question. Instead of saying, “We’re going to New York City this summer,” you can say, “We were thinking about visiting New York this summer. How do you feel about that?”

, Older children and teenagers can use the internet to read up about different potential options. Tell them to spend some time researching before reporting back to the family.You can say, “Why don’t you go online and compare the different options? See what looks more fun to you.”
Ask everyone to contribute two or three different options. You can discuss them together at another family meeting.
With younger children, you can sit at a computer and research ideas together. Explain the different activities to the child."
"
Let everyone pick one thing to do.,
Give them a map.,
Post ideas on a collaborative travel planning site.,
Avoid over planning.",How to Involve Your Child in Vacation Planning2," Tell everyone in the family to pick one activity that they want to do. These are the activities that you will do on your vacation no matter what.Younger children may need a little more guidance in what they pick. You should give them two options. You can say, “Do you want to visit the children’s museum or the water park?”
Do not prioritize one child’s activity over the other. Everyone should be able to pick at least one activity.

, Give your child a map of your destination, and circle where some interesting activities are located. Ask them if they can plot a path for the family between the different places.To get them thinking about organization, you can ask them:


“How far it is between each place?”
“How would we get to each place? Would we walk, drive, or take a bus?”
“How long do you think it will take us to reach each place? Do you think we have time for it all?”

, Older children and teenagers may be able to handle planning software, apps, and websites. These will help your child figure out how to make an itinerary. Find a collaborative site where the entire family can post their ideas and opinions.Some good collaborative sites include:


Travefy
TripIt
Pana

, Do not try to pack too many activities into your vacation. Leave some room for flexibility. While you should let everyone pick one activity, you do not want to overwhelm the children or stress yourself out.Give yourself at least an hour or two of free time a day. Decide what to do during this time once you're there. For example, you might decide to go swimming in the hotel pool or to take a nap.
You might want to make a reservation for one nice dinner, but most meals should be spontaneous. Wait to see how the rest of the family is feeling, and give them an opinion when the time comes.

Set a budget.,
Ask them to find activities that fit the budget.,
Talk about trade-offs.,
Encourage them to save money.",How to Involve Your Child in Vacation Planning3," Establish ahead of time how much your family can afford to spend on this vacation. This is a decision you will have to make yourself without the input of the child. Some costs you will want to factor in when budgeting:Cost of travel
Hotel room rates per night
Meals for each person
Tickets to attractions

, Assign an activity to your child, and tell them how much money you have to spend on it. Encourage them to research and plan the activity in a way that fits your budget.For example, you might ask them to plan a trip to the zoo for the family. The child will have to add up the cost of tickets, look for discounts, set aside extra money for snacks, and decide if any money is left over for souvenirs.
Your child may need a little guidance with this activity. Offer to sit next to them, and give them advice on how to find the right information.

, If your child is struggling with the budget, sit down and talk to them about how they must make trade-offs. Doing one activity might prevent them from doing another. This is a good way to teach the child important budgeting skills.For example, you might say, “If we go to the theme park, we won’t be able to go the museum, see a show, or go ice skating. Is it worth it to do one expensive activity or multiple cheaper activities?”

, Talk to your child about saving money for the trip. This money might go towards snacks or souvenirs that they want to buy for themselves. You may want to tell them to put away ten or twenty percent of their allowance into their savings each week.


You can use a piggy bank that they can store their coins or cash in.
You can make a shadow box to encourage them to save. Put a picture of your vacation destination in the shadow box, and cut a slit for money. As they deposit money, they will see their savings build up."

Realize that maps are not more difficult to understand that reading a recipe for dinner, once you learn what the assorted markings and labels mean.,
A little knowledge about the way highways are numbered can go a long way.,
Know that, generally, the bolder the line, the bigger the road.,
Rely on major intersections (such as when an interstate crosses a major highway, or when two interstates cross, any prominent intersection) as a reference point.,
Often, if you can remember the curves a road has given, even if it isn't clearly marked what the name or number of the road is, you can identify it if you know the general region.,
Know that roads that circle a city are usually called ""bypasses"" because they allow non-city traffic to bypass the headaches of driving straight through.,
Study maps.",How to Learn to Be an Expert Map Reader," Look around the edges of the map (or in the case of an atlas, in the first few pages) to find a ""legend"" that will help to decode what the different colors mean.;
, In the US, an odd numbered highway (85, 67, etc) then it runs north and south, up and down on the map, as north is ordinarily always at the top of the page. Even numbered highways (40, 66, etc) always run east to west, from side to side on the map.

, Interstates lay on the map like arteries, which small roads look like veins, smaller roads probably will not even be marked on large maps. (Which is good; if you think a map is complicated as it is, imagine adding billions of other lines to denote every road!)

, When you Arrive at an intersection, try to locate a place to park and reference to the map. You can easily find yourself by just looking for the intersection that involves the two roads that intersect near you.

, If the road you are on is going east to west (west being your example direction of travel), and had a long straight section and then a sweeping left-hand turn, look on the map for roads going left to right, with a long straight section and a bend going downward. Continuing down this road, and relating the curves to the bends of the road on the map can give you a pinpoint location. If you go through a section of long S-curves after the long straight and sweeping left, and the road on the map goes right to left, bends downward, and then weaves back and forth like a snake, you can be assumed that this is the road you are on, and can find your way from there to wherever you want to go.

, If a road bends around a city on the map, and there is only one road of major prominence that does so and you see a sign denoting a bypass, there is a good likelihood that the bend around the city is the bypass you are approaching.

, It can be a fun hobby to study maps and learn about the roads, and for some reason, people may forget the recipe to mushroom soup, but can retain the major highways of Oklahoma. Make it a personal point of pride to know something about the lay of the roads in your home area, so that even if you never become lost, you can assist someone who may be lost. Knowing you are heading south on highway 20 is helpful, but knowing that just outside of Such and Such City it connects with 36 which loops back to your hometown is a comfort!

Put together a time-frame.,
Figure out if you're going alone.,
Plan out your budget.,
Take classes when you can.,
Stay open-minded to things.,
Make sure you’re completely free.",How to Go on a Wellness Getaway," Whether you are aiming to lose weight or simply better your physical health, a fitness getaway can provide you with the necessary tools to stay or get fit. Choose a retreat with outdoor activities like hiking, rock climbing, skiing, and surfing. Or, go for a place with a more introspective exercise like yoga. Most health and fitness getaways include structured classes and guides to aid you in your fitness journey. Some even offer pre-planned meals to help you meet your goals., If you are looking for a mental break, aim for a retreat that includes meditation. Commonly placed in quiet, out-of-the-way areas, spiritual retreats encourage guests to find inner peace. Participate in activities like yoga, Tai Chi, and mental workshops that will help guide you in working through problems and settling your mind.Many of these retreats encourage disconnection from modern life and do not have televisions or internet.

, Try a myriad of beauty treatments and feel refreshed with a spa getaway. These retreats are about more than just massages, they’re designed to help you decompress and rejuvenate. Choose from activities like body wraps, specialty baths, exfoliating rubs, and other specialized treatments. Or have one of the many counselors help you choose a schedule that suits your needs.

, Decide how much time you are able to spend away. If you work, you may have to take vacation days or a long weekend. You may also have to give up a day or two to travel, so be sure you have enough time allotted for both getting to the retreat and staying there.


Most wellness getaways are between 3 days and two weeks. So it's best to schedule your getaway a month or two in advance.

, Decide if you are bringing friends or family with you. A wellness getaway doesn't have to be a solo trip. Take a friend or significant other to deepen your relationship and relax together. Or go as a family and find the quality time together you may feel like you're missing at home. Many retreats may even offer special packages for groups or parties.


Whoever you are taking is likely to have their own wants and needs in regards to the best location as well.

, Wellness getaways can cost anywhere between $200-$5,000. It all depends on where you're going, how long you're staying, and whether or not amenities like food are offered. For example, many retreats will provide guests with lodging and regular meals - especially ones involved with weight loss. However, you may be required to pay for a hotel, specialized classes, and airfare., Wellness getaways are more than just vacations. You are free (and encouraged) to do what you wish with your time, however, taking advantage of the activities offered will help you get more from the trip. Every retreat will have trained guides that can lead you in both relaxing and improving your mental and physical health. Try a variety of classes or activities that your retreat offers like yoga, meditation, weight loss, or guided hiking.


You don’t have to partake in everything. Pick and choose what you feel would help you most.

, There may be courses or activities offered at your chosen getaway that you find unnecessary. Rather than decide against them immediately, keep an open mind to trying new things. Though you might assume something is ridiculous at first or that you won’t be able to manage, you may be surprised in the end. A wellness getaway is all about improvement, so try putting yourself out there when you can.

, Plan ahead to finish any obligations - work-related or personal. It's important to not have any immediate responsibilities on your wellness getaway so you can fully relax. The more cut off you are from your everyday life the easier it will be to properly take a break and refresh.

The governing differential equation for a simple pendulum is nonlinear because of the sin⁡θ{\displaystyle \sin \theta } term. In general, nonlinear differential equations do not have solutions that can be written in terms of elementary functions, and this is no exception. 

However, if we assume that the angle of oscillation is small, e.g. θ<15∘,{\displaystyle \theta <15^{\circ },} then it is reasonable to make the approximation that sin⁡θ≈θ.{\displaystyle \sin \theta \approx \theta .} We see that θ{\displaystyle \theta } is the first term in the Taylor series for sin⁡θ{\displaystyle \sin \theta } about θ=0,{\displaystyle \theta =0,} so our error in this approximation is on the order of O(θ3).{\displaystyle O(\theta ^{3}).}


sin⁡θ=θ−θ33!+θ55!−θ77!+⋯{\displaystyle \sin \theta =\theta -{\frac {\theta ^{3}}{3!}}+{\frac {\theta ^{5}}{5!}}-{\frac {\theta ^{7}}{7!}}+\cdots }



We then obtain the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. This equation is linear and has a well-known solution.


d2θdt2+glθ=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}+{\frac {g}{l}}\theta =0}


;
, Since this is a linear differential equation with constant coefficients, our solution must either be in the form of exponentials or trigonometric functions. For physical reasons, we expect that the equation of motion be oscillatory (trigonometric) in nature.

Obtain the characteristic equation and solve for the roots.


r2+gl=0{\displaystyle r^{2}+{\frac {g}{l}}=0}


r=±gli{\displaystyle r=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {g}{l}}}i}



Since our roots are imaginary, our solution is indeed oscillatory, as expected. From the theory of differential equations, we obtain our solution below. We write the angular frequency ω=gl.{\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {\frac {g}{l}}}.}


θ(t)=c1cos⁡ωt+c2sin⁡ωt{\displaystyle \theta (t)=c_{1}\cos \omega t+c_{2}\sin \omega t}




, A more useful formulation of the solution involves making the following manipulation.

Multiply the solution by c12+c22c12+c22.{\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}.}


c12+c22(c1c12+c22cos⁡ωt+c2c12+c22sin⁡ωt){\displaystyle {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}\left({\frac {c_{1}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}\cos \omega t+{\frac {c_{2}}{\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}}\sin \omega t\right)}



Draw a right triangle with angle ϕ,{\displaystyle \phi ,} hypotenuse length c12+c22,{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}},} opposite side length c1,{\displaystyle c_{1},} and adjacent side length c2.{\displaystyle c_{2}.} Replace the constant c12+c22{\displaystyle {\sqrt {c_{1}^{2}+c_{2}^{2}}}} with a new constant Θ,{\displaystyle \Theta ,} denoting amplitude. Now we can simplify the quantities in parentheses. The result is that the second arbitrary constant has been replaced with an angle. 


θ(t)=Θ(sin⁡ϕcos⁡ωt+cos⁡ϕsin⁡ωt)=Θsin⁡(ωt+ϕ){\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\theta (t)&=\Theta (\sin \phi \cos \omega t+\cos \phi \sin \omega t)\\&=\Theta \sin(\omega t+\phi )\end{aligned}}}



Because ϕ{\displaystyle \phi } is arbitrary, we can also use the cosine function as well. Mathematically, the two phase factors are different, but in terms of finding the equation of motion given initial conditions, only the form of the solution matters. Writing it in terms of cosine is slightly more common because it fits initial conditions well (imagine a pendulum being let go at some angle - the cosine function fits this situation naturally).


θ(t)=Θcos⁡(ωt+ϕ){\displaystyle \theta (t)=\Theta \cos(\omega t+\phi )}




, Initial conditions are solved in the usual manner with regards to second-order differential equations given the general solution. 

Assume initial conditions θ(0)=θ0{\displaystyle \theta (0)=\theta _{0}} and dθdt(0)=0.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}(0)=0.} This is equivalent to saying that we release a pendulum without any force at some angle θ0{\displaystyle \theta _{0}} from equilibrium, provided that θ0{\displaystyle \theta _{0}} is not too great.

Substitute these conditions into the general solution. Differentiate the general solution and substitute these conditions into that as well. We immediately obtain ϕ=0{\displaystyle \phi =0} and Θ=θ0.{\displaystyle \Theta =\theta _{0}.}


θ(t)=θ0cos⁡ωt{\displaystyle \theta (t)=\theta _{0}\cos \omega t}



If you are given numbers, then simply follow the above steps with the appropriate numbers substituted.


,

Physically, the angular frequency is the number of radians rotated per unit time. It is therefore related to the period via the relation ω=2πT.{\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {2\pi }{T}}.} We can then solve for the period T.{\displaystyle T.}


ω=gl{\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {\frac {g}{l}}}}


T=2πlg{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {l}{g}}}}



The order of g{\displaystyle g} and l{\displaystyle l} can get confusing. If it does, we go back to physical intuition. Intuitively, a longer pendulum should have a longer period than a shorter pendulum, so l{\displaystyle l} should be on top.


, This equation is no longer linear and is not easily solved. It turns out that the period of such a pendulum can be written exactly in terms of elliptic integrals - integrals that historically were studied to find the arc length of ellipses, but naturally arise in the study of pendulums as well. 


d2θdt2+glsin⁡θ=0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}+{\frac {g}{l}}\sin \theta =0} 

To make things simple, we are given the same initial conditions as before: θ(0)=θ0{\displaystyle \theta (0)=\theta _{0}} and dθdt(0)=0.{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}(0)=0.}


, 


2dθdtd2θdt2+2gldθdtsin⁡θ=0{\displaystyle 2{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}+{\frac {2g}{l}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\sin \theta =0}

We can then make use of the chain rule for both terms.


2dθdtd2θdt2=ddt(dθdt)2{\displaystyle 2{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }^{2}\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t^{2}}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\left({\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\right)^{2}}


ddtcos⁡θ=−sin⁡θdθdt{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\cos \theta =-\sin \theta {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}}



Then, we arrive at the following equation.


ddt(dθdt)2=2glddtcos⁡θ{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\left({\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\right)^{2}={\frac {2g}{l}}{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\cos \theta }




, The integration introduces an integration constant. Physically, this constant represents the cosine of an initial angle. There are two solutions because the pendulum can move counterclockwise or clockwise.


(dθdt)2=2gl(cos⁡θ−cos⁡θ0){\displaystyle \left({\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}\right)^{2}={\frac {2g}{l}}(\cos \theta -\cos \theta _{0})}


dθdt=±2glcos⁡θ−cos⁡θ0{\displaystyle {\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{{\mathrm {d} }t}}=\pm {\sqrt {\frac {2g}{l}}}{\sqrt {\cos \theta -\cos \theta _{0}}}}


,

From our previous results, we found that Θ=θ0{\displaystyle \Theta =\theta _{0}} was the amplitude of oscillation. This suggests that half the period is the time taken for the pendulum to traverse from −θ0{\displaystyle -\theta _{0}} to θ0.{\displaystyle \theta _{0}.}


T2=l2g∫−θ0θ0dθcos⁡θ−cos⁡θ0{\displaystyle {\frac {T}{2}}={\sqrt {\frac {l}{2g}}}\int _{-\theta _{0}}^{\theta _{0}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\cos \theta -\cos \theta _{0}}}}}



Because cos⁡θ{\displaystyle \cos \theta } is even, we can factor out a 2.


T=22lg∫0θ0dθcos⁡θ−cos⁡θ0{\displaystyle T=2{\sqrt {\frac {2l}{g}}}\int _{0}^{\theta _{0}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\cos \theta -\cos \theta _{0}}}}}



This integral is tough, and cannot be evaluated using elementary methods. However, it can be evaluated exactly in terms of the Beta function if we assume that θ0=π/2,{\displaystyle \theta _{0}=\pi /2,} i.e. the angle of oscillation is 90°. This is large enough to be outside the scope of the small-angle approximation. We do this calculation in the next step.


, 

When θ0=π/2,{\displaystyle \theta _{0}=\pi /2,} cos⁡θ0=0{\displaystyle \cos \theta _{0}=0} and we obtain the following integral.


T=22lg∫0π/2dθcos⁡θ{\displaystyle T=2{\sqrt {\frac {2l}{g}}}\int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\cos \theta }}}}



This integral still does not have an antiderivative that can be written in terms of elementary functions, but it can be evaluated exactly in terms of the Beta function, itself written in terms of the Gamma function.


Γ(α)Γ(β)2Γ(α+β)=∫0π/2cos2α−1⁡θsin2β−1⁡θdθ{\displaystyle {\frac {\Gamma (\alpha )\Gamma (\beta )}{2\,\Gamma (\alpha +\beta )}}=\int _{0}^{\pi /2}\cos ^{2\alpha -1}\theta \sin ^{2\beta -1}\theta {\mathrm {d} }\theta }



We see from direct comparison that α=1/4{\displaystyle \alpha =1/4} and β=1/2.{\displaystyle \beta =1/2.} Given that Γ(1/2)=π,{\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2)={\sqrt {\pi }},} we arrive at the following answer.


∫0π/2dθcos⁡θ=π2Γ(1/4)Γ(3/4){\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\cos \theta }}}={\frac {\sqrt {\pi }}{2}}{\frac {\Gamma (1/4)}{\Gamma (3/4)}}}



We now make use of Euler's reflection formula to simplify, since Γ(3/4){\displaystyle \Gamma (3/4)} is related to Γ(1/4).{\displaystyle \Gamma (1/4).}


Γ(z)Γ(1−z)=πsin⁡(πz){\displaystyle \Gamma (z)\Gamma (1-z)={\frac {\pi }{\sin(\pi z)}}} 


∫0π/2dθcos⁡θ=Γ2(1/4)22π{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\cos \theta }}}={\frac {\Gamma ^{2}(1/4)}{2{\sqrt {2\pi }}}}}



Combining with our previous result, and setting the period of the pendulum with small-angle approximation T0,{\displaystyle T_{0},} we arrive at the following result. Note that Γ(1/4){\displaystyle \Gamma (1/4)} is transcendental.


T=lgΓ2(1/4)π=Γ2(1/4)2π3/2T0≈1.18T0{\displaystyle T={\sqrt {\frac {l}{g}}}{\frac {\Gamma ^{2}(1/4)}{\sqrt {\pi }}}={\frac {\Gamma ^{2}(1/4)}{2\pi ^{3/2}}}T_{0}\approx 1.18T_{0}}



Thus, the period of a pendulum given an amplitude of 90° has a period about 18% longer than that given by the simple harmonic oscillator. 


,

We first restate the integral to be evaluated.


T=22lg∫0θ0dθcos⁡θ−cos⁡θ0{\displaystyle T=2{\sqrt {\frac {2l}{g}}}\int _{0}^{\theta _{0}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\cos \theta -\cos \theta _{0}}}}}



Make use of the following substitutions. The third line immediately follows from the second substitution.


cos⁡θ=1−2sin2θ2{\displaystyle \cos \theta =1-2\sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}} 


sinθ2=sinθ02sin⁡ϕ{\displaystyle \sin {\frac {\theta }{2}}=\sin {\frac {\theta _{0}}{2}}\sin \phi }


12cosπ2dθ=2kcos⁡ϕdϕ{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\cos {\frac {\pi }{2}}{\mathrm {d} }\theta =2k\cos \phi {\mathrm {d} }\phi }



For simplicity, let k=sinθ02.{\displaystyle k=\sin {\frac {\theta _{0}}{2}}.} Notice that when θ=0,{\displaystyle \theta =0,} ϕ=0,{\displaystyle \phi =0,} and when θ=θ0,{\displaystyle \theta =\theta _{0},} ϕ=π/2.{\displaystyle \phi =\pi /2.}


T=22lg∫0θ0dθcos⁡θ−cos⁡θ0=2lg∫0θ0dθsin2θ02−sin2θ2=2lg∫0π/21k2kdϕ1−sin2⁡ϕ1−sin2⁡ϕ1−sin2θ2=4lg∫0π/2dϕ1−k2sin2⁡ϕ{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}T&=2{\sqrt {\frac {2l}{g}}}\int _{0}^{\theta _{0}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\cos \theta -\cos \theta _{0}}}}\\&=2{\sqrt {\frac {l}{g}}}\int _{0}^{\theta _{0}}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\theta }{\sqrt {\sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta _{0}}{2}}-\sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}}}}\\&=2{\sqrt {\frac {l}{g}}}\int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {1}{k}}{\frac {2k{\mathrm {d} }\phi }{\sqrt {1-\sin ^{2}\phi }}}{\frac {\sqrt {1-\sin ^{2}\phi }}{\sqrt {1-\sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta }{2}}}}}\\&=4{\sqrt {\frac {l}{g}}}\int _{0}^{\pi /2}{\frac {{\mathrm {d} }\phi }{\sqrt {1-k^{2}\sin ^{2}\phi }}}\end{aligned}}}



This integral is called the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, denoted by K(k).{\displaystyle K(k).} This integral does not have a solution expressible in terms of elementary functions, but it can be expressed as a series by way of the Beta function again.

The period can thus be written exactly as follows. 


T=4lgK(sin2θ02){\displaystyle T=4{\sqrt {\frac {l}{g}}}K\left(\sin ^{2}{\frac {\theta _{0}}{2}}\right)}




, A more detailed explanation of this evaluation can be found here.

We must make use of the binomial series.

In this derivation, we used the binomial series, the relation between the Gamma and the factorial functions Γ(z)=(z−1)!,{\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=(z-1)!,} Euler's reflection formula to simplify the Γ(1/2+m){\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2+m)} and Γ(1/2−m){\displaystyle \Gamma (1/2-m)} terms, the fact that (−1)msin⁡(π(m+1/2))=1{\displaystyle (-1)^{m}\sin(\pi (m+1/2))=1} for all integers m,{\displaystyle m,} and the double factorial identity relating it to the Gamma function, written below. 


(2m−1)!!=2mΓ(m+1/2)π{\displaystyle (2m-1)!!={\frac {2^{m}\Gamma (m+1/2)}{\sqrt {\pi }}}}




, This is a very important series, and from this, we obtain the period of a true pendulum. Let T0=2πlg{\displaystyle T_{0}=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {l}{g}}}} be the period of the pendulum using the small-angle approximation. The series clearly demonstrates the deviation from this approximation as θ0{\displaystyle \theta _{0}} gets larger. Since the region of convergence is |k|<1,{\displaystyle |k|<1,} we see that at 180°, the series diverges, corresponding to a pendulum at unstable equilibrium. Remember that k=sinθ02{\displaystyle k=\sin {\frac {\theta _{0}}{2}}} in this relation.


T=T0{\displaystyle T=T_{0}\left}

The graph above shows the elliptic integral in red, along with its series expansions truncated to 2nd, 4th, and 10th order. We can clearly see the divergence here, as well as the series being progressively better approximations the more terms we keep.

Find the closest Metro or RER station.,
Purchase a Billet Ile-de-France.,
Make your way to the RER A train.,
Take the RER A train line towards Marne-la-Valleé - Chessy.,
Exit the station and walk to Disneyland Paris.",How to Get to Disneyland Paris1," The RER (Réseau Express Régional) is a network of express trains that run from central Paris to its suburbs. There are 16 metro lines and 5 RER lines that run throughout Paris.If both a metro and RER station are equally close, the RER train will likely be faster as it is an express train.


Search alternate train options; depending on your starting location there may be a faster train. For example, there is a TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse, or high-speed train) direct from the Charles-de-Gaulle Airport to Disneyland Paris.There are also Eurostar trains to Disneyland Paris direct from several places in the United Kingdom.;
, You can purchase these tickets from any metro or RER station ticket window, or from any of the automated ticket vending machines located around Paris.If you're traveling from central Paris (public transportation Zone 1) this is the only ticket you'll need to purchase.A one-way ticket from central Paris will cost 7,60 Euros (as of January 2015).
Paris Visite Cards, Pass Navigo Decouverte, and Ticket Mobilis are accepted passes.
A ticket t+ will not work for this trip since your final stop is in Zone 5., If the closest RER station to you does not serve the A train, you will need to take a different RER or Metro line and switch over to the RER A train. For example, if you're traveling from Charles de Gaulle airport, take the RER B train to Paris and switch to the RER A train line towards Marne la Valleé at Châtelet Les Halles station., The sign for your direction may also read ""Boissy-St-Legér"", in addition to ""Marne-la-Valleé"". As you're waiting for your train, make sure that the stop panels hanging above the train platform have a yellow box next to the Marne-la-Valleé - Chessy station.If Marne la Valleé - Chessy is not listed on the hanging panels, you're probably on the wrong side of the platform.
Keep your ticket handy while you're aboard the RER in case you need to show it to a ticket checker (known as ""controllers"").

, The Marne-la-Valleé/Chessy stop is a two minute walk from the park gates. Exit the RER A train station and go up the escalator, following the signs for ""Sortie"". Use your billet Ile-de-France in the turnstiles as you exit."

Map directions to the park.,
Get to France.,
Follow your map or planned directions to the park.",How to Get to Disneyland Paris2," Services like Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, or Mapquest will provide turn-by-turn directions and even guide you around traffic if your co-pilot operates while you drive. The parking lot is located on Boulevard de Parc, 77700 Coupvray, FR (48°52'33.9""N 2°47'47.3""E)., From the UK, the Eurotunnel Shuttle will take you and your car from Folkestone to Calais. Alternately, there are ferries that run across the English channel, such as the P&O ferry from Dover to Calais.If you're trying to get to France through a different European country, there are a variety of highways on the E-road network that should be able to get you into the country.

, There are plenty of signs for the park on the Autoroute and E-road highways to guide you. From the north, take the A26 from Calais and change to the A4, following signs for ""Metz/Nancy"" if you don't see signs for the park. From the south, follow the motorway towards ""Paris"" and follow signs for Disneyland Paris.Some French motorways are toll roads, so be prepared to pay the appropriate toll.
Parking is free if you're staying at a Disneyland hotel, but will cost money if you're staying elsewhere.

Book a flight to Paris.,
Plan your transportation from the airport to the park.,
Find your ground transportation and hop on.",How to Get to Disneyland Paris3," When choosing which airport to fly into, it may help knowing that both Charles de Gaulle airport and Orly airport have direct, 45 minute shuttles to the Disneyland Paris park, and Charles de Gaulle has a direct TGV train to the Disneyland Paris park gates. Beauvais-Tille also has a direct shuttle to the park which takes about an hour and a half., There a plethora of options, including direct shuttles from the major airports and the TGV direct train from Charles de Gaulle airport to the park.It is also easy to rent a car, take the train, or take a cab., Once you've landed in Paris, your shuttle provider will provide you with directions to make sure you can find the bus. If you're renting a car, follow signs in the airport to find the appropriate rental car stand to complete your reservation. If you opted to go the train route, there should also be signs to get you to the RER or TGV (only in Charles de Gaulle) stations after you get your bags.

Make it so that they can have travel activities that teach skills like drawing, writing, math, or other sciences.,
Teach them travel activities that help to stimulate creativity.,
Use technology in a smart way



Photography on the Move: If you trust them with it, give your preschooler your phone or (small) camera and let them take pictures of what you are traveling by.",How to Entertain Kids on Long Car Trips Without Video Games,"


A mini/travel white board and dry-erase felt pens
Some empty sheets of paper and printed coloring pages and a holder paper clipboard.;
,



Play ""Storytelling"" or just involve everybody (except the driver) in telling/inventing the story. Start a story and when it reached a dramatic point, have someone else continue.

Play ""Scavenger hunt"".Have a list of things that need to be find during the trip and have everyone in the car( except the driver) look for them. The nice things is that with a bit of imagination you can adapt this game to your traveling stile and the and of your children.

Play ""Do as I’m doing"": Invite your kids to imitate you by doing funny things with your face, hands and arms. For example, try patting your nose or rubbing your belly three times, then see if she can do the same number of actions. Or create a sequence — nose touch, chin pat, cheek blow — and invite her to follow along. Then copy her as she creates her own (never mind the funny looks from fellow passengers). You can also play the “head shoulders knees and toes” song.

Mark the Miles: Before starting out on a long travel with kids you make a kids travel game. Hang little numbered tickets above each child’s car seat, one for every hour of the trip. This way they will be able to understand the concept of time and avoid questions like “Are we there yet?”. They will love to pull down the ticket when you’ll ask ‘Tickets, please!’, and if you want to- every time they hand over the ticket- you can reward their patience with some treats.

Give a challenge: Put some treats into paper bags labeled with an activity -like finding a specific landmark or license plate- that kids must do before opening the bag.

Make some noise: Why not throwing a party in the car? Play freeze dance by blasting the car stereo for a minute while everyone wriggles and boogies in their seat (except the driver!). When the music stops, freeze in place for a while and then start again. As a bonus the family will burn off some energy :-)

Make everything a surprise: Wrap everything in recycled newspapers or magazines, so that every new toy you hand over is a surprise. It does not matter if they played with the toy before, unwrapping something is always exciting for a kid.

Ask Who am I?: This is a great travel activity for kids because it requires no gear beyond an active mind. To play a kid-friendly version, think of a simple category, like “fruits”, “animals”, “family”, then pick something you want to be and offer three clues to your identity. For instance, “I’m orange, I’m hard, and rabbits love me. Who am I?” A carrot, of course. You can also pretend to be a member of the family and offer clues like “I’m tall, I’m older than…., and I wear glasses.”

Play with Clear Tape: I know this seems silly, but kids love it- I promise. If you’re worried about what they will stick it to, talk to them beforehand if there’s anything you don’t want stuck! The kids can color a little tape with black marker or pen and make a mustache or a beard, adding to their upper lip or chin. Or they can tape long strips across the whole back seat from window to window. They can even tape close some empty plastic container. Just give the kids their own roll of tape to do whatever they want with it.

Play with Paper Clips: Another super simple object that kids will love to play during family travel. They can make chains, necklaces, or open them up to make more structures. They can make a paper clips chain from one side of the car to the other, attaching them to the hand rails, and then hanging their toys from it. There are many fun things they’ll be able to do with paper clips.

,

Save your songs: Kids love to sing, and if you give them a smart phone or mic, they will love to tape their songs and play them back. Plus you’ll have some great (original) music for your family travel :-)







Let them guide you: Give your preschooler a (spare) GPS or similar device and let her guide you. She will be very happy to play such a vital role in the trip, and she’ll get to practice her orientation skills. Make sure that from time to time you ask her “Are we going on the right way?” or “what do we need to do now?”

Tablets and smartphones: You don’t need me to tell you that these are great things to have with you. Make sure you have some movies they like and some fun and education apps, and use them in emergency situations :-)

Call your banks to tell them your plan to travel to the UAE.,
Withdraw several hundred dollars or pounds from your bank before you leave.,
Choose traveler's checks from certain banks as a monetary safety net.,
Visit a currency exchange house in the airport when you arrive.,
Check if your hotel offers UAE currency exchange.,
Use an ATM.,
Visit a major bank.,
Find currency exchange businesses with good rates at malls.,
Visit several banks, money lenders and currency exchange locations to inquire about rates before you exchange large sums of money.,
Use a credit card when paying for hotels and fine dining.",How to Exchange Money in the UAE," You will want to have several ways to obtain cash in the Emirates, so opt for a major credit card that can be used abroad and an automated teller machine (ATM) card that can withdraw cash from a major account.


Calling the customer service number on the back of your ATM and credit card will place notes on the accounts about when and where you plan to travel. You are less likely to have purchases flagged as possible card theft, which can lead to a hold on your account.
Check on the rates of your debit and credit cards before leaving your country. Some cards charge an extra fee for ATM or credit card usage in foreign currencies. Choose the cards that have the most reasonable rates before you travel.;
, Dollars and pounds are more likely to be exchanged than other currencies, although you may be able to exchange other currencies at certain banks or airports.

, Some people choose to keep traveler's checks in another bag or in a money belt, in case of theft. If you do this, you should choose banks like HSBC and Thomas Cook that have locations in the major cities of the UAE.


Traveler's checks from smaller banks may not be accepted at banks, hotels and exchange houses.

, Airports are known for having more costly exchange rates, in general. However, this is a good place to exchange your first $100, so that you have money to pay for services and tips on the way to your hotel.


If you are flying into Dubai, search for the currency exchange locations in your terminal at dubaiairport.com/en/passengers/AirportServices/Pages/Currencyexchange.aspx,

, If you are simply wanting to exchange dollars or pounds, your hotel may be able to offer you a rate similar to the airport. They are unlikely to exchange traveler's checks.

, These machines are available all over the UAE, in malls, in hotels and in banks. Simply type in your pin, request the money and you will receive cash in Dirhams.

, Go to HSBC or Thomas cook to get cash exchanged for traveler's checks or to exchange cash.


UAE banking hours are slightly different than in the US or Britain. They are open between 8 am and 1 pm and 4 pm to 6 pm Monday through Thursday. They are closed all day on Friday. Some exchange businesses are open for a portion of the day on Friday.

, People often find that the fees are more favorable here than in the airport or at hotels.

, If you are exchanging more than several hundred dollars, you should do some research in the city where you are staying to get a favorable rate.

, You will get discounts for using cash in most markets and with many services. Use the credit card for larger travel services, like accommodations, to use your cash when it is necessary.

Do your research ahead of time.,
Skip the major chains.,
Avoid dining at fancy and expensive restaurants.,
Consider traveling during a holiday or festival.",How to Eat Like a Local when Traveling1," While plenty of great, local restaurants can be discovered just by walking through a city, you can save yourself time and energy by doing research ahead of time. If you have an idea of the budget you’ll be dining on and the city or region you’ll be in, start your research with an online search at a site like Yelp or TripAdvisor.Type in something like “Best local restaurants in Portland,” and check restaurant reviews and menus online.


There are also a number of helpful food and restaurant blogs that can be found with a quick online search. Also check newspaper food reviews, including the Dining and Wine section of The New York Times.
If you have any friends on social media sites who live in the area you’re traveling to, reach out to them.Send a quick message saying, “I’m going to be in (region) for a few days and am looking to eat locally; where can you recommend?”;
, Regardless of where you travel, certain major national and global chains will be ubiquitous. Avoid eating at restaurants that you can find in your hometown; these places will not incorporate local ingredients and dishes.


Chain restaurants are also more likely to be frequented by tourists looking for familiar foods, rather than a local culinary experience.

, Unless fine dining is a deliberate part of your culinary plan, you may also want to skip the well-known, fancy restaurants in a city. Locals often don’t eat at upscale places, but prefer more affordable and authentic meals.If someone you know—or a food critic you enjoy—has eaten at an upscale restaurant in an area you’re traveling, ask them to recommend a similar restaurant that has more authentic regional food and a lower price tag.

, Often the best food that cities or regions have to offer is made during culturally significant events, such as Christmas, the New Year, or a regionally specific holiday. To gain an appreciation for local food, and eat dishes that may not be available throughout the year, you may want to plan your travel during a local or cultural holiday.If you don’t want to travel during a major holiday, you can at least check online and find any local food festivals. Food festivals are a great way to experience a dense amount of local cuisine in one place.
Keep in mind that other aspects of travel—for example, airfare and hotels—may be dramatically more expensive during national holiday seasons.

"
"
Walk through a restaurant-heavy area of the city.,
Use internet searches to narrow down your options.,
Talk to people who live—and dine—in the vicinity.,
Spread a meal out across a few restaurants.,
Be sensibly cautious about food and general safety concerns.",How to Eat Like a Local when Traveling2," A great way to find local restaurants and culinary treasures is to simply wander through a part of the city or region you’re travelling to that is known to have a large number of local, authentic restaurants.


Look for restaurants that are not stuffed with tourists and that seem to be populated by locals. Also try to find places that have their menu written in the local language.

, When looking for restaurants in an unfamiliar place, online searches using sites like Yelp or TripAdvisor will help you find spots of interest, or at least give you an idea of where to start looking. Keep in mind that these sites will often leave out many smaller local restaurants, where local people actually eat., Ask your taxi or Uber driver, the staff at your hotel, or any other local individuals with whom you interact, where they commonly go out to eat on a Friday night. Local people will be able to recommend authentic restaurants that may not have a website or may not show up in guidebooks.Say something like, “I’m only in town for a few days and hoping to eat at some places I couldn’t find back home. Where do you usually eat on a night out?”
Additionally, if you’ve already been to a restaurant that you enjoyed, or heard of one you plan to visit, you can name-drop this to your advantage. Say something like, “I’ve already eaten at (restaurant name) and enjoyed it; can you recommend any other places with similar food?”

, You can easily double or triple the number of restaurants you visit if you split a single meal up among multiple locations. If you’re in a city or region that’s large enough to support several restaurants within walking distance, plan out a route ahead of time, and visit two or three for a meal.For example, start with a cocktail or small plate at one restaurant, then move on to another location for the main course, and finish with dessert at a third restaurant.
If you repeat this process for several meals over a few days, you’ll have tried upwards of 10 new, local restaurants.

, If you’re traveling in a new area, especially internationally, be aware that certain foods may not be prepared as sanitarily as they would be in your home town. Also, certain unfamiliar ingredients in foreign cuisine—including many spicy dishes—may upset your digestive system. As a rule of thumb, order meat well done or medium-well done, avoid dishes with raw eggs or excessive uncooked vegetables, and plan to eat foods that need to be cooked, washed, or peeled (such as fresh fruits).Ordering food from street vendors can pose a risk. Before ordering, look around the food stand: make sure that the food is served hot, and that the cart looks sanitary and well-kept.
If you’re dining outside of a touristy area, observe general traveler-safety guides, even if you’re tracking down a new restaurant. Avoid restaurant-hunting alone, and make sure you can always find your way back to your hotel.

Try new local foods by ordering small plates.,
Take a cooking class.,
Adopt local mannerisms as much as you’re comfortable.,
Learn some of the local language for travel.",How to Eat Like a Local when Traveling3," When ordering at a local restaurant, it’s smart to order appetizers and small plates, rather than entrees. Chefs rotate their small plates more frequently, and can take greater liberties than with entrees, which are often consistent and lack local flavor.You’ll also be able to eat more local dishes if you order small plates. Look for oysters or lobster in coastal areas, and plan to eat small plates built around other local specialties and ingredients.

, Although eating out can be a great experience and a fun way to learn about a new culture, as you can imagine, locals do not eat at restaurants for every meal. You can learn more about the way in which a regional cuisine is made—especially if you’re traveling internationally—by taking a cooking class.Taking a cooking class will allow you to better appreciate the flavors of the local food and gain insight into the way(s) in which dishes are made. Also, if you’re traveling for an extended period of time, you’ll be able to cook your own meals and replicate the local cuisine while traveling.

, Table manners and eating customs differ from place to place, especially if you’re traveling outside of your home country. To avoid looking like a confused tourist, put in some research so you can match local dining manners.If you are traveling abroad and you have friends, family member, or acquaintances who have traveled and eaten in the area, ask them if there are any typical American table manners that would be offensive in the area.
There may also be local dining customs that you could find through a quick online search.

, If you’re traveling in a country or region that speaks a language different from your own, it will be valuable to have learned some food-related terms in the language. If you’re eating at the type of authentic restaurant favored by locals, the management and staff may not speak much English, and you’ll need to order in the local language.Keep a travel notebook, and jot down pronunciation for phrases like, “I’m hungry,” “Where can I find a restaurant?” and “What kind of food do you serve?”
Also brush up on culinary terms in the language, so you can navigate a non-English menu. Start with simple terms like “grilled,” “raw,” “fried,” “steamed,” and increase the complexity of your vocabulary from there.

Accept that you will feel different when you return home.,
Realize that the people who know you will probably not see more than basic changes in you on your return.,
Expect both change and no change in those you left at home.,
Give yourself time to adjust.",How to Cope With Returning Home After Long Term Overseas Travel," This means that you will perceive your old life, old home, old places in a very new light. This can be both negative and positive, depending on each individual case.;
, They'll be happy to see you back, they'll notice the tan, the new hairdo, and your insistence on adopting a funny new accent. What they'll be less likely to notice is how deeply changed you feel inside. There are two aspects to this. For those who have never traveled far, they won't really understand this feeling at all. For those who have traveled but not for a long time, there may be a sense of not wanting to remember that feeling too well, for fear of feeling jealous or sad about times long past. Don't be too hard on either of these reasons behind not trying to delve into your deeper experiences.

, In both cases, your own emotions are going to be jolted around a bit until you find your niche back home again and start carrying on with life as usual.


In some cases, there may be dramatic changes, including relationship changes, residential moves, new hobbies, new jobs, new family members, etc. This can be very disorienting for you at first, on discovering that things changed dramatically in your absence.
On the other hand, and often more commonplace, nothing has changed. And this can be quite hard to handle because you've just have life-changing experiences that have challenged your worldview and helped you mature in new directions but back at home, everyone is still carrying on as they have done always, none the wiser, no more enlightened and certainly not having life revelations of the sort you might have had!
Go easy on others around you; yes, it's incredibly frustrating that many people aren't that interested in talking about all the amazing experiences you've had but on the other hand, you have been blessed to have the chance at all. Remember that many other people don't get this opportunity, or don't understand the value of making room for overseas value. If there is any sense of resentment, it's best not to push your experience in their faces but to simply include gentle comments about things you've done, here and there in the conversation.

, On coming back home, take time to settle back into your usual or new routine. If you have a job to go back to, no doubt that will come up shortly. But if this was big year overseas prior to looking for a career, you're bound to be feeling trepidation at what lies ahead--your entire future! To get you started, it's good to get into a routine as soon as possible:


Unpack your gear, clean all the dirty things, give out the gifts, put the bags away for another trip some day.






Go to the doctor for a routine check up for your general health. This is the time to raise any health concerns that might have arisen while traveling.
Store your photos and sort them. Now is the time to do this; the longer you leave it, the more likely it is that you will never get around to doing it.
Start preparing your resume, educational institution applications, etc. as needed.

Work out the feasibility of going home and then resuming your trip.",How to Cope With a Crisis at Home when Traveling," Is your immediate thought ""I have to go back!""? Or is it, ""This is awful but I know X will cope with all the family/friend support.""? Your initial reaction will be an important indicator in reaching your final decision.;
, Unless it's a matter of life and death, you might want to see how the crisis pans out before really facing the decision. This might necessitate staying put to be near email or phone access, or it might mean that you just have to travel with the need to stay in touch in mind.

, If it is someone very close to you, such as your parents, ask for their advice and recommendations. Ask them if they want you to come home. Even if they say no, does their answer ring true to you?

, It helps to get the perspective of someone you can trust but who may not have the same level of involvement in the crisis. They will be able to help you gauge your own emotional reaction better too.


Consider how your emotions will impact your travel companion(s). If you become difficult to travel with because of your emotions, this can spoil things for the other person(s) and it might just be better to go home to deal with the crisis in person.

, This can be a useful exercise to help you work out where the real balance lies - in staying, or in going back.


Keep in mind that if someone you care about is dying, that this is final. Where you are traveling isn't going anywhere, on the other hand, and will still be there for you another time.

, In some cases, this may answer all of the concerns even though it will probably entail spending more money.

Count the prongs to your devices’ plugs.,
Research plug types.,
Distinguish between “grounded” and “ungrounded.” When researching plug types, expect to find more than one listed for most countries.,
Confirm your hotel’s plug type, if needed.,
Shop according to your needs.",How to Choose a Travel Adapter1," Before you start looking for adapters, determine exactly which devices you’ll be bringing along on your trip. You’ll need to refer to each one later on for additional information, but for now, simply check the electrical plug to each device. Expect them to have either two or three prongs.Two-pronged plugs are known as “unearthed” or “ungrounded” (depending on where you live), while the extra prong in a three-pronged plug means that it’s “earthed” or “grounded.”
The extra prong in an earthed or grounded plug is known as an “earth pin” or “grounding pin.” This is a safety feature, typically for devices made of metal or other conductive material, to reduce the chances of electrical shock.;
, Expect the designs of electrical outlets to vary country by country, or even region by region. Compose a list of each country that you will be visiting. For each one, search online for which type(s) of designs are used in that country so you can find adapters shaped to match.Designs for outlets and plugs are typically expressed in letters. For example, an American device with two prongs to its plug is type A, while an American device with three prongs is type B.

, If there are only two listed, one is most likely for grounded electronics, and the other for ungrounded. For each plug type you find for that country, count the number of prongs. If one has two prongs and the other has three, this means one is for ungrounded electronics and the other for grounded.


If any of the devices that you’re bringing have three prongs, you will need a corresponding grounding adapter for those items.If all of your devices have only two prongs, however, simply go with an ungrounded adapter, since these are typically cheaper.

, Expect many countries to stick to only one or two plug types. However, if your search turns up multiple types used in one country, contact the hotel where you will be staying and/or wherever else you expect to need your electronics the most (like an office if you’re traveling for business). Ask them which type of electrical outlets they have.


Maldives, for instance, uses six different types: C, D, G, J, K, and L.

, There are lots and lots of adapters on the market, either available direct from manufacturers or retailers, so do some comparative shopping first. Factor in which devices you’ll be bringing, how many you’ll need to plug in at one time, which countries you will be visiting, and which plug types they use. Check customer reviews and online forums to help you select an adapter or adapters that will fit your specific needs. For example:You can buy kits that include multiple adapters for different countries, or an all-in-one adapter featuring multiple plug types. However, some may work with grounded devices, while others are intended solely for ungrounded ones.
If you plan on using multiple devices at once, you could buy an adapter that accepts more than one at a time. But you may find that customer reviews for one such product indicate that it’s too heavy to stay plugged in with certain countries’ outlets.

"
"
Remember the limitations of adapters.,
Research your destination’s voltage.,
Locate your devices’ power specifications.,
Find out if your device is single or dual voltage.,
Check the wattages of all single-voltage devices.,
Shop for converters that match your needs.",How to Choose a Travel Adapter2," Be aware that an adapter’s sole function is to match the shape of a particular outlet. Do not expect it to convert the voltage provided by that outlet. If you’re visiting a country whose outlets provide a higher or lower voltage than your own, determine whether you need to purchase a converter in addition to your adapter.Using an electronic device with the wrong voltage can destroy your device.

, For each country that you’re visiting, check the amount of voltage that their outlets provide. Expect most countries to use between 220 and 240 volts, while others use between 100 and 125. Compare that with your own country’s standard voltage. If they’re the same, you don’t need a converter, but if they differ, anticipate having to possibly buy one.As with plug types, the amount of voltage used in some countries may vary. Belize, for instance, uses both 110 volts and 220. If this is the case, check with your hotel to find out how much voltage you should expect there., Refer to each device that you’re bringing and/or their owner’s manual. Find the “indications” or “power supply” label on the device itself, or look up the same in your manual’s index. If you’re searching for it on your device, look for a mold, imprint, or sticker on the plug, charger, or power supply.If you don’t have a manual and can’t find the label on the device, contact the manufacturer or search online for the product specifications.

, Modern products (especially those likely to be included in international travel) are often designed to work with varying amounts of voltage, so don’t rush out and by a converter just yet. Check the required voltage on the power supply label. If your device is dual voltage, it will work with both voltages specified there. If it’s single voltage, however, you will need a converter in order to use it abroad.


The voltage will be expressed by the number of volts plus either the symbol “V” (for “voltage”) or “AC” (for “alternating current”). A dual-voltage device will read something like “110/220V” or “120-240AC,” while a single-voltage device will simply read “110V” or “220AC.”
Generally speaking, devices will still work despite slight differences in voltage. So if your label reads “110V” and your destination supplies 120 volts, it should be safe to use without a converter.If your device is dual voltage, remember to check the instructions before using it with different voltage. Find out if it adjusts to different voltages on its own or if you have to manually adjust its settings beforehand.

, Expect the power supply label for each device to indicate both the voltage and wattage needed. In order to find out which voltage converter is right for a particular device, find out its wattage first. Look for a number followed by the letter “W” (for “watts”).Many if not most devices that are often included in travel usually use fewer watts (generally between 23W and 50W). However, devices that generate heat (like irons and hair dryers) use far more, as much as 1000W or 2000W.
Some labels may provide information about “amps” (expressed as “A”) instead of wattage. If this is the case, multiply the number of amps by the voltage to determine the wattage. For instance, 120V x 6A = 720W.

, First, decide between “step-down” converters (to be used with devices in the 100-125V range in countries with higher voltage) or “step-up” converters (for devices in the 220-240 range in countries with lower voltage).Next, determine which of your devices are “electric” and which are “electronic,” since not all converters work for both.Then search for converters with at least two to three times as many watts than the wattage needed by your devices. For instance, if your device uses 50W, choose a converter with at least 100W or 150W.This may seem like more wattage than necessary, but many devices use more wattage than indicated when they are first turned on and “power up” before they settle down into normal mode.
It’s better to have more watts than needed than fewer, so always err on the side of caution if possible and go with one that has three times as many watts than needed.
Electric devices have mechanical motors and/or heating elements (such as a hair dryer), while electronics operate by chips and circuits (like a smartphone).

"
"
Find out what your hotel provides.,
Try to eliminate the need for converters.,
Be selective when packing.",How to Choose a Travel Adapter3," Expect many hotels to be long accustomed to meeting international travelers’ needs. Before you start shopping for adapters and converters, call ahead and ask what accommodations are already available where you’ll be staying. For example, they may offer upon request:


Electric devices like hair dryers and irons.Adapters and/or converters.
Designated outlets providing the required voltage for your single-voltage devices., Expect converters to be bigger and more expensive than adapters. If possible, leave any devices that are single voltage at home. Save yourself some money while freeing up more luggage space at the same time. Consider how long you’ll be abroad, and if you really need a particular device for all that time. For example:If you intend on bringing your single-voltage laptop as well as your dual-voltage smartphone or tablet, consider leaving the laptop behind. Ask yourself what you intend to do with it while abroad, and if you could do the same with your phone or tablet.

, Whether you’re going to one destination or many, reduce the number of adaptors that you’ll need by being picky with what you bring. Ask yourself what you really need and what you can do without or easily substitute with another item. For instance:Favor battery-operated devices (like cameras or electric toothbrushes) over plug-in varieties.
Opt for manual devices to use instead of your electric ones, like disposable razors instead of your electric razor.
Purchasing new devices upon arrival for longer stays abroad, like an electric beard trimmer.

If you start to feel lonely or homesick, just take a moment to look at the pictures you brought. Remember how much your family and friends mean to you and think about how happy you will be to see each other when you return.Make copies of your favorite photographs and take them with you. This way you won't lose the original copies if your luggage gets lost or stolen.;
, Furnishing the place you're staying when you travel with things you like to have around you at home will make it seem a little less foreign. Pack a favorite blanket, comfortable slippers, or even your daily coffee cup to take a little piece of home with you.Even if you plan on packing light, consider bringing some small comfort items that will make your travel experience more comfortable, and remind you of home at the same time.

, Sometimes having a tangible thing to touch and feel can be very reassuring when you’re lonely or homesick. Take this item out and hold it or wear it whenever you start to feel homesick. The texture, the smell – all of the physical attributes of the thing – will remind you of home and, hopefully, begin to make you feel a little less homesick.Take a small stuffed animal, or a favorite t-shirt that reminds you of a good experience. Or maybe you should bring your lucky keychain or a favorite bracelet. Maybe it’s your favorite pillow to sleep with at night.

, Keeping up certain routines while you’re away can often help alleviate feelings of homesickness. This can make you feel like you brought a piece of home with you.

This includes things like exercising daily, listening to music, taking a yoga class, keeping up with a book club at home, writing in your journal, or taking a morning stroll.

, Cheer yourself up by buying souvenirs and gifts for the people you miss. Looking for the perfect gift will help occupy your free time and, when you find something that reminds you of them, you can anticipate seeing them again.Try to buy thoughtful gifts that show your loved ones you were thinking of them while you were gone. Spending time to find a thoughtful present is a great way to alleviate homesickness.
But remember to stay within your budget. Your loved ones wouldn’t want you overspending on your trip because you bought too many expensive gifts.

, Hearing the voices of loved ones will make them seem less far away. Take time to call home and tell the ones you miss that you love them. Staying in contact will help you feel less homesick while you’re traveling.In today’s technologically advanced world, keeping in touch is easier than ever. You can call or text your loved ones, or you can video message with them using apps like Skype or FaceTime. You can also send international texts through online messaging apps like WhatsApp or Viber.

, Do some of the things you like to do at home while you are traveling in a new location. Find a good bookstore to browse if you miss your favorite one or find a local eatery that makes a great burger that resembles burgers you get at home.Experiencing new things is one of the most exciting parts of traveling. But if you mix in a few reminders of home as well, this can help you enjoy the experience more overall.

, One of the best ways to acclimate to a new location is to go exploring. Familiarize yourself with your new surroundings so that it doesn’t seem so foreign. This will help you feel more at home while you’re traveling.

Try taking a walk each day to a new part of town. Even if you stay in your own neighborhood, this can still be a very grounding exercise.

, Document your travels by taking a lot of pictures. You’ll want to remember your time away once you return home, and photos are great mementos for you to bring home with you.

Additionally, you can post the photos on your social media accounts to stay connected to friends and family at home while you are traveling.

, Create some semblance of a routine for yourself to avoid homesickness if you're staying somewhere for a long period. Activities such as going to the same coffee shop every morning will give you a sense of familiarity with your surroundings that will comfort you.People will begin to recognize you if you start frequenting the same places. Once starts to happen, you will feel more of a sense of community with the new location, like you belong.

, Talking with other people from your native country or home state will make you feel a little less out of place when you travel. Seek out a pub or bar that televises your favorite sport and enjoy some camaraderie with some new friends to forget that you're far from home.Spending time with other travelers will help you feel less lonely and give you an outlet to vent about any problems you may encounter or homesickness you might be feeling.

, Splurge on a fancy restaurant meal, an exotic new coat, or a pair of boots when you travel. You'll feel good about yourself and will appreciate the area where you're traveling more by enjoying some of the nicer things the region has to offer.This can help you focus more on creating a positive experience for yourself, rather than focusing on how much you miss home.

, Create a list of all of the things you want to do, see, or experience while you are traveling. Make an effort to do each thing and then cross them off as you work your way through the list. This will give you something to focus on and create goals for you to achieve while you’re away from home.

Include things like restaurants you want to eat at, local tourist sites you want to visit, various local cuisines you want to try, or any other local experience you can’t get at home.

Discuss objectives and plans for the trip.",How to Choose a Traveling Companion," If you're an outdoor enthusiast and your traveling companion is a fashionista, your objectives for your trip may differ greatly. If you select someone who is interested in many of the things you are, the two of you will enjoy visiting similar sites. This does not mean, though, that you and your traveling companion must have identical interests. During the trip, you may choose to do different things, but it's always nice to be able to share some experiences while traveling.;
, Choosing someone who must constantly personalize arrangements to suit his or her individual tastes or needs will result in a travel partner who is high maintenance. If plans go awry, an overly picky travel companion may become so upset over little details that he will ruin the rest of the trip for you. Additionally, avoid any potential travel companion with traits you already find to be annoying. These traits may become even more annoying when traveling together.

, If one of you plans to go first class and the other can only afford coach, at least one person may spend much of the vacation unhappy (and, possibly overextended). Clearly identify your expectations for the trip, accommodations you plan to acquire and the type of dining you expect to enjoy while traveling. If your expectations are similar, you may have found a potentially great travel partner.

, If you can't travel to the nearest city together and happily spend a day and night seeing the sights, it's unlikely that you can endure and enjoy a longer trip together. This test trip can be an overnight or a weekend trip. Make note of anything disconcerting, such as a travel companion who snores or pawns his luggage off on you. If you decide to travel with this person, come prepared to deal with any peculiarities you've noticed.

, Let your travel companion know about anything you feel you must see or do. Be open to anything your travel partner feels is a necessity to her part of the trip. Get expectations for the trip out in the open and compare any differences.

Look at your hobbies.,
Flip through your history books.,
Check out your favorite movies and novels.,
Think about your favorite foods.",How to Choose a Destination As a First Time Traveler1," One of the best ways you can decide on a good destination is by reviewing the hobbies you enjoy in your everyday life, as these can provide valuable insight into what kind of a place you would enjoy visiting. For example, if you do karate or capoeira in your spare time, you might want to consider going to Japan or Brazil, respectively, where you can explore the history and current manifestations of these ancient folk practices. Or, if you play an instrument in your local orchestra, you could consider going on a tour of European capitals with historic orchestral groups and theaters.Even if your hobby doesn’t have a particular geographical or cultural origin, you can still use it to guide your travel destination decision-making. For example, if you’re a big film buff, you could look for domestic and international film festivals taking place around the time you want to travel.;
, When thinking about what places you might want to visit, think about your historical interests. If you’re still in school, flip back through your textbooks and see if you remember any units which interested you in particular. If you’re out of school, take a look at your home library or internet search history to see what kinds of historical topics, cultures, and events have interested you in the past. You’ll be amazed how actually visiting the historic sites you’ve read about can change your perspective and enhance your understanding.For example, if you’ve got tons of books on the Gold Rush or ancient Chinese dynasties, you might consider a road trip through the American West or a sight-seeing tour of Beijing as potential points of destination.
Don’t limit yourself to the bookshelf! Check out your Netflix and Amazon cues to see what kind of historical documentaries—if any—you tend to watch, or flip through your favorite channels for any clues.

, You might not be a fan of non-fiction or history, but this doesn’t mean you don’t have certain cultural or historical interests. Think about your favorite movies, novels, and music and ask if you'd be interested in visiting any of the places depicted in them. For example, If you’ve read the complete canon of Fyodor Dostoevsky or William Butler Yeats, you might want to experience the cities—St. Petersburg and Dublin, respectively—which influenced these literary giants.


Just because your favorite movie is Ben-Hur, doesn’t mean you have to go to Jerusalem or Rome for your first destination. Filming locations often differ from their fictional setting, so you could make your objective to visit particular filming locations rather than the places in the story.
Don’t write off this option just because your favorite fiction takes place in fantasy worlds. Game of Thrones, for example, films on several locations in Northern Ireland, and you can tour the elaborate sets and locations of Lord of the Rings in New Zealand., If you live in a big city with the world’s cuisine at your fingertips, you might think that traveling across country borders to taste some authentic Thai, Indian, or French food seems a bit pointless or extravagant. In fact, though, many restaurants adapt their authentic dishes to meet the pricing expectations and taste preferences of the country in which they operate.It’s fairly safe to say, then, that you'll learn loads more about your favorite cuisine if you visit its birthplace.


With the growing popularity of culinary and baking shows, there are many organized tours across the world devoted specifically to culinary history and tasting.Or, if you’re more of a lone wolf when it comes to lifestyle and traveling, you might want to plan your own itinerary using a favorite cookbook or the recommendations of a travel journalist, such as Anthony Bourdain or Rick Steves."

Ask yourself if you’re going primarily to relax.,
Consider how important authentic cultural experience and exposure is.,
Decide if you want your travel to include physical adventure.,
Take stock of your party priorities.",How to Choose a Destination As a First Time Traveler2," Most experienced travelers automatically base their travel plans off of their intentions and priorities for vacation: for example, experienced senior citizen travelers know they’re going abroad for some rest and relaxation, so they choose low-key destinations with plentiful amenities. Take a page from these seasoned ramblers and ask yourself what you want out of your first big destination. If you automatically think about relaxing on a beach, sipping margaritas, and getting spa treatments and massages, chances are you’re looking for some relaxation out of your vacation.


Cruises, resorts, and sea-side hotels are all great options for the traveler seeking respite. If you need help deciding what soothing option is your best one, consult a travel agent regarding the relative comfort and services offered at a variety of restful resorts and locations.Don’t forget to factor distance and travel time into your plans. You might have found the most relaxing island halfway across the world, but, if it requires a twenty-hour flight and multiple stopovers, you might not return home as rested and refreshed as you had hoped.

, While popular travel shows such as Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern assume authentic cultural interaction is a priority, not all people really want this from their travel destinations. Travelers wanting to sunbathe by the Mediterranean or stroll around a cruise ship, for example, probably don’t want a dose of culture shock mixed into their relaxation remedy.


If you’re interested in the people, politics, or native arts scene, though, you should place cultural exposure high on your list of priorities. Cross off cruises, tourist resorts, guided excursions, and kitschy commercial districts such as Times Square in Manhattan or Puerto Vallarta in Mexico as viable options and look for more off-the-grid destinations.Remember that your history-heavy itinerary—especially if it’s guided by an agency or official group—probably won’t offer much genuine cross-cultural exchange. So, if this kind of exchange is important to you, make sure you carve out some independent time to roam the local markets or talk to some locals at a café.

, Massive metropolises such as New York City, Mumbai, and Moscow offer plenty of options for physical activity—for example, urban hiking, indoor laser tag, and even urban bungee-jumping—but your access to the wilderness and associated activities such as camping, hiking, and fishing will be restricted. If daily activity, fresh air, and exposure to the wilderness are important to you, choose a rural destination with proximity to natural landmarks such as mountain ranges, lakes, rivers, forests, and canyons.


Since you’ll be traveling in a remote location while engaging in vigorous physical activity, you should take the risk of getting injured seriously. Have your doctor give you a thorough check-up before you embark to make sure you’re fit enough to handle the potential hazards of your travel adventure.Yearning for some natural landscapes doesn’t mean you have to forego the city experience entirely. Many smaller cities such as Belfast, Denver, and Lucerne are just minutes away from impressive landmarks and wild terrain which you can explore.

, Depending on your age and your daily habits, you might think that eating, drinking, and dancing constitute an important part of traveling. If you’re excited about getting dressed up and going out on the town, consider choosing a major urban center or a mid-size town with a reputation for serious recreation and nightlife. If you plan on curling up by the fire with a book by 9 pm every night and rising early every morning, you might want to avoid big party destinations in order to avoid the crowds and noise attendant to these places.


Dubrovnik in Croatia, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Bali in Indonesia, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates are some of the most renowned international hot spots for late night—and all-day!—partying."

Look over your accounts and available credit.,
Check out travel websites and promotion offers.,
Look for car, bus or train accessible destinations.,
Compare travel fees with location-specific cost of living.,
Recruit friends or family to travel with you.",How to Choose a Destination As a First Time Traveler3," Don’t dash your traveling dreams just because you’re watching your wallet. No matter what the constraints on your cash, you can find a number of finance-friendly travel destinations. Assess how much money you have in savings, what kind of payment you can expect from your job while on vacation, how much available credit you have, and how much money you ultimately want to spend on your travels.


Make sure you check out the interest rates on your credit card before using it to book your flight or hotel.
If you’re thinking of traveling internationally, don’t forget to factor in the costs of passport processing and other visa-related fees. Depending on where you live and where you’re going, these can range from negligible amounts to significant sources of spending., Once you’ve figured out how much money you can spend on your destination, browse through some popular booking sites such as expedia.com, momondo.com, and hotwire.com. These resources allow you to search based on destination while comparing rates from different companies and providers. In addition to searching by destination and date, check out the section on the site that lists special offers and deals.


If you have some flexibility with your travel dates, try checking the ‘My dates are flexible’ box below the search field. Ticket prices can vary significantly on a day-to-day basis, so this option can save you big bucks with minimal effort., Many of the booking sites where you search for flights and hotels also offer prices and booking for terrestrial travel options. If you have a car, look up the distance to road trip accessible locations and calculate the cost of gasoline and other vehicle maintenance-related fees. Use a site like gasbuddy.com to help you estimate fuel costs if you need assistance in your calculations.Don’t forget to weigh your cheaper, land-bound transport options against the duration of travel. Many trains and buses will get you somewhere dirt-cheap, but they might take 24, 48, or even 72-plus hours to do so. If time is no issue, this is still a great option! If you only have a week total to enjoy your holiday, though, you should consider selecting a closer destination, or someplace far away but offering a good deal on flights.

, In addition to calculating the cost of transport to your potential destinations, research local prices and typical expenses in the place you’re thinking of going. After all, some far-away locales may cost a pretty penny for the flight, but the cost of hotels, food, and entertainment might be paltry relative to what you spend in your hometown. In contrast, some domestic destinations might be comparatively cheap to drive or bus to, but the daily expenses there are quite pricey.All-inclusive resorts can also be a good, budget-friendly option. With an all-inclusive package, all of your meals and drinks are included in a flat fee for your lodging. This means that you don't have to research local cost of living or watch your spending while vacationing.
While you can easily research hotel costs online, it can be a bit more difficult to find out how much per diem expenses such as local groceries, restaurants, beverages, and transportation will be. You can find this out by looking at various travel review sites and blogs, such as priceoftravel.com and budgetyourtrip.com.

, No matter what destination looks appealing to you, consider asking a friend or family member to come along. Not only will your travels be all the merrier, but you can split the costs of gasoline if you’re driving and hotels if you’re getting a shared room.Even if they can’t come along with you and lighten some of the financial load, friends and family can be a good source of travel recommendations. Ask them if they’ve been to any fun places which were also wallet-friendly.

Use an online tool to randomly generate a destination.,
Draw a destination from a hat.,
Review safety-related warnings and travel advisories for the area.",How to Choose a Destination As a First Time Traveler4," You might want to approach your search as a first time traveler as an adventure in and of itself. As long as you’re a fairly open-minded, easygoing person, you can pick a location using a random destination generator available online. Sites like travelsp.in, geomidpoint.com, earthroulette.com, and jauntaroo.com allow you to enter some general constraints and find a destination with the click of a button.


Only use random point generators like geomidpoint.com if cost is not a major concern. If you are on a budget, use a site like jauntaroo.com, as it takes finances and other preferences into consideration.

, If you are interested in several locations but don’t know how to whittle down your options, you can leave the final choice up to chance! Write down five to ten destinations you’re considering on slips of paper, fold them up, and shake them in a hat or basket. Pick just one at random and you’ll have your destination decision!


If you want to make the process even more exciting and unpredictable, have friends and family write down destinations they think you should visit. Choose from these crowd-sourced destinations rather than working from your own list.

, Before purchasing tickets to your spontaneous get-away, do some basic research to make sure your impromptu itinerary is a safe one. Review government travel advisory sites such as https://travel.state.gov or https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice in order to find out if there are any current environmental or social problems which could endanger your stay. You should also look into medical services so you’ll be sure that, in the case of emergency, you’ll be able to find the proper care.


Don’t forget to check out specific social customs which could single you out in particular. For example, some destinations are less safe for LGBTQ individuals or single women, so figure out beforehand if your identity could put you in jeopardy in a particular area and culture.You should also research how much of an issue property-related crimes such as pick-pocketing or mugging are. Relatively high rates of pick-pocketing don’t mean you have to rule the destination out, but you should take certain measures such as passport belts which strap on under your shirt and mobile safes to lock up your valuables."

Estimate the amount of money you wish to exchange.,
Look up the exchange rate of the currency to which you wish to convert.,
Calculate how much money you'll have after the exchange.,
Check for an up-to-date conversion rate online.,
Contact the government for accurate exchange rates.,
Google the conversion you want to know.,
Ask your bank.,
Use a currency exchange service.,
Use an ATM in a foreign country.",How to Calculate Exchange Rate," Think about how much money you're budgeting for the trip. Or, if you know how much money you'll need in the other country, work backwards and start with the foreign currency.;
, You can find this information on a Google search, or on several banking or financial websites.


Note that you want to set the currency you have to 1; the value listed next to the currency you're exchanging to is the exchange rate.

, Multiply the money you've budgeted by the exchange rate. The answer is how much money you'll have after the exchange. If ""a"" is the money you have in one currency and ""b"" is the exchange rate, then ""c"" is how much money you'll have after the exchange. So a * b = c, and a = c/b.


For instance, say you want to convert US dollars to Euros. At the time of this revision, 1 US dollar is worth 0.7618 Euro. Your exchange rate is 0.7618. If you're planning on taking $1500 US dollars with you, you would multiply 1500 by 0.7618. The answer, 1142.7, is how much money you'll have in Euros after the exchange.
Here's an example of the ""work backwards"" method. Say that you know you'll need 20,000 Hungarian forints for your trip. You discover that 1 US dollar is equivalent to 226.43 forints. To figure out how many US dollars you would need to save at the current exchange rate, divide 20,000 by 226.43. The answer, 88.33, is how many US dollars you need to exchange.

, There are many websitesthat constantly update their site with the current conversion rates for currencies around the world. These are good places to look for the exchange rate, then use the equation in Step 3 above to calculate currency totals.

, You can contact the Department of Treasuryor other governmental agenciesto get up-to-date information about exchange rates for converting currency.

, Simply type into a Google search bar what conversion you want to make and Google will tell you the answer using their currency converter.For example, if you want to know what the exchange rate for $1,000 US to Euros is, type 1000 dollars to euros in any Google search bar and it will tell you the answer.
However, because Google's finance converter does not constantly track and update current currency exchange rates, this information is more of an estimate and should not be relied on as accurate up-to-the-minute data.

, Many banks, especially larger ones like Bank of America or Wells Fargo, keep foreign currency on hand in the branch.You can go to the bank and pick them up directly or order them online. And, even if you are not a customer, these banks will usually allow you to exchange currency for a fee.


If your bank's branch does not keep he currency on hand, they can often order it for you. This usually takes about 2-5 business days.Note: Many smaller banks and credit unions are unable to exchange foreign currency., Most major airports have currency exchange services that use companies like Travelexto help travelers exchange their home country's money when they arrive in a new destination.


These services often charge much higher fees than exchanging currency at a bank because they are in prime locations (like airports) where people need local currency quickly.

, Sometimes the easiest way to exchange money is to simply use your card at an ATM while you are traveling. Your bank will probably charge you a foreign transaction fee that is a percentage of the entire amount withdrawn (usually 1-3%)in addition to other fees for using another bank's ATM.

Evaluate the travel journal's size.,
Eyeball the journal's format.,
Open the journal wide and rifle through the pages.,
Examine the journal's cover material and what the pages are made of.,
Open and shut the clasp on the journal--if it has a clasp--several times to make sure the mechanism is easy to operate and secure enough to hold the journal closed, even if you shake it vigorously.

,
Look for a way to slip a pen or pencil into the journal.",How to Buy a Travel Journal," It should be small enough to carry with you unobtrusively, but not so tiny that writing in it or reading it is difficult.


If you're going to be traveling for a long time, odds are that you're going to be living in one or two pairs of pants and carrying one pack or purse with you constantly. Check to make sure any journals you're considering will either fit in your pants pocket or in your pack/purse, so you always have the journal ready to hand.;
, Most journals will have evenly ruled pages, but if you plan to include sketches or keepsakes from your trip--such as local newspaper clippings, ticket stubs, postcards or receipts--you might prefer a journal with completely blank pages.

, The binding should be sturdy and all the pages secure.


If the journal is ring-bound the rings should be large enough to let you turn the pages easily, and strong enough not to deform from being repeatedly packed, unpacked and handled.

,


Leather is both attractive and sturdy as a cover material. Fabric-covered covers are reasonably sturdy and attractive. Plastic covers might be less attractive but stand up very well to abuse.
Purchasing a journal with acid-free pages will help preserve your travel memories for longer. You can also purchase waterproof or water-resistant travel journals, if you're concerned about ruining your journal in wet conditions.

A place you've always wanted to visit, but want to see from a less-touristy perspective.;
,


Places where you speak at least a bit of the local language.
Safety. Some governments list travel alerts and warnings for disease outbreaks, politic problems and local unrest. In the United States, you can access the U.S. State Department's alerts and warnings lists at travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_1766.html or travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html respectively.

, For many people, adventure travel also means thrifty living. Roughing it is part of the experience. But if you're going to have any money to spend on luxuries, calculate it now.

, A few good places to look for leads include:


Online forums dedicated to the adventure sport you want to try (if any), forums dedicated to the country you want to visit, or general adventure travel forums.
Travel guidebooks.
Major adventure- or travel-oriented magazines, newspapers and websites. You can even find adventure travel information in the Lifestyle section of magazines and websites from other fields, like Forbes.com.

, Does this service conduct trips to this locale, or with this kind of activity, very frequently? Have any injuries or fatalities ever happened? If so, how were they dealt with?

Don't be shy about Googling your potential guide's name to search for news articles, searching for guide service reviews online or asking for contact information for former clients so that you can get an honest read on the experience.

, Some items that might or might not be included are:


Travel costs,
Lodging and meals,
Travel and trip cancellation insurance,
Special gear needed,
Tips or small gifts of appreciation for the guides.

, Make sure to inquire about cancellation or rescheduling policies before you sign on the dotted line.

, The guide service should also be able to give you general advice about visa, passport and immunization requirements for traveling in that country.

, For example, in some cultures it's rude to sit with the bottoms of your feet pointing toward another person. One region's friendly salutation might be considered an obscene gesture in another country.

,

Some credit card companies promise to cover your car insurance if you use the card to pay for the rental, but this offer is not valid with all credit cards or in all countries.
Consider purchasing travel insurance specifically intended for use during adventure travel. Typical travel insurance policies might not cover you if you get injured while performing a hazardous activity, like rock climbing.

Learn about the country.,
Attempt basic phrases.,
Try to meet someone who knows about or has been to the country.,
Have a basic understanding of customs.,
Handle your money well.",How to Behave in a Foreign Country," Get a base of knowledge. Where is the country located? What are their traditional foods? These and other questions should be answered. If you know someone who has lived in/been to the country in question, ask them to tell you a bit about the country.;
, If you do not know how to speak their language, it will be hard to master the entire language in a short amount of time. If you have previously taken the language, brush up on it. If you have never spoken the language, buy a dictionary (i.e. an English to French dictionary, not a French to English dictionary). You may want to invest in a computer language program, or a tutor to help you learn key phrases. Remember that you will not have time to learn the entire language so focus on things like; asking for directions, ordering in restaurants, asking and telling time, and money transactions. Learn these phrases along with the basic please, thank you, hello, and goodbye. Remember that with a polite attitude and a smile, your basic language skills will be forgiven.

, If it is a country like France or Spain, you may want to ask a French or Spanish teacher from a local high school. Chances are they will not only know the language very well, but will have spent time there. If it is a less known country, you may be out of luck. In this case, search the Internet and the library. You will be better able to learn from a person, but books can be just as resourceful!

, If you are being tutored in the language, ask your tutor to teach you some of their customs. However, when all else fails, don't point, don't shout, and always say please and thank you. If you do end up in a tangle because of your lack of customs, calmly explain that you are foreign and that it was an accident. Basic English customs are not the same around the world (especially as you get into Asia and Africa) but will provide as a base for most European countries.

, Money can be confusing, but cover all your bases. Understand the name of the monetary unit (i.e. dollars) and know the names of the coins/bills within the unit (i.e ten-dollar bill, quarters). Do this in your own country before heading off. Exchange your bills a couple of weeks before you go and practice recognizing them. Know the basic conversion (i.e. one pound is about two dollars). Recognize fair prices and know how to make basic money transactions.

Waterproof digital cameras are also available. Be sure the batteries are charged and take along an extra set of batteries for back up.;
, For winter whale-watching trips, a pair of gloves is important. Take a warm sweatshirt during any season, as mornings and evenings can be surprisingly chilly, even on the hottest days.

, Include at least one pair of extra socks if you're whale watching during the winter.

, A hat with a strap is best, as hats have a habit of blowing away with the wind. Brimmed hats are best, as caps will leave your ears exposed to the wind and sun.

, Although water is crucial in hot weather, dehydration can occur even on cool, damp days.

, Take along a sunscreen with a SPF of 30 or more. Apply your sunscreen 30 to 45 minutes before boarding, then reapply regularly. The reflection of the sun on the water will burn your skin very quickly, even on an overcast day.

,, If you're prone to seasickness, pack saltine crackers to settle your stomach during the whale-watching cruise, then nibble on a cracker every 15 to 20 minutes.

, Include a few bandages and antiseptic cream. Don't forget your prescription or over-the-counter seasick medication. Take the first dose before you board the boat, then repeat as directed by your doctor, or as suggested on the package. Include prescription medications if your trip is more than a few hours. Toss in a tube of lip gloss to protect your lips from the salt air. A lip gloss or balm with sunscreen is a good choice.

Buy Hawaii clothing and souvenirs once you arrive in Hawaii.,
Don't forget your swimsuit!,
Pack a according to a list.",How to Pack for a Week in Hawaii," During the days, the average temperature is between 81 and 88 and at nights, the average temperature can range between 68 and 75. August is the hottest month, while January is the coolest. Bags should be packed with loose clothing; jeans are a good suggestion for those cool nights.;
, Maps are another great suggestion since some of the best things about Hawaii are hidden, for example hiking trails and beaches.

, ABC Stores, Walmart, and Longs Drugs have some of the best clothing apparel and items to take back with you. But, be aware that if you do buy polyester, flower-print clothing, you will stick out like a sore thumb.

,


If you wear prescription goggles and want to go snorkeling, bring those with you too, so you can see all the colorful fish there!







, You'll want to write your own, depending on just what you plan to do in Hawaii, but here are some ideas:

5-6 casual t-shirts and tank tops. Make sure these go with your shorts!
3-4 pairs of comfortable shorts. Pack a variety of shorts, but they should be comfortable. Be aware, when you are packing your clothes, that this list is meant to be mixed and matched. Stick with simple blue denim, white, and black shorts, and be wary of patterns.
1 pair of jeans. Only one pair of jeans is really necessary. These are for dinners and outdoor activities like horseback riding.
2 casual blouses or shirts. This one was obviously geared towards the ladies. If you're a man, opt instead for polo shirts, or button-ups. Steer away from suits and ties. A very slim amount of dining facilities in Hawaii require a strictly formal dress code.
2-3 bathing suits. This one is important, especially if you plan on spending time near the water. Three bathing suits is ideal, but a minimum of two is perfectly okay. This way, you can alternate drying them. Make sure you place one suit in your carry-on bag, just in case you have some slight luggage complication. Even if you are a guy, do not skip out on this suggestion. Putting on a cold, damp swimsuit is never fun.
2 suit cover-ups. This one is especially a must if you plan on shopping shortly after spending a day at the beach. Make one of the cover ups a full coverage (sheer is fine) cover up. For ladies, a sarong is great. These can tie around the waist and serve as a cute, bohemian cover up, and serve multiple functions.
2-3 sundresses/skirts. Ladies, these are very cute when done right. Maxi dresses and maxi skirts are wonderful tropical destination attires. Be wary when selecting these dresses and skirts. Sea breezes can be quite strong along the coast, and short dresses/skirts when not tight/form fitting, are quite likely to blow up and over, which may cause for an embarrassing situation. Sundresses can also double as swimsuit cover ups.
1 nice outfit for semi-formal outings. It's perfectly fine to have one well put together dressy outfit for nights out. Girls, think casual dresses and wedges/flats/dress sandals. Guys, think button up with khakis and a pair of flip flops.
1-2 pajama combinations. Opt for leggings/sweatpants with normal T-shirts. These can double as comfortable and casual outfits for the airport.
5 pairs of socks. Self-explanatory. You may want to add a few to this number and always keep an extra pair or two in your day bag- Socks are easily soiled, and damp/wet socks are annoying, and are very likely to irk you if you are required to walk around in them.
8 pairs of underwear. Alternate the styles to fit your outfits. For example, T-backs and seamless styles are far more suitable for spandex like clothing.
5 bras. Neutral colors and versatile styles are best. Nude, black, white. Racerback, sports bra, strapless, etc.
2 active outfits if you plan on rigorous outdoor activity. Opt for breathable, fast drying materials. If you plan on working out, pack yourself some spandex shorts, yoga pants, etc. Don't forget compression shorts and other necessities.

Think about what you'll be wearing over your shirts to help you decide what to pack.
If you, say, plan on wearing a button down shirt over a t-shirt, pick a color that goes well with the button-down.
Wools and polyesters are good materials for base layers.;
, Presentation layers are the outermost layers of an outfit besides a coat or jacket. These are the clothes people will see you wearing indoors, so pick items you like.Pick items that are fashionable but can easily conceal base layers. Example includes tunics, light sweaters, and cardigans.

, Once you have your layers in place, add a jacket. Remember, if you're layering, this will keep you warm. Therefore, you do not need to take up suitcase space unnecessarily with a big, bulky jacket.For a warmer destination, you may be able to get by with a light zip-up denim or fleece jacket.
For a colder destination, go for a bigger, bulkier jacket. However, you do not need to pack something like a parka if you're dressing in layers.

, You also want to keep your feet and legs warm. Pack items with this in mind. Jeans and corduroy pants are great presentation layers, as they can easily be worn over things like leggings, tights, and long underwear.You should also pack multiple pairs of warm socks. It's important to keep your feet warm when traveling over the winter.

Have shoes as your one heavy item.,
Pack plenty of hats.,
Pack gloves and mittens.,
Bring some sunglasses.,
Do not neglect sunscreen just because it's winter.",How to Pack for a Winter Trip2," You want to keep your suitcase as light as possible. However, one heavy item you should pack is shoes. Pack big, warm shoes or boots that will protect your feet during winter travel.Pack shoes that are weatherproof. Water resistant shoes are important, especially if you anticipate snow or rain.
You should also pack darker shoes or boots, as they're likely to get stained with mud, slush, and other weather-related substances.
Try to pack shoes you can take on and off easily if you're flying, as you'll want to get through security fast.

, Hats are vital for a winter trip. You will need to wear hats when out to keep your head warm. Opt for a hat that covers your ears and part of the back of your neck. Avoid hats that have bulky, unnecessary materials like puffballs or flaps.When choosing a hat, be reasonable about how often you'll be outdoors. If you're just going to be moving from, say, a car to a restaurant, club, or so on, you can go for a lighter hat and save some space.
If you're going to be spending a lot of time outdoors during your trip, pick a bigger hat that covers more of your face.

, If you're going to be spending a lot of time outdoors, gloves and mittens are important. However, you don't necessarily need big, bulky gloves or mittens to stay warm. Instead, look for light weatherproof gloves that you can easily pack.You should also make sure the gloves you choose have some grip on them.
Quick drying gloves can also be great in the winter.

, It can get bright out, even in the winter. Do not forget to pack sunglasses. Snow can reflect light into your eyes, which can be dangerous when driving. Opt for polarized sunglasses for optimal protection., The sun can damage your skin even in the winter time. Pack sunscreen for your trip and wear it each day. In addition to sunscreen, bring a lip balm that protects your lips from the sun."

Roll softer items and fold stiffer ones.,
Pack heavy items on the bottom and lighter ones on top.,
Place what you'll need first on top.,
Fill gaps with smaller items.",How to Pack for a Winter Trip3," Rolling up items can save a lot of space in your suitcase, but not all items should be rolled. Stiffer wardrobe items and accessories are likely to wrinkle when rolled, so fold these items. Softer, lighter items should be rolled up prior to storage.Things like underwear, jeans, cotton pants, and knit items can usually be rolled.
Heavier fabrics, like dress shirts, blazers, skirts, and dress pants should be folded.

, This will make your suitcase easier to carry. As you pack, be aware of your item's weight. Heavier items, such as shoes, should go near the bottom. Lighter items, like gloves, underwear, and light hats, should go on the top., You should also think about how you'll use your items. This will save you time when you get to your destination. Pack items you'll need right away at the top so you have easy access to them.For example, if you're getting in at night, pack your pajamas near the top of your suitcase.

, When you're packing, hold off on packing smaller items. Wait until you've packed your bigger items to find a place for smaller things. You can make the most of your suitcase's space by filling in gaps with tiny items. Thinks like, say, underwear can be packed in gaps between your shirts and pants."

Check the weather at your destination.,
Decide on your luggage.,
Maximize your laptop bag.,
Use your pockets.,
Pack only the clothes you need.,
Choose clothes you can wear for multiple purposes or events.,
Limit your shoes.,
Limit your jewelry.,
Decide what you can leave at home.,
Buy travel sizes.,
Pack only essential makeup.",How to Pack for a Two Day Trip," This will narrow your decisions of what to wear and pack. Warmer, tropical climates allow for lighter articles of clothing, such as shorts and tank tops. Colder climates require heavier clothes that would keep you warm, such as jackets, sweaters and coats.


Pack a small umbrella if the forecast calls for rain. If an unexpected deluge happens at a time that you absolutely must be outside, ask your host or front desk at the hotel if you can borrow a larger umbrella.;
, Since you are only going on a two-day trip, smaller luggage is ideal. Some good options are a backpack, duffel bag, or small rolling suitcase. You can maximize limited space with a few packing tips. You could:


Roll clothes that won’t wrinkle. These are usually tee-shirts, jeans, and casual clothes made of cotton. Place them in the bottom of your bag.
Fold clothes that can wrinkle. This includes cotton dress shirts and anything made of silk or satin. Place them on top of rolled items.Fold longer articles in half. This includes trousers and long skirts. To create even layers, drape the top of the second article on top of the bottom of the first.Make use of spaces that remain. Look for smaller spaces between layers and between articles of clothing. Tuck socks, underwear, and chargers in these spaces.

, Make use of its additional space. In addition to your computer, use pockets for any necessary paper documents. Smaller pockets can fit MP3 players, ear buds, cell phones, flash drives, and business cards. Larger pockets can fit chargers and small adapters.

, Keys, small cell phones and MP3 players are small enough to fit in your pockets. If you’re flying remember to remove them from your pockets have them x-rayed at the security checkpoint. If you’re flying during the winter, put everything in your coat pockets for an easy one-step scan.

, Make a list of the activities you've planned. This will narrow your choices to the necessities. For example, if you're planning on sightseeing one day and a beach party the next, you won't need high heels or a formal dress. Sensible choices include:


2 shirts/blouses
2 trousers/jeans/skirts/shorts
3 pairs of underwear
1 set of pajamas
3 pairs of socks/pantyhose

, Narrow your color choices to neutral tones, which work for any occasion.Wear the same outfit en route each way. Good choices for versatile clothes include:


A white shirt or blouse
Black, brown, or gray trousers/skirt
Black, brown, or gray sandals
Black athletic shoes, when worn with trousers

, Unless you have multiple events planned during your two days away, you'll probably only need the shoes you're wearing. If you need to pack an extra pair of shoes, wear the heavier shoes en route, and pack the lighter shoes in your luggage. To prevent your clothes from getting dirty, wrap your shoes in a plastic bag., For a two-day trip, you should only pack (or wear) the jewelry that you absolutely need. You can save space in your luggage by limiting yourself to what you plan to wear en route. If you plan to attend any formal events, choose which of your jewelry is appropriate for multiple occasions. Some examples include:


Watch
Wedding band/engagement ring
Simple gold or silver necklace
Stud earrings

, The more you can leave at home, the lighter your luggage will be. Check with your hotel ahead of time for a list of what will be provided. Most accommodations provide clothes irons, shampoo, conditioner, soap and/or shower gel. Some locations provide hair dryers, sewing kits, cotton balls, cotton swabs, and hand/body lotion.


If you’re staying with friends or relatives, ask what they have on hand and if they’re willing to share. As a friendly gesture, offer to repay them with a meal, movie ticket, gift card, etc.

, Even if you're not flying, opt for travel-sized containers. Pack them in an easily accessible pocket or compartment in your laptop bag or purse. If you are flying, this will make the security check easier. Toiletries available in sizes of 3.4 fluid ounces (100mL) or less include:Toothpaste
Mouthwash
Deodorant
Sunscreen
Hair gel
Hairspray

, Narrow down which cosmetics to pack by considering which one or two facial features you want to bring out. If you have skin issues that you usually conceal, pack your concealer and facial powder for efficient coverage. You could go the extra step by finding makeup that does double duty. Some examples include:


Colored lip gloss
Powdered foundation
Eyeliner/eyeshadow combo stick

Consider bringing a waterproof camera.",How to Pack for a Water Park," Water parks usually don’t allow guests to go into the water without swimwear. Always check the individual water park’s dress code before you begin trying on swimsuits that you may want to bring. They are the experts and have regulations in place for safety that you may not have considered. Pack swimsuits that fit well. Water slide attractions are more physical activities than swimming in a regular pool. You don’t want the suit to be loose enough to fall off or so tight that it rides up. Your bathing suit should be comfortable to walk around in – some parks don’t allow shirts or cover-ups on rides.Don’t bring swimsuits that have zippers, buttons, belts, rivets or metal ornaments. You may not be allowed to get on certain slides with them because they can cause damage to the equipment at the water park. Furthermore, you don’t want them to get caught on anything and cause your swimsuit to tear.Bikinis are not recommended for water parks. They tend not to stay put on water slides, and some parks even forbid skimpy bathing suits. For females, one piece swimsuits are advisable. Look for suits with straps in a sports bra style so that they don’t slide off your shoulders. Avoid suits with ties that can come undone.;
, You may want to arrive at the park with a bathing suit under your clothes so that it’s easier to get ready in the locker room. Choose casual clothing with a top that’s easily removable. Long-sleeved shirts and coverups can reduce your exposure to the sun. Keep in mind that you may not fully dry after going on water rides. Bring a comfortable jacket or sweatshirt so that you won’t be as chilly if the weather gets cooler as the day wanes.Consider bringing a hat to help shield your face from the sun.

, Pack a change of clothes that will be easy to slip into later in case your clothes don’t dry. Include an extra pair of undergarments to go home in. If you’re going to divide up your day at the water park, consider bringing an extra set of bathing suits per person so that you don’t have to put back on a suit that is still wet.


For example, tearaway athletic pants can be snapped on so that you don’t have to stand on one leg to put your pants on in a potentially wet locker room or bathroom.

, You may want to bring a set of sporty clothes and shoes for each person in addition to water apparel. Check out what activities the water park has to offer before you go. If the park has attractions that aren’t water-related, such as zip-lining, laser tag, or a ropes course, you will probably want to bring appropriate gear for that., You will probably be walking around on concrete, and it may be hot, so you want to have a better plan than bare feet. Bring water socks, flip flops, plastic shoes or water shoes.Keep in mind that depending on the park, you might not be allowed to wear water shoes on the rides or in the pools.Have sandals with treaded or rubber soles to minimize your chances of slipping on wet walkways.

, Consider bringing sunglasses with a strap if you want to wear them in the water where permitted. Polarized sunglasses will reduce the glare from the water. If you want to wear regular eyeglasses, you should confirm that you are allowed to wear them on rides. Some attractions may permit eyeglasses with a head strap only.

, Bring at least one large, absorbent beach towel per person. Some parks ask you to bring your own towels, while others offer towels to use for free, for a rental fee, or by purchase. However, they may not be long enough to wrap around you or thick enough to dry you adequately. Your best bet is to bring your own; then you don’t even have to check ahead to find out about towel availability at the park.

, Some water parks offer life jackets you can use for free. If you want to bring any pool noodles, water wings or inflatable pool toys with you, check with the park first to make sure they are permitted. If there are children coming with you, make sure to ask about flotation devices required for them.Try asking, “Do children of a certain age or height need to wear life jackets or vests?” If the answer is yes, you can also ask, “Do the life jackets need to be Coast Guard approved? Are they provided at the water park, or should I bring my own?” If your child is a practiced swimmer, you may want to follow up these questions with, “Is there any type of swimming test exemption from this rule?”
Water wings are considered swimming aids but should not be used as a replacement for life jackets or life preservers.Some water parks don’t allow swimsuits with built-in tubes.

, You can wear swim goggles to shield your eyes from getting splashed on a raft ride. They are also great for using in wave pools.Mirrored, polarized and photochromatic goggles are ideal for outdoor swimming in the sunshine, while goggles that are merely tinted will offer medium protection in the sun.Test the seal of your goggles by putting them over your eyes without strapping them on. Press the lenses gently towards your eyes. If the lenses maintain suction for a few seconds without you holding them into place, they will provide good protection against water leakage.
Goggle straps are for keeping goggles on your head, not for keeping the seal suctioned. Make sure you can adjust the straps so that they stay put without being too loose or too tight.

, Bring sunblock with an SPF of 30 to 45. Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen so that it will protect you against both UVA and UVB rays from the sun.Choose a waterproof version. Apply your sunscreen a half hour before you’ll be outside, and bring it with you so that you can reapply it. Bring baby sunscreen if needed.Reapply your sunscreen every two hours at least. You should put sunblock on again after getting out of the water and drying off.
Make sure to reapply sunblock after riding any water slides., Water parks usually have showers in the locker rooms for washing chlorine off before you change into dry clothes. Consider bringing travel-sized body wash and shampoo. Chlorine dries out skin, so you might want to pack lotion to put on after you’ve dried off.Bring enough feminine care products for the length of your stay, if needed.
Other items you may want to bring are a hairbrush or comb, travel-sized conditioner, deodorant, and hair ties.

, A beach bag or backpack is handy for carrying around water shoes, sunscreen, snacks, and towels. Just don’t overpack your bag with weighty items that may hurt your shoulders to carry around for long periods of time. You may want to bring a fanny pack with you as well.

, If you’re travelling with a child who wears diapers, make sure to bring diapers specially made for swimming. These might be available at the water park you’re going to, but it’s much more economical to purchase them beforehand and bring them with you. Some parks may require wearers of swimming diapers to also wear swim pants.Other items you may want to pack in the diaper bag: wipes, diaper rash cream, changing pads, a bib, baby food and spoon, bottle and nipples, pacifier, formula, blanket, and bath toys., If you want to bring your own food and/or drinks, check with the water park ahead of time and see if you’re allowed to do so. Ask if there are any regulations about what types of food or drinks you can bring, and what containers they can be in. Most parks allow you to at least bring bottled water. Alternately, you might be able to bring empty water bottles to fill at water fountains inside the park.Consider bringing adult- and kid-friendly snacks, if not meals as well. Bring napkins, paper plates, and appropriate eating utensils as needed.


Consider putting food and drink in a cooler lined with ice packs. Plan to stay hydrated: this can help prevent motion sickness. Check what type of coolers, if any, are permitted at the park first. Some parks may not allow coolers, or may allow soft foldable coolers only.If the water park doesn’t allow food, find out if you can leave and re-enter the park without paying admission again. That way, you can still pack a cooler, and eat your meal in the parking lot or a nearby picnic area instead. If you plan to do the latter, bring picnic items as well, such as a tablecloth and clips.
If the water park doesn’t allow food and you have dietary restrictions or are bringing an infant, find out if they make exceptions for such situations.

, Take a stroller with you if you have infants or toddlers. If not, consider bringing a wagon – whether you have children of age to be riding in one or not. You can use this as a handy way to cart around bags, souvenirs, a cooler, and more.You may want to check with the water park first to see if they have stroller or wagon rentals available, and where strollers and wagons can be safely stowed while you’re on a ride.

, The motion of water and amusement park rides can cause uncomfortable motion sickness, such as nausea, dizziness and vertigo. The most effective way to combat motion sickness is to prevent it from happening. Consider taking an over-the-counter antihistamine 30 to 60 minutes before you arrive at the water park. Look for medication containing meclizine (Antivert) or dimenhydrinate (Dramamine).Those most at risk for getting motion sickness are children ages 2 to 12, women (particularly when menstruating, pregnant or taking hormones), people prone to migraines, and those taking certain medications. Infants and toddlers are typically immune.If you have a history of motion sickness or other reason to believe you may experience it at the water park, consider talking to your health care provider about a possible prescription option. Scopolamine is a transdermal patch which is put behind the ear four hours beforehand,and is considered a first line of defense against motion sickness., You don’t want to risk losing or damaging your jewelry. You may not even be allowed to wear jewelry on certain rides. Your fingers will shrink in cold water, and if you’re wearing a ring it can easily slip off, especially if you’re riding water slides or going in a wave pool.Water parks use chemicals like chlorine to keep water safe and clean, and these chemicals can damage the metal used in jewelry.Don’t wear a watch to the water park. Even if the watch is labeled as “waterproof” or “water resistant,” there is no watch that is completely waterproof, especially when it will be submerged underwater forcefully at water park attractions., Bring sealable, waterproof bags. Carry some money with you in case you want to buy food, beverages, souvenirs, or any items you may have forgotten to pack. Some water parks also take major credit cards for admission tickets, gift shops, and food. You may also want to rent lounge chairs or other equipment at park. Check with the park first about storage locker fees, since some storage lockers may only accept quarters.


Bring two sets of keys to your vehicle, and keep them in different places. This is a safety precaution in case you lose a key.
You may want to put money or a credit card, your license, a car key, and a cell phone all in one waterproof bag to be stored in your locker. Keep the key to your locker around your wrist throughout your stay at the water park.

, You may want to leave your cell phone at home so that you don’t risk losing or damaging it. If you want to bring it, however, you should strongly consider leaving it either hidden in your vehicle, or in a locker at the water park. You might want to leave a car charger with it as well, if you think your battery may get low., A disposable, waterproof camera would be less of a loss and less likely to get damaged than a smartphone or digital camera. If you’re planning to bring some type of camera, note that some water parks don’t allow selfie sticks or monopods. Bring film and/or batteries if your camera needs them.

, Or will you be at a hotel where not everything is provided? Doing laundry can be time consuming and expensive and usually, only upscale hotels offer a Laundry Service. This service may be great, but it's expensive!,, Do you use creams or cleansers that you will need? Bring a toothbrush and sample sized tube of paste. If you don't have a toothbrush holder use a baggy. Pack nothing over 100ml in your hand luggage - decant all larger toiletries into 100ml bottles, or the security at the airport will take them.

, Pack clothes that all coordinate with each other. Don't forget under clothes and pajamas! (You may want to have some extra underclothes, so pack for as many days that you are staying plus at least two - it never hurts to be safe.) A good thing to do is pack four pairs of shorts/skirts and 9 tee-shirts or vest tops and matching flip-flops. Also, remember to pack those all too important bathing suits if this guest has a pool. Remember to pack beach towels, sunscreen, and other pool things.


Shoes: Try to pack so that you have outfits that match the shoes you wear to the location, and if not try to only pack one other pair, it really saves space. Is there a pool or beach? You probably only need to pack one pair of flip-flops.







,, Remember your cell phone and its charger. This is especially important if you are very far from home--you don't want to be out of touch. Same with your laptop if you're bringing it.

First pack items that you know you can’t live without.,

Don’t necessarily take up valuable suitcase space with rain gear.,
Bring extra walking shoes.",How to Pack for a Two Week Trip," It’s a good idea to store any travel documents, visas and passports in a special pouch or bag where you won’t misplace them. Be sure to bring refills of any medicines that you won’t be able to replace while you’re traveling, along with toiletries that are must-haves and will be hard to find when you get there. A journal and camera are important so you can keep memories from your trip for years to come. If you’re bringing a tablet, this can double as a journal, and potentially a camera. Otherwise consider a small, point-and-shoot camera. Don’t forget that extra memory card and battery.


We all have our trusty chap stick that we absolutely can’t live without. So if you’re worried you could run out and not be able to find an essential item on your trip, pack an extra to be safe.Back up credit or debit cards and a photocopy of your passport and visa could come in handy if you happen to misplace these items or they are stolen.
If your allergies occasionally flair up or you tend to get migraines, make sure you’re better safe than sorry and pack appropriate medications.;
, As a bonus you can also use this to carefully consider what you’ll need for each activity or stop on your trip. You’ll be able to easily anticipate what each day will bring. You may even notice a few items to eliminate because they won't be of use. If you aren’t entirely sure what will come in handy for each stop on your trip, research online reviews to find out what others say about the experience and what they wish they’d brought. For instance, find out if a boat trip you’re planning to take provides sunscreen and towels or if this is something you’ll need to pack.Comfortable shoes may be the single most important item you pack. Typically this includes a pair that ties and has arch support, although it varies by person.
Bring articles of clothing that aren’t too specific and will match with multiple items you packed. This way you won’t need to worry about what’s clean and what needs washing.

, Plan to bring three pairs of socks, underwear, and shirts. This way you’ll have just enough of each item to wash one, dry one, and wear one. Pants can usually be worn more than once, so two pairs should suffice. This rule only applies to the staples that you’ll be wearing everyday. If you plan to attend an event where your standard ensemble won’t be appropriate, plan accordingly.Especially if you are traveling during the warmers months, be sure to bring clothing made of lighter fabric, such as a poly blend, which is easily packable, durable, and dries quickly.
Only choose clothing items that you can mix and match, so they can be worn with anything you brought.
A pair of jeans or comfortable shorts is usually a safe bet as is a pair of pants that can unzip to become shorts. These will grant you even more outfit options.
Shirts in neutral colors like white, black and tan are likely to match with almost any bottoms. Just remember that darker colors provide more sun protection.
If you’re traveling during cold months, plan on layering, rather than packing a heavy coat. Only the piece touching your skin will need to be washed regularly, so don’t worry about spending more time doing laundry.
Bring a small container of laundry detergent or plan to hire a laundry service.

, This will keep you from offending the locals or sticking out like a sore thumb. The more you fit in, the less likely you are to be a target for pickpockets and people trying to take advantage of you. If you are unsure of the local customs for covering up, not exposing your shoulders and knees is a good rule of thumb.If the culture of the visiting country is on the conservative side, a lightweight scarf won’t add bulk to your luggage but can easily and quickly cover you up.
If you plan to attend a formal event or service, dressier clothing is necessary to show that you respect the occasion.
An easy and quick way to dress up your everyday clothing is with accessories. For women, a piece of jewelry or a hairpiece can make even your cotton t-shirt seem dressy.
Men can wear ties and stylish glasses with a watch to dress up their everyday duds. And the best part is that these items hardly add any weight and don’t take up room in your suitcase.

, If your destination country speaks a language different from yours, it is respectful to bring along a language book to help you communicate, and of course to learn what you can beforehand. Even mastering the basic greetings or phrases for ordering meals may impress locals and show them that you’re trying.If you plan to have phone reception or computer access, consider downloading an application for easy communication with locals. Languages and Google Translate are considered two of the best translator apps.Especially if you expect Internet access to be limited, make sure to bring a reliable guidebook.
Depending on the nature of your trip, look for a one that has more sections dedicated to actual activities, excursions, and landmarks, rather than accommodations. This is assuming that you have booked a place to stay before you actually arrive at your destination, so these are essentially wasted pages.
If you’re a foodie and hoping to experience the local cuisine, then a guidebook that is heavily focused on the restaurant scene would be of most use to you.
All good guidebooks should include ample information about the local culture and customs. Typically they’ll highlight in-depth information about transportation options as well.
Make sure the book is current (written no longer than two or three years ago, if not the year you plan to travel). Cities change, restaurants close, and customs adapt, so to get the best experience, you need the latest information.

, Two-ounce liquid containers can be bought at most department stores for refills of shampoo, liquid soap, or make up. Likewise department stores are likely to have sections devoted to travel sized toiletries, such as toothpaste and lotion, that you may need during your flight or for when you first land. To avoid extra fees, weigh your luggage beforehand so it doesn’t exceed your airline’s limit.Don’t pack anything that could be considered a weapon, such as razors or scissors, in your carry-on bag.
Put your name and address on a tag attached to your luggage.
Leave any agricultural products, including animal products and plants, at home.

, You can even download multiple books, movies, and songs beforehand to your tablet to save space.Remember to bring your own blanket and neck pillow if you’d rather not use what’s provided by the airline.
Pack a separate carry-on bag that you can easily place at your feet with toiletries, medicines, headphones, and anything else that will make your overseas flight more comfortable.
Earplugs and an eye mask will be especially useful for overnight flights, ensuring you’ll arrive at your destination well rested rather than jet-lagged.

, This will give you enough time to make trips to the store if you are running low on something. Having all the items you’re packing in front of you visually may even help you make some eliminations throughout the week, saving valuable room in your suitcase.Making a check list a week in advance will ensure you don’t forget anything valuable, as you can add to the list throughout the week. Take note of the items you use on a daily basis, chances are these are what you’ll also need on your trip.
Consider talking to friends or acquaintances who have been to the place you’re visiting and see if they have any recommendations for what to bring. An insider’s view is usually more helpful than Internet research or a guidebook. Not only is it more personalized, but they will be able to answer your specific questions.

, Analyze each item individually to determine the likelihood of using it during your two-week trip, and whether or not it’s something you can easily buy once you reach your destination, such as toiletries. Decide if the amount you’ll use the item justifies its weight in your bag. Do ample research on the destination so you’re fully aware of what you will and won’t have access to once you arrive.Think in terms of items you can get by without, rather than what would be convenient on your trip. If it would be handy to have your trusty coffee press from home, but you will have easy access to inexpensive coffee on every corner, this is probably something you should leave behind.
Use lightweight luggage, like a backpack, so more weight can be devoted to the contents. But although luggage with wheels are usually made of heavier material, they do lighten the load on your back.
Remember hard luggage helps protect valuables inside, while soft materials are more lightweight and easily conform to fit in the luggage bin, trunk of the car, etc.

, Not only will your luggage fit into the overhead bin of an airplane, but it won’t weigh you down. When you do reach your destination, you’ll enjoy mobility and spontaneity. Furthermore, everything you packed, from your toiletries down to that extra sweater, will be easily accessible. If you know there are some items you’re likely to need access to regularly, these should be placed at the top of your bag, or on the outside pockets. This will prevent you from needing to dig through all of your belongings just to find that pair of extra socks.Carrying your bag onto the plane means it’s less prone to getting lost, broken, or stolen.
Last minute changes in your flight itinerary will be met with less stress.
Save on checked bag fees.
If you’re travelling by car or train, save room in the trunk or baggage storage by keeping your bag at your feet the entire trip.

, This will maximize space and minimize wrinkles. Rather than folding clothes the way you typically would, rolling shirts and pairs of pants make them easier to cram into every free nook and cranny. Don’t worry, they’ll be wrinkle-free when you do take them out to wear.To roll shirts, fold them in half and place the sleeves onto the body. Begin rolling.
With pants just simply fold them in half with the back pockets touching, and roll from either end, making sure not to form any creases.
To maximize space inside your bag even further, you can stick the rolled items into a compression bag, available at most travel stores. This saves room by eliminating the air between clothing. Make sure you don’t stuff too many items into each bag, and be careful of the weight, as it can add up before you realize.
Place socks and rolled up t-shirts inside your shoes.
Wear your shoes and other bulky items during travel. This will save room and weight in your bag.
Layer shirts or sweaters if you’re really tight on space.

, Items like toothpaste, shampoo, soap, and most first aid supplies can most likely be bought at your destination. So if you’re exceptionally tight on space, plan to make a pharmacy stop once you arrive. Sometimes part of the experience includes something as simple as a trip to the local market to pick up handmade Shea butter with which to replace your usual body lotion. However, if you do plan to do this, researching whether or not you’ll be able to find all of your essentials is important to do beforehand. If your final destination is a remote area of Alaska and you plan to buy a toothbrush there, it might be an uncomfortable two weeks.Part of this is also understanding that products in a foreign country might not be exactly what you’re used to, but embracing these differences is part of the fun.

, Most likely, partaking in local food and drink customs is going to be a substantial part of your trip. However, even if you don’t plan on eating out at restaurants, or there won’t be many where you’re going, stopping at a grocery store along the way or once you’ve arrived is your best bet, rather than trying to pack food from home. Not only will bringing food take up more space and add excess weight, but if it's unrefrigerated, it won't last long anyway.If there is a packaged food you can’t live without, remember to leave space for it while you’re packing clothing and other items. Be sure to include this in your packing list as well.
Bring a collapsible water bottle or plan to buy one at your destination to reuse for the duration of your trip.

, Consider the weather forecast and location before packing these items. Unless you’re going somewhere that has exceptionally rainy weather, such as the Pacific Northwest, the weather forecast during your two-week stay should let you know if it’s worth it to bring boots, raincoats, and umbrellas. While nothing is likely to ruin your trip more than being unprepared for a rainstorm, these items also take up a significant amount of space for something you may possibly never remove from your bag.Pack waterproof shoes and a rain jacket that can also double as your regular walking shoes and coat. This means you won’t have to waste any extra space for your rain gear, but will still be equipped should it start to drizzle.
Travel size umbrellas don’t take up much space and can come in handy during a light shower.
If the forecast is wrong and it does start to rain, you’ll most likely still find a disposable poncho to buy at your destination.

, Don’t plan to just buy extras as needed once you arrive: these usually need to be broken in. Sometimes you don’t know if a shoe is right for your foot until you’ve worn it for a while. Finding out on your trip that the toe portion is too narrow, could put a damper on all that sightseeing you wanted to do.Even the best, most comfortable sneakers are likely to cause a blister or two after extensive wear. So even if it’s just a comfortable sandal with ample support, don’t be left without an extra pair of shoes.
This won’t be inexpensive to purchase when you arrive, especially if you’re in a touristy area.
You won’t have planned on packing an extra pair of shoes, which can take up a lot of space on the way back.

Also inquire about any visas you might need, depending on your country of citizenship on the passport.
, English is widely spoken, but knowing key words and phrases in Portuguese will make your travels smoother. If you have an eReader, smartphone or electronic tablet, download an app with the dictionary to make it easier to carry around everywhere you go in the city.

, If you have a digital camera, pack extra memory cards; if it's a film camera, have extra film. Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful place and is extremely photogenic, especially if you're participating in festivals or other events. Once there, be sure to photograph the Christ Redeemer statue, document your view from the Sugar Loaf cable car, the Botanical gardens or one of the many beaches.

, Brazilian outlets are either type A, B or C. Type A and B are common throughout North America, but older buildings in Brazil may still have C type outlets. It's helpful to have an adapter for your personal electronics, such as laptops, hair dryer or electric razor. However, if you forget to pack this, don't fret––either your hotel or a local electronics store should be able to sell you one there.

, The seasons in Rio are the opposite of those in North America, with North American winters being Rio's summer, and vice versa. Rio has an average temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, or 68 Fahrenheit, year round. Pack light clothing, especially when travelling during Rio's high summer months, December and January, when the temperature can reach 40 degrees Celsius, over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.


Dress simply but with style. Have day clothes and one flashier item for evenings out. Be aware that even the nightclubs are casual, so don't overdress. Good casual dress is fine for even the best restaurants.
Avoid the usual tourist garb of safari shorts and jacket, etc. unless you want to be recognized as a tourist.
Choose non-slip sandals and shoes because the sidewalks can be slippery when it rains.
Leave the expensive clothes and jewelry at home. You don't need them and they might make you a target for thieves.

, Rio is well known for its beaches, which are accessible year round due to Rio's mild climate. Bring a suit and enjoy the beaches at Copacabana, Ipanema, or dozens of other popular tourist destinations.


You don't need to go skimpy but can if you want to! Bikini culture is truly alive. If you wear a one-piece, the locals will know you're a tourist but it's your prerogative. A wrap, sarong or towel can help to cover you more modestly if preferred.
If you don't want to bring a towel to the beach, the air is usually warm enough to air-dry you quickly.
Flip flops are useful for beach walking.

, You will need to be protected from the sun as it's very easy to get burned, both walking around and spending time on the beaches of Rio. Of course, these can also be purchased in Rio if preferred; either way, just be sure to use them!

, The Brazilian Real is the local currency, and currency exchanges can be found in many hotels and banks. Many businesses that cater to tourists accept credit cards, but it is a good idea to carry Real additionally. You can also bring traveller's cheques.

, Vancouver offers hundreds of photo opportunities, so be sure to snap tons of photos! In the case of a digital camera, bring an extra memory card or two to insure you don't run out of space. Pictures can be taken while on tours on the Big Bus, at Stanley Park, Canada Place, Science World, or while viewing the world from a great height while on the Capilano Suspension Bridge.

You will see how many bags they will allow you to bring and the exact required dimensions of each bag. Pay particular attention to the size of overhead bags and the weight limitations on checked bags.


Of course, if you exceed the guidelines most airlines will let you take your bag along for an additional fee. If you choose to go this route, just know that you will incur that extra cost.;
, Look over your luggage and consider the length and type of your trip. If you plan to stay in London for over a week, you may need to bring one larger checked bag and one small carry bag. If you prefer to travel light or are a backpacker, then a backpack or small bag might do the trick.Most people go with a roller bag with stiff sides, if they pack a large bag at all. But, there are many options to consider. You could use a duffel, a messenger bag, a hanger-style bag, or a soft-side rectangle., There are many sample packing lists available online. Find them by entering “London packing list” into a search engine. Print out one of these lists and then modify it to suit your needs. Just make sure that you put everything that is going will you onto this list, including whatever you will carry in your pockets. This will minimize the chance that you’ll leave something important behind.As part of your list, make sure to write down the details of the outfit that you will be travelling in. This should be taken to account as part of your overall clothing numbers.You may want to start this list at least a few weeks out from your trip. Keep it somewhere handy and edit it as time goes on.

, London is a very busy city and you don’t want to be slowed down by lugging around multiple huge bags. Instead, be realistic about what you can reasonably handle and carry. Most people do best with one large bag (on rollers) and one small carry-on bag with a strap or handle., Go to a weather website, such as Accuweater, and look for the average temperatures for London during the period of your visit. You will notice that London temperatures are generally mild, swinging from 6 degrees Celsius (43 degrees Fahrenheit) in the winter to around 20 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit) in the mid-summer.Be prepared to pack items like sunscreen just in case temperatures reach their maximum.

, Once you’ve located all of the items on your list, pull them all out and place them somewhere easy to access, such as a bed or a clean bedroom floor. Sort the items according to type. Make a pile of shirts, a pile of socks, and so on. Now that you can see everything, look over it all and ask yourself, “What can I eliminate and what do I need to add?”


You should only pack items that you know that you will use. If you can’t envision a use for it, leave it behind. For example, that very pretty dress that’s been hanging in your closet for the past two years should probably stay in the closet unless you have a specific occasion to wear it to while in London.

, While London rarely sees snow or ice, it does get a lot of rainy precipitation. So, you’ll want to pack a sturdy umbrella that can withstand both wind and rain. Some of the compact ones are actually quite strong, so you don’t have to take up a lot of room in your suitcase. A sturdy raincoat is also a good idea. Remember that your coat will appear in many pictures, so make sure that its’ one that you like., Londoners love wearing blacks, greys, and browns with splashes of bright color. Go for simplicity and a timeless look when choosing your wardrobe color palette. For example, you might pack items that are dark grey, white, and pink tones. That way you can intermix pieces to make a number of outfits., It is quite possible that London will be cold in the mornings and then warmer in the afternoons during your visit. Pack clothes that work well in thin layers. Light sweaters, natural-fiber shirts, cardigans, and light shrugs all work well. You can always take off an outer layer and put it in your carry bag too., Go for jewelry that is versatile and fits within your color palette. For example, if you are going with pinks and greys, then choose either silver or gold toned jewelry to pack. Bring a few pieces that can fit with a number of outfits. You also want to choose pieces that are fairly durable and will hold up well when travelling., If you know that you are going to a nice restaurant, pick out one particular outfit for that evening. Or, Londoners love soccer (or football, as they call it) and if you are going to a match, it’s probably a good idea to research the home team’s colors beforehand. If you can get a jersey, even better., It is really easy to overdo it when packing footwear. You should really be able to make do with 2-3 pairs on a trip. One non-white walking shoe, like a Converse. One leather or rubber bootie for those nasty weather days. And, one nicer pair of shoes for formal outings.Remember that you can always buy another pair of shoes in London if you need to.

, You need to turn your chaotic piles into organized stacks. This is the step immediately prior to packing your bags. Fold your pants along their natural crease. Try to fold shirts as simply as possible along the seams. Jackets and sports coats will need to be turned inside out first, then folded. Folding everything neatly will result in less tedious ironing or steaming when you arrive in London.When in doubt, go with the simplest fold possible. The less lines that you create in a garment, the better.

, Place delicate items, such as dresses, at the bottom of your bag. They will be protected and pressed by the other clothes. The next layer should be general use items, such as casual shirts or pants. Top these with t-shirts, underwear, and other non-wrinkling items. At the very top, place your plastic bags with toiletries and other random items.If you are worried about your dress clothes, you can place white, acid-free tissue paper in between the particular clothing items. This will lessen wrinkling. You can also stuff tissue paper into shoes to help them keep their shape while packed.Some people prefer to place each layer into a packing cube, and then stack the cubes into the bag. Packing cubes come in a variety of sizes and this is a good idea particularly if you will not fully unpack your suitcase on your trip. The cubes can keep everything relatively organized.
If you’ve done the stack and you still have gaps, you can use small items, such as rolled up socks, to fill in the holes. Making sure that your bags are filled from top to bottom will prevent movement which will, in turn, keep your clothes from getting further wrinkled and disorganized.

, Heavy, structured items, such as shoes and belts, should be put around the bag’s outer edge. They will help to hold the other clothing in place. The outer placement will also minimize the damage that they can cause to delicate clothing by snagging.

, Buy the good freezer bags in the quart or gallon size and use them for your liquid items. This will help to prevent your clothing being ruined in the event of any liquid leaks. Don’t overpack the bags or they may burst and ruin the whole point. Also, consider buying travel size versions of all of your toiletries in order to save space.


Some people carry only a few small toiletries with them and instead buy all of their bath and shower items after they arrive in London. This will definitely cut down on your packing space needs.

, Depending on where you are travelling from, you may need to bring along an electronic convertor in order to use certain devices, like your hairdryer. It is a good idea to place these items into a plastic bag along with any other recharging cords that you have. Some people prefer to place these items in a personal bag or carry-on to ensure that they will not be lost.

, Make sure to consider how you plan to pack anything that you purchase while in London. You might want to toss extra clothing items, such as t-shirts, to make room. Or, you can pack with these souvenir items in mind, leaving one layer of your suitcase open. Some people bring along an extra empty duffel bag that can hold either clothing or other items on the way home., Make sure that you have a plan in case your large bag gets lost in transit. Pack a small, personal bags with enough items to get you comfortably though a few days. Include any required toiletry items or medications. Pack one full extra outfit, the fresh socks and underwear being particularly important.

, If you are travelling with a family group, and you feel comfortable doing so, then it is a good idea to pack a few items of each person’s clothing in another person’s large suitcase. This will ensure that everyone has something to wear in the event that a piece of luggage is lost."

The border control (at the actual border or at the airport) will ask to see your passport to verify your identity and your ability to legally enter Canada.


If you don’t have a passport, you’ll need to apply for one. Most countries issue passports in six weeks or less. Some even offer expedited services for a fee. Be sure to plan ahead so that you’ll definitely have your passport in time for your trip.;
, Citizens from many countries are required to apply for a visa before they can legally enter Canada. Check on the Canadian government’s website to see if citizens you’re your country need a visa to visit Canada.Americans don’t need a travel visa to travel to Canada, but citizens of most other countries will need to apply for one before their trip.
If you are required to apply for a visa to visit Canada, you won’t be allowed to enter the country without showing the visa at the border.

, Print off copies of all the important things you’ll need to manage your travel. This includes your travel itinerary, flight schedules, hotel reservations, and even directions to points of interest if you want to be super thorough.You can also save these documents on your smartphone. But it’s always smart to have a hard copy just in case your phone dies or in case someone else needs to look at your documents.

, It may be difficult to get access to refills of prescription medications while you are in Montreal. Make sure you bring enough of any medication you take to last you through the duration of your stay in Montreal. Medications should be stored in the original bottle with the prescription label from the pharmacy while you are traveling.You can always go to the doctor while you are on your vacation, but it may be difficult (or costly) to get the tests and/or records needed for a doctor to write you a prescription.
At the very least, it will take up a lot of your precious vacation time. So be sure to plan ahead to bring all the medications you’ll need.

, It’s important to remember that Montreal is a primarily French-speaking city, even though it is located in Canada. If you don’t already know French, you might want to brush up on some French expressions that will help you in your day-to-day travel experience. Some common phrases you may need to know include:Merci = Thank you

S’il vous plaît = Please

Bonjour = Hello

Je m’appelle = My name is

La toilette = The bathroom

Je cherche un hôtel = I am looking for a hotel

, Consider extra items you might need for travel to Canada. Try to bring extras of things like batteries and chargers that might come in handy. Also bring guidebooks and maps that will help you out while you are on your holiday.


You should also bring some emergency contact phone numbers and keep them written down in your wallet or purse just in case anything happens and you are incapacitated.
Be sure to bring a camera with additional memory to capture all of your vacation memories in Montreal.

, Check the weather forecast for Montreal before you travel to Canada. Unless it's summer, you will definitely need warm clothes. Layers are recommended because it gives you more freedom in choosing how warm you want to be.Except for summer, Montreal's average temperatures range from 16 degrees Fahrenheit (-8.9 degrees Celsius) in winter to 58.1 degrees Fahrenheit (14.5 degrees Celsius) in spring.
Summer days are usually humid and mid-July temps hover around 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius).
Nights are still cool, so bring a light jacket or sweater.
Summer showers happen on occasion, so you might want to bring a rain poncho or umbrella.

, Don't underestimate the cold weather you will most likely encounter in Montreal. If you are travelling in December, January, February, or March, you will need to bring a warm winter coat and boots. Make sure the jacket’s inner layer is thick enough for Canadian winters. A puffer jacket, wool jacket, or thick peacoat should be fine, especially when combined with other layered clothing.You will also need a pair of boots or else your feet will get wet and cold. Sorel has warm reliable boots made especially for Canada's weather.
You can always buy a warm jacket in Montreal as there are plenty of them on the market.

, Consider packing a mix-and-match wardrobe to cut down on the amount of clothes you need to pack. Bring tops that can be dressed up or dressed down, depending on the pants you pair them with. Pack some pants that are comfortable enough for walking around in all day, but also nice enough to wear to a concert at night.You'll probably need one nice outfit for attending nice restaurants or evening events.
Bring some long-sleeved shirts, sweaters or cardigans, t-shirts, and a lighter jacket (like a hoodie) you can wear under your heavier jacket.
You could wear your t-shirt under a sweater on a medium cold day. Then you could wear a long-sleeved shirt under a sweater on a colder day. This gives you the freedom to take off the sweater at any point if you get too hot while you’re out visiting the city.

, Be sure to bring some warm winter boots or shoes that will keep your feet warm in the snowy, chilly weather conditions. But make sure the shoes are also comfortable, as Montreal is a city made for walking.Pair your warm shoes with some warm socks to add an extra layer of insulation.
Make sure your shoes are broken in so that you don’t get blisters while you’re on vacation. They should also have decent traction on them so you can avoid slipping on any ice or snow you may encounter.
Try to limit yourself to two pairs of shoes: comfortable ones and a pair of dressy shoes. Shoes take up a lot of room in luggage.

, Think about what you’re planning to do while you are in Montreal, as this will greatly impact what you’ll need to bring with you. If you plan on doing more sporty activities, you’ll need to bring some more athletic type clothing. Plan out your activities ahead of time, as best you can, so you can pack accordingly.


If you plan on doing a lot of sightseeing or hiking, you should bring comfortable, looser-fitting clothes and reliable walking shoes for most of your outfits.
If you plan on spending most of your time going out with friends, you’ll want to consider those situations while packing. Bring several nicer outfits for going out to fancy dinners or to a club. And bring some comfortable clothes that will look cute in photos.

, Rather than just throwing all of your stuff into the suitcase, spend some time putting the pieces together like a puzzle so that it minimizes the space you use. Try rolling up your clothes instead of folding them.Use smaller items like socks, rolled up t-shirts and underwear to fill in small gaps or to put inside shoes to maximize the space you’re using.
Packing bulky things like shoes along the edge of a suitcase provides more room.

, Pack your suitcase so that it's full, but not overly full. This will help you leave room for any souvenirs or gifts you might want to bring back from your trip to Montreal.You also don’t want to over-pack your suitcase because a busted zipper can really ruin a trip.

Learn basic Portuguese phrases.,
Surf the Internet to learn about things to do in Rio.,

Use the weeks prior to the flight to learn 50 phrases and practice!

, Go to the Maracana stadium, visit museums such as the Museum of Modern Art (MAM), Museum of Rio (MAR) or The Rio Bay Museum, which looks like a flying saucer. Visit Jardim Botanico (Botanical Gardens), or sample the wild nightlife in Lapa, etc. in Nitéroi is also worth a visit.

, Remember, Rio as a city is as populous as NYC with just as much variety. If you can't find something to do in Rio then you're not really trying.

Bring a counterfeit money marker along with you and strike a distinguishable pattern line across every stacked fan of bills as you hand them to the cash-handler.",How to Travel Safely Around Peru," Basic Spanish classes are recommended for a full, more confident experience in Peru. Travelers can get by without Spanish while within their tour groups, but one does miss a lot of the overall experience. Learning Spanish in groups or as a family can be really fun, and putting it into practice in Spanish-speaking countries can be really satisfying.;
, The most popular destinations are Lima, Cusco, Machu Picchu, Lake Titicaca (Puno), Nasca and the adventure-filled jungles. All these places have well established tourist circuits, and it is advisable to stick to these for easier and safer travel.

, If you are just traveling to Lima, you will probably not need yellow fever or malaria medications. The risk of disease is higher in rural areas, however.

, It is very common for tourists to get food poisoning in Peru.To play it safe, do not drink the tap water (only bottled) and use bottled water to brush your teeth.

Purchase pharmaceutical food grade chlorine treatment drops that is processed and packaged for agriculture and food processing. Do not eat the skin on fruit or vegetables. You can find them in most local pharmacies or leading food store chains. Ask your doctor for a prescription for antibiotics to treat traveler diarrhea to bring, just in case.







, Try not to display any signs of wealth. Don't carry a lot of cash. Spread it out on you so that if you do get mugged, you can give some of it away and have another cache somewhere on you. Be on the alert for bogus taxis. Use only registered cabs. The tourist board recommends that you never sit in the front seat of a taxi. Sit in the back seat directly behind the driver.

, For example, in Lima stay near the safe and well policed area of Miraflores. In Cusco keep your family in the center around the Main Square where it's relatively safe. Wherever you are, be aware of your kids' whereabouts.

, The air is extremely dry, and you may experience dryness of the nose and lips. It is recommended that you drink at least 2 liters (0.5 US gal) of water a day and use lip balm.



The high altitude can also give you mild headaches. Don’t over-exert yourself, and drink lots of water until you adjust. Give yourself time to acclimate before doing anything strenuous. Ask your doctor about medication that will help you acclimate (e.g. Diamox). The locals often recommend drinking coca tea as a remedy.



, Do not exchange cash with people on the street as they may give you fake cash. If you bring cash to exchange, get bills that are in as perfect condition as possible. Often, if you go to your bank and ask a teller, they will give you bills that are in tip top shape. Many places in Peru will not accept dollar bills that have any signs of wear and tear, even just a tiny tear along the edge., Make clear and carefully controlled display of the way you present, count, and exchange currency, document notes, and proof of payments.

Do this as a display of your integrity and respect. This avoids offensive misunderstandings of mistrust and the opportunity to be scammed.

Pack light.,
Make sure your luggage is strong and easy to transport.,
Update your immunizations before you leave.,
Take insect repellent containing DEET and use it, especially if you will be traveling in any rural or jungle area.,
Take an electrical adapter or purchase one when you arrive.,
Always carry toilet paper with you.,
Take plenty of layers.,
Wash underwear yourself.,
Wear sun-cream at high altitude.,
Take some energy bars or snacks.,
Use hotel safes.,
Use a money belt or similar and take precautions to avoid pickpockets.,
Take earplugs.,
Use Internet cafes.",How to Travel Comfortably Around South America," It sounds simple but it is really important if you will be carrying your luggage from one place to another. Expect to travel in buses, taxis, trains, and on foot, and through airports and hotels. It really makes a difference if your stuff is easy to carry. Don't take anything that isn't strictly necessary.


Shoes can be heavy and take up lots of room. Try to take only one or two pairs and remember that the streets will be dirty; it's good to take an older pair for around town and a light pair (flip-flops are good) for evenings.
If you can keep your luggage to one carry-on sized bag, you may be able to avoid having to check anything or leave any bags in a bag deposit. You will also have an easier time getting around.;
, Bear in mind that your bags will be tossed around a lot in airports, train stations, etc. It needs to be sturdy or you will find yourself buying new bags which, though cheap, won't last long. Though good bags are expensive, it's worth investing a little at the start to avoid lots of spending later and much inconvenience.


Whatever bags you take, make sure you can transport them easily yourself. If you are getting new bags, consider getting them with wheels so that they are easy to move from one place to another. Though surfaces may not be entirely smooth, it makes life easier.
On the other hand, consider getting bags small enough and keeping them light enough not to need wheels. Wheels add weight and bulk to a bag, and you may find yourself navigating tiled, uneven sidewalks, cobblestone streets, stairs and even unpaved surfaces. Consider using a rucksack (backpack) or lightweight shoulder bag instead of a suitcase.

, A few countries require vaccinations for entry; many others recommend vaccinations.

, Some parts of South America, such as high in the Andes mountains, are free of mosquitoes and other insects that carry disease; many more areas are at risk for insect-borne diseases, including dengue, yellow fever, and malaria. It is best to avoid being exposed.

, If you take electrical appliances (hair-dryers, camera charger, laptop), you will need an electrical adapter. Remember that the voltage and frequency (Hertz or Hz) may also be different from what you have at home. If it is, you may need an adapter that includes a transformer or converter, not just a plug that fits. Check the labels on the devices you will use to see if they can accept different electricity supplies. Cut out or cut down on electrical devices if you don't really need them, to reduce weight and minimize the damage in case your luggage gets lost.

, In many toilets in South America, toilet paper is not provided. Taking a wad with you from your hotel ensures that you won't be left without. Also, it's easy to catch a cold at high altitude if you're not used to it. Using toilet paper is cheaper and easier than carrying around packets of tissues and it means you can top up every evening from your hotel.

, Weather in South America can vary, so it's easier if you take layers of clothes that you can put on and off. A light raincoat is good for wet weather; these days, it is easy to get macs that pack up nice and small. Long-sleeved t-shirts or light jumpers are better than thick sweaters but remember that it is unlikely you'll need more than one or two outer layers.

, Hotel washing can be very expensive and difficult if you're only there for one night; it is far easier to wash knickers and socks while you shower, then hang them up to dry overnight. If wrung out thoroughly, they will be dry by morning so that you can have clean underwear every day without taking lots of pairs. If you have a bit more time, you can wash other clothing by hand, too, or you can use a laundromat (lavendería) or hotel laundry service.

, If you're traveling in the Andes, even in the winter, it is easy to get sunburn. Though it may still feel cold, put sun-cream on your face to protect it.

, These are handy if you get hungry while traveling. It may be difficult to get food if you're in a remote area or traveling by coach.

, These usually have little or no extra charge and are much better than carrying valuables around town with you.

, When you must carry your passport, credit card, or the like, use interior pockets or a money belt to keep them out of sight and out of reach.


Do not set bags down in restaurants, Internet cafes, or the like, and do not leave bags unattended or hang them over the back of a chair. These areas are frequent targets for pickpockets.
Don't wear expensive jewelry.

, Many hotel rooms face noisy streets.

, In many places, web cafes are abundant and inexpensive. You may be able to avoid carrying a laptop around, which in turn will eliminate the possibility of loss or theft.


In Argentina, look for the word locutorio to identify web cafes. These shops often have public telephones and they may have basic post office services, too.

This could add substantial costs, depending on your circumstances., Before you begin to think about travel or lodging accommodations, you need to put together a budget for your trip to Puerto Rico. Without a budget, you won't know what you can afford to do, and what you can not.


Determine the total amount of money you have for the trip. This includes trip savings you may have put aside, cash, and any credit card debt you are considering taking on for your trip.
Figure out how much of your money you have to devote to travel and lodging. This will help you decide what type of vacation you can take. For instance, if you have limited money for lodging, you might consider a cruise because that will bundle travel and lodging together.

Crouch over the toilet opening.,
Do your business.,
Wash your private areas with the available water.,
Throw toilet paper in the trash can.,
Flush the toilet.,
Dry off.,
Wash your hands with soap.",How to Use an Indian Bathroom," You may need to search for usable toilets if you are disabled. Disability isn’t well-understood or accommodated in India and the residents have the benefit of using squat toilets their whole lives. This can be a particular challenge for people who have a hard time squatting, such as those pregnant, elderly, or with disabilities. As of 2016, India does not have much in the way of accommodations for these groups, so try to plan out your route before you arrive.Search the Internet for Western toilets and toilets with ramps, handrails, and Braille signs. Ask hotel concierges and city guides where to find accommodations.
Stay near public places such as railway lines. This is where the government has indicated it will improve disability access.
47 newer smart toilets that are handicap-accessible were approved in 2016 for public use in New Delhi. Seek out these once they are built.Children can use the same toilets as adults.;
, Squat toilets in India don’t use toilet paper but rather water to rinse areas that come into contact with wastes. Because toilet paper typically isn't used, a spray hose or a bucket of water is the only source. Sometimes other guests use the water before anyone notices and refills the bucket.


The bathroom should either have a spray hose for cleaning or a bucket of water with a bowl or mug. If there isn’t any water, find a different toilet.

, Hygiene standards in India are spotty at best. Indians use their left hand with water to clean away wastes. If you have to risk using your hand, you’re going to want to choose a toilet that has soap available for use afterwards.


Keep wipes, soap, or sanitizer on hand for such occasions. This reduces your need to search for an alternative bathroom in an emergency.

, This is optional, but putting a little water down before you go helps keep your shoes from sticking to the floor and makes it easier for you to wash away wastes later.


Dip the mug or bowl in the bucket or use the spray hose. Use enough to wet the floor without making the floor slippery. Leave enough water to use on yourself later.

, Beginners especially benefit from removing their lower garments. Some places will have hooks for clothes, but others have pipes and other outcroppings that allow you keep your clothes and valuables from harm.

, The safest way to avoid getting water and waste on your pants and underwear is to remove them entirely. Some bathrooms may have a hook or other place you can hang them. If not, try to find a creative way to wrap them around a pipe or other feature.You can use a squat toilet without removing your clothing. Pull them down around knee length and don’t forget to roll up your pant legs.
If you are wearing a skirt, you can bunch it up in your right hand.

, The toilet forms a u-shape with a hole in the back end. The correct position is similar to the one you would use with a Western toilet. Your back will be to the wall. Align your backside over the hole., There may be foot pads on the side of the toilets. While standing, place a foot on either side with the toilet’s hole behind you. If there are no pads, place a foot on each side of the toilet about shoulder-width apart.

, The toilet functions the same as an upright toilet but has no seat. To find comfortable positioning, bend your knees and lower yourself as if you’re balancing weights on your shoulders until you reach a semi-sitting position.You may be most comfortable with your thighs together and your arms resting on your knees.

, It helps to lower yourself as much as possible. Aim for the hole to avoid as much splashback as possible., You will need about 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of water for this task. Use the spray hose to rinse or take the dipper provided in the water bucket. With your right hand, throw the water up at the dirty areas.In India, it is common to clean with the left hand. When you use your right hand to throw the water, reach between your legs with your left hand. Cup your left hand to collect some falling water and use this to clean yourself.

, If there is toilet paper or you brought your own, don’t put it down the hole. The plumbing isn’t designed to take the paper and you will cause a clog. Some bathrooms include a trash can where you can put the used paper.


If there is no trash can and you have used paper, store it in a bag until you can find a place to dispose it. Bring along a bag for this purpose if necessary.

, If the toilet has a water tank, all you have to do is pull a side handle. Other squat toilets have hanging flush chains. Still others don’t flush at all and require you to take the spray hose or the dipper and pour the water over any waste to wash it away., If there’s a towel or tissues available, use these. Don’t put them down the toilet hole or else you’ll cause a clog. Deposit used tissues in a trash can.


It helps to carry a towel or tissues on your travels along with a bag to store used ones in until you can find a place to dispose of them.

, In some places, soap is provided. Scrub your hands using the available water. If you didn’t check for soap before you started, there’s not much you can do but search for some once you leave.

, Again, a link is provided at the bottom of the page.

, High traffic ferries going between the San Juans require almost 1 1/2 hours by car and about 30 minutes by foot. On-foot rides are generally recommended for most sailings.

, If you prefer, you can purchase tickets online. Prices vary greatly depending on the route (which can be $7 a person or about $20 for a car and driver for the Bremerton route to almost $17 dollars a person and $45 dollars for a car for the Sidney route). Credit cards are accepted.

, If going by car, you'll load into a garage area and then take stairs up to the main passenger area. If going on foot, you'll cross a bridge onto the viewing deck and directly into the main passenger area.

, This is the best part of the ride: every route is scenic, providing legendary views, and cameras are recommended. The ferries also provide wifi service for $7 a ride or $30 a year. Little cafes are on board, along with vending machines. Eating tables are provided for these purposes. The passenger area itself can be explored, and outside viewing decks and lounges can also be found. Scattered around are various editorials and advertisements for places in the Puget Sound area. A typical ride last about 45 minutes, but can be as long as 3 hours.

, Get to your car when prompted, and get to the unloading area when prompted.

, This should be pretty self explanatory.

, If you brought your own car, you can skip this step. If you arrived by foot and have no intention of venturing far past the ferry dock, you can also skip this step. If, however, you're going to go far past the dock (such as exploring the San Juans or getting to your work 10 blocks away), you'll need to board a metro bus, light rail train, or sounder train. Up in Friday Harbor, you have the option of renting vehicles to go around with.

, Tickets are issued for time slots of 15 minutes, and each time slot is limited to 20 visitors. Once you receive your tickets, you have to return 15 minutes before the assigned time to reconfirm your reservation. If you are early enough in the morning, you may choose the time slot for your visit. You will then be ushered to a waiting gallery. The gallery is in itself worth visiting, as there are interesting exhibits relating to tall buildings. There is a ""live"" demonstration of what happens when lightning strikes a tall building, and also a laser sensor that compares your height with that of the tower.

, You will be invited into the 3-D auditorium where Polaroid glasses will be loaned to you. Here you will learn all about the construction and concept of the Petronas Twin Towers.

If the wind is strong during your visit you might feel the building actually sway as much as 30 centimeters (11.8 in).

, If you want to avoid the long queue, you can tip someone (especially taxi drivers or bellboys) to obtain tickets on your behalf. One person may obtain up to five tickets.

, You can casually arrive around 3:00 or 4:00 PM without a ticket and try your luck. As the tickets are given out free, some people who queue in the morning fail to return at their assigned time later in the day. If you are lucky, you may get tickets without the hassle of early morning queuing.

, Single visitors or couples have a better chance of getting in than do larger groups. In any event, don't be disheartened if you fail to get tickets. Try again at another time.

, You can visit KL Tower instead. It gives you an even better view of Kuala Lumpur, is seldom crowded, and you won't have to hassle with queues. However, it is not free, and you need to go there by taxi. It is a good 30-to-40-minute walk.

, It's not recommended, but it is possible to do it Alain 'Spiderman' Robert style. On 20 March 1997 a French ""Spiderman"" attempted to climb the towers without so much as a safety harness. He was stopped by local police on the 60th floor. (The Skybridge is at Level 41.) He attempted it again ten years later and was again stopped by the authorities at the same level.

, See the story in the local newspaper, The Star .

, For groups up to 120 students, you may write in to obtain special approval for your visit. This will allow you to avoid the queue.

Decide which neighborhood to live in.,
Decide how much you want to pay in rent.,
Look for a place to live in D.C.


Craigslist is a good place to look for apartment listings, room shares, and sublets.",How to Find a Place to Live in D.C.,"


D.C. has a number of diverse neighborhoods that all have their advantages and disadvantages. One of the main things to keep in mind is that the city has one of the longest commute times in the entire country, so you'll want to choose a neighborhood that is close to your place of work, internship or study, or one that offers an easy and fast commute.
D.C. has an extensive and reliable public transportation system, so you might want to consider using that to get around rather than driving and losing precious hours in traffic.
The area around Capitol Hill is called Capitol Hill, and includes the Supreme Court building and the Library of Congress, as well as the Union Market, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and Eastern Market. Because it offers a good connection to other areas by means of the metro or bus, it's a great area for staffers and interns on Capitol Hill.
Dupont Circle, where the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut come together, is a lively neighborhood that is both walkable and has a great connection to other parts of the city thanks to its metro station. Condos, apartments, and homes are available to rent on your own or to share in this part of town.
Adams-Morgan is an exciting and culturally diverse area. It's tiny and trendy and known for its nightlife, restaurants and boutiques, and there are 2 metro stations within 1 mile (1.6 km).
Cleveland Park/Woodley Park, about 20 minutes from downtown D.C., features magnificent old homes with large porches on beautiful streets. It is also next door to Rock Creek Park, the third oldest US National Park where locals hike and horseback on 32 mile long trails. Cleveland Park and Woodley Park are easily accessible by public transportation and the former has a metro stop.
Georgetown, where Georgetown University is located, offers a vibrant pub and nightlife scene. Colonial row houses, upscale boutiques and restaurants, and picturesque gardens make this a pleasant place to live.
Glover Park, just north of Georgetown, is mainly residential. Due to its proximity to Georgetown University and American Universities, it's home to many students.
Foggy Bottom lies along the border with Virginia and can be reached with the Blue and Orange metro lines. Due to the proximity to George Washington University, there are numerous apartment and condo rentals.
The following 2 neighborhoods, Downtown and The Mall, aren't specifically places to look for apartments, but if you come across one, it might offer a good location. Downtown is all about hotels, museums, federal buildings, and lobbying firms, but it also holds Chinatown and the Penn Quarter with the Verizon Center. The Mall town attracts thousands of tourists as it stretches 2.5 miles (4 km) from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. Most of the monuments, including the Smithsonian museums, are located here.;
,


Be prepared for steep rent prices. If you can only afford under $1000, you're probably best off looking to live with 1 or more roommates. Between $1000 and $2000 you can get a studio in most locations, and sometimes even a 1 bedroom.
Determine for how long you need to rent. Most rentals are long-term, meaning you'll have to sign a lease for at least 12 months. You can find shorter leases such as month to month, but you could look for sublets, instead.
The suburbs offer cheaper rents, but you're looking at a longer commute and higher transportation costs.

, However, you need to react quickly as apartments go fast.
Other publications mainly feature the same listings as those on Craigslist.
If you know anybody in D.C., ask them to help you out. Word of mouth is the best way to find a safe and affordable place.
Ask if your place of work or study offers any help in your relocation. If you're a student, there are dorms available, and many of the companies and institutions provide housing for employees by working with local estate agents.
Sign a lease.
Always review the lease carefully so you know and understand exactly what you're agreeing to.
If you're going to live with a roommate, sign a roommate agreement that clearly states each party's rights and obligations.

Adult 2400JPY
Child 1200JPY.;
, Check the signs in the airport or ask for directions if you're unsure. The bus stops you need to find are:


Terminal 1 → Bus stop 7.
Terminal 2 → Bus stop 11.

, You'll find that the direct bus (a limousine bus) runs six times each day, so if you've just missed one, note the time of the next one and head back into the airport for rest and refreshment. If one is arriving soon, simply wait.


To be more efficient, download a timetable before you leave on your vacation, so that you have a good idea when the bus will be available and whether you'll make the connection easily., Place your luggage in the bus luggage holder and find a seat. Expect the direct journey to the airport to take about 60 to 85 minutes.

, Retrieve your bags and begin your stay.

Decide when to go.,
Once you've selected a date, see which events will be going on when you head into town.,
Drive to Washington if you live a reasonable distance away, or take the train.,
Start the day by eating a quick breakfast and visiting one of the many Smithsonian museums along the National Mall.,
Alternatively, for a more historical experience (better for older kids), visit Arlington National Cemetery in nearby Virginia, Mount Vernon, the National Gallery of Art or the Supreme Court building.,
Eat lunch at the museum's cafeteria or a nearby restaurant.,
Visit a national monument.,
Walk over to one of the national memorials.,
If time allows, visit another Smithsonian museum or go shopping.,
Eat dinner out or pick it up on the way home.,
Go home and enjoy the memories and photos of your family day out in Washington, DC!

","How to Plan an Outing for Kids in Washington, DC"," The weather in Washington, D.C. can be unpredictable at times, but this is not always the case. Spring is the best season to visit as it will be warm and the city's plants and trees will be blossoming; fall is a good time to go as well. The summers are hot, muggy, and crowded, but present the best opportunities for outdoor activities. Wintertime is downright cold but the city looks amazing when blanketed in snow.;
, You don't want to be stuck fighting the crowds or traffic nightmares if an enormous convention or political parade will be going on.

, Make sure you leave early and allow plenty of time for unexpected delays, backups, or closures. Bring along some activities to keep your kids occupied if the drive is long, such as books on tape, travel games or iPods.

, They are all free to enter and most are much larger than the museums you may have been to back home. Some recommended Smithsonian museums for kids include the National Air & Space, American History, and Natural History. Allow between 2-4 hours to explore.


There are many other museums in Washington that kids will enjoy visiting. Some have admission fees, but they cater to a variety of interests from espionage to news broadcasting to crime and punishment. Browse the web or look through a city guidebook for more information.

, Younger kids may also enjoy a morning at the National Zoo.

, Take this time to go over the day so far, examine a map of the city or plan out what everyone wants to do next. If you have any non-perishable leftovers, take them along for a quick snack in case you or your kids get hungry before dinner.

, Walk, drive, or take the subway to one of the city's many historic sites, including the Capitol Building, White House, Washington Monument, National Mall, Library of Congress, etc. Spend at least an hour exploring and taking photos (if you have a camera with you).

, While younger kids may get bored, older ones may enjoy walking around the memorials of Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt, etc. Ask one of the National Park Service rangers on duty to give you some facts or history of the memorial.

, Many museums and other places of interest close early depending on the season, so you may have better luck with this step in the summer than the winter.

, If you can leave before or after rush hour, you will have a better time avoiding Washington's infamous traffic backups and other delays getting out of the city on time. Make sure your kids have used the bathroom before leaving as well!

Find out what and where your destination is.,
Be familiar with the Metro hours.,
Enter the Metro station, arriving by personal vehicle and parking in the designated area.,
Determine your specific destination once in the station.,
Obtain a Metro pass(paper ticket or a plastic SmartTrip card)


The SmartTrip card is durable, reusable, card that can be used to purchase fares for Metro rides.,
Go through the ticket gate using your Metro pass.,
Insert your paper ticket, or swipe your Smartcard.,
Find the correct platform.,
Board the Metro train.,
Find a place to sit or stand.,
Get off at the stop you determined earlier by using the map.,
Exit the car quickly to the station exit.

,
Follow all exit signs, but be sure you are not reading the signs to exit in case of fire, as this can get you a ride in the back of a police car (unless there really is a fire).",How to Navigate the D.C. Metro System," Without this information, there is no purpose in riding the metro.Make note of the Metro stops in the relative area of the location in which you are travelling to. Read the map to find this information.


There will a sign indicating where Metro exits will be located on the street, but it saves a lot of time and guesswork to plan out your trip and to be familiar with the surrounding stops before you enter the city.;
, The Washington Metro isn't open 24/7, so be sure to make other travel arrangements if you need to travel in DC outside of operating hours.


Make sure you leave plenty of time to return to your final stop before the Metro closes.
Check for expected closures and disruptions in the Metro operating schedule using their website.

, In some locations outside the city, you can expect to find outside parking lots that aren't covered with an overhang, while those inside you'll need to find their parking garage or nearest parking area that is designated by Metro. (You will need to pay to exit). You may also ride the Metro bus or a taxi to and from the Metro station.


Note which entrance you used to enter the Metro station so you can exit the same way. There are multiple exits in the Metro.

,


Use the map near the ticket purchasing area to determine:

Which color line your destination is on
How many stops until your final destination
If and when you will need to switch to a different color line



, A balance may be kept on the card, which cuts down travel time, but the rides are a bit pricier so buy it only if you intend to use the Metro frequently.
To purchase a ticket, follow the directions on the display window of the ticket machine. You can buy a Smartcard with a machine next to the ticket machine.

Determine the amount that needs to be on your Metro pass


On the ticket machine there is a table that corresponds to the amount it will cost to travel to a specific stop at specific times. Use this table to determine the exact amount of the trip by adding together the cost of the trip into DC and the trip back from DC.

, Put your pass in a safe spot, as you'll need it at your exit point. Only use the gates which have a lit-up green arrow. The gates which have a red circle on them are used for exiting and will not accept your pass.

, Be ready to retrieve your ticket from the top-side of the machine. (It'll go in one side and straight out the other.)


Observe the digital screen by the ticket slot in the gate to be certain that your ticket was read. If the ticket is not read on entry, you will not be able to exit the Metro station. Do not hesitate to walk through it because it will close fast.
There is an information booth with sometimes a station attendant (Stationmaster) near the ticket gate where you can ask for assistance or further information.

, There are signs that state the color of the line and the last stop of that line to indicate with direction the Metro train is travelling in. These signs have arrows that indicate in which direction you should proceed.


On the platform there are digital signs that state which train is coming on which line and how long it will be until the train arrives. It'll also say when the train boards, and will also tell you when it departs, though you can tell by the way the train looks at that time, when these other actions have taken place.
Some metro stops are a part of multiple lines. The color of the line will be displayed digitally on the Metro train. Pay attention to what color the line the train you are about to board belongs to. This will ensure that you board the right train and reach your final destination without having to backtrack.
If the station has the red line in addition to any other lines, the red line will be upstairs, and the others will be on the lower platform.
At L'Enfant station - the station with the most lines running through it - the green and yellow lines are upstairs, while the blue and orange are downstairs.

, When the train comes, the lights on the platform next to the track will begin to blink. This would be a good time to take a few steps back if you are close to the track, because the train comes in at a high speed.

, If you are getting off within a couple of stops, try to find a place near the door.


Note the direction that the train came in. If you are prone to motion-sickness, it may be beneficial to sit in the direction the train is moving.

,


The next stop is announced by overhead speakers (but is not always clear) or use the map located in each Metro car.
By looking through the car windows, note the signs on the platform or on the wall of the tunnel that indicate the stop you’re at.

,, Following the crowd in this case can actually be beneficial for finding the exit area, but do not follow the crowd blindly, or you may end up exiting at the wrong exit.


Note the street on which you are exiting before you exit the ticket gate. If it is not the street exit you had planned on, it may be difficult to orient yourself or find the street you need.
Only use the gates which have a lit-up green arrow. The gates which have a red circle on them are used for entering and will not accept your pass. Insert your ticket or swipe your Smartcard.
If you do not have enough money on your card to exit there should be a few ticket booths located on the train side of the station platform that you can purchase additional fare or buy another ticket or add money to your pass.

Enjoy Thai food.",How to Live in Thailand," Apply for a passport if you do not have one. A passport is a form of identification that verifies your citizenship in a country and allows you to travel to other countries.


Check to see if you need a visa for entry into Thailand. This is required for visitors from some countries. A visa is a document that authorizes a non-citizen to enter a country for a period of time or for a specific purpose. Citizens from most countries can enter and stay in Thailand for 30 consecutive days with a valid passport. Your time in Thailand can be extended for up to 90 days. After the 90 day period, you must apply for a visa to remain in the country.Some foreigners use this loophole to avoid getting a visa. They simply leave the country for an afternoon and return later that day. This restarts your 30-day, passport period.
Make sure you acquire a tourist or retirement visa before entering the country if you are planning to live in Thailand for longer than 90 days or are retiring there. Contact the Thailand Immigration Bureau or the Thai Embassy in your country. You may obtain a work permit on your own through the Thai Embassy; however, if you accept a position with a company that operates in Thailand, the company will obtain the work visa on your behalf.;
, Choose accommodation based on your proposed visit length. Thai hotels provide modest to expensive accommodations for short term living in the country. For long term stays in Thailand, non-citizens may rent an apartment or house, live with a host family or purchase a condominium. Condominiums are the only property non-citizens are allowed to buy in Thailand. It is not difficult to find accommodation after arrival, depending upon the season (high season or around holidays it is more difficult).


Investigate the costs of utilities, including electricity, water, and phone, and learn how and where you will need to pay them every month if you won't be staying at a hotel. In general, utilities and cell phone service is relatively inexpensive compared with other countries. One exception is the use of air conditioning can inflate the electricity bill by $100-$200 USD/month, possibly more for continual use. Residents of some apartment complexes, for example, receive an itemized statement at the end of the month that includes their rent and utilities.

, You may think that Bangkok is the place for you. Many expats settle in Bangkok because it is the central financial, political, economic, and cultural hub of the country. There are many great places you might consider moving. Perhaps, city life isn’t your preference. See what the other provinces have to offer.


Chiang Mai, Phuket, Hua Hin, Chiang Rai, and Rayong are other popular, more off-the-beaten-track places you might consider researching., Do you like milder temperatures? Do you like seasons? Thailand is a temperate location with warmer temperatures year round. If you go into Norther Thailand, the higher elevations will bring milder and even colder temperatures. Light layers, sleeve-shirts, and shorts are a must in most of Thailand.


Thailand experiences 3 seasons. The rainy season (May-October) is produced from monsoons that emerge over the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. The cool season (November-February) is the nicest time of year to visit Thailand. Despite its sometimes cooler temperatures, it can still get to around 30 degrees celsius or 86 degrees fahrenheit in the afternoon. The hot season (March-May) can witness temperatures well above 35 degrees celsius or 95 degrees fahrenheit. This is the prime beach-going season in Thailand., Review your transportation options. In the urban areas of Thailand these usually include bus service, car taxis, motorbike taxis, samlors (also called rickshaws), train and boat services. Walking is also an option based on where you live in proximity to work, shopping and entertainment. Renting motorbikes and bicycles by the day, week and month is widespread. Also purchasing a motorbike (used or new) is much more affordable if staying in Thailand for 6 months or longer.


Non-citizens can purchase cars and motorcycles in Thailand. It is pretty easy to drive in Thailand. In the cities, people often double and triple park. It is not unusual for a triple parked car to be left in neutral. You can just push the car out of the way, if they’ve blocked you in., If you want to live in Thailand, you'll need a source of income. Some people who work exclusively online or for themselves manage to find ways of living in Thailand without finding a job located there. Most likely, you'll want to find employment in the country.


Consider teaching English, a popular job for non-citizens in Thailand. The pay for teachers in Thailand is modest. Work permits are needed for all kinds of paid employment.Research companies operating in Thailand that hire outside of the country. The industries that offer the greatest opportunities for non-citizen workers are finance, computers and engineering. Many companies operating in Thailand will offer potential non-citizen employee packages that include the offer for work and subsidies for housing.Certain jobs in Thailand are restricted to Thai natives including barber, beautician, carpenter, and secretary., If you plan to live and work in Thailand, having a bank account will be helpful for navigating everyday life. This is one of those activities that you really can only do, once you’ve made the move.


There are international bank locations located in Thailand you can use, if you decide to keep your original bank.The Thai Baht (THB, ฿) is the currency of Thailand. The US dollar or other currency are rarely accepted, though most banks are able to change currency.
Decide on the type of account you want to open. Your choice will be determined based on your work visa. Very few banks allow foreigners to open banks without a visa. Some banks require proof of residence, which a lease or affidavit from your embassy or consulate can provide. The vast majority of accounts used are savings accounts, which include ATM and Visa/Mastercard logos. Some banks restrict where the Visa/Mastercard function can be used (SCB Bank), some do not (Kbank, Bangkok Bank).
Almost no one uses a current account (checking account). Checks are rarely used. Bank transfers are much more common and can be done using ATMs or online banking. PayPal also operates in Thailand and though they do not have a credit card option like in other countries, it is possible to transfer funds between your Thai PayPal account and Thai banks as well as US banks.

, It is pretty easy to get a cell phone in Thailand. There are hundreds of retailers and all of them offer no-contract, pay as you go service. So just buy a phone, get some credit, pick a phone number, and start making calls right away.


Many expats complain that Thai phone companies charge you based on time rather than data for using the internet on your smartphone. Some people find that their data deteriorates quickly, especially if you have several apps that constantly use 3G to update themselves., Most of Thailand is still on the dial-up system, but the urban areas like Bangkok offer cheap high-speed internet. If your internet reliance is not that high, most bigger cafes and restaurants have free wifi internet., In general, health treatment costs are cheaper than in the United States and Europe. You have two options. You can either pay for international health insurance form your home country or you can sign up for Thai health insurance, which functions like health insurance elsewhere in the world. If you plan to permanently relocate to Thailand, international insurance may not work. Ask your provider before you move. Sometimes, they place time limits on how long you can hold health insurance in specific countries., Most people who relocate to the country find it nearly impossible to distinguish between sentences or even individual words. As with any language, it will take some time to develop an “ear” for the language. Get cracking. Moreover, the Thai people love it when foreigners put forth an effort. You’ll find that you’ll be received with greater hospitality, if you at least try to speak the language.The vast majority of residents in Thailand speak some form of Thai, and most business is conducted in the Thai language. In tourist areas, there are usually some English-speaking customer service people (for example, the main branches of the Internet and Cell phone service providers). It is wise to learn as much of the Thai language as you can to assist with navigating daily life among the Thai people.
Options for learning Thai include taking classes facilitated by native Thai speakers; learning to read Thai using text books and Thai-English dictionaries; hiring a native Thai speaker to be your conversation partner; or taking an online course that offers free and fee-based materials.Watch a lot of Thai TV too. One of the best ways to improve your language skills is to watchTV in the language you’re learning. You’ll be able to pick up context clues from their actions.

, If you move to Thailand, you'll inevitably have to deal with its government. Thailand has technically been a constitutional monarchy under a parliamentary democracy since 1932. Yet, since its foundation, the military and the monarch have intervened repeatedly and temporarily disrupted democratic proceedings. Despite this, the bureaucratic system works pretty well and is relatively open to foreigners who want to relocate.


The Thai people are very serious about their nation and their government. Do not show any signs of disrespect., The Thai people are fiercely proud of their country and their history.Theravada Buddhism is an important part of Thai history. Roughly 95% of the population is Buddhist. There are temples throughout the country you can visit and monks are the most revered members of society. You can even see images of monks in graffiti, in taxi cabs, and on TV commercials.


Embrace the spiritual side of Thailand. The primarily Buddhist country offers meditation retreats and tours of several shrines and temples throughout Thailand.Chiang Mai in particular has many beautiful Buddhist temples that are open to the public. Be sure to show respect when you enter any of these temples. Wear appropriate clothing and be sure to remove your shoes before you enter.The next largest minority in Thailand is Islam. Accounting for about 4% of the population, the majority of Muslims live in the southern provinces near the Malaysian border. There are also sizable Christian, Hindu, Confucian, and Taoist communities in Bangkok., Like most countries, Thailand has a number of polite customs you’ll want to observe. Most importantly, avoid raising your voice or getting angry. Signs of anger are frowned upon in the “land of smiles.”


Greetings in Thailand are different from in the Western World. Rather than shaking hands, waving, or giving the “what’s up” head nod, the proper way to greet in Thailand is the wai. Place your finger tips together just below your chin like you are about to start praying. Bow your head. Avoid excessive physical contact and take your shoes off before entering any Buddhist temples or Thai personal residences.
No matter what, the Thai population will see you as a foreigner. They will probably call you ""farang"" rather than by your name. For some this is a derogatory term. For others, it is just a common phrase. Just go with it. Don't be confrontational. The Thai people pride themselves on their politeness. Most likely, they won't use ""farang"" in a negative sense, unless you give them a reason to be upset.Thai people have a strong sense of nationalism that pervades their entire culture. They will proudly tell you of their nation, its history, and its unique culture. At the same time, they will always see you as different. This manifests itself in strange ways. If you get in a car accident, for example, most likely you will be blamed for it. If you weren't in the country, you wouldn't have been in the car in the first place and no accident would have occurred. It doesn't make too much sense, but there is little fighting it., There are cruises and all kinds of ecotourist activities. Try taking biking tours, hiking, kayaking, and other water activities.Travel around the country is fairly cheap as well, with many train routes to dozens of far off destinations. Train travel is safe and incredibly cheap. A 48 hour train trip from Bangkok to Singapore is only about $60. In addition, you'll get to see great views from your seat in the train car., Thailand offers a variety of eating options. Food can range from very inexpensive to expensive, and cuisine (in the tourist/larger cities) includes various international options as well as fast food chains."

Note that paved streets and sidewalks have a logic to their layout so you don't need to be a local to make sense of it all. Numbered streets run north and south; lettered streets run east and west and state-names streets run diagonally, often meeting at traffic circles and squares.
Keep your costs down by knowing the hours of operation and what the size of the crowd will be like at your desired destination before you go.;
, Each season has hot-spot attractions as well as year-round favorites.

, Popular and economically-friendly options include walking, cycling, driving and taking D.C. Metrorail or Metrobus. Your Washington, D.C. map should indicate the D.C. Metrorail stations. Signs for Metrobus and D.C. Circulator bus stops are frequently and conveniently located throughout the city.


Walk on wide, paved sidewalks that line the four main streets: Independence Avenue, Jefferson Drive, Madison Drive and Constitution Avenue; surrounding 10 of the Smithsonian museums located in downtown Washington, D.C.
Bike along the street or one of five major Washington, D.C. trails: The Capital Crescent Trail; Chesapeake & Ohio Towpath; Rock Creek Trail; Anacostia Northwest and Northeast Trails.
Ride the DC Metrorail subway system. The five colored, handicapped-accessible train lines link the city and surrounding metropolitan area. Brown pylons capped with the letter M, mark station entrances. Route maps are posted at each station and inside each subway car. The D.C. Metrorail operates continually from 5:30 a.m. on weekdays and 7 a.m. on weekends. Fares start at $1.35. Certain subway cars accommodate bicycles.
Bus your way through town on either the D.C. Metrobus or the D.C. Circulator bus. The Metrobus runs continually throughout the city. There are discounted fares if you transfer between Metrorail and Metrobus. The shuttle, D.C. Ciculator bus lines are more limited, but also less expensive than riding the Metrobus. Both bus lines can accommodate cyclist commuters and their bicycles.

, MTR signs are located above ground near the entrance of all MTR stops. Look for signs that are all red aside from a white symbol, see image as an example. Occasionally you can find an MTR sign within a building in a mall area such as at the “Central” stop.

,


Enter the subway station and find a teller station. To enter a station in most cases you will be walking down a couple flights of stairs. At every stop there is a kiosk with at least one person working. Ask the MTR worker for an Octopus card and map.
Octopus cards cost a total of 150 HKD, 50 HKD is used as a deposit on the card and can be reclaimed at the end of your stay. The rest of the 100 HKD balance is left on the Octopus card which can be used for traveling the MTR and many other forms of public transportation in HK.

,


The map uses color coordination to indicate different lines, circles to represent stops and ovals to represent line transfer areas.
Different rail way lines are indicated in different colors. If the stop of interest is on a different color line than the stop you are located at, this means you cannot use the same one train to get to the your final destination. At some point you will need to do a line transfer which is covered in later steps.

, After obtaining the MTR map take a moment to find the stop closest to where you're staying. Mark it on the map and write the name down on your index card. Look around and above you to find the stop name from the surrounding signs.

, Now use the MTR map to find places of interest and see stops relative to where you want to go.

, As stated earlier, the color lines on the map indicate the different rail way lines. If the desired final destination is on a different line color than the current station, you will have to transfer between trains. To locate places where you can transfer, look for the oval shapes on the railway line that will have the current line color and the transfer line color located within the oval. Locate the stop needed for line transfer (or transfers if two or more railways are needed) to ultimately get to the final destination.


Note: All railways aside from Airport express travels in both directions
Transfer lines are outlined in black

, Having located final destination, current destination, and all transfer lines it is now time to enter the subway system. Take your Octopus card and find a green light turn style gate. Enter the turn style gate by placing the octopus card on the card reader to allow entry. Enter through the gate.

, Follow signs leading to the subway platform. Typically they lead you down a flight of stairs.

, Most lines have trains operating in both directions. When on the subway platform there will be a tunnel on either side of the platform. It is important to locate the correct direction of the train in order to effectively get to the final destination.


Look for signs typically located on the respective sides of the tracks that state the next stop. If the next stop is going in the direction you want then you have found the right train.

, Multiple trains operate on one track in the same direction. They're usually spaced about 5 minutes apart at the most. If you might miss one, do not run after a train; just wait for the next one.

, The proper way to wait to board the train is to stand on the far right and left of the train doors. People on the train have the right of way to leave first. After the people leaving have departed, you can board.

,


On each train there are maps above each exiting door. These maps indicate the track you are on and all the stops that it will be stopping at. Most times there is a lighted system to indicate what stop the train is at, if not make sure to keep track of what stop you are at.

, Once the train has come to the correct stop or transfer stop, it is time to get off the train. Again people leaving the train have the right of way so when the train stops get off immediately in order to allow boarding passengers to effectively board.

, Currently you should be at a train stop that is indicated with an oval on the MTR map. If you are not currently at a stop like this then return to your map and board the train to get to the proper stop.


Follow the exit signs to get to the main floor of the MTR but be sure do not leave out of turn style gates. Instead of leaving, look for signs directing you to the new line. The signs for the new line will be in the same color the line is on your MTR map. This may take you through a line of tunnels and you will end up finding an open area like all main floors of MTR. Once you have followed the signs to the new line, take the next leg of your trip to your final destination.

, To leave the train station, follow the exit signs that lead up the stairs and locate the same turn style gates that you entered in. Pull your Octopus card out to place over scanner allowing the turn style gates to open. This is when the MTR charges your Octopus card for stops travelled.

, Now you have walked past the turn style gates and are looking to actually leave the MTR station. At most stops there will be a varying rang of 3-6 exits from one underground line. These exits are labeled A-F, each has a sign of the streets that you will arrive at when exiting the subway. Find the correct exit and begin touring Hong Kong!

In Bangkok, go to any travel agent that has a sign showing ""train tickets"" or to the train station.,
Buy tickets to Butterworth, Malaysia.,
Set the days in advance and get the tickets as early as possible.,

",How to Travel from Singapore to Bangkok by Train," The main Bangkok station that has trains going south is called Hualamphong station.;
, Once you cross into Malaysia you will exit the train and go through immigration and customs. Be sure to check ""in transit"" through Malaysia. The train from Bangkok leaves at 2:45pm and takes about 23 hours. It costs about 1,100 Baht for a second class sleeper. This is a wide seat facing another seat that later converts to an upper and lower berth.

, Tickets can be purchased the day of travel, but often only the upper berths are left. They are left because they are not comfortable usually.

, The ticket office in KL is easy to find since everything is in Malay and English. The KL station looks like a nice airport.

, An 8:30am train, 2:30pm, and 10:30pm. If the train is not late (which is unlikely), the 8:30 would be most timely. If you have a long layover, at least 4 hours, you can catch the Light Rail train from inside the KL Sentral station to KLCC station which is the Petronas towers. The tallest buildings in the world.

, The day trips are on regular trains with two seats. There will be a movie (an old TV and crappy VCR at both ends of the cars) and they will be in English. You will pass through customs around Johor Bahru.

, It will save large amounts of money due to the exchange rate of the RM to the Sing Dollar.

, They go all the way through. Use the trains because buses often break down and customs/immigration takes much longer. Plus, the buses claim to have bathrooms, which they do, but no one can use them. Once a passenger used the bathroom for ""sitting"" purposes and had to clean it out himself after the trip.

Plan your travel.,
Co-operate with fellow-passengers.,
Carry essential items.,
Do not carry a lot of valuables.",How to Use Public Transport in India," India is a vast country with many big metropolitan cities. Decide your destination and look for the shortest way to reach it.


If you are travelling to a different city/ state, it is advisable to use the train (railway) service. India has one of the largest railway networks in the world, connecting around 7,500 stations throughout the country.

Visit https://www.irctc.co.in/ for booking tickets, inquiries, etc.


An alternative to railways is the bus service. Buses are slower modes of transport, but connect various small parts of India which aren't covered by the railways, yet.

Bus services are provided most of the state's governments. Private services are available too.


If you are travelling intra-city (within a city), try opting for the local railway services. Local railways are the backbones of various Indian metropolitan cities (including, but not limited to: Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai).


Getting on local trains can be difficult, especially during peak hours. Hundreds of thousands of people use these services everyday.
Use local-bus services. Services from BEST (Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport) and similar agencies make the transportation within a city much easier.

;
, Public transport will be crowded and you'll, usually (during office timings), not find a place to sit. Understand that this is a pain many other people are going through too.

, Long distant transport services like trains and buses occasionally get delayed. Carry the items necessary for your trip.


If you are travelling with children, carry adequate amount of food and water. Keep in mind that you just want to carry adequate, not a lot!
Carry tissues and hand sanitizer. Do not expect the services to be very clean and tidy. Learn to adjust.

, Carrying additional valuables will only tempt people to steal it. Carry only those which is required for the journey.

",How to Find Bombay's Best Tourist Spots," Bombay (Mumbai as it now called) is well connected to all the cities across the world by flights. It is also has flights to other destinations in the country.;
, But for all intents and purposes, you can refer to a good travel website and take a few print-outs.

, It is always hot and humid in Bombay. But do not dress too skimpy! Remember this is conservative country. People will stare at you like you have 2 heads and no legs if you are weirdly dressed. Also, if you plan in visiting any religious spots, you need to have your legs and arms covered. Carry a small scarf as you may need to cover your head too.

Avoid visiting in the height of summer (June-August) as it is blisteringly hot, or going in the winter months (November-March) as it gets so cold!,
Whatever time of year you visit, take multivitamins with you to keep your immune system up.,
Keep an eye on your possessions, especially when you are carrying valuables with you.,
Remember is that you can say no.,
Don't jump at everyone who tries to speak to you.,
Learn some Chinese before you go.,
Although it is said that everything in China is negotiable, it's best to save the haggling for the markets.,
As well as learning some of the language, make sure to research a bit of the culture too, so you know what is and isn't okay.,
Bear this in mind, but don't let it overwhelm you.",How to Survive Beijing," Spring and Autumn are definitely to be recommended as they are the most temperate months. However, if you do end up in Beijing in the summer, a parasol, a fan, and plenty of bottled water are all essential, and if you visit in the winter, plenty of layers and foil-wrapped, baked sweet-potatoes from the street vendors to warm your hands are a must!;
,


As long as you are sensible then you can stay safe and still have fun. Just don't get hoodwinked by the minority that see foreign visitors as an easy target!

, A bag with a zip and a fold-over flap is invaluable in keeping your stuff safe from pickpockets, plus a bit of vigilance on your part!

, Particularly in the tourist areas you will come across people with very good English who claim to be visiting from other provinces. They will invite you to visit somewhere with them. Make an excuse, or simply say no; however you do it, make sure you get out of it - definitely do not say yes! Whilst they may just be wishing to chat with you, the chances are that really they want your money. They will lead you to a tea-house (or some such thing), order a full tea ceremony and then feign shock when the bill arrives, insisting it doesn't cost nearly as much in their province and they're truly surprised before demanding that you pay as they cannot afford it. Often the shop-owners are parties to this little trick, and so many a poor soul has lost out on their RMB this way! Beware!

, Most are kind and helpful, but be aware at the tourist spots that there are those who seem a little too eager to chat...

, This can be very useful. Focus on key phrases so that you can ask basic questions and understand the answers, and be sure to remember how to say thank you!


People appreciate someone who has taken the time to learn at least a little of their language, and it's great in a city where it's easy to get lost if you're able to ask how to get home.
Speaking Chinese is also useful when shopping, though not essential. Still, a little bargaining in Chinese rather than English might just give you the edge, and the lower price!

, Don't lose your nerve - you learn quickly that the asking prices are usually wildly disproportionate to the actual cost. If you give your price and stick to it, even if you have to walk away, it's likely that you'll be chased down soon after with your offer accepted. Shopping is fun in Beijing and you can make some amazing savings as long as you stay strong!

, Avoid sensitive issues when talking, smile when you talk, and bear in mind that it is a land of ceremonies. Err on the side of caution and behave more formally than you would at home to refrain from unintentionally causing offense. A particular faux pas where Europeans and the British are concerned is exaggerated arm movements when talking - keep those hands folded! To fit in with local custom, ladies should wear clothes with a higher neckline too, so as not to cause a scandal.

, Beijingers are used to people from all over the world flying in these days and are generally very welcoming. Above all, enjoy the experience, make the most of it and have fun!

Plan the trip beforehand.,
Know the language.,
Be aware of the Tibetan people's customs.,
Be aware of the hotel conditions.,
Know the best time to visit.,
Know what to pack for your trip.",How to Plan a Trip to Tibet1," Decide where you will be going and how long. If you aim to see only Lhasa and/or areas around it, a four-day visit is sufficient. If you aim to see Mt. Everest, you should be free for at least a week.
, The principal language of Tibet is Tibetan, which is not an easy language to learn. There are several dialects of Tibetan, too, and almost all Tibetans can speak Mandarin, with the exception of the nomadic groups living in Far East Tibet. It is highly recommended to know at least basic Tibetan, but definitely Mandarin Chinese in order to communicate with the Tibetan people.

Keep in mind that there is political opposition to using Chinese in Tibet. If you talk to Tibetans in Chinese, you are linking yourself with the Chinese, who the Tibetans have some bitterness against because of the way the Chinese treat them. However, there are many Tibetans who see Chinese as a fundamental lingua franca and only knowing several pleasantries in Tibetan can help you to make friends with Tibetans.

, Tibetan culture may shock you, as their customs are different from those in many other countries and places. Thus, it is important to reduce this shock by knowing what is proper and improper manners in Tibet to avoid trouble with people there.

Refrain from taking pictures of Buddha statues when visiting the Tibetan monasteries. This is allowed in some of them including the Tashilhunpo Monastery, though you will be charged.
Never smoke during your visit to a monastery. Wear professional clothing; avoid wearing shorts and sunglasses.
Avoid sensitive topics of conversation, such as the political situation in Tibet. Discussing these can lead to arguments, or you may offend people this way.
Always ask permission before going into a monastery.
At a Tibetan dinner, avoid eating with an overfull mouth, and always try to chew quietly. If the host/hostess gives you an item such as a cup of tea, use both hands to take it. This shows gratitude and respect.

, Those differ contingently on whether you are staying in Lhasa or outside of it. For hotels in Lhasa, you can be fairly comfortable as there are heaters and in winter the water is hot. If you are not feeling well at any point, there are doctors that can care for you. Hotels in small towns and cities located outside of Lhasa have basic facilities, and there may not be a heater or hot water during winter. Thus, it is best to stay in Lhasa during the winter if you plan to go to Tibet around then., Anytime from May to October is the best time to go, since the weather allows for comfort and people can breathe in more oxygen. Do keep in mind that Tibet is closed to foreigners during the majority of February, and in March due to this being around Tibetan new year., There are specific requirements for packing because of the conditions in Tibet, including weather and altitude.

Take along warm clothing, such as a fleece or a sweater. This is also necessary during summer, since the temperature drops heavily at night. In addition, take along mountain winter clothing if you are traveling in winter.
You will need sunblock and sunglasses because the sunlight can become strong.
It is very dry in Tibet, so lip cream is necessary to keep your lips moist.
Bring extra snacks in case you are not fond of the Tibetan food, or you don't think you can eat much of it.
Bring altitude sickness medicine and take it at least one day before arriving in Tibet. This will protect against altitude sickness.

You definitely don’t have to dress in business attire or even business casual attire. In fact, the students appreciate that you don’t. Jeans and a shirt will do for most days, but it is advised that you don’t wear flip flops or sandals to class.;
, As you will see, most of the students will dress in the same clothes for two or three days.

,, The RMB (RénMínBì) currently fluctuates around ¥6.40 for every $1.00. The average salary for a contracted teach ranges from ¥4,000 - ¥7,000 ($625 – $1090) per month. The average salary of a contracted Chinese teacher is around ¥2000 ($375) per month. It is true that foreign teachers do get paid more than their counterparts and with the cost of living in smaller cities, the money does in fact go a long way.

, The western food chains will cost about ¥20 - ¥30 per meal. Vegetables and fruits are very inexpensive while meats are a little higher priced at the market/grocery store.

, Mobile phones can range from ¥100 – ¥5,000 depending on the quality. Most of the international mobile phone companies are in China. The mobile phone service will cost about ¥10 - ¥50 per month depending on usage.

, Clothing is very inexpensive to buy clothing due to the shear volume that is produced.

, Beers at a bar ¥10 - ¥20, beers at the market ¥3 - ¥5. There is usually never a cover price to get into a bar/dance club and in fact, these places love when foreigners come in. If you make friends with the owners, drinks might be free.

, Train or bus ticket for 3 hours will cost ¥35 - ¥50, taxis start around ¥3 - ¥6 then it’s about ¥1.8 per k/m, and local city buses are ¥1 - ¥2.

, Tickets are usually priced around ¥40 - ¥65 although sometimes there are pre-sale tickets that are half priced just outside of the building. Most theaters will get a majority of the new American releases.

,, Before you depart, it is best to have travel insurance even if you have been healthy for fifteen years. If something does happen, the medical bills could be costly. There are numerous policies out there to choose from but we recommend Travelex Insurance. They make it easy to find a quote then you can choose which policy fits you best. Most schools will provide you with medical insurance during the length of your contract though if you decide to travel outside of the city, having extra coverage is settling.

, It is important to visit your doctor 6-8 weeks before departure for advice of the necessary vaccinations. Not having the correct vaccinations might prevent you from entering into China. We also suggest visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for further information.

Know the permits necessary to go to Tibet.,
Apply for a Tibet Entry Permit.,
Apply for an Aliens' Travel Permit if necessary.,
Apply for a Military Permit.",How to Plan a Trip to Tibet2," The principal documents that you'll need are the TTB permit, or Tibet Entry Permit (the Tibet Tourism Bureau gives these documents) and the PSB Permit or Aliens' Travel Permit (given by the Public Security Bureau or local police). Note that you cannot travel by yourself; you must have an organized trip booked in advance by a tour group. A licensed tour guide is required to be with you., It is obligatory for all foreigners traveling to Tibet, and allows you to see the capital Lhasa, Namtso Lake, Shigatse, and the Potala Palace. Apply at least 20 days in advance., This is needed for tourism to most areas out of Lhasa, but you can only obtain it after arrival in Tibet., You will need this if heading to sensitive or military areas."

Travel to Nepal or Mainland China.,
Travel to Tibet from Nepal.,
Travel to Tibet from Mainland China.",How to Plan a Trip to Tibet3," Depending on where you live, you may need to take a flight there. Note that getting to Tibet from Mainland China is more recommended as a Group Chinese Visa is necessary if you are entering from Nepal, but not from Mainland China.

By the way, despite the word ""group"" being in the name ""Group Chinese Visa"", you can still obtain one of those if you are a solo traveler on an organized tour.

, You can do this by either transportation or plane. If you'd rather fly, there is an option to fly from Kathmandu to Lhasa, which only takes an hour and 15 minutes. Alternatively, you could ask a travel agency in Nepal to cover for a private vehicle for you or travel by public bus to the Tibetan border. Note that regular tourist vehicles coming from Nepal do not go into Tibet, so a change of vehicles is necessary at the border., You can either go by plane or train. If you'd prefer a plane, try one of the direct flights to Lhasa from certain cities in China: Xining, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Beijing, X'ian, Kunming, etc. The most popular choices for flying to Lhasa are from Xining and Chengdu. You will need the permit that you applied for in order to fly to Lhasa; it will be mailed to you before you travel.

If you are taking the train, note the cities that you can travel from in China: Beijing, Shanghai, Chongding, Lanzhou, Xining and Chengdu. Xining is the best choice as it is the primary entrance to the Tibetan railway and the closest principal city to Lhasa.

At the top of the red building complex, you will find gold roofs with a great shine. This trip will give you a new feeling of appreciation for Tibetan culture and architecture., You will need to take a journey from Shigatse to get there. There are many risks to climbing it, but it is an incredible mountain and the climb is very rewarding. Do not go if you are not feeling well, as it is easy to suffer from altitude sickness., It is an ancient monastery; the first one to ever be constructed in Tibet. It is also the place in which Tibetan Buddhism was founded. In addition, the views there are spectacular; the monastery is in a valley with sand dunes and infertile mountains around it. Note that it takes 1 hour and 30 minutes to get there from Tsetang, and the location is in Shannan Prefecture., It is a palace that very well represents Tibet, with the complex building being magnificently ""red and white"", and the setting is against blue sky and mountains that are green and grey. The Potala Palace features historical features based on the history of Tibet, such as antiques, murals, Buddha statues, and religious jewelry. It is scheduled in nearly all organized tour itineraries."

Consider Shanghai's climate and weather.,
Decide which of Shanghai's attractions and seasonal events you would like to experience, and time your trip accordingly.,
Recognize Shanghai's tourist season and its corresponding rate and crowd increase.",How to Time Your Trip to Shanghai," Shanghai has a climate comparable to that of the United States' southeast coastal states. The spring months of March through May are mild and temperate, while temperatures in the summer rise drastically and cause oppressive heat throughout the city. Autumn brings mild, comfortable temperatures, but the threat of typhoon-propelled rains spikes each September. Winter temperatures usually remain above freezing, but the weather is damp and chilly with occasional snowfall.;
, Shanghai has many traditional and modern festivals for visitors to enjoy throughout the year.


Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, is celebrated on the first day of the first lunar month, which usually falls in late January or early February. Houses are cleaned and decorated with predominantly red-colored calligraphy, paper-cuttings and lanterns to welcome peace and prosperity for the New Year. The revelry and celebration is taken to the streets in the form of lion dancing, dragon dancing, lantern festivals and temple fairs which last for 5-to-7 days.
The Shanghai Peach Blossom Festival is in late March/early April each year and celebrates the blossoming of Nanhui District's beautiful peach trees.
The Longhua Temple Fair is held each year on the 3rd day of the 3rd month of the lunar calendar, the day on which, according to local legend, dragons visit the temple to help grant people's wishes. Locals and pilgrims attend the festival and pay homage to Buddha at this ancient temple.
The Shanghai Tourism Festival is held annually in mid-September. A more modern festival, it celebrates the city's colorful tourist products and activities related to sightseeing, shopping and dining.
Shanghai's old city is home to traditional treasures such as teahouses, active temples, classic gardens and ancient pagodas that remain open year-round.

, Shanghai's busiest tourist seasons coincide with the temperate weather in the spring and fall. The movement of domestic tourists, during public holidays, can increase the local population by tens of millions and quickly clog transportation and available hotel accommodations. Millions of Chinese residents attempt to return to their homes in time for Spring Festival each year, and the effects of the holiday are felt from 2 weeks before Chinese New Year, until 2 weeks after.

Be careful using Google in China, even with a VPN.",How to Go on Google in China," A virtual private network (VPN) obscures the content you are accessing by routing it through a private (and usually encrypted) connection. Many free VPNs will have limits on either bandwidth or total dataflow per day.You can subscribe to higher-volume VPNs for about $10 a month, which may be worth the investment if you know you'll be using them a lot. Consider sharing one VPN account with a few friends to split up the cost.


Visit https://en.greatfire.org/ to check whether a given website is blocked or otherwise restricted in China.;
, Most Chinese internet users don't need to worry about this, because they generally prefer using sites hosted inside of China that the Chinese government does not block. Baidu, for instance, is a search engine that is more popular in China than Google, and it is not blocked by the government. The broader issue is that Baidu only turns up search results from China – and blocks the rest of the world. Many say that the Chinese government has banned Google and other websites largely for the purpose of keeping Chinese citizens out of the global loop.When you use Baidu instead of Google, you will find what Chinese people search. When you search Google, you will find data from around the world.
The same goes for videos: when you search Youku instead of Youtube, you will find what Chinese people search and post. You may find some foreign videos put online by Chinese people, but the service still has its limits.

, The Chinese government has never stated that it is illegal to use a VPN to circumvent the ""Great Firewall"", and nobody has been prosecuted for using a VPN. Despite this, China blocks the websites of most major VPNs. If you access websites that operate in China, remember that they've agreed to disclose information about where you're accessing the site from—and what you're doing on them—upon request from the Chinese government.

, Know that any of these providers may or not have been disabled by the Chinese government by the time you read this. Do your research before you download a VPN, and make sure that it hasn't been banned.


fqrouter: Works well for Android. It is free, and it works best if your phone is rooted. If you use a USB to tether your phone to your laptop, you can get access to unblocked Internet on both devices. This VPN has a stable proxy and a wide range of functions.
SuperVPN: Works with Android. First 30 days are free. After the trial, you can get one free hour, but you must connect again after every hour.
ExpressVPN: Made to run quickly and stably in China. You can use various apps. The service hosts servers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and the west coast of the US. You can get your money back within 30 days, no questions asked. ExpressVPN takes PayPal, most major credit cards, Bitcoin, Unionpay, Alipay, Webmoney, and CashU.
VyprVPN: Works with Windows or Linux. You get 500 MB free each month, but you have to pay for more. Works well when configured with OpenVPN. Use the Chameleon Protocol they offer which was developed to get around the Great Firewall. VyprVPN also accepts Alipay and has recently reduced their price points.
12VPN: Headquartered in Hong Kong, and they have experience with the Great Firewall, many Chinese customers. 7 day money back policy. But no P2P downloading/torrenting.
VPN.AC: Various features for Chinese users, including the ability to make OpenVPN traffic look like regular SSL traffic. There are servers in Hong Kong, Singapore, the west coast of the US. The service also features peering with China Telecom and China Unicom.

, The Chinese government occasionally shuts down some VPN providers, mostly because they crossed some political or other line, but this has no effect on you if you've already downloaded the software. Currently, China is blocking all VPNs at the protocol level (including corporate VPNs). However, there are other VPN providers that stealth techniques to hide their VPN traffic.Ask locals for up-to-date advice on VPN choices. Most people living there will be able to point you to their favorite, free VPNs.
It's rare that already-downloaded VPNs are rendered useless. However, if you find that your VPN provider of choice has been shut down and has become inaccessible to newer users, don't worry – there's always another VPN out there.

, For example, many shopping sites will list Chinese prices—which are typically much cheaper than foreign prices—only when your IP address indicates that you've accessed the site from within China. This means that when you're using your VPN, the site will hide these prices from you because it thinks you're accessing it from outside China – say, the US.

, You will need to download a VPN protocol—a host, of sorts—to set up most of the VPN providers.


OpenVPN: This is currently a less stable protocol/client, although it has been reliable in the past. Know that most ports are blocked – connection reset. The primary cause seems to be spoofed RST packets.L2TP: This is a quick protocol for China. At the time of posting, it functions well.
PPTP: Only use this if L2TP isn't working. PPTP is generally slower and less predictable than L2TP.
SSTP: Use SSTP to connect over secure HTTPS (Port 443). This lets clients access networks securely behind NAT routers, firewalls, and web proxies. You won't need to worry about the usual port-blocking problems.

, Simply run a web search for the VPN client that you plan to use. For instance, ""download ExpressVPN"". You should find a link to the VPN protocol website. If you can't find a website, try downloading a program on a torrent site.

, The interface will be slightly different for each VPN, but you will almost always be prompted to choose a country. This country (e.g. South Korea or Canada) is the country from which you will be pretending to access Google. The VPN will scramble your IP address so that it looks like you're accessing the site from X foreign country. If the VPN has not been restricted by the Chinese government, you should be able to circumvent the Great Firewall.

, Once the VPN is downloaded, select the country that you want to connect to – for instance, the United States or South Korea. Once you've connected, you should be able to visit any site that's blocked in China: Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, etc. When in China, try to connect to a VPN server in Asia (e.g. in China, Hong Kong, Bangkok). The next-best option is to connect to a server on the west coast of the US (e.g. Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco).


Chinese users are often visiting websites based in Mainland China, so the VPN server must be based near the country to keep speeds fast. Westerners, on the other hand, need a server based as close as possible to the web server's country of origin – for instance, choose a US IP address to access a US website.
Western websites will always load much faster through a VPN closer to the home country than to China. On the flip side, Chinese websites will load very slowly with a western IP, because you're routing the web traffic to the other side of the world, then back again.

, Working through a VPN requires much more bandwidth than a standard internet connection. Thus, it cannot be done easily on slower internet connections – especially public networks in places like cafes, airport terminals, and hotels.

, When you're using Google services, don't try to search for sensitive keywords that might catch the attention of the Chinese government. Your connection will be reset, meaning that you'll be shut off of the Internet for about 90 seconds. You should be able to get back on when you can see the website's logo again.

Train schedules are available on a number of websites (including English language sites). A few examples include seat61.com (which includes train schedules and information from all around the world) and chinatrainguide.com.Train schedules can also be had at local train stations. However, the availability of schedules in English may vary greatly from city to city. Cities that typically have large numbers of tourists are the most likely to have schedules in other languages.;
, Tickets are typically available 60 days before departure online and 58 days before departure at the station. Keep in mind that most long-distance trains do sell out, so you may want to book some time in advance.There are a number of websites that list available tickets. The most used booking site for people in China is 12306.cn, but this site is only in Chinese. A few, such as chinahighlights.com and china-diy-travel.com, are in English.

, You can book through the websites listed in the above step. Be aware that only chinahighlights.com lists the prices in U.S. dollars (others list them in renminbi).


Purchasing in person at the station is convenient. You will pay for the ticket and receive it immediately. However, it can be clumsy if you do not speak Chinese.
You can pay for the ticket directly on the website, but you cannot print out the ticket at home. You will receive an e-ticket number, but you cannot use that for boarding. The website chinahighlights.com can send the ticket to a hotel front desk or reserve it for you at the train station's ticket office.The website china-diy-travel.com will only reserve the ticket at the station., Of course, if you are taking a train during a busy travel season, you may want to arrive even earlier. During the Chinese New Year (or Spring Festival) period, some recommend that you arrive two hours in advance.Be sure of which station you are going to, as some places (like Beijing) have multiple stations. The name of the station will be clearly printed on your ticket.
Consider taking the subway or a cab to reach the station you will depart from. The biggest cities have fast and efficient sudway lines, and most such lines include connections to regional transportation hubs. In smaller cities or at times of lower traffic volume, cabs are also readily available. Most cost little (at least for anyone familiar with U.S. rates).
Understand that those waiting to get into the state might not be lined up. Queuing, as the British call it, is almost rare in China. Of course, its actually rare everywhere in the world except for the U.S., Canada, some portions of Europe, and a few former European colonies. Just be patient and follow the person in front of you. It may take longer but you will get there., In many stations, there will checkpoints outside of the station and another you must pass before you board.At the first gate or checkpoint, show your passport and ticket to the security guard. Proceed to the next security checkpoint.
In the next step, you may be asked to pass through airport-style security checks. There's typically no need to remove your shoes or outerwear. Put all of your luggage on the conveyor belt of the x-ray inspection machine. When security signals to you (either verbally or with a hand gesture), make your way through the metal detector. You will most likely set it off, but don't worry. A security guard will use a ""wand"" and may gently pat you down. Do not forget to fetch your luggage in the other side of the conveyor belt.

, There should be several electronic screens displaying the times of arrival, departure, locations, and other information. Use the train number on your ticket (ex: FD234) to find the platform your train will depart from.


Note that most stations will only show city names in Chinese, at least on their display boards. Know the characters for the destination city or station., A series of signs near the platform doors will display boarding trains. If your train is not boarding or queuing, rest in the waiting room. When it is your time to board, a broadcast will inform you (in Chinese). Your train number will also be displayed on the screens., You cannot check luggage, so make sure you have everything. Show your ticket to the attendant so they will let you pass. Follow signs to your platform. If you do not know where the platform is and there are no signs, follow the crowd. They will not let you pass if your ticket is different, so you are clearly in the right line.

, Your ticket will have a car number marked on it. Once you reach the platform, look down. The floor usually has markings for the train cars. Be aware they may not line up when the train comes. When the train arrives, allow passengers to exit the train before you step on., These numbers may be hard to see because they are on the wall. If you are standing, find a comfortable place to stand that is out of the way. People and food carts will pass through once the train starts., If you're not sure where to get off, ask someone seated next to you or listen for announcements.

, Most places, depending on size can have at least two or more bus stations. Travel guide books to China are too heavy to carry––yet, the most useful information they contain is where bus stations are located, so at hostels, you can look out for someone who has a travel book and copy down what you need to know for your next location.

, Need to make a phone call, but you have no cell phone? Find the nearest small convenience store. They often have phones on their counters for public use. Make your call, then the owner will tell you how much.

, When buying anything that needs to be weighed be aware that the price given is for 500gms not a kilo.

, In cities, many large department stores will have a food court on the top floor. Most of them are point and buy type places, so they are easy to order from and you know what you are getting. Some sell tickets at the door. You hand over tickets to the seller and what you don’t use, gets refunded as you leave.


Some restaurants will seat you and give you a table number card. This you show to the seller, they write down the price and your food choice is delivered to your table. You pay when you leave.

Being able to say that you can buy the same thing for a third of the price around the corner will help you haggle.
Bear in mind that the marked prices may not be a fair reflection of the item’s value.

, Before you approach a vendor, it’s sensible to make sure that you are carrying some small denomination currency and you have a good idea of how much cash you have on you. If the vendor catches sight of a high denomination note, you can expect the price to rise accordingly.


Keep your small change and larger notes separate and always pay with the small change.
If you are keeping your small change in your wallet or purse, put your larger notes somewhere else so there is no risk of the vendor seeing them., Once you have had a look around and sorted out your money, you should try to mentally come up with a rough figure for how much you are prepared to spend. You may have to be a little bit flexible, but it’s best to go in with a clear idea in your head so you can be assertive and get the haggling off to a strong start., When you have spotted something you like, approach the vendor and start with a price well below what he says it costs. The first price you are told could be 7 or 8 times a reasonable price. Remember that after you offer a price, you can never go lower, only higher.The mark up that the vendor attempts will depend on the person and the culture at the place you are shopping.
It’s impossible to provide a typical mark up, so it’s important to have had a look around and compared some prices first.

, If you are overly enthusiastic about the item you are interested in buying, the vendor will take note of this and think he can get a higher price from you. Don’t go rushing towards something, instead be more aloof. If you are with a friend you can work as a team. One of you will be interested and the other one can say how expensive it is and that you could find it cheaper somewhere else.The vendor may not understand what you are saying, but he will understand your body language and facial expressions.

, If you make your intervention and the vendor is dismissive, you should remain firm but always be polite and good humoured. There is a certain amount of theatre in haggling, so try not to get annoyed or frustrated. Equally, don’t feel pressurised or obliged to pay over what you think is reasonable.


The exchange could be quite loud and the vendor might hold your arm or push something into your hand.Smile and be friendly, but be prepared to walk away.

, It’s perfectly acceptable, and useful, to point out any flaws or problems with the item you are haggling over. If there are some chips or cracks, point to them and show the vendor. He will probably be telling you how perfect the item is, so pointing out some imperfections can prompt him to lower his asking price., If you feel like you are not getting anywhere, don’t be afraid to walk away. This can still be all part of the haggling process, and if worst comes to the worst you can always return. Make sure the vendor knows the price you are prepared to pay, and if he doesn’t accept it start to slowly walk away. You might find that he has a sudden change of heart and offers you a better price.This technique will only work if he thinks you might actually walk away, so make yourself clear.
If you can’t agree on a price, respect the vendor and don’t waste each other’s time.
If you keep haggling for an extended period, but end up not buying anything, the vendor may become annoyed and aggressive., Once you have managed to agree on a price that is acceptable to both you and the seller, always try to pay with small bills and as close to the correct change as you can. Revealing at the last minute that you have a wallet full of cash could cause some problems.


A vendor may be reluctant to find change for a large note.It’s not unheard of for unscrupulous vendors to return the incorrect change. You might not notice this if you are new to the currency.

, Picking up a few key phrases could help you to communicate better, and might even help the vendor warm to you. Someone who has made the effort to learn a little bit of the language might be taken more seriously than a more obviously clueless foreigner. Knowing a few phrases could also help you understand what is going on around you, and find out what sort of prices other people are paying. Some good phrases to start with include:


Duō shǎo qián – how much money.
Jià gé – price, cost.Tài gui le! – too expensive!Pian Yi Dian? – can you give me this for cheaper?, If you are struggling to understand each other, writing down numbers or entering them onto a calculator is a good idea. The vendor will almost certainly have a calculator and pen and paper at hand for precisely this purpose.


It’s probably not a good idea to use your phone for this.
Pulling out an expensive phone will be displaying your wealth and may prompt the vendor to look for a higher price.

, If you don’t have a language in common with the vendor you will have to rely on body language and gestures. This can be easier than you think, with a simple shake of the head an easily recognisable sign that you are not paying that price. Try to be open and friendly, rather than closed off and prickly. They might be trying to take rip you off, but it’s nothing personal.


Unless you’re buying something very expensive, the actual difference in price when converted back to your home currency is probably not that significant.
Don’t feel bad if the vendor seems offended by your low price offer, it’s all part of the melodrama of haggling in China."

Take the train.,
Journey by bus.,
Catch a taxi.,
Hire a rental car.",How to Travel to Hangzhou from Shanghai," This is the cheapest, safest and most comfortable way to travel to Hangzhou from Shanghai. There are more than 40 trains commuting between Shanghai and Hangzhou every 24 hours, and the high speed train is available now. It is a 45-minute to 1 hours ride for about 82RMB (13USD) one way. Trains run every 30 minutes (at least in peak hours) from Shanghai Hongqiao train station (the one next to SHA Shanghai airport). There are English-version ticket vending machines that are your best solution to purchase tickets. The trains go up to speeds of 350km/h.


The one way ticket price varies from 20RMB (3 USD) to 100RMB (14USD), depending on the level of the train and the class of your tickets.
There are several types of the trains differentiated by the starting letter of the train number. Generally, there are four types of trains running between Shanghai and Hangzhou. The fastest and the most comfortable train you can find now is call “ Dong Che Zu” (“动车组”) starts with the letter “D” for example “D689”. It’s very new and clean, and takes only 1 hour and 40 minutes to travel from Shanghai South railway station to Hangzhou railway station. The ones start with letter “T” for example “T797” are express trains and the ones start with letter “N” for example “N489” are fast trains. They are generally also acceptable with around 2 to 2 and half hours travel time. The ones that start with “K” (e.g. “K89”) or have no letter (e.g. “1597”) are not recommended. They normally stop in between Shanghai and Hangzhou which delays the travel. Also, most of them are old trains without air conditioning.;
, Bus is the most convenient way to travel during the daytime. The highway between Shanghai and Hangzhou is one of the best in China and definitely matches international standards. On average, it takes 2-3 hours station to station traveling time.


The one way ticket price is 50RMB (7 USD).
Compared to taking the train, it is more frequent. Buses depart almost every 10 to 20 minutes time 8am to 8pm.
There are several bus stations in Shanghai; you can choose the one close to your departure location. Most of the bus arrives at Hangzhou East bus station（“杭州东”）, which is an old station and in relatively poor condition. Sometimes, you have to wait in a long queue in order to get a taxi due to the terrible traffic around it.
If you are leaving from Shanghai Pudong international airport, the easiest way to get to Hangzhou is by taking a long distance airport bus. You can find the bus on the first level of the departure hall. The ticket price is RMB100 (USD14) for one way. It takes about 3 hours depends on the traffic. However, there are two drawbacks with this bus. First, the frequency of the bus is relatively low. It leaves in every three hours starting from 9am to 6pm. Second, the quality of the bus is poorer compared to other transportation modes.

, This is the most flexible but also the most expensive way to travel to Hangzhou. You can basically get a taxi anyway, anytime from Shanghai. And it normally takes around 2-4 hours door to door, with traveling time depending on the traffic and your departure and destination locations.


You can either choose to pay according to the meters or negotiate a lump sum in advance. Negotiating a total in advance is recommended but you can also keep the meter running on the same time just to see how much it actually ends up. The total price is normally between 700 to 800 RMB (100 to 115 USD).
If you choose to take taxi, be careful of the taxi companies. Several instances have been reported of kidnappings on long distance taxi rides. Taking taxis from big companies is recommended, especially in the night, as they generally guarantee the integrity of the driver and the quality of the car. Also, if you have any issue, it will be much easier to report and resolve with bigger companies.
There are two major taxi companies in Shanghai: Dazhong and Qiangshen. Both of them also provide car rental service.

, This is the most dangerous way to travel to Hangzhou, and not recommended. The rental car service is still under development in China. However, there are several rental car services available which you can find by searching “Shanghai rental car” on an Internet search engine. Considering China’s high road accidents rate, the different local driving habits and rules, and the fact that you can only drive with a valid Chinese Driving License or a temporary International Driving License, long distance driving on the highway is not recommended for a foreigner.

Plan on seeing some temples.,
Sample the food.",How to Plan a Trip to Kerala1," If you have limited vacation time, this makes a big difference in what you can do in Kerala. Kerala can be broken down into 5 major tourist regions. It's recommended that you spend 2 to 3 days in each region to really experience the area.If you're going for more than a couple of weeks, it may be worth it to try to see some or all of the regions. You'll have to plan how to travel between regions. When planning, make sure to consider travel time. It may take a daylong drive to get from one region to the next.
If you're just going to be in Kerala for a short period, you may want to stick to one or two regions for your visit.;
, Choose your regions wisely, especially if your time is limited. You want to make sure you get the most out of your vacation. Choose regions that have destinations that match with your personal interests.The Calicut (Kozhikode)/Wayanad region is a good option if you're looking for hills and spice trails. There are also a lot of city tours and nature walks available in the region, as well as tours of caves and waterfalls.
Many people come to India to look at temples, and the Cochin/Thrissur/Guruvayoor is home to many temples. If temples are an important destination for your trip, prioritize a trip to this region. However, you can also see many temples in the Cochin/Munnar/Thekkady/Sabarimala region. In addition to temples, this region is known for tea plantations, nature walks, safaris, luxury treatments like spas, and lots of city tours.
In the Cochin/Alleppey (Alappuzha)/Kumarakom region, you can also see temples. There are many nature options, such as boat tours, backwaters, and bird sanctuaries.
In the Trivandrum region, there is a lot of relaxing spa-type services. It also offers nature walks, boat tours, water sports, and city tours.

, As Kerala is such a sprawling state, professional tour services can help you get the most out of your experience. Once you've settled on a region, look into the kind of tour services that are present there. You may even be able to book a few tours for your trip ahead of time. If you have your heart set on touring a spice trail, for example, you can book a tour for your first Monday in Kerala. Make sure you see how long tours last, so you can plan other adventures for the day around that tour.


If you can afford it, see if you can talk to a professional trip adviser. A professional trip planner/adviser may be able to help you manage your time in Kerala by assessing your needs and planning an itinerary accordingly. However, these services can be expensive, and you may be better off planning on your own.

, Beaches are a big pull for many people traveling to Kerala. Almost every region in Kerala has at least some beaches. If you're planning on spending some time relaxing at the beach, look into the beach options available in your area.Find a beach near where you're staying. If you're staying in the Trivandrum region, there is a sparkling beach about 50 miles away called Varkala. There is a temple near the beach and it tends to be less crowded. You can find information on other beaches by region on tourist websites and blogs discussing trips to Kerala.
Keep in mind you'll need to figure out how you'll get to your chosen beach. In Varkala, for example, you may have to take a train out of the main city to get to the beach. You should look up train routes and take travel time into consideration when planning your beach day.
In addition to beaches, many regions have backwaters you can tour. Tourists websites will also list backwaters by region, and allow you to see what guided tours are available. If you're staying in a region known for its backwaters, you should make the effort to tour at least one.

, Resorts are another favorite of tourists looking to pamper themselves. If you want to schedule some rest and relaxation into your trip, see what resorts are available in your region and plan a spa or resort trip.Kerala Ayurvedi Centers are located throughout Kerala. They offer a variety of treatments aimed at rejuvenating skin, reducing stress, and removing blemishes like psoriasis. They also offer massages and other forms of pampering. If you want a spa day on your trip, make sure you find a region with a Kerala Ayurvedi Center.
Look into cost. Make sure you find a spa within your budget, as prices vary.

, Festivals are a large part of the culture of Kerala. If there are any local festivals happening around your stay, you'll want to take time to check them out. This will give you a sense of Kerala's rich culture. Festival calendars by year can be found online, giving you an overview of the type, location, and date of various festivals.Festivals come in a variety of categories. There are some festivals based on an event, like a boat race, while others are religious or traditional in nature. In addition to festivals, there are some ritualistic feasts that occur in Kerala each year.
Unless you're planning your trip around a specific festival, you may have to simply accept the festival that falls during your trip. You may feel disappointed if this was not your first choice festival, but keep in mind you'll be getting a unique taste of a given region's culture.

, Most regions in Kerala have at least some temples. If you're going to Kerala, touring a temple can give you a real sense of the culture.The temples available to you depend on the region where you're staying. Temples cater to a variety of religious and spiritual beliefs, like Hindi and Jainism. Some temples offer tours, so check the rules regarding the temple in your area. A guided tour can allow you to learn information you would otherwise miss.
Keep in mind, some temples have strict operating hours. The Sabarimala Sastha temple, for example, is only open to the public certain days of the year. If you have your heart set on a particular temple, you'll want to make sure that temple's available for viewing during your trip.

, If you're in Kerala, you'll want to sample some of the food. You can get a variety of traditional Indian dishes during your stay, so make sure you try a little bit of everything.Dosa Ghee Roast with Kerala Style Sambar has been included on lists of the world's most delicious foods. It's made with fermented rice and lentils, which are roasted until crisp.

Plan your flight route.,
Decide on home stays versus hotels.,
Look into logical transportation routes for your trip.",How to Plan a Trip to Kerala2," There are two international airports in Kerala. You can also fly into a larger city and take a train into Kerala depending on flight rates.Thiruvananthapuram International Airport and Kochi International Airport are both located in Kerala. If you can find affordable tickets, you should try to fly directly into Kerala. This will minimize travel time and allow you to begin experiencing the state right away.
If flights directly to Kerala are not in your price range, you can fly into another larger city like Deli, Mumbai, or Calcutta. Flight rates tend to fluctuate throughout the year, and sometimes a flight to a nearby city may be cheaper than one into Kerala. From here, you can take a train into Kerala. This may save you some money, depending on flight rates, but you'll have to weigh the inconvenience of extra travel time. It may take a day or more to actually get into Kerala. If you're going on a short trip, paying extra to get directly into Kerala may be worth the money.

, If you don't have family or friends in Kerala, you have two options for lodging: home stays or hotels. You can stay in a traditional hotel, or you can a home-stay. These are accommodations provided by locals, sort of similar to Couch Surfing in the United States. Much like Couch Surfing, websites provide information and ratings of locals providing home-stays.Home stays are great on a budget. They are generally cheaper than hotels, and food is often provided in addition to lodging. You also get a lot of insights into local culture, as you'll be staying with a local family.
If money is not an issue, or if you value privacy, you may want to opt for a hotel instead. Hotel prices vary by region, but with some dedication you can usually find reasonably priced hotels. Make sure to read reviews online, however, to make sure any hotel you choose has a solid reputation.

, It's fairly easy to travel from one region to the next making use of options like trains and busses. However, you'll want to plan your route before leaving. This will help you make sure you you can travel between regions.It's a good idea to plan on staying near a railroad while you're in Kerala. This way, you can take a train from one region to the next.
You should aim to take the train when possible, as bus routes are generally longer.
If you're only staying for a short time, book things like train tickets ahead of time whenever possible. Make a rough itinerary for yourself where you list which trains you'll be taking which days, and at what time. This will help you figure your entertainment options for each region. If you get into one region late one day, for example, certain attractions may be closed.

In Kerala, the currency used is the Indian Rupee.You can sometimes get foreign currency from your local bank, so ask there first. If your bank does not do currency exchanges, or does not carry rupees, you can make an exchange at the airport or even online.
It's a good idea to have about $100 to $150 in rupees on hand going into your trip.

Ask them to inform you FOUR stations in advance before your station comes. They will be more than happy to help you, they are very friendly people. If you are woman and travelling, then purchase tickets for 1st class and travel in compartments specially reserved for Women. Local train tickets are very cheap and can cost just 3-4 $ max one way. If travelling in a group (men and women) then stay together. If possible, avoid peak time i.e. 7:00 am to 10:00 am and 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm.;
, When your station comes near (that is third or fourth to go) start arranging your luggage in position that it hangs around your neck and/or stays on your stomach or chest. The reason for it is that there will be a heavy rush outwards from your back side. If you have a bag, hug it, if you have a tote or purse, hang it in your neck, if you have a knapsack, wear it in a way that it stays on your stomach instead of your back. A knapsack is the easiest luggage to carry in these trains. Take very good care of your luggage, there will be such a huge rush that sometimes you will get out but not your luggage!!

, If you are wearing spectacles, remove them for a while and put them in your luggage, remove anything that dangles from your clothing or appearance like long earrings, dangling of your purse etc. If you have long hair, tie them in a tight knot. Empty the hip pockets of your jeans and keep your wallet safe. If you are wearing salwar kurta, remove your dupatta and put in your luggage. Remove any piece of jewelry from your neck.

During these conversations, lay out your snacks for the guests to partake.,
Finish properly.",How to Host a Haldi Kumkum Ceremony," Invite ladies that are married and try to invite those who have an appreciation for other cultures or are of Indian origin.;
, The first two things you will need are the haldi and kumkum. If you live in a foreign country, find out and visit an Indian store close to home. If there is nothing in your zone, haldi and kumkum can be purchased on sites like Amazon. Here are some other things you will require:


A blouse piece of a sari. If not available, then a small gift: a simple necklace or pendant or idol will do.
Apples, bananas, and coconuts.
A leaf called vettal.
Simple gift bags.
Snacks: ladoos, moong dal fritters, and sweets (explore your neighborhood Indian store for ideas).

, In each bag, place a coconut, the gift or blouse piece, a fruit and two leaves.


Make enough gift bags for the guests only. Even if your female guest brings members of her family, she is the only one to receive the gift.

, On the day of your Haldi Kumkum ceremony, wear black, since black is the color of this festival. If your culture has beliefs against black, don't panic. Slap on something bright and colorful for the occasion.

,


In two small bowls (preferably silver), put the haldi and kumkum and add a trickle of water in each, to turn them into a slight paste.
Put the bowls on a tray (preferably silver) and keep ready for your guests.
Before the ceremony, it is customary to offer a bit of the haldi and kumkum to a deity.

, As your guest ladies walk in, offer them the haldi kumkum plate that you set up earlier.


Ask the guests to apply the kumkum on their head and the haldi on their throat.
Offer them a seat in your home or hall.

, Try not to crack jokes because it disturbs the calmness of the ceremony. Talk about life or any interesting experiences one of your guests has had.

, Try to place the snacks on a table in the center of the guests, so as to not disturb their conversations. Pass out plates and napkins for people to use.


Keep some knives, forks and spoon handy for special guests.
When it comes to drinks, water is your best bet, but keep a Sprite handy.

, Before your guests leave, have them face north. Place one of the gifts on a tray and present it to them. Give some hugs and kisses to complete the event.

Join or start a group in your community.",How to Help Save Endangered Tigers in India1," Whether you live in India or not, sending money to organizations that care for and protect tigers in India helps more than you know. The money will be used to ensure that tigers are looked after and can be kept in areas where there would otherwise be population encroachment.


It costs about $15 million a year to properly protect tigers in India.World Wildlife India (WWF-India) is an organization committed to saving tigers in India, where they work to help tigers and humans peacefully coexist, educate local communities about the importance of conservation, and perform many more efforts.Other conservation organizations in India that you can contribute to include Tiger Awareness,a UK charity that supports Indian tigers, and the Wildlife Protection Society of India.;
, You can make a difference no matter where you are in the world, especially now that the internet is accessible by so many--even from inside India. Join groups on social media websites like Facebook to show your activism in support of saving the tigers in India.


In Facebook, do a search for “tiger conservation India” (or something similar) in the website’s search bar. Make sure you click the “groups” tab underneath the search bar. Once on a group page, click “Join Group,” and depending on the privacy settings, you will either be added instantly or must wait until a group admin approves your membership.Do a search with a search engine like Google using keywords like “save the tigers India internet groups,” and you will find links to many different organizations that you can join, although most of them are general tiger conservation groups and are not specific to the tigers in India.

, There aren’t a lot of conservation groups on Facebook targeted toward the tigers just in India. If you know a few people in your area—or even just on the internet—who want to save the tigers in India as much as you do, consider starting your own Facebook group. This way you can control what the group does and how members communicate with each other.

, If you want to be more involved than just from your computer, you can join a local tiger conservation group in your community and encourage them to focus on the tigers in Indian habitats. If there aren’t any, you can start one yourself.


Book a room at a community center for a certain time of week, then post flyers in the community, such as on bulletin boards in local grocery stores, at the community center itself, at the local library, and on other community boards you see around town.
If you’re a college student, you may be able to start a group on campus if there isn’t one to join already. Do the same as if you were starting a group in a local community—book a room and post flyers.
No matter where your group meets, get the word out about your conservation group by posting it on social media as well as flyers.

Ask on which side the station will come and start moving towards that door.,
On the previous station of your destination: Let the people to get down.Do not step aside willingly for the people to go in or the flow will drag you in again!,
Place yourself in the center of the mob now.,
And the station comes: The train slows down at your station.,
It is wiser to take ticket of two stations ahead from where you want to get down.,
In case your luggage is lost, it is lost for ever, no one will have any clue about it.

",How to Step off at the Desired Station on a Mumbai Local Train2," In Mumbai, many of the domestic stations do not have platforms on both sides of the track, so ask the people around on which side the platform will come. Before two stations to your destination, stand up from your seat (that is if you are lucky enough to have one)and start moving towards the door. There will be more than 100 people to get down from the same door at any station and more than 100 people to enter your compartment from the same door and the whole transaction will have to be done in less than a minute, 30 seconds sometimes!! Reach near to the door, but don't go too near or the flow of people will knock you out at the wrong station!!

, Immediately there will be gathering of the people who want to get down on the next station with you.

, Clutch your luggage tightly on your chest or abdomen. Don't try to move willingly now, let the mob do its job! Never be at the end of mob, you will be left behind in the train. Never keep your luggage on the back or it will be left behind!!

, The mob is desperate to get out of the door. Just lift your heels and be on your fingers!! That is the best way to let the mob carry you with it!! Get on your feet as soon as you climb down the stairs. The train is not going to stop completely, it will just slow down. You will have to be prepared for a little bit of momentum. Take two three running steps after getting off.

, Suppose you have failed to step out at your desired station, try on next and next to that, you will surely succeed in one of these attempts!Travel back one or two stations in other train or go out of the station and catch a rickshaw or bus back to your station.

Send money to educators in India.,
Send money to relief organizations.,
Offer to go yourself.",How to Help Save Endangered Tigers in India2," Supporting organizations that care for the education, health, and welfare of Indian children will help the next generation desire to save its tigers. Education helps to break the cycle of poverty by giving Indian children a chance to get employment in fields that pay adequate living salaries. You can do this wether you live in India or abroad.


Most of the same organizations listed in Method 1 perform some sort of education work to keep the next generation of Indian citizens motivated to care about their tigers. For example, WWF-India hosts awareness programs specially designed for schoolchildren, in schools located both near tiger reserves and in cities., Poverty is a major cause of dwindling tiger populations in India. The problems the tiger faces are those of ignorance and poverty: people in surrounding villages are living hand to mouth, and many give in to the temptation to make money by supplying tigers to the black market.


There is a market for tiger organs to be used in Chinese folk medicine. For example, tiger brain is used to treat pimples and laziness.There has been a rise in Asian upper class affluence, a class that can afford the expensive Chinese medicinal treatments. As this class has grown in size, so has the demand for tiger organs. The Environmental Investigation Agency believes one tiger is killed each day for its use in Chinese medicine.You can help relieve Indian poverty through organizations like the India Village Poverty Relief Fund, which starts social justice projects for villages in India.If you already live in India, you can find local poverty relief organizations like churches and give money to assist their efforts.

, If you live in India, it is easy to find organizations that you can volunteer with to help relieve poverty or educate those who live near tigers. If you don't already live in India, there are opportunities for people to go teach and do relief work there. You can join these relief organizations and do work as a volunteer to help relieve poverty, sickness, and any number of other issues. Your work will help the impoverished in India to feel less pressure to get a quick buck through tiger poaching.


You can join the medical relief efforts of Foundation for International Medical Relief for Children.You can join Sankalp Volunteer and choose from a variety of projects.If you work for a corporation in India, you can encourage your executives to partner with WWF-India through their corporate partnerships program.Perform a search in Google to find other volunteer opportunities in India, whether you already live there or not.

Be a responsible tourist.,
Refuse to buy Chinese medicine with tiger parts.,
Inform wildlife conservers of poaching activity.,
Reduce your purchase of wood products.",How to Help Save Endangered Tigers in India3," Follow conservation practices when you go on tourism trips in India, especially in relation to the forest habitat of tigers. This is true for both local and international tourists. Don’t take vegetation out of the forests and don’t use destructive vehicles to get around inside them.


Instead, if you’re booking safari trip in India, make sure the company you purchase a package with actively supports tiger conservation. If you don’t see it on the packaging or website, ask about it.

, If you use Chinese medicine, you are probably consuming tiger parts. Unless a product you’ve purchased says it is an herbal remedy, a Chinese medicine product probably has tiger parts in it, depending on what it’s for. Switch over to herbal medicines so that you aren’t part of the problem.


For example, tiger bones are used in Chinese medicine to treat a host of aches and pains. An herbal alternative to, say, a headache, is spring onion tea or wild ginger., If you ever hear a rumor of poaching activity in India, whether in your community or while doing any relief work, report it to wildlife conservers or the authorities immediately.


You might hear a poaching rumor if you are working as a volunteer in an Indian village.

, Since the tiger’s habitat is in the forest, consumer purchase of lumber and paper products places pressure on it.Try to find avoid purchasing wood products made or sourced in India if you live abroad, and find alternative materials for these items if you live in India.


The next time you purchase a ream of paper or a piece of wooden furniture, ask the manufacturer the source of their wood before purchasing.

Write 'Srinagar' as the capital under the states name.

, Write the name of the state 'Punjab' and its capital 'Chandigarh' as Jammu and Kashmir above.


You may also write it with pencil first so you can erase any spelling errors and then write on it with pen.

, Make the border for Himachal Pradesh alongside Punjab.


Write Shimla as its capital city.

, Create the border for Uttarakhand and mention capital 'Dehradun'.


If the names are too long to fit inside the borders, you may stretch it beyond the borders with part of it in the map and part of it extending outside.

, Mark Gujarat to the west of India.


In order to maintain good proportion and that you dont make mistakes with the borders, you can shift from top to bottom or left to the right of the map.
As you reach the center of the map, you will see that the proportions are well maintained and a particular state is not extended beyond its original area.
Write 'Gandhinagar' as its capital.

, Mark 'Rajasthan' above 'Gujarat' and write 'Jaipur' as its capital.


Make the border for 'Uttar Pradesh' below 'Uttarakhand' and name its capital 'Lucknow'.
Make the border for 'Haryana' and its capital 'Chandigarh' between Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

, Specify the capital of India - New Delhi with a special symbol which will be mentioned in the key below.

, Going in a flow from top to bottom may make way for some disproportion as mentioned before. Try moving to another direction as south. As you move from south to the top, you will reach the center of India with exact proportion.

, The borders here are a bit wavy. To avoid confusion and going beyond the area of specified states, make guidelines for the states.


Mark 'Karnataka' above Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Mention its state 'Bengaluru'.
Mark the border for the state 'Andhra Pradesh' next to Karnataka. Mention its capital city 'Hyderabad'.
Make a small border for 'Goa' over 'Karnataka' and note its capital as 'Panaji'.
Mark the border for the state of 'Maharashtra' between Gujarat and Goa. Mention 'Mumbai' as the capital of Maharashtra.
Mark the guideline over 'Andhra Pradesh' for the state 'Odisha' or 'Orissa'. Adjust its capital is 'Bhubaneshwar' partly inside the map and the rest outside or write it completely outside but alongside Odisha to it looks like it belongs to it.
Mark the border for 'West Bengal' over Odisha and write its capital 'Kolkata'.

, Join the marks you made for the states as per its shape and area.


Write the names of the states and its capital as mentioned above.
Make the border for the state which is at the center India, 'Madhya Pradesh'. Mention its capital 'Bhopal'.
Make the border for 'Telangana' and its capital also 'Hyderabad'. Telangana shares its borders with a few states namely Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.

, Make it over Telangana. Write the name of its capital, Raipur.

, Border the boundary for Jharkhand and its capital 'Ranchi'.

, This section of the map is complete with Bihar which shares its borders with Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

, This is the portion of the map which is to the extreme end holding on with a comparatively smaller portion.


Write the name of the state 'Sikkim' on the rectangular shape that stands out. Mention its capital as 'Gangtok'.
Make the remaining borders for the eight states that fall in this section of India.

, Write the name of the Union Territory - 'Andaman and Nicobar' and its capital 'Port Blair' as seen outside the map.

, Mention 'Daman and Diu' with its capital 'Daman' and 'Dadra and Nagar Haveli' with its capital 'Silvassa'.

Arabian Sea to the lower left blank area.
Indian Ocean below the Arabian Sea.
Tropic of Cancer at the center to the right side of the map.
China to the top right blank area.
Bay of Bengal at bottom right of the page.

, Use a specific colored pen or any medium of your choice to outline the map. This will make the map stand out and create a distinction between the overall border of India and the borders of the various states.


You can also use a thick black pen or a non-smudge sketch pen for it.
You can color the states with different colors of your choice.
You can color outside the map as well.

, Use a different color or a different thickness for the outline of the states.


You can also draw the border creatively with dotted lines, thick and thin lines etc. All this will be marked accordingly in the 'key'.
You can write 'India' either on the map elaborately or on the side outside the map. Just make it bold and clear so it need not be searched instead is easily spotted. If you write it on the map, make sure not to write on top of the other names mentioned in it already.

, The key consists of and explains the symbols you have used to mark the details like borders, states, capitals etc. It mostly sits on the lower right of the map.


You can make the box for the key first and fill in all the details first or write the details first and make borders around it. If you write the details first, you don't have to worry about fitting in all the details or writing in smaller letters.
If you have used a thick black line to mark the borders, make a thick black line and write 'Country Boundary' besides the line. This will show how you have marked the boundary of the country.

, Write 'Key' as the heading.


Towards the left of the key mark the symbol you have used to mark the capital of the country and the capital of the states or the union territories.
Continue with marking the style or color of the line you have used to mark the boundary of both the country as a whole and the states or the Union territories.
Towards its right, mention what the symbols denote.
Make a border around the key to make it look neat.

, You can choose to color the inside of the map. Coloring with pencil colors or with any medium of your choice will only make it look more presentable and vibrant. You can color each state and Union Territory with a different color so each division stands out individually.


Using differing colors will also avoid confusion as to where a certain boundary or border ends and where another begins.

Understand that India has a right hand/left side drive.,
Be careful while driving in any city.,
Stay alert at all times.,
Acknowledge that insurance in India has various clauses in it such as depreciation charge on metal and plastic.,
Be aware that it is not uncommon to find drunk drivers after 10 PM, so be extra careful at nights.,
Remember that there are all sorts of vehicles on Indian roads such as bullock carts, cycles, rickshaws, three-wheelers, cars, SUVs, trucks, buses, etc.,
Learn that a marriage party, minister or religious processions are regular and can hold up traffic.,
When driving to a small town or rural village, roads will be too narrow for two lanes.,
While driving on wide roads, for example OMR, ECR in Chennai, be alert.,
In many places in India comercial vehicles, such as trucks and buses, will have signs that read ""Sound Horn"".,
Remember that in case of an accident, if the situation gets out of hand then call the cops immediately.",How to Drive in India," If you are from a country in which cars have a left-hand drive, this can be confusing for you, initially.;
, India is no exception.

, In most Indian cities, though there are lanes, people don't use them and may cut in front of you without warning. Animals or children may come in your way. Whenever your foot is not on the accelerator, it should be resting on the brake.

, So please read your insurance completely and understand it well. Remember that third party claims are rare in India and in most cases would need a copy of Police FIR. Avoid accidents at all costs.

, Do not tailgate any driver at a speed higher than 30 kilometers (19 mi), if possible avoid it completely. People can turn without signaling or without switching on the indicator.

, There are no separate lanes for slower moving vehicles so be prepared to drive slowly using brakes very often. There are hardly any automatic transmission vehicles in India so be prepared for a manual transmission. If you rent a stickshift but are used to an automatic then ensure that its clutch pedal is light else you will end up building a stronger calf muscle.

, Don't be shy in taking alternative routes in such situations, like driving on the side unpaved road (if it's there) or cutting the traffic like others.

, Therefore, traffic coming in the other direction will have to travel on the same path as you. When a car is coming towards you, move to the LEFT so that you are only taking up half the road. It's ok if the left side of your car isn't on the road anymore. The guy coming towards you will do the same thing on his left side. After you have passed each other, come back onto the road.

, Many smaller vehicles come on the wrong side of the road.

, This means that if you honk they will move over slightly so that you may pass. Honk only once and do it politely, if they do not move simply stay behind them. Although they may move to the side, make sure to check for oncoming traffic before you pass.


When honking, make sure you are not in a quiet zone (generally around hospitals) as this is illegal and very disrupting to hospital patients.







, This will save you from getting a beating from the public. In case of an accident public involvement will surely happen and the guy with a smaller vehicle will get the sympathy. Avoid any such pandemonium and try to settle things quickly.

Understand that girls and boys are both human beings, who equally deserve respect, care, love, affection and friendship.,
Learn more about the human body.,
Listen to your parents when they teach you good manners and civic behavior.

,
Find out from your parents what is the correct way of touching in your culture when you greet another person.,
Do not engage in eve teasing or sexual harassment.,
Keep your hands to yourself during play, religious functions and parties.,
Do not loiter in lonely, deserted roads during your spare time.",How to Do Your Part to Prevent Rape in India1,";
, Ask your parents and teachers to teach you about male and female body parts, human development, the reproduction system and puberty.

,, It could be a handshake, a hug or a pat on the back. Some expect you to join hands, bow your head and say namaste without touching the person you are talking to.

, Eve teasing is the term used in India when you make a remark about a girl’s body, dress or the way she walks or about her posture. You may also make cat calls. You usually do it in public places. Some of you may also do it in schools. Instead, ask your parents to teach you how to pay compliments properly.

, During play or during parties and functions, do not touch someone’s sexual parts. If you see a friend or a relative touching another child's private parts, scream, yell, call for help, run to your parents and tell them what you saw.

, DO socially useful and productive work instead. Use your spare time to read, complete homework, build a robot, play games, make paper planes or help your parents in household work. You could also do some or all of these things:learn to cook, or watch TV, wash dishes, wash the car or the bike, bathe the cow or the buffalo, polish shoes,listen to music, learn to play a musical instrument,paint a picture, sing, go swimming, dance, do push-ups, build a house of cards or a mud house in the yard.

Remember that all human beings have equal rights to live safely and independently with dignity.

,
Tell yourself everyday that you are neither inferior nor superior compared to a woman.,
Learn to do household chores.,
Keep yourself strong and fit.,
Watch out!,
Do what you can to stop abuse.,
Campaign against female infanticide.,
Do not commit violent molestations and sink into a hell-hole.,

,
Offer free basic education for adults.,
Do a dharna or stage a non violent protest against unemployment.,
Keep your hands to yourself while traveling.,
Keep your hands to yourself when you see a girl walking on the beach or the street.,
Keep your hands to yourself during travel.,
Do not beat and abuse your wife.",How to Do Your Part to Prevent Rape in India2,", Remember that everyone on this earth has something valuable to contribute to the society.

, Most Indian men, even those who are highly educated and employed are physically and emotionally dependent on women-mother, wife, sisters, sisters-in-law, aunties or grandmothers for food, water, socks, laundry, ironing and cleaning. Practice doing these things on your own. It will make you feel more independent.

, Exercise regularly and eat well and drink sufficient water.

, Do not ogle at women. Women are no longer mere housewives. They are out, going to schools and colleges, working, working out and learning to be independent. Get used to seeing them walking in the streets, jogging or traveling. Applaud their courage and celebrate. Don’t discriminate.

, If you see another man or men eve teasing or sexually harassing a girl, fight with her and report them to the nearest police station.

, Many parents kill their female infants because the society has been made unsafe for girls.

, You will feel horrible about yourself afterwards. Organize a patrol instead. If you are part of a group of men who have no work and lots of spare time, organize a patrol and monitor lonely streets. While you are at it, clear the streets of plastic bags and other garbage.

,, Parents kill their daughters in the womb because they are unable to earn enough to pay your dowry. When you stop demanding dowry, parents will stop killing their girls. Then the male-female ratio will even out. More number of males is one reason for gang rape.

,, There are many youth and men who are uneducated. This is another reason for gang rape. Lack of education means idle brains and morality goes down the drains.

, Round up all your unemployed mates and demand that your states create jobs. Too many unemployed men—another reason for gang rape.

, If a girl or a woman sits next to you on a bus, or a plane or a train, do not touch her. Do not peep when she is asleep.

, Do not eve tease or touch her. She keeps her hands to herself and so should you.

, If you are going on a long journey, read a book, or listen to music on your headphones or introduce yourself to her and talk to her only if she is also willing to talk. If she prefers to be silent, you too remain silent. Close your eyes and go to sleep or meditate or count sheep.

, If you feel like hitting someone, punch a pillow or find someone your size to wrestle with. Join a wrestling club, do shadow boxing or push-ups or train to run a marathon or try a triathlon.

Use the Sky trains.,
Take the MRT.,
Make an adventure of your travels with the Chao Phraya River Boat.,
Travel shorter distances in a tuk-tuk.,
Take a motorbike taxi.",How to Get Around Bangkok During Rush Hour," A recent addition to Bangkok transport, the sky train was built to combat the intense traffic situation. If you are out on the street during rush hour, always opt to travel in the sky train. Covering all the major stops in the city, the sky train will take you to your destination in just a fraction of the time that you would spend of the road. The Disneyland space-agedness feeling that it provides makes your journey on the sky train just as interesting as the attractions in your destination. Your bird's eye view of the city will give you a glimpse of the many hundred vehicles crawling their way through the heaviest congestion. Breathe a sigh of relief that you are not down there! The real cherry on the top of Bangkok's sky train are the ticket prices. Cheap in price and soaring above traffic and pollution, there is absolutely no reason to not choose the sky train.;
, If you cannot fly above there is a way down below: the mass rapid transit (MRT), Bangkok's subway system. This subway is pretty much an underground version of the Sky train. In fact, it reaches a number of regions in the city that the sky train does not. There are stations located everywhere and several can be found in close proximity to a number of Bangkok Serviced Apartments as well the famous Anantara Baan Rajprasong Bangkok Serviced Suites. Again the biggest blessing of the MRT is evading the heavy traffic overhead. Since prices for the MRT are just as cheap as the sky train, it is again another sensible option during Bangkok's rush hour.

, Covering the whole Western Edge of the city, this is an excellent mode of transportation to truly appreciate the authentic Bangkok atmosphere. The breeze is heavenly, the water is sparkling, the backdrop is picturesque and the price is dirt cheap.

, These three-wheeled rickshaws are perfect for evading traffic as they somehow manage to squeeze their way from one lane to another, getting you to where you want to go. Tuk-tuks come in handy when you have arrived at your stop via Sky Train or MTS and still have substantial distance to cover within the region. Fortunately or unfortunately, tuk-tuks have little regard for traffic rules and hence it does not hurt their conscience to jump lines and disregard cues. While this can make for a scary or dangerous ride, it will get you where you're going, and fast.

, This is the fastest and perhaps the most exciting way to get around the busy streets of Bangkok. Clad in orange and purple vests, these taxi drivers are readily available to whisk you to your destination. Able to literally squeeze their way through the nastiest traffic jams, this can be a huge help during Bangkok's rush hour.

Look at environmental factors.,
Research economic factors.,
Learn about social factors.,
Search booking sites.,
Read reviews.,
Look for specific details on a resort’s website.,
Email or call the resort directly.,
Look for certifications or collaborations.",How to Find a Sustainable Resort in Thailand," “Sustainability” is a concept that seeks to find long-term, enduring solutions to interrelated environmental, economic, and social concerns. The biggest environmental problems in Thailand include air and water pollution, overfishing, water scarcity, use of plastic (especially plastic bags), and waste issues. Seek a resort that aims to address these specific environmental concerns., Sustainability in Thailand also has to do with economics. Some economic factors that can contribute to the sustainability of a Thai resort include the sourcing of products from local merchants, putting money back into the local economy, and paying employees a living wage plus health benefits. Seek a resort that makes efforts toward economic sustainability., Finally, true sustainability also seeks to address socio-cultural concerns. This can include things like employee treatment (e.g., employees being allowed to observe religious holidays), the percentage of resort workers that come from the area, and how involved the resort is with the local community. Look for a resort that tries to address local socio-cultural concerns., Start by visiting travel-booking sites, such as TripAdvisor or Travelocity. Using the search function, type in “sustainable resorts Thailand.” This will pull up numerous Thai hotels and resorts that use the key word “sustainable” in their description, and/or have these words mentioned in reviews. This is great place to begin looking for a sustainable resort in Thailand.Try using a few different search terms, such as “green resorts Thailand” or “Thai eco-friendly resorts.”
If you will be visiting a specific Thai city, you can narrow your search to just this location.

, Many of these travel sites, including Travelocity and TripAdvisor, use rating systems and customer reviews. Reviews can sometimes offer insight into the experience of a given resort. Once you have created a search for “sustainable resorts Thailand,” begin combing through some reviews.Look for specifics about how they handle waste (garbage, recycling, compost), what they are doing to reduce water usage, where they source their water.
Look for details on where they source their food and other products.
Try to find a resort that both reflects and gives back to the local community.
Some options include the Bangkok Tree House, FaaSai Resort and Spa, and Soneva Kiri., Once you have some leads about potential sustainable resorts in Thailand, you need to dig a little deeper. Begin your investigation by reading over a resort’s website. If they claim to be sustainable, look for evidence to back up that claim.


What efforts or initiatives have they taken to make address the environmental, economic, and social issues facing Thailand?
How do they handle garbage and recycling? Do they compost?
What are they doing to reduce water usage and water waste? Where is their drinking water sourced?
How much plastic do they use? How are they working to reduce the use of disposable plastic items and plastic bags?
How does the resort contribute to the local economy? Do they use locally sourced food and support small-scale local fishermen?
What percentage of their employees come from the local area? Do they hire indigenous Thai people?
What is their involvement with the local community?

, There is really no better way to get information about a resort than to speak to someone directly. Sending a very specific email or making a call with some questions ready is the most effective way to determine whether or not a resort is right for you. If it is small resort, try to speak directly to the owner. If it is a resort chain, try to speak to the general manager. Great questions to ask include:


What do you do to reduce waste?
What chemicals are used to clean the rooms and as the resort as a whole?
How much do you pay your employees? Do you offer healthcare?
What percentage of your employee come from the area?
Where do you source your resorts paper materials?
Can you describe your involvement with the local community? How do you give back?
You might say, “I notice that you market yourself as a sustainable resort. Could you tell a bit more about this? I’m curious what steps you have taken to address the environmental, economic, and social concerns facing Thailand.”

, Many sustainable resorts will be working together with sustainable organizations. For example, check to see if a resort has been certified by LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or if they are working with a green consultant like Carbonfund.org to reduce their environmental impact. Look for collaborations for non-profit organizations, as well as involvement with the local community."

Learn never to listen to the touts (airport or shopping).,
Use taxi meters (all have lights on top of the car).,
Ask where to go shopping at your hotel.,
Understand that this is a very “Thai love Thai” society.,
Be careful when buying gems in Thailand.,
If going to Patpong or a similar red light district, avoid going to upper floors of the establishments unless it is crowded with other people.,
Bar girls may be eager to leave with you, but keep in mind that they only want your money.",How to Avoid Tourist Traps in Thailand," They will either overcharge you or take you somewhere that gives them a commission.;
, If they say the meter has broken, get another taxi. Alternatively, you could establish the price before leaving (not when you arrive) but this is unlikely to be a fair price.

, They will generally not get a commission and will know some good places.

, When going to a temple, always dress respectfully - shirts (not sleeveless) and long trousers. Leave your shoes at the door. Don’t point your feet or touch the head of a Buddhist monk or even a statue of Buddha. The head is the highest point of the body and the feet the lowest and therefore highly disrespectful.

, If you are unsure about the reputation of a particular establishment, check with the Jewel Fest Club or the Thai Gem and Jewelry Traders Association on (66 2) 267 5233-6. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is! If you're shop owner and looking for fair prices, better to buy jewelry directly at factories.

, Some places are known to corner foreigners in empty rooms and later present them with a false hefty bill, refusing to let them leave unless the bill is paid. If you do get into such a situation, pay the bill and then go to the police immediately.

, They will ask you to buy them stuff (mobile phones, jewelry, etc.) and they will ask for your e-mail address so they can keep milking you for money once you're back home. Typical excuses include sick parents/siblings who need surgery, money for education, etc. Be careful to let them down gently, however as it is common politeness and just in case the girl actually likes you.

Listen to someone say ""Oregon"".,
Emphasize the first syllable.,
Say ""Oregon"" quickly.,
Practice pronouncing ""Oregon"".",How to Pronounce Oregon," Visit the state, if possible, or speak with someone who has spent time there. Listen to an audio pronunciation sample:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtAPSR6KNT4;
, The correct pronunciation uses three syllables: ""OR"", ""ih"" and ""gun"". The first syllable is long but the last two syllables are very short. Remember: it's ""ORegon"", not ""orEgon"" or ""oreGON"".


The pronunciation of ""or"" is straightforward: say it like the word ""or"" or ""for"".
Pronounce the middle syllable (the ""e"") the way you would pronounce the ""i"" in ""it"". You can also pronounce it like the ""e"" in ""egg"".
Pronounce the last syllable (""gon"") like the word ""gun"" or ""gehn"". Make sure to pronounce the hard ""g"" -- say it like ""gun"", not like ""gin"". Whatever you do, avoid pronouncing the ""gon"" like the last syllable in Greek words ""decagon"" or ""polygon"". Native Oregonians will be quick to tell you that it isn't ""Or-e-gone"". The ON sound in the French word Oregon is the same as the ON sound in ""dragon"" and also the same as next door Washington.

, Don't pronounce each syllable as distinctly separate; they should blend together smoothly, but keep the hard sounds coherent. Some Oregonians slur the middle syllable and pronounce ""Oregon"" as ""Organ"", but this is not the traditional pronunciation. , Practice in front of a mirror until you get it right. Make sure that you get the pronunciation mostly right before you talk about the state in front of people, but don't worry too much: as long as people know which state you're talking about, you'll be okay. Just don't say ""Or-e-gone"".

Remember that not every market can be bargained at.;
, This is a reconnaissance tour, just to see which shop has better items.

, Find how much the locals usually pay for the item.


Make sure the stuff is in a good condition and worth paying for.

, This is about getting a ""yes"", then an even better ""yes"".


Begin with the price that the merchant has set for you.
Then, slowly talk down to price to a point that is both acceptable for both you and the merchant.
If you don't have any luck, you can ask for something else to be included in the price.
For example, if the shoes are 200 Baht, then you can slowly try to convince the merchant for 190, 180, until 150 (if you can) or ask if you pay for the full price but can you also get the extra shoe laces.

, This is about getting a ""no"", then getting a ""yes"".


Initially, ask for an impossible price.
Then, come back with a more reasonable price.
For example, say that a hat costs 100 Baht. Begin with the price that the merchant will not accept for sure such as ""can it be from 100 to 20?"". Then you try ""can it be 60?""

, The moment you get the price you like, stop. Don't think if you can go for a little more; some profit has to be made for the business to stay viable. Go home and enjoy your bargained-for item.

, People are not allowed to change their names in an effort to avoid punishment for crimes, to defraud others, or to avoid honoring responsibilities (like paying debts or maintaining child support payments).


If a court later decides that a person’s reason for changing his or her name was a desire to defraud, then the name change will be ineffective., Like a number of states, Oregon allows residents to change their names without going through the court system. Instead, residents can just go ahead and start using their new name, which will be honored.Nevertheless, it is rarely wise to change a name informally. An informal name change makes it difficult to establish your identity using official government documents.

, Go to the courthouse in the county in which you live. Ask your local court clerk for a copy of the required procedures, and gather the following list of forms. Some counties do not provide forms but will direct you to a stationer’s where you can buy forms:Petition for Change of Name
Notice of Change of Name Hearing
Change of Name Order/Decree
Affidavit—Proof of Posting Notice of Change of Name Hearing
Notice of Change of Name Decree
Affidavit—Proof of Posting Notice of Name Change

You must sign it in front of a notary. Be sure to bring a valid personal ID (such as a driver’s license or passport) when signing in front of the notary. The court clerk can probably notarize; call ahead and ask.

, Complete this form in the same manner as the Petition. You will take this form with you (along with the Petition) to the clerk of court.


At the clerk’s, pick up a hearing date. It must be at least 14 days after the date you are filing the Petition and the Notice., The current fee is $111. If it changes, the clerk will alert you.


If you cannot afford the fee, ask for a fee waiver form and fill it out.

, You must post this in the courthouse and leave it up for 14 days.The purpose of posting this Notice is to alert the public in case anyone wants to come to the hearing and challenge your change of name.


Ask the clerk where and how to post it.

, Complete this form but do not sign it. You must sign it in front of the clerk and have it notarized. Attach a copy of the Notice of Change of Name Hearing form.The purpose of this form is to attest, by an affidavit, that you have properly posted the Notice of Change of Name Hearing form.

, After filling in the information, you should not sign or date the decree. The judge will do this after approving your request for a name change., The day of the hearing, you should bring with you the Change of Name Decree, the Notice of Change of Name Decree, and the Affidavit—Proof of Posting Notice of Hearing. You should have the clerk notarize the Affidavit—Proof of Posting Notice of Hearing form.


Go to the courtroom. At the hearing, the judge will sign the Change of Name Decree. Be prepared to explain why you want to change your name. If no one objects, then this should be a straightforward process.

, After the hearing, return to the clerk’s office and complete the Notice of Change of Name Decree. Make 2 copies. Then, post the Notice of Change of Name Decree in the courthouse area for public notice.


You will then wait 14 days before returning to the clerk’s office.

, Attach a copy of the Notice of Change of Name Decree. At the clerk’s office, bring the Affidavit—Proof of Posting. The clerk will notarize after you sign. File the document with the clerk.

banks and other financial organizations
the three major credit reporting bureaus
your local voter registration office as well as the DMV
the IRS
the government passport office, if you ever plan to travel
universities you attended from which you might obtain transcripts in the future

, You will want to contact your attorney and revise any will, durable power of attorney, medical power of attorney, or similar document to reflect your new name. To be in agreement with Oregon’s statutes, you should note your old name along with your new name on the new document.

Personal identifying information including: full name; sex; date of birth; social security number; and race.
Both applicants’ addresses, occupation and highest educational level completed.
Previous marital status, the date the marriage ended; and the reason(s) why the marriage ended.
Applicants’ fathers and mothers’ names and places of birth.If you are 17 years old and your parent or guardian resides in Oregon, you also need to provide written consent to for you to marry from your parent or guardian. If the parent or guardian lives out of state and either party to the marriage has resided in the county of marriage for at least 6 months prior to applying for a license, then the license can be issued without parental consent so long as all other requirements are met., Both applicants must appear together in front of the county clerk to complete your marriage license paperwork. You must both have picture identification and the name on the IDs must match the names on the marriage license application. You must also pay an application fee.


The fee amount varies by county but typically it is $50 to $60.
Check with the county clerk to find out what type of payment is accepted. Some counties accept cash, certified checks and/or credit cards.
If you want to get married on the same day that you submit your application or before the 3 day waiting period, you must request a waiver of the waiting period when you are completing your application.
If you are granted a waiver, you may have to pay an additional fee of $5 to $20.Each county has different requirements for waiving the waiting period, which may include showing that you are getting married within 3 days of completing your application or completing a waiver request form. You should check with the county clerk to find out what steps you need to take in order to waive the waiting period.For a list of county-by-county fees visit: http://aclu-or.org/MarriageLicense_by_County.

, Oregon requires that a qualified person officiate your marriage ceremony. Under Oregon law, the individuals qualified to officiate a ceremony include: religious leaders authorized by a congregation or organization; Oregon judges; active federal or military judges; county clerks; and judicial officers.You can locate Oregon judges willing to perform weddings at: http://courts.oregon.gov/Washington/General_Information/Going_to_Court/pages/weddings.aspx

Oregon allows family or friends who became ordained online to officiate weddings so long as the person is ordained through a religious institution that is actively conducting business and has a valid physical address., You must have two witnesses present at your marriage ceremony and they must sign the marriage license.


You do not need to know the witnesses personally. Some businesses that offer “elopement services” provide two witnesses for you., Once you apply for your marriage license, you have 60 days to get married or else you will need to apply for a new marriage license. A marriage is valid in Oregon if two people declare to a qualified officiant that they agree to be married and they do so before two witnesses., Once you get married, the officiant must fill out and sign your marriage license paperwork and then return it within 10 days of the ceremony to the clerk’s office that issued your license.Generally, the officiant will have to provide the following information:


Date, location and county of marriage.
The officiant’s signature, title, name, address and phone number.
The officiant must also provide the printed names of the witnesses., Within 1 to 2 weeks after your ceremony, the newly married couple can contact the office where they applied for their marriage license and ask whether their marriage has been officially recorded in the county and state of Oregon. If it has been recorded, applicants can purchase a certified copy of their marriage license, which is the legal document showing their marriage.


Typically, you can purchase a certified copy by mail or in person., If you do not plan to get married at the county clerk’s office where you applied for your marriage license, you can plan almost any type of wedding that you want in Oregon. Since Oregon is such a geographically diverse state, there are many possibilities for beautiful wedding sites, including:


Beaches, such as Surfside Resort at Cannon Beach on the Northern Coast or Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area on the Southern Coast of Oregon.Parks, such as the Beazell Forest Education Center located in Beazell Memorial Forest near Corvallis, Oregon.or Silver Falls State Park in Sublimity, Oregon.Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood.Wineries and vineyards, such as BeckenRidge Vineyards in the Willamette Valley or Del Rio Vineyards in Southern Utah.St. John's Bridge in Portland, Typically, the winter months of January, February and March are the least popular for Oregon weddings and June, August, September, and October are the most popular season to get married.


If you choose to get married during one of the less popular times, you may be able to get discounted prices for your wedding site, caterer, florist and photographer.If you choose to get married during the more popular months or at a popular wedding destination, you need to book your location as early as possible because Saturday weddings spots fill up quickly., Depending on the size of your wedding and your budget, you may want to hire a photographer, caterer, band or DJ, and a florist. When you speak with these vendors, you should discuss the following:


The price and when you need to make a deposit.
The earliest that you can review a contract.
Ask for the names of former clients as references.

, You should be in regular contact with all of your vendors and the officiant as your wedding date approaches. Open communication helps to ensure that all of the parties are prepared for your wedding day.

, If your final payments are due on the date of your wedding, consider making out the checks ahead of time and asking a friend or family member to handle the final payments. This allows you to focus on yourself and your spouse and not be worried about carrying the checks around with you.

Consider the season.,
Consider Portland style.,
Keep in mind that Portland is an outdoor hub.","How to Pack for a Trip to Portland, Oregon"," The season of your visit should definitely determine what you bring. Winters are cold but usually mild (30-55 degrees F), and frost is typical most mornings with the occasional disruptive snowfall. Rain is typical every season, though markedly less in July and August when the weather frequently hovers at 75 and above, up to 100 on the very hottest days. Autumn is brisk but generally pleasant, and layering is key. Make sure you pack in preparation for the seasonal weather:


In the cool months (October-February), bring a raincoat/windbreaker, jeans, scarf and hat (and even some coffee/hot chocolate!).
In the warm months (June, July-August), bring airy clothing, light sweater, sandals, sunglasses, sunscreen, iced tea/cold beer, raincoat.
In the spring (March-May), bring a raincoat and light layers.;
, Portland style is stereotypically outdoorsy and casual, with a strong strain of hipster chic and organic cotton, but very often clothes from any part of REI (outdoor store) are sufficient city wear. Much of the city dresses like everywhere else, but most people will embrace any style, though formality gets you noticed.

, Pack for your activities—whether for the coast (often a little chilly but beautiful), a hike or walk in the huge Forest Park or surrounds, snow adventures on Mt Hood, a swimsuit for various swimming holes either along the Willamette and Columbia rivers or further afield with local guidance, or a summer dress for strolling the waterfront park.

Breathe!,
Organize everything.,
Do your research.,
Obtain and file all necessary documentation.,
Document everything!,
Remain calm and be reasonable.,
Know the law.,
Consult the Lawyer of The Day!",How to Represent Yourself in Family Court Massachusetts," It is very easy to lose sight of the goal or final outcome you wish to reach in this long and arduous process. There is no short cut and what you do and say now will ultimately determine your final outcome. Take a step back, breathe, and then put your peripheral blinders on and focus!;
, This can not be stressed this enough, especially if the opposing party has legal representation. If you are organized you will afford yourself a bit more respect by the courts and the opposing council. Bumbling around for papers that are torn and tattered will impact your success. Purchase a three ring binder and dividers. Whether you are just starting the divorce and custody proceeding or you are revisiting a custody/visitation matter, you will need to have a section for all matters that come before the court. For instance, Child Custody/Visitation and Child Support are separate matters. Keep all financial matters like W-2's, Bank Statements etc separate from documents and evidence supporting your ability to hold physical custody of your children.


In your binder, have labeled sections for each category of material you have. For example, the labels might look like this: Divorce; Custody; Child Support/Finance; Evidence; Misc Documents.

, Although you feel like the only one on the earth going through this, there have been many before you and there will be many after you that will endure the pain of family court. Therefore, there is endless amounts of information out there to prep you for what's ahead. There are sites like Avvo that provide you with legal advice directly from attorneys that will guide you on how to handle each matter.  MassLegalHelp is also another useful site to provide steps and forms you will need to navigate through the system. There are also many personal stories and experiences out there in forums, which can provide direction, assurance, and moral support along the way.

, If it is in your court file it should be in your binder! You can go to the court in which your case is being heard and request your file. Make sure all the papers in this file match what you have and if they do not, make copies. Depending on who you are in the case, ""Plaintiff"" or ""Defendant"",  you will need to file motions and responses accordingly. The Plaintiff is always the one filing the motions petitioning the court for assistance in a matter against you or that involves you.  If you are the Defendant you will need to file responses to the motions filed by the Plaintiff.  If you are the one seeking the divorce or change of custody etc you will need to file motions to modify or initiate court proceedings.

, There is a saying that goes, ""If it is not in writing, it is not of this world"". This is especially true in court. Hearsay may hold weight in court in some instances but more often then not it is what you can support through documentation that goes the furthest. Whether it be a text, email, or police report this will hold more weight than what you think someone said three months ago. The courts do NOT have time for petty arguments and games of he-said-she-said.

, People are often all too quick to yell, point fingers, and lose sight of the goal. Especially when children are involved your ultimate goal is to reach an agreement that is in the best interest of the child. Remember it's not about how the other party wronged you or how bad you can make them look. Stick to facts that you can support with evidence. A judge wants to hear your plan to reach an agreement. Be reasonable! Find a way to show you're open to ideas and agreements that include ample parenting time with both parents.  If it's divorce, cut your losses and find a happy medium. In court, no judge will entertain a tirade. Intelligent and thought-out responses and actions gain the most attention.

, Read up on it and examine past cases. If you're not familiar with all relevant laws and the consequences they've had for cases similar to yours, it will be hard for you to follow all necessary procedures and win your case.

, In your courthouse there is most likely an attorney of the day. If not, find an attorney or online service that will allow you to discuss your case for free. Consult them. Stick to the facts and your goal. When you can not afford an attorney this is often the next best option as they can give you a path or direction to follow.

Experiment.",How to Use a Vending Machine in Japan," Although some vending machines will accept ￥1,000 bills, ￥500, ￥100, ￥50, and ￥10 coins are easier to use. The machine will not accept ￥5 and ￥1 coins. Insert the required amount of the item you want to purchase.;
, It is not uncommon in Japan to come across a vending machine that serves both hot and cold beverages. Above the button, there will be an indicator that shows the type of beverage. The red indicator that says 'あたたかい' (Ah-ta-ta-kai) means 'hot' , whereas the blue indicator that says 'つめたい' (Tsoo-meh-tie) means 'cold'.

, Press the lit up button beneath the display of the item you want to purchase. The button will not light up if the required amount is not inserted in the machine. The button will be red if the item is sold out.

, Change will be dispensed towards the bottom of the machine. If it doesn't come out automatically - or if you changed your mind about your purchase and want your yen back - you can pull the lever labelled 'おつり'.

, Traditionally, Japanese people stand in front of the vending machine after making a purchase and consume the item completely before throwing it away and moving freely. Making a purchase and consuming it while walking is considered quite rude, but as a foreigner, you will be easily forgiven. For your consideration, keep recycling in mind. Japan has very limited natural resources. There will often be a special bin for cans, bottles and plastic 'PET' bottles located somewhere near the vending machine.

, Japanese people are often very selfless, so an act of this sort may intimidate the individual and cause them to rush eating/drinking in order to make your life easier. As you will soon discover, there will be many vending machines every few blocks; so unless you're dying of thirst, keep walking.

, Although there are vending machines in Japan that cater to such items, their locations are typically very exclusive, and the prices of such can be expensive.

, These are very common, and sometimes placed in areas that may not, to a foreigner, appear 'child-friendly'. Cigarette vending machines usually have a 'Taspo' system to prevent minors from buying these goods, and machines that sell beer may require you to insert your driver's license. Keep in mind that the legal smoking age and legal drinking age in Japan is 20.

, Enjoy your stay and the experiences in Japan with its wonderful vending machines. After a while, you will become very accustomed to making purchases and reacting to the often new and exciting tastes they offer!

Research shipping.",How to Prepare for a Trip to Japan," The barrier between a language such as English and Japanese is huge. For English speakers, students and even some adults have undergone English lessons and signs and pictures are present around Japan to make visiting friendly, but chances are you’ll still find yourself in a situation of miscommunication.


Search for guides online. Boutiquejapan.com has links to several guides to get you started.Useful phrases to use include basic, polite greetings such as please and thank you, asking for objects, and asking for directions.The strongest English speakers are found where tourists gather, such as in large hotels. As you move out further into the countryside, the English proficiency of the natives decreases.
A language application for a phone or other device, such as Imiwa, which lets you look up words by pronunciation, and Yomiwa, which translates language characters captured in your photos, can help you even after you arrive in Japan.;
, Some travel maps have location names printed side-by-side in Japanese and English or another foreign language. This way, you have the translations of places in case you need to speak to a Japanese native or point out the word to ask for directions.


If you prefer to go paperless, phone applications such as MapsWithMe, which works offline, and Planetyze, which serves as maps and guidebooks, will also offer guidance.

, Japanese is made of three writing systems: hiragana and katakana, which are simplified phonetic alphabets for local and foreign words respectively, and kanji, which consists of over 40,000 symbols. This makes up much of Japanese communication, so it helps to have translation on hand.If you’ll have a device with Internet access on your trip, visit a site such as jisho.org where you can input words to obtain translations or search the meaning of kanji symbols.
The number of kanji symbols are limited, so the meaning of words is formed by mixing these symbols and their sounds. Sound-alike words and other mix-ups are common, so be wary.
Ahead of time, you can use this to help you print out a list of ingredients you can't eat if you have dietary restrictions. This way, you can search the labels of packaged food for these ingredients.

, This includes where you’re staying and any other location you plan on visiting regardless of how difficult you believe they will be to find. If you have to ask for directions, it’ll be far easier to point out where you need to go rather than try to communicate verbally.

, This can be done in your own language. Include your native language, blood type, chronic conditions, serious allergies, and generic names of any medications you are taking. In case of emergency, medical care is most easily provided when this information is readily available and understood.

, Some medications that are legal in your home country are restricted under Japanese law. You will get in trouble for possessing these without certification by Japan's government.For example, psychotropic drugs including opiod pain medications and stimulants such as Adderall are legally prescribed in America but will land you in jail in Japan.To apply for a certification for drugs such as narcotics, drugs classified as stimulants such as Ritalin, or over one month of supplies of an approved drug, obtain a doctor's note within six months of your application, details of your flight, and complete a Yakkan Shoumei application.All drugs and cosmetics are considered pharmaceuticals under Japanese law, but limited quantities of cosmetics, weak over-the counter-drugs, non-narcotics for personal use, and non-syringe external and oral medications such as insulin can be cleared in Customs.If you need a medication that won't be cleared by Customs, speak with your doctor. You may need devise an alternative treatment. The law is strict and there's no exception for stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse.

, Japan is becoming more and more aware of issues such as celiac disease, vegetarianism, halal, and kosher food, but there remains the need for many changes in order to accommodate all travelers. Allow places weeks or months to prepare to accommodate your needs.Places better accustomed to handling tourists are better equipped to meet these needs. This includes larger hotels and nearby restaurants.
Consumers looking for halal and kosher food in particular must keep in mind that even restaurants that advertise these specialties can still violate religious laws out of a lack of exposure to such cultures.
Print out a card with your dietary restrictions in Japanese for when you need food without having a reservation.
For those with celiac’s disease who need to avoid gluten, get the card from legalnomads.com. Foods of particular note to avoid include soy sauce, miso soup and tea that includes barley, and wheat noodles.Vegetarians can memorize and write down the words shojin ryori. This essentially means Buddhist vegetarian cooking., Yes, Japanese language and customs vary depending on who you’re addressing. This applies to bowing, which has the caveat of many different bows being used for many different expressions. To be safe, master a basic bow in a mirror or around friends.A standard bow is appropriate in many situations for travelers, including when you greet or part from someone. The only exception is when you are greeted by a clerk or attendant upon entering a store, as most people pass with a nod of acknowledgement.
When offering thanks or apologies for disturbing someone, such as when asking for directions, be sure to offer this bow of courtesy.To ensure you avoid offense, return a bow when anyone bows to you. It's better to be safe than sorry.
Keep your spine in a straight line as you bend from your hips.
Don’t move your legs, hips, or your butt.
Keep your arms straight and your hands against your sides.
Incline your body downwards to a 30-45 degree angle. Standing straight means your body is at a 90 degree angle from the ground, so bring your body down a little less than halfway parallel to the ground.

, The documents you need depend on where you live, how long you plan to stay, and why you’re visiting. Consult your local government for details on what you need to obtain and provide to ensure entry into Japan.For America, Canada, Australia, Britain, and European Union nations, a passport and return ticket are required if you stay less than 90 days for sight-seeing purposes.
Other nationals, including those from Asian nations near Japan, need a visa.

, Most likely you won’t need this, but it pays to be ready for the worst. Healthcare in Japan is costly and you don’t want to be stuck in a situation in a foreign country where you’re on your own with a medical bill. Search online for policies that cover your needs., The shinkansen bullet trains are a premier way to visit multiple cities, but multiple tickets are costly and difficult to manage. The initial price of the pass seems high, but for those that will take the trains often, it pays for itself. Visit jrpass.com for information.Order the pass in advance. It’s for foreign tourists, so it is meant to be bought online, outside of Japan. Starting in 2017, limited rail stations and airports sell the pass at an increased price.In order to use the pass, you’ll need temporary visitor status under Japanese immigration law. Tourists from most countries receive this automatically, but make sure you have a sticker or stamp on your passport to represent this.Passes are sold in seven, 14, and 21-day increments.
There are two different types of passes: green and ordinary. Green cars offer luxuries such as more space.Shinkansen seats can also be reserved. This can be done in advance at railway offices and is useful during holiday busy periods in April, August, and December or when wanting to sit together with members of your group., Japan has an ultra-competitive airline scene. If you’re looking to travel to multiple cities, you can find discount airlines, discount tickets and even ticket package deals that may end up being cheaper than taking the train., For those traveling within a major city such as Tokyo, the subway is a better option. This enables you to avoid sluggish vehicular traffic while paying less than a train pass. Maps are available online.Since they are in major cities, subways tend to be crowded and thus may not be desirable to families, even though staff is on hand to make sure everyone gets on board and environment inside the cars is quiet.Fares cost a couple hundred yen and can be purchased at the subway’s vending machines.

, Buses are an easy choice in most countries for fast transportation, but in Japan they fill the niche between convenient trains and crowded streets. Travel takes longer but is several hundred yen cheaper than by train.


Check online at kakuyasubus.jp and other sites. There you can find buses and reserve seats.Highway buses and night buses are similar to tour buses in other countries. They come equipped with bathrooms and will transport you between cities.
Local buses are necessary in locations without subways. These will have timetables and routes at bus stops.

, Taxis are a safe, easy way to get around busy cities. The costs can add up, but if you pay for a taxi you won’t have to worry about subway lines and walking directions.Taxis start at several hundred yen and the cost per distance rises the further you travel.
Taxis can be found either by waiting at a taxi stand or flagging one down.
Vacant taxis have a red light atop the dashboard. Occupied ones have a green light.
The driver may not speak your language, so it is useful to have on hand a map or a Japanese printout of your address.

, Driving in Japan can be difficult. It may mean getting accustomed to driving on the left side of the road, an abundance of traffic, and pricey gasoline. Having your own transportation can also be freeing.You'll need to be at least 18 with a valid driver's license in your home country and an international driving permit, but many rental companies only do business with those over 21.Inquire with your local government on how to apply for an international driving permit. In America, for example, requirements includes two passport pictures, a valid U.S. driver’s license, and a permit fee.Be wary of scams. In America, for instance, only the American Automobile Association and American Automobile Touring Association are licensed to take applications for international driving permits.Visit ToCoo! Car Rental’s website (www2.tocoo.jp). They hold information on hundreds of rental agencies, cars, and traffic signs.
Call rental car agencies. Agencies such as Toyota Rent-A-Car, Nippon Rent-A-Car, and Nissan Rent-A-Car have phone lines in addition to websites you can visit for help.
Road signs on major highways contain both Japanese and English text. For other locations, try a bilingual map.

, The best location for this depends upon your home currency, but knowing where to go when you need yen is essential in a cash-based society such as Japan. Cards are growing in popularity, but smaller shops favor cash transactions.For a currency that is valuable in Japan such as American dollars or when the yen is weak, you may get a better rate exchanging your currency when you arrive.Airport exchange counters, banks, and post offices are good places to exchange your currency.
Bring a conversion calculator, too. This can be a handheld calculator after you’ve learned of the exchange rate, an online website if you'll have Internet access, or a phone application such as XE Currency.

, You don’t want to be caught in Japan needing to withdraw money but finding out the ATM doesn’t accept your card. Ask your bank if your card works in Japan and for alternatives.

, Once you are settled with your bank, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with where you can find places to access your money. Many ATMs, particularly those beyond typical tourist locations, will be harder to manage for those that don’t speak Japanese.


Banks, post offices, and large hotels are tourist-friendly and often have ATMs.
Another good location to find ATMs is 7/11. Japan has tens of thousand branches of this convenient store chain and they’re friendly to tourists.

, Pasmo, Suica, and Icoca cards are cards you can preload with yen. This reduces the amount of cash you have to juggle and reduces the need for you to search out ATMs and use your bank card.


Prepaid cards can be found at exchange machines in airports and train stations.A main use for these cards is for managing multiple trips on short-distance subways and trains, saving time and hassle during transfers.
These cards are now accepted by many stores and vending machines.

, Rooms in Japan fill up fast and the polite culture means that your Japanese hosts appreciate ample time to accommodate you. Once you’ve done this, you’ll no longer have to worry about finding a place to stay., Ryokans are Japanese-style inns. Think of the kind of home you may have seen on TV: a serene environment, tatami mats, paper doors, and futons. These are for people who wish to experience traditional Japanese culture.Some ryokans boast specialties, including relaxing hot springs or an emphasis on Japanese food.Most offer two meals per person per day.
These are traditional, so they may be without central heating, advanced technology, or staff fluent in foreign languages.
Costs range from a couple thousand yen to over a hundred thousand yen a night. Bring cash to pay your bill or check to see if the ryokan accepts credit card.

, Various international and Japanese chains exist, especially among the major cities. These are convenient and offer the usual amenities such as carpeted rooms and televisions.


Cost can be an issue. Many hotels surround popular attractions where business owners can get away with charging more for goods and services by appealing to tourists.
Capsule hotels are another option. In the vein of regular hotels, they target mostly single males and offer basics such as a place to sleep, a clean bathroom, and a television at a reduced price., Many people conflate these guest, or gaijin, houses with ryokans. A guest house is an apartment you can rent cheaply for a short contract or a long stay. Often this means having to share a kitchen and bathroom with other guests. This is good for experiencing everyday life in Japan.


Guest houses tend to run under 100,000 yen for a month’s stay., A growing trend worldwide is to house visitors in one’s own house or apartment and Japan is no different. Search online for renting rates, locations, and modern and restored traditional houses that will allow you to experience life in Japan through the eyes of a native., These are for budget and often younger travelers. They operate much as dormitories do and include shared rooms and common areas. This is an ideal place if you wish to interact with a wide variety of travelers.Hostels tend to cost under 5,000 yen.
Many hostels have extra benefits, including a guest kitchen, meals, and free Internet. Check with the hostel for any fees associated with these features.
Some hostels, especially those outside big cities, have strict curfews and lock-out periods where you need to be away from your room.

, Many places, including hostels and hotels, can be booked online or over the telephone. If you’ve yet to figure out where you’re going to stay, a travel agency can guide you. Either describe where you’d like to stay or ask for their opinion. This can be the only way to reach out to traditional ryokans, as some are not technologically advanced.

, Japan still maintains a culture of formality. Casual clothing is fine for walking around and seeing the sights, but to dress like the locals, lean towards the formal. No matter the ages of yourself and anyone you are traveling with, avoid clothes that are tattered, ragged, or revealing.


Inside establishments, choose formal wear such as a suit or jacket for men and a skirt and high heels for women.Avoid jeans. You'll see natives wearing jeans on occasion, but most people wear more formal pants, skirts, and even shorts on the street. Children and young adults also benefit from avoiding the attention jeans bring.
Jeans and shorts should not be worn inside restaurants.

, The Japanese choose muted, traditional colors including black, blue, brown, gray, and white. The goal is to not stand out in a crowd and most Japanese choose to avoid gaudiness.


Men should also avoid black ties and women all-black, since this is associated with funerals.
Children and teenagers have more leeway, but still it is best to avoid clothing that is flashy, over-the-top, or revealing.

, The winter months are December through February, but the cold lasts until May. The weather trends towards 5-10 degrees Celsius and 40-50 degrees Farenheit, accompanied by harsh, cold wind.Bring gloves, a scarf, a knit hat, and warm underwear.

, This is essential in the rainy season, which occurs around the month of June, but a light raincoat is always useful in fending off Japan’s rains. You may also bring an umbrella or shop for these once you arrive.

, The summer months are June through August when the weather becomes hot and humid. You will sweat a lot, so bring quick-drying fabrics such as linen and cotton.


Women of all ages have to take care to stay covered, as Japan has a culture of modesty. Slender legs can be passable, but avoid cleavage and bare midriffs at all costs.Consider bringing a light jacket or sweater in case the air conditioning inside establishments makes you cold.

, This depends on where you’re going. You’ll need a bathing suit for the beach, but most hot springs (onsen) restrict bathing suits as they pollute the water. Rather, you are meant to clean yourself, then wear a towel and set it aside upon entering the water.Women and girls should choose a one-piece bathing suit. Japan’s modest culture leads many to frown upon excessive skin exposure of a bikini.

, This isn’t mandatory, but many places in Japan, including restaurants and ryokans, maintain a custom of not bringing shoes inside. If you don’t want to go through the effort of undoing laces, alternative shoes are important.Remember that tatami mats are a clear indicator to take off your shoes.

, Japan has different customs regarding medications and it’ll benefit you to have whatever you need on-hand since you won’t be able to buy most of what you need without a Japanese prescription. This is also useful in case your departure get delayed.


Again, check local laws with an embassy and discuss alternatives with your doctor if the medication you need isn’t permitted inside Japan.

, There is nothing like traveling to a foreign country and discovering you can’t charge your important devices because the outlets are different. If you live outside North America, invest in one before you leave.Japan uses two-pronged plugs with similar voltage to North America customs, so the only type of conversion needed for North Americans is for devices with more prongs,

, While in Japan, you’ll notice that many natives rinse their hands with a little water after using the bathroom. Many public bathrooms do not offer soap or paper towels., Since you’ll likely want to use your electronic device for Internet contact, searching for information on Japan, and translation, you’ll need Wi-Fi access. You can rent these from places online such as eConnect and japan-rail-pass.com.


A portable hotspot establishes a portal for your devices to connect to the Internet, but a SIM card is a chip you install in your phone to enable it to connect to the Internet.
These devices should be reserved in advance and delivered to a convenient location upon your arrival, such as the airport post office and your hotel.
The SIM card requires a existing Internet connection to register, so do this in a public place such as the airport.
When you’re finished with the device, all you have to do is put it in an included pre-paid package and drop it in a postbox., This is another option for Wi-Fi connectivity. You can also find these at eConnect and japan-rail-pass.com, among other sites. These cards allow you to connect to the Internet even when you’re away a Wi-Fi hotspot.

, Some carriers offer roaming services, but others don’t operate in Japan at all. If you haven’t done this yet, you'll want to check so that you can plan on obtaining a device such as a SIM card or locating hotspots.

, This will help you in a pinch if you don’t have an alternative method such as pocket Wi-Fi. Due to the growth of technology, public Internet access is growing in Japan, but you should still check to see where you can connect.Most big tourist areas, including hotels, train lines, and shopping districts now have free Wi-Fi access.

, You don’t have to go overboard planning your trip to the last detail. In fact, you may not even see all the places you consider here. Still, it’s good to have some idea so you can plan out issues such as Wi-Fi access, printing location names in Japanese, money management, and traveling.


As there are plenty of sights for younger and older adults, there are plenty of attractions that cater to children. You'll find no shortage of zoos, museums, nature, and amusement parks with no fear that the Japanese will be anything less than welcoming., Comparing the prices you are familiar with to yen prices requires an adjustment. Before you go, decide on how much you plan to spend and where you intend to spend it. This will remove a lot of the stress you’d get from navigating a foreign country.

, Most visitors can get around fine in Japan on their own, but don’t be afraid to hire a guide if needed. Search online or contact an agency for representatives willing to show you to where you’d like to go while providing insight on Japan along the way.


This can be particularly useful for travelers searching for restaurants based on dietary restrictions. The travel industry for Muslims has been growing, for instance, so a tour from a specialized company can help you navigate Japan and locate halal-friendly restaurants.

, Japan is a popular tourist spot, so other travelers before you have begun to influence food culture and assemble lists of restaurants that cater to dietary restrictions. Search for vegetarian restaurants in Tokyo, for example, to find these lists online and plan out your diet.A tour guide or specialized visitor representatives and hotel staffs can help guide you to restaurants that fit your needs.

, If you intend on making purchases in Japan, you may need to send them home via shipping. Airlines have strict regulations these days, but parcel companies can ensure packages reach your door.


One such resource is the TA-Q-BIN system (kuronekoyamato.co.jp), which also has information on international moving and UPS services.

Think light and small - compared with westerners, Japanese people tend to travel with smaller size luggage.,
Bring cash - many stores and restaurants might not accept credit cards.,
Pack a pair of shoes that you can slip off easily.,
Take comfortable shoes for walking, you'll be doing a lot of that.

,
Carry a mini-towel in your bag for drying your hands.,
If you want to feel like part of the crowd - Jeans are not an option while dining.,
Packing warm clothing is a must in winter.,
Make sure to pack a converter or plug - the electricity in Tokyo is 100 volts.,
Take mosquito repellent if you're visiting during the summer season.",How to Prepare a Packing Checklist for Tokyo," As a result, there usually isn't a wide space to store large luggage in trains (including the bullet train). Coin lockers in subway stations aren't large enough to hold big suitcases either. Subway stations in Tokyo consist of endless pathways, some include stairs (and no elevators). Planning to use the subway with luggage in hand is not a good idea.;
, It's a good idea to prepare for that by bringing a substantial amount of Japanese yen in cash.

, Since it's a Japanese custom to walk without shoes indoors, you might have to take off your shoes frequently. Be sure to pack your best looking socks and pantyhose to avoid any embarrassment when you take off your shoes.

,, Most restrooms, in spite of their extreme cleanliness, do not provide paper towels. Carrying a mini towel is a very common Japanese thing to do.

, Casual clothes are fine for sightseeing, but most Tokyo citizens dress very formally - a suit or a jacket for men, Long shorts are okay for men as long as the beach look is avoided. Women usually wear Skirts and high heels. Revealing clothes are not common among Japanese women. Women are likely to feel very out of place in shorts or cleavage. Men should avoid black ties and women should avoid an all-black look - since this is the funeral attire.

, The wind is freezing cold. Your list should include Gloves, long underwear, a scarf, and a warm knitted hat. Winter is very dry, and people with sensitive skin should pack their favorite skin lotion in abundance. Wet season - pack an umbrella. In the summer - cotton clothing is the best. Most places are air-conditioned, so put a light jacket on your checklist. Autumn and spring tips - packing light jackets and sweaters is recommended. Evening clothing must be warmer, since the temperatures drop drastically.

, American appliances can be used in Japan without a converter although they will have less power. If your appliances are three-pronged, you need a plug since Japanese appliances are two-pronged. You can purchase converters and plugs in the airport shops.

, You're likely to find mosquitoes in parks and gardens. You can find mosquito repellents in Japanese drugstores.

Know your destination.,
Buy a ticket.,
Find your platform.,
Board the train.,
Ride the train.,
Get off the train.",How to Ride a Train in Japan," Be sure to know exactly where you want to go or at least the general area. There are plenty of English maps of the railway system available out there so be sure to pick up one ahead of time.;
, When you buy your ticket from the machines there is an English language option to help guide you along. Be sure to make full use of it, especially if it is your first time buying a ticket. You also need to know the amount it will cost to get to your destination which is listed above you on a map of the railway if you are unsure. Just to be safe, don't be afraid to spend 20 yen more if you are unsure of the cost of your trip. It is also very beneficial if you ride the train frequently to think about buying a train card.

, Once you know your destination and you have bought your ticket it is time to find the platform where your train is located. There are signs and arrows that will guide you to your destination and most times they are also color coded.

, When you arrive at the platform and are waiting for the train be sure to stand along the line provided on the ground and stand behind the cautionary yellow line. Once the train arrives make sure to stand aside to let the passengers file off and then make your way onto the train. Rush Hour: While it is appropriate to be polite and wait to the side you may have to shove your way through to make it on in time. Don't be alarmed if you are slightly shoved yourself or if one of the station officers comes along to give you a nice push into the train. When it is crowded it is crowded; you will feel like a sardine no matter what you do.

, When riding the train be sure to observe etiquette. If you are not tired then do not take a seat, save it for those who are or the elderly or handicapped. The same applies for if you do happen to take a seat; be polite and give it to those who need it. It is also proper not to talk on the phone in the train whether it is crowded or not.

, Pay attention to your stops and know when your destination is coming. It will be announced every station so you don't have to struggle to understand the signs if you are confused. Just watch your step as you get off the train and enjoy yourself at your destination. Rush Hour: When you're packed in with too many people and your stop has arrived be prepared for some pushing and shoving again. There are two key phrases you can call out that people will immediately understand and proceed to help you in your effort to get off the train. The first is ""sumimasen"" which means excuse me and is customary for many other situations as well. The other is ""orimasu"" which is ""I'm getting off."" The two can be used together like ""Sumimasen, orimasu!"" as well.

"
"
Plan ahead before you plunge in on rush hours which extend from 7.30am to 9am and from 5pm to 7pm.,
Listen for an apology over the loudspeaker if your train is slightly behind schedule, say 30 seconds.,
Know your 'going out' options.,
Take the Tokyo subway map in English at your hotel desk, or in the subway stations.,
Look for the correct station.,
Buy prepaid rail passes.,
Swipe the card over the card reader on the gate, which is indicated by a blue light.,
Note: As an alternative to a pass, if you are brave, you can purchase your tickets individually from station to station.,
To purchase tickets at a station:

,
Locate the ticket purchasing area- usually there is English that will say ""Tickets"".,
Above the ticket machines there is a diagram with the names of locations and the price for going there.,
Approach one of the ticket machines that says ""commuter ticket"".,
Set the instructions to English if you need to.,
Pay with yen.,
Collect your change and ticket.

,
Insert your ticket into the slot of one of the turnstiles, pass through, and make sure to pick up your ticket on the other side.,
From there, find the appropriate line headed to your destination (For example, Ueno would be the 山手線 (yamanote sen).",How to Navigate the Tokyo Subway," This is certainly not a venture for those who value their personal space. Benches on board fold up to maximize capacity, and platform attendants wearing white gloves push passengers through the doors. Some subway lines have women-only cars during the morning rush hours, so women and young children can ride more comfortably.;
, Even at an intense frequency of every 2-3 minutes there is a strict schedule that is followed to the second. A train late by only a minute (which is considered ""on time"" in any other place in the world) is a major concern here.

, Enjoying a night out? You'll have to choose between heading home early on the last train, staying out much later and catching the first, or taking a taxi. The subway operates between 5 am and 1 am, when all transportation services cease.

, It is very simple to navigate the Tokyo transportation system. Signs on subway stations include the station names in English. Each line has a letter (example: the Ginza line has a line symbol of G) and a color. You simply follow the signs indicating the line symbol + line color.

, When you arrive at the platform there are two ways of recognizing your preferred station / direction- using the station name as your guide– they appear in English, or there is a letter and number code to identify it each station. The letter stands for the line, the number reflects where on the line the station is.

, They are rechargeable ""smart cards"". There are two major brands of rail pass: Suica, and Pasmo. They can be used on just about every subway, train and bus line in Tokyo (with the exception of JR's Shinkansen and limited express trains). Most Tokyo Subway tickets and rail passes are sold from automated vending machines which have an English language option (see note below for more detail). Ticket machines are located at each subway station. Some of the larger stations have ticketing offices. There is an initial ¥500 deposit that you must pay when purchasing a rail pass, this fee is refundable at the subway station when you leave Japan. You choose how much money you want to put on the pass, depending on the time you plan to spend in Tokyo.

, When you place your ticket, it will display the amount of cash left on your pass.


Going out of the station without knowing the right exit number for your desired destination, can lead to extensive walking in the endless passageways of the Tokyo subway system. You can find your exit number easily on the vicinity maps which are located on the platforms, or after exiting the fare gate. Once you've identified your exit number, you follow the appropriate exit signs. Subway inspectors located on platforms and next to fare gates, are also very willing to help.

, It seems a bit scary at first but it gets easier the more you do it. If you get stuck you can always ask for help.

,, The Japanese for ticket is きっぷ (kippu). If you cannot find it, there is almost always a window next to the turnstiles leading in and out of the station and you can ask for help there.

, For example, under Ueno (上野) if the number is 760, it costs 760￥ to go to Ueno from your current station.

, On the JR line this is usually green.

, The first button to push is JRきっぷ (JR Ticket). This will bring up a display with various numbers. This is where you select the number you saw under your destination (so, in the example of Ueno, 760).

, Be aware there is no Dollars option. Sticking with our example you would owe 760￥.

,, It will have a hole punched in it now. You'll need it to exit the station at your destination, so don't forget it!

, This is probably the hardest part, so don't give up if you don't understand right away. Ask the station attendants or people at the information booths for help. See tips for various ways to ask in Japanese.


If at the end of your trip you find you've ridden too far or paid for a ticket to someplace farther than you actually went, use the Fare Adjustment machines located near the exits- the machines look like the ticket buying machines but are yellow. Just slip your ticket in and it will tell you the difference to be made up. Then you can go through the turnstiles with no worries.

Take the water bus for an enjoyable treat.",How to Travel Around Tokyo," Get familiar with the Tokyo metro and rail systems. Both modes of transport are modern, clean, efficient, and user-friendly. Station names are displayed and announced in English. The 13 subway lines that operate beneath the city are colour coded, and pictorial information at stations gives instructions to locate connecting trains. Various ticket options and day passes allow all day travel on board any train or bus in greater Tokyo.;
, The Yamanote Line that runs in an oblong loop around Tokyo offers the most comprehensive service and stops at 29 stations, connecting Tokyo's six city centers. Other surface trains servicing Tokyo run alongside and through the Yamanote loop. This is a perfect option for sightseeing and shopping, with department stores located at each station. However, you'll need to be aware of the idiosyncrasies of the surface rail system, such as stopping halfway to destinations at closing time. Get familiar with railway schedules prior to travel.

, Although almost everyone takes the subway, it may sometimes be convenient to travel by bus, especially when train tickets allow unlimited travel on buses as well. Bus route guides have a copy of the route map and time tables. Destinations are clearly marked in English on the bus and stops are digitally displayed also in English. As bus routes generally start and end at railway stations, it is not too confusing to use them.


Trams still offer optional transport services in the southeast, northeast and north central Tokyo, and many people use the tram system to discover interesting places in the city.

, Taxis are the most expensive way to travel around Tokyo and should be used only in an emergency and when trains and busses have stopped operating. The high fares are due in part to Tokyo traffic jams. However, taxis can be cost effective when shared. Hail a vacant taxi, marked with a red light on the front window, at an appropriate spot on the street. As Japanese taxi drivers are not known for their English language skills it is better to have the destination written in Japanese on a piece of paper prior to climbing aboard a taxi.

, Driving in Tokyo is almost impossible impossible and quite expensive due to heavy traffic, expensive toll roads, and the difficulty of parking. Avoid traveling by car if at all possible.

, As it is accepted to cycle along the pavement, many people use bicycles to get around the suburban areas of Tokyo. It is the cheapest way to get around the neighborhoods and to explore the immediate vicinity.

, Although all tourist destinations are accessible by some form of land transport, which is almost always cheaper and more efficient, some people take water buses simply to enjoy Tokyo from the water.

Learn how to use public transportation.,
Know what to do in public baths.,
Learn how to greet others.,
Never sit on the floor.,
Japanese people are very modest.,
Be observant.",How to Practice Good Manners in Japan," The more Japanese you know the better. Unless you are just making a quick trip as a tourist you should study the language. There are many set phrases in Japanese and by learning the language you will learn when and how to use them. This is key for people staying for a long period of time. Most Japanese people would be willing to teach them to you.;
, Japanese mealtime etiquette is pretty easy to learn, if you remember a few simple rules.


Never stick your chopsticks in your rice and leave them there, or pass food from person to person by chopsticks. These two behaviors occur at funerals and so they shouldn't be done at the dinner table.
Making some noises while you eat is okay; in fact, slurping your noodles is expected.
It is okay to lift something big with chopsticks, bite off a piece, and set the rest back down.
Use your chopsticks to eat solid parts of soup, then lift the bowl and drink the broth.
Always eat what you are given.

, Sometimes there are slippers at the door to a restroom. If you see them, use them. Carry a small towel with you in Japan to dry your hands because public restrooms do not have towels.

, Never use a handkerchief to blow a runny nose.

, Japanese people tend to dress more formally than Westerners. It is important you do not wear garments such as revealing tops that show cleavage, too-short shorts or miniskirts that expose underwear when you bend over. It is disconcerting and inconsiderate to others around you, and you'll attract unwanted attention and staring. Some men may get the wrong idea.

, Always line up to enter the vehicle. If you have a backpack, take it off before you board and carry it by your feet. If you do not, you may hit someone with it accidentally. Try not to bump into anyone. When boarding a bus or train and there are no seats available, stand up. No matter how tired you are, never sit on the floor - as the floor is considered dirty. On crowded trains, physical contact is unavoidable so watch your hands to prevent misunderstandings. Eating and drinking are usually okay, but do not make a mess. Offer your seat to the elderly, pregnant women, people with infants or young children, and the physically handicapped. You must do this if you are seated in a ""Priority Seat"", unless, of course, you fit into one of these categories. These seats are clearly labeled in English.

, Bring your own towel, soap, and shampoo, just in case. Shower and rinse yourself thoroughly before you get in the bath. You can take a smaller ""privacy towel"" with you to the bath but leave your big towel behind. Do not let your towel touch the water. Rinse again after you get out.

, Unlike Westerners, Japanese people do not greet people by kissing them on the cheek - but they will make exceptions to shake hands with you if you are a foreigner. When you see a person for the first time that day, greet and bow to them. You are always expected to bow, especially to seniors who are more superior to you. The older they are, the deeper you will be expected to bow. This does not apply to strangers of course, but rather to anyone you will have a conversation with. Learn to bow properly.

, No matter where or how tired you are, the floor is considered extremely filthy and is seen as the the dirtiest place in public. Same rule applies for squatting - this is associated with criminals and gangster people. The only exception for sitting on the floor is home, or wherever you may happen to be staying in Japan (e.g. home-stay, hotel, guest house, Japanese inns), or in the house of a friend or family member. Otherwise, especially on public transport, stand up - unless there's a spare seat nearby.

, They rarely say that they are good at something. For example, at the dinner table someone comments on how well you use chopsticks, it is better to decline the compliment. Say something like ""Iie, iie, mada mada desu,"" which directly translates to ""no, no not yet,"" and shake your head for effect.

, You can learn a lot by watching other people and doing what they do. It will not always work, but at least this way you have a reason why you were rude.

Know the different languages that belong to either country.,
Be aware of how geography has shaped the two cultures.,
Know the different types of dishes that are native to either China or Japan.,
Know what type of governing body rules the respective nations.,
Know the difference between Chinese holidays and Japanese holidays and how they're celebrated.,
Learn the difference between Chinese names and Japanese names.,
Know the different religions that are practiced in China and Japan.",How to Distinguish Between Japanese and Chinese Cultures," China has many spoken languages such as Mandarin, Wu, Yue (Cantonese falls in this) and Min, but one written system, ""Chinese"", whereas Japan has only spoken Japanese but three different writing systems.


Chinese is a tonal language, where Japanese tends to be more monotone.
Japanese kanji is based off of Chinese written Chinese characters. Kanji and written Chinese are very similar, but not exactly the same.
Japanese does have regional dialects, with standard Japanese being the Tokyo dialect.;
, China covers a vast amount of land on the mainland of Asia, whereas Japan is a group of islands.


China shares borders with the countries in the Middle East, Southern Asia, Southeast Asia, North and South Korea, Russia, and Mongolia. These land borders allowed for expansive trade networks and for culture to flow back and forth across their borders. As a result, Chinese culture had a wide sphere of influence but had vastly different cultures in northern and southern China.
Japan's neighboring countries were limited to North and South Korea, China, Russia, the Ainu people in the North (present day Hokkaido) and the Ryukyu kingdom (present day Okinawa)

, Knowing the flavor profiles of the two countries will also help you distinguish between the cuisines. Due to Japan being mostly island, seafood is heavily featured in much of Japanese cuisine. Chinese cuisines tend to feature seafood less prominently unless they're from coastal regions.


Chinese food varies by region, but tends to have stronger flavors. Northern China is better known for their noodle and grain-based dishes, while Southern China traditionally has been had more rice based dishes. Japanese cuisine is known for its more subtle tastes.
Japanese cuisine makes use of a lot of fish stock (dashi), kelp, miso, soy sauce, sake, and rice vinegar. Japanese rice is glutinous short grained rice, which tends to be stickier. Japanese famous food examples include sushi, tempura, and ramen.
Chinese cuisine, in general, favors soy sauce, rice wine, and ginger. Chinese food examples include Peking duck, chow mein, char siu (BBQ pork), and yumcha/dim sum. Chinese rice tends to be long grain non-glutinous rice, which tends to lack stickiness.

, Mainland China is is a communist state (the nationalist party fled to Taiwan shortly after WW2), whereas Japan is a parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy.


In Japan, the Emperor is the head of state but holds no real power, while the Prime Minister acts as the head of government. Legislative power is vested in the Diet, which consists of elected officials from across the 47 prefectures.

, While a lot of Asian countries celebrate Lunar New Year (such as South Korea and Vietnam), Japan does not celebrate Lunar New Year. Rather, it celebrates the Western New Year according to the Gregorian calendar. The way they're celebrated is similar, but different. In both there's a large emphasis on visiting with family and cleaning before the New Year, but the Chinese New Year tends to be celebrated very differently, with firecrackers and red things everywhere.


Another major holiday in Japan is the Obon season, which occurs in the late summer. Many people return to their hometowns and families to honor the spirit of their ancestors.

, Chinese names usually only have one syllable. Japanese names usually have about three syllables, and end in a vowel (similar to Italian names).

, Being able to recognize the symbolism associated with the different religions will help you identify which religion belongs to which country.

Buddhism is an import to both countries (as well as the entire continent of Asia in general) from India. However, mainstream Chinese Buddhism has evolved very differently from its Indian roots. Buddhism was brought to Japan by Chinese monks and developed independently from Chinese Buddhism. Accordingly, Buddhism looks different in China than it does in Japan with different and sometimes overlapping sects.
Taoism and Confucianism both originated in China, and both have influenced and been influenced by Chinese Buddhism.
Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, though both Shinto and Buddhist practices are observed by many Japanese throughout their lives. Zen Buddhism is one of the most well known sects of Japanese Buddhism.

They are usually available for purchase in the bath house. You may also bring any toiletries you like, though shampoo and soap are usually provided in the shower areas.

, In Japan, it is considered rude and unhygienic to get into the tub before cleaning your body thoroughly. You ought to do it for the sake of everyone who will bathe after you. If you are obviously new to visiting hot springs, fellow bathers may watch you closely to make sure you clean your whole body thoroughly.

, If you have long hair, tie it up now. You should not let your hair touch the bathwater.

, Japanese baths may be hotter than you are accustomed to, so use caution. You may want to start by lowering half your body into the water in order to adjust to the temperature. Many people in Japan say you should not stay in for longer than thirty minutes at a time because it increases your risk of fainting. Many people fold the small white Onset towel and place it on their heads to help keep it cool. If you start to feel faint, get out of the water slowly and take a moment to sit before getting a drink or splashing cool water on your body.

, This is so the sweat on your body doesn't dirty the bathwater.

Decide on what to do in Halong Bay.,

Decide where to book the trips.","How to Tour Halong Bay, Vietnam"," Go to Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, and choose the transportation type.

The best way to go to Halong Bay from Hanoi is by bus. It is cheap and comfortable and the buses to Halong Bay are new, have air conditioning and come with a safe driver. The road quality from Hanoi to Halong Bay is acceptable, not too bumpy.

Decide on a tourist or local bus. A tourist bus is strongly recommended because it will be a new bus in good condition. It will take you directly from Hanoi to Halong Bay without any stops. However, you need to stay in Old Quarter.
Know how much a bus trip costs. Minh Sinh Travel company (the owner of Halong Galaxy Cruise) charges 8USD each way (170.000 Vietnamdong) or 15USD for a round trip (315.000vnd). If you book a tour with them directly, the cost of traveling by bus is included in the price. The staff of this company speak English.
In total, the drive from Hanoi to Halong Bay will take four hours. Taking a local bus is cheaper, but the bus is old and shocking, and there are indecorous staff. The staff will stop everywhere on the road to pick up more guests. If in some occasions of holiday in Vietnam, you will be stuffed. Mostly local people choose local buses because of the price; it costs about 4-6USD per way.
Another transportation you should consider is to go by seaplane. This trip only takes you 45 minutes to get to Halong Bay. The flight can be extended to include an additional 15-minute scenic tour over the bay, which allows you to enjoy a bird’s eye view of the thousands of limestone karsts jutting up from the jade green waters and see remote fishing villages before landing at Tuan Chau Island Marina. However, the price is much higher from traveling by bus, about 300USD per person.




 



;
, This should be dependent on your travel plan.

You can do a tour in Halong bay for 1 day, 2 days and 1 night, or 3 days and 2 nights, and stay more in Halong City or Cat Ba island in Halong Bay. However, a duration of 2 days and 1 night, or 3 days and 2 nights, is preferable.

, You can choose to stay on the boat itself, or a cabin on the boat that offers overnight cabin.







Halong Galaxy Cruise offers the cabins to stay on the boat. The cabin is a little small, but absolutely clean likes a three-star hotel. The condition of the cabin is also good. It is air-conditioned, hot water is available, and there is a hairdryer. In overall, you do not worry about accommodation if you stay with Halong Galaxy Cruise.






Another option for accommodation is the hotel or bungalow on Cat Ba island. It is a small town, but has mostly conditions as on the main land. There are a lot of hotels or guest houses there with a reasonable price.

, Staying on the boat, the staff will supply all the meals.







Most of the food is seafood. Otherwise, meat and vegetables are also supplied on the boat.






For breakfast, there is milk, jam, bread, toast, soup, eggs, sausage, grilled pork meat, salad, and fruit. Other meals have salad, steamed vegetables, eggs, meat (pork, chicken, or beef), shrimp, crab, and fruit. Vegetarian people can require the chef to have a special menu.

,

You can book any cruise for overnight in Halong bay, and is highly recommended.
Know how much the company charges to stay on a boat. For example, Halong Galaxy Cruise charges 125USD per person for a 2 days and 1 night package, and 215USD per person for 3 days and 2 nights. Features such as a 2 way bus, boat, tour guide, food, entrance fees, water, and kayaking are included.

, The most interesting thing about this site is that there are thousands of fantastic rock formations rising up on the sea. It is great for photos.







You can also do activities such as caving, swimming, kayaking, adventure and sightseeing.






Generate what is in your trip to Halong bay, and what you want to do as self-going. The trip package includes transportation, a boat trip, a tour guide, entrance fees, food, drinks, accommodation, and kayaking. You also need to pay for the above.

, It is best to book at your hotel, or directly with tour operators. Beware of tour offices on the street."

Dress properly.,
Mind your body language.,
Avoid spreading germs.,
Keep some distance.,
Learn to bow properly.,
Remove your shoes before entering a residence.,
Learn gift-giving conventions.,
Show up on time.,
Clean your hands.,
Wait until everyone has their food before eating.,
Respect the layout.,
Don’t waste food.",How to Avoid Etiquette Mistakes in Japan," Most Japanese people dress fairly similarly to westerners so you won’t have to worry about buying specific clothes for your trip. However, Japanese culture places a slightly higher premium on professional attire in public places than exists in the west.Err towards packing and wearing your nicer clothing.


Adult men generally don’t wear shorts in Japan, even in hotter weather.Expectations for women to dress modestly are slightly higher in Japan than in the west. Japanese women usually cover their shoulders and avoid form-fitting clothes. However, this expectation is less present in major cities like Tokyo.Flip-flops are not commonly worn in public in Japan. It won’t be considered rude but you may get strange looks.;
, Body language signals are more intentional and universally understood in Japan than in most western cultures. A subtle nod, smile or placement of your hands can drastically change the meaning of your words.While Japanese people used to dealing with westerners will understand if you haven’t totally mastered these signals, there are some body language signals that could be considered rude.


Try to keep your back straight at all times. Slouching while sitting or leaning against a wall while standing is considered rude and dismissive of your companions.Don’t keep your hands in your pockets during a conversation.
Point with your hand, not your finger. Pointing with a finger can be considered as an insult or even a threat.

, Japanese people are very conscientious about spreading germs. This is especially true in major cities like Tokyo because a lot of public places are very crowded and contagious illness can spread easily.


Don’t blow your nose in public places. Find a bathroom instead.
Cough into the crook of your arm rather than your hand so you cover more of your mouth.
If you have a cold, wearing a surgical mask so you don’t get others sick is considered polite., Japanese people generally like to leave a bit more space between them during conversations. Try to leave enough space so that if both conversants were to bow at the same time, there would be no risk of bumping heads.Touching is generally discouraged and can be perceived as overly familiar or aggressive. This includes common and benign western actions like patting someone’s shoulder., Bowing is the most common form of nonverbal communication. While bowing conventions are fairly elaborate, using two types of bows should suffice for a visitor.


A deep bow is often used when apologizing or meeting someone of a higher station. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist. Bend far enough so that your face is pointing toward the floor and hold the position for at least 2 full seconds before returning to the upright position.You should definitely perform a deep bow for an employer or anyone you deem to be particularly prestigious. Anyone that is substantially older than you is considered to be of higher station as well.A smaller bow is considered, to some extent, the equivalent of a handshake. Keep your legs and back straight and bend at the waist and return to your starting position quickly. It is proper for meeting people of similar age or station., Wearing shoes inside someone’s residence is not acceptable. It is customary to provide guests with slippers when they enter a home so it is unlikely you will have to walk barefoot or in socks.Some hotels, restaurants and other public establishments also require the removal of shoes. A good rule of thumb is to remove your shoes if you see tatami, woven bamboo floor mats, on the ground., In Japanese culture, gift-giving is very common and it is considered a necessary act of humility to politely refuse a gift the first time it is offered to you. Japanese people will expect this and will continue to offer, at which point you can accept it.A good way to respond the first time is “I am humbled by your generosity but I should not accept.”
Do not open the gift in the presence of the giver unless they specifically ask you to.
When offering a gift, show humility by saying “I would like to offer this small token” to avoid the appearance of bragging about your wealth or generosity.
Receive the gift with both hands out, not just one., Punctuality is extremely important in Japanese culture so showing up late to a meeting or event may indicate that you don’t respect the time of your companions.If you are late, offer a contrite apology.

, It is customary to provide dinner guests a bowl of fragranced water for washing hands and/or an oshibori, a moist hand towel.Some Japanese restaurants will not have napkins. Most Japanese people carry around a handkerchief and use it as a napkin for meals.

, Similar to western conventions, it is considered rude to eat or drink before everyone at the table has received their portion. While many westerners will not notice or pay much mind to someone eating early, it will be perceived more negatively in Japan.When receiving food, it is polite to say “itadakimasu,” which means “I gratefully receive.”When drinking from a communal pitcher, it is polite to offer to pour a drink for others before pouring your own.

, With more formal meals, the presentation and layout of food is important. Do not reorganize the food, utensils or plates in an improper fashion.When you aren’t using your chopsticks, place them on a holder, known as a hashioki, if it is available.
Always keep the rice bowl to the left of your plate and the soup bowl to the right.

, It is considered wasteful to put food on your plate and then not finish it. Take small portions at a time so you know won’t have too much to eat..


Spilling food on yourself or on the table is considered a severe form of bad table manners. It is customary to hold the plate or bowl underneath your chin as you take each bite."

, The official minimum age of sumo wrestling is 15. There is no rule on how old you can be.

, On the official website, it says sumo wrestlers do not have to be a minimum or maximum weight. But, the bigger you are, the more you can knock people down. 

, Don't be fooled by how big they are. They have flexible muscles, strong arms, and stable legs. You must be ready to practice every day.

, When you become a sumo wrestler, you will wear it all the time. This uniform is a loincloth and your hair in a certain style. It is called a chonmage or an Edo-era samurai ponytail.

, If living in a live-in sumo school, you must get up at 5 in the morning to practice. This goes on into 12 in the afternoon, and sometimes longer. You must do your own chores, clean, and you only get a lunch break in between practice. And, to get above the entry level takes years of practice. But, you may drop out at any time.

, Some of sumo wrestlers' practices include slamming yourself against wood, and slamming your chest on various things. Also, you must be fine with scratches and bruises.

, If you are good enough, you will move on to where it all started. Japan!

Obtain all necessary licenses and documentation.,
Look for a bike.,
Look for bikes from a roadside mechanic.,
Know what your budget will be.,
Have a general look over the bike.,
Check over the frame.,
Look closely at the tyres.,
Check the electronics.,
Investigate the suspension.,
Take the bike for a test ride, do all the gears work smoothly, do the brakes work?,
Any problems you are likely to find are usually fixed extremely cheaply by most mechanics but walk away from something falling to bits.,
Make sure you get the appropriate paperwork with the bike.",How to Buy a Motorbike in Vietnam," In order to ride legally in Vietnam, you'll need a valid Vietnam motorcycle license, ownership papers for the motorcycle you're riding, and insurance, which you can buy cheaply from the same agent where you got your license.;
, Check online at sites like Craigslist or Travelswop, which also has information about the more common bikes available in Vietnam.

, Just bear in mind that they will add their commission on, so don’t pay too much. Buying from a dealer in secondhand bikes doesn’t guarantee anything either. Make sure you check the bike thoroughly before buying even from someone who appears honest and reputable.


There are a few people trading bikes in Saigon and Hanoi due to the popularity of the route, not all of them are honest! However choosing the ones with a good online reputation can save you gambling and buying the wrong bike from a backpacker.

, In terms of budget, you should be able to get a suitable steed for $300 US. Don't spend much more than this on something secondhand as it will generally be overpriced unless it’s very new. Bikes in the 50 to 125cc range, larger capacity bikes are available but unless you have the appropriate Vietnamese motorbike license, you will draw unwanted attention from the police.

, Does it look clean? Is anything hanging off? Paint jobs range from clean to Hammerite with a brush but will you be able to sell it again? If it looks like its been through the wars, then the next potential owner will spot that too and probably walk away or offer peanuts.

, Is it straight? Any suspicious looking welding? A small amount of surface rust is OK but have a good poke at areas of rust that look like they have been painted over with a pen or similar prodding device. If the pen goes through anywhere, then walk away.

, What are the tyres like? Do they have tread on them? Are they inflated? Check on the sides of the tyre for any cracks or bits missing.

, Do the electronics work? Check everything twice, front light (dipped and main beam), back light (headlight on and brake light), indicators, horn, started motor (if fitted).

, Does the suspension work smoothly, you should be able to bounce the bike without hearing any strange noises. The suspension should return to the extended position after being pressed down without any subsequent bouncing.

, Any strange noises? Is the acceleration smooth and progressive? Does the bike cruise ok on a constant throttle? Lights, indicators and horn still working?


Also grab the wheel at each side when checking bearings and alternately try to rock it (pull with one hand and push with the other) do this for both front and back wheels.
Check the rubbers here for any movement this can lead to loose handlebars while riding it makes the upper pinch bolts come loose too.

, If you find any minor issues then politely tell the seller about them and factor them into your offer price. Here is a small price guide (in VND).

Front tyre – 120,000
Rear tyre – 150,000
Oil change – 80,000
Small wiring fix e.g. headlight not working – 20,000
Rear wheel hub – 250,000
Wheel bearings (per wheel) – 50,000
Indicator – 30,000
Inline fuel filter and carb clean – 70,000

, Unlike the UK you don’t need to transfer the bike into your name. You should receive a blue ownership card (usually laminated) when you hand over the cash, ask to see it beforehand and make sure all the details match the bike in question.


If you don’t have this card and the police stop you or you are involved in an incident then you will need to pay a hefty bribe or your bike will be confiscated.
Keep it on your person at all times when you are riding your bike. It should look like this and DO NOT be fobbed off with anything else, being offered something that looks different with an explanation like ‘This is the old type of paper’ is rubbish.

According to Tran Dinh Ky, director of King Quang Trung museum in Quy Nhon Town, Tay Son battle drumming is a special genre which blends military and artistic elements and is based on the traditional sound systems such as ho, xang and xe. It is extremely difficult to express the “soul” of Tay Son battle drumming, which explains why few artists can perform it well.

, Travel with a friend where possible or better still join a tour if you are not a seasoned traveler. Tour guides know the ropes and will be able to assist you where necessary.

Research the current exchange rate prior arriving in Moscow.,
Decide how much currency you wish to exchange.,
Find a convenient conversion agent: exchange office, bank, or ATM.,
ATM machines are familiar and convenient agents for currency exchange.",How to Convert Your Currency in Moscow," If you are aware of the exchange rate, then you will know exactly how many rubles you will receive upon conversion.;
, You will need to consider the length of your trip, as well as your personal itinerary. Will you be shopping, eating out, using public transportation, etc? You will be charged an exchange commission for each transaction, so it is a good idea to plan ahead.

,


Exchange offices can be easily found in post offices, train stations, hotel receptions, on street corners and surrounding large tourism hot spots. Most exchange offices offer very reasonable exchange rates in order to stay competitive. Rates may vary, as will agent commission charges, however both are required to be clearly displayed. Most exchange offices are open 24 hours, but many require a valid passport.
Banks in Moscow are also able to exchange foreign currency as needed. Banking hours are typically from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday. Take notice of their posted exchange rate, as it may vary from bank to bank in your home country and in Moscow.
Count the dispensed rubles and confirm that the conversion has followed the proper exchange rate before ending your transaction.

, Moscow's ATMs have instructions available in several languages and operate using a 4-digit PIN. ATMs typically have the most competitive exchange rates, but you will almost certainly be charged a transaction fee and/or a foreign-exchange surcharge for each transaction. Also, as a security precaution you must notify your bank that you will be traveling in Russia prior to your departure.

Prepare a few forms of payment like a credit card or debit card.,
Budget for your trip.,
Set aside at least a whole afternoon, if not a full day, to shop through GUM in Red Square.,
Travel to Red Square.,
Shop large clothing stores like Zara on the first floor.,
Browse the flagship stores and luxury shops on the first and second floors of the arcade.,
Eat at the Gastronome 1 on the first floor.,
Visit the third floor to browse the Russian fashion lines.,
Study the architecture.,
Take pictures.",How to Shop at GUM in Moscow," If you want to use cash, be sure to convert your home currency into the Russian ruble.


Call your bank to tell them you will be traveling to Moscow to avoid your credit card or debit card being declined. As a matter of procedure, banks flag any purchases that are made far away from home in case of theft. Usually, calls have to be made to reactivate the card before making further purchases. Failure to do this may mean that your shopping trip to GUM will be cut short.;
, Although GUM is known for a variety of shops, it is a mall filled with flagship and hard-to-find stores. It is not known for value; it is known for designer goods that warrant higher prices than most shops. It is comparable to the Via Veneto in Italy or Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.

, It is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

, Red Square is in the heart of Moscow in the innermost circular road, called Boulevard Ring. This ring was built in the 1820s in the same place as the 16th century walls. The road on the other side of GUM is called Vetoshny Lane. Plan your route from the hotel or the airport in advance because none of the Metro train signs are in English. Look for signs or literature that point to the Kremlin or Lenin's tomb as well, because these sit across from GUM.

, Beware that although their goods are less expensive than the luxury goods, you may pay more at GUM than in the same store at another location in Russia.

, GUM houses Emporio Armani, Guess, Swatch, Burberry, Hugo Boss and many more designer stores. If you can't afford to spend much money on shopping, be sure to window shop instead.

, There are Russian restaurants as well as food from all over the world. Eat amongst the Russian elite or pick up fast food before continuing your shopping trip.

, If you are coming from outside of the country, you can find something that will be unique at home. For example, visit Zolotaya Strekoza or Stolovaya. You will also find the majority of the technology stores and household product stores on the third level arcade. Stop by the Cafe Festivalnoe, a traditionally designed Soviet cafe.

, The beautiful building merits more than a glance. It has ornate steel framework, limestone, granite, and a glass roof. It has been notably compared to 19th century train stations in Paris and London.

, Record the beautiful art and architecture, the abundance of luxury goods and the Russian charm. GUM has become a cult shopping experience through reinvention and word of mouth.

Use the state’s database.,
Determine the definition of unclaimed property.,
Know your rights.",How to Find Unclaimed Property in the State of Washington1," The state of Washington has a convenient online database where you can look to see whether the state is holding property that belongs to you or someone else.


Go to: http://ucp.dor.wa.gov/. You will find spaces to enter your personal information to start the search.
Put in your first and last name or your business name or a reference number if you’ve already started a claim. Click the blue search button or returning user button.
Unclaimed property in Washington comes from more than just the government too. It can also come from banks, retailers, credit unions, utility companies, insurance companies, and various corporations.
The Department of Revenue is the holder of the unclaimed property and, as such, administers the program in order to seek rightful owners and return the property to them.;
, The state of Washington has very precise definitions for what counts as unclaimed property. Don’t waste your time looking for something that doesn’t count.


Typical unclaimed property in Washington includes such things as bank accounts, proceeds from insurance, stocks bonds or mutual funds, safe deposit box contents, utility and phone company deposits, and uncashed checks.
Uncashed checks can include payroll checks, insurance payments or even traveler’s checks. Unclaimed property is defined as property being held by an organization that has not had contact with the owner for an extended period of time. Generally, it takes three years for property to be considered unclaimed.
In Washington, real estate, cars, and most other physical property does not count as unclaimed property under the unclaimed property law, which is Chapter 63.29 in the state statutes., Unclaimed property laws are very specific in Washington. The power of the law protects your property until it can be returned to you.There is no time limit for filing a claim to receive it back. Owners or their heirs can file to regain property that was reported since 1955. Claims are updated once a week. You might not have received a notice from the company that owed you the money if the amount was small.
The one exception to this lack of a time limit for filing is that the state might auction off the contents of safety deposit boxes that remain unclaimed for five years.
There’s a lot of unclaimed property out there. More than $1 billion in unclaimed property was turned over to the Washington Department of Revenue, dating back to 1955. In 2013 alone, the department received $138 million in unclaimed property, an amount that is on the rise.

Go to the Incredible India website.,
Understand how to communicate with the locals.",How to Prepare for a Trip to India," India is a large country, and most people spend a few weeks traveling in order to enjoy its beauty and varied cultures. However, its infrastructure isn't of the best quality in all regions, so you should always plan your itinerary before you leave.


If you're traveling with an organized group, you can skip this step as the travel organization will take care of everything.






For all others, make sure you have a good and current map of the country and reserve any flights, boat trips, train rides, and rental cars ahead of time.






Also make your hotel or hostel reservations before you embark on your India trip, or at the very least have a list of addresses where you can stay.





;
, You'll need a valid passport to travel, as well as a 6-month tourist visa for India.


You can apply for a passport at your local post office.






You can contact the Indian embassy in your country to apply for a tourist visa. You will be asked to supply a list of regions you'll be visiting, as well as addresses where you'll be staying.







, The vaccination requirements for the different regions of India may vary from time to time, so you should always discuss which immunizations you need before you travel, though usually tetanus, typhoid, and cholera are advised. You should allow up to 6 weeks for any vaccinations to take effect. Other medical issues to be prepared for are malaria and diarrhea.

, Though what you need to bring with you will vary greatly depending on the types of activities you plan to do and the areas you plan to visit, you should always bring enough clothes, sunscreen, insect repellent, a sunhat, a first aid kit, and a money belt.

, Though India is very affordable by Western standards, you should also realize that you'll need lots of cash, as many places don't accept credit cards or checks. Bring travelers' checks, which you can cash in at many stops along the way, and make a note to get rupees as soon as you land in India.

, The rule of thumb in India is to only drink bottled water, never eat uncooked foods, and never drink beverages with ice in them. If you live by this rule during your travels, you stand a better chance of not getting sick.

, This has a number of useful resources under the ""Trip Planner"" drop down menu that will help you plan your trip, including an extensive calendar of festivals so you can either find out what's going on while you're in India, or plan your trip around a certain festival. There are also more helpful tools under the tab ""Traveler Tools"" on the right sidebar of the page.

, As always when traveling, safety should be your primary concern. Most rickshaw drivers and vendors expect you to haggle over prices, but you should also remember to tip. In addition, never go anywhere with somebody you don't trust, or allow anybody to take care of your personal belongings.

""When in Rome, do as the Romans do."",
Anticipate culture shock, and have effective strategies to deal with it when it arises.,
Be patient with yourself and others.",How to Survive and Enjoy Being an Expatriate," Make sure you research your new country thoroughly. You will want to know all of their customs beforehand, so you don't accidentally make a cultural gaffe while you're there. Become very familiar with their food, art, lifestyle, national pastimes, and maybe even a bit of history if you're interested. And if the language spoken there is one other than your native one, for goodness' sake make sure you are able to speak it, at least passably. Not being able to communicate properly in your new country will result in disaster! All in all, knowing what to expect before you move to another country will greatly help lessen culture shock.


Trying out recipes from the country you're moving to might be fun, and it will give you a sense of what you will be eating when you are there.;
, Feeling disoriented is normal. Not knowing what to do is normal. Give yourself time to adjust to your new surroundings; don't jump in with both feet immediately. However, once you're settled in, it is a good idea to find something to occupy your time, such as a hobby. This will take your mind off your homesick feelings in a productive way, whereas moping around at home will give you more time to feel sorry for yourself. Some good ideas for this are:



Do yoga. This is very relaxing and has many health benefits.

Volunteering will make you feel good about yourself and keep you busy. It has the additional perk of enabling you to meet new people!

Play a musical instrument; sing; make up a song. Music is good for the soul.

Write a poem, story, article, or whatever you feel like. Keeping a journal is also a great idea.

, Other cultures make friends differently from ours. Try to respect them while still being yourself.

, Observe the locals and do what they do. For example ... you go to the post office and discover that there isn't a line. Everyone is just sort of jostling for position. You might feel uncomfortable at time and rather uneasy, but if you want to buy stamps and mail your packages, you'll just have to take a deep breath and join the crowd. This isn't always an easy thing to do. But either you adjust a bit to the new culture, or you simply won't be able to function as well as you would like.

, When you are fresh off of the airplane, you will be very excited and enthusiastic about the adventure you are about to have in a foreign land. Everything about your new country will seem exotic, new, and wonderful; this is known by some as the ""rose-coloured glasses"" phase, similar to the phase that newlyweds experience. However, as you adjust to your new country and live there for a while, this initial happiness wears off and some negative feelings start to creep in. You might decide that you're sick and tired of this country and you want to go home, only you can't go home. This is called culture shock; it is completely normal, and there are many others who have gone through it before. Some people try to cope with culture shock by re-creating their home country. They try to only associate with people from their country. They only cook foods from their culture and eat at restaurants that serve this familiar food. They want their children only to play with other children from their country. This strategy is destined to fail. Repeat this mantra to yourself ... ""I cannot recreate my home country and I will only make myself and others unhappy if I try"". There isn't a lot you can do about the feelings you have, and you certainly can't totally control your environment. What you can do is control your actions:


Try hard not to complain. Complaining only reinforces your negative feelings. Find ways to vent your feelings ... for example: mow your yard, mow your neighbor's yard, work out, pray, volunteer your time, etc. Find things about your new country that you like.
This may seem obvious, but just remember, your new country is not your home country. Their customs are not based on the tradition you are used to. Even though their customs may sometimes seem difficult or silly to you, this is how things have been done for a long time there, and they aren't going to change for you.
Find things about your new country that you like. This is especially effective if these things cannot be found in your home country. If you admire a unique aspect of your country's food, culture, or lifestyle, make sure you get out there and enjoy it, and remember that the experience wouldn't be possible if you were back at home. For example, if you are living in Japan, you might find that the sushi you can find there is better than anything you could ever pick up where you used to live. Even little things like that can help you adjust to culture shock.

, Love yourself. This experience of living abroad can be a rich and rewarding time, if you let it.

If you arrive between June and September, it may be worth checking out the campus residences at Dublin City University, which are let out to the public while students are away on summer break. The basic rooms have (wired) internet access, own bathroom and shared kitchen facilities. From DCU it's a 5-10 minute bus trip into downtown Dublin.;
, In order to successfully navigate to job interviews, government offices etc. you will need a decent map book. A recommended book is ""Tourist Dublin Street finder"", a light blue cover, A5 size paperback, you will find this at many stores on O'Connell Street.

, You will need to present your passport and any documentation confirming your right to work in Ireland. The GNIB is based at 13/14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2. Heading south on O'Connell Street, cross over the bridge and Burgh Quay follows the river to your left. The Opening hours for the Bureau are Monday to Thursday 8am to 10pm, Friday 8.30am to 4pm. Enter the building and take a queue ticket from the machine. Typically you will have to wait a few hours before you are called, so don't be afraid to explore Dublin and have something to eat while you wait (after checking your current position in the queue, of course).

Important: you MUST go to the office nearest your address of residence, you will be turned away otherwise. You will need to take your passport and proof of address.

Keep an open mind.,
Make an effort to learn the local language.,
Get acquainted with the social conduct of your new environment.,
Do not take cultural familiarity or knowledge at face-value.,
Make sure you get to know people in your new environment.,
Try to achieve a sense of stability in your life.,
Most importantly, maintain a sense of humor!",How to Overcome Culture Shock in a Foreign Country," Do not automatically perceive anything that is different to be ""wrong"". Withholding judgment will allow you to be an objective observer and will facilitate the process of cross-cultural understanding. Also, if you are going to a country with which you know close to nothing about, do a little background information. As you learn about the country in which you are going to, keeping an open mind is necessary, and, who knows, you may find the reason for something you may not understand.;
, This increases your communication skills and it helps you to integrate with the local community. It also demonstrates your interest in the new country.

, Do not assume or interpret behavior from your own cultural perspective or ""filter"". Behavior is not data. For example, Americans often use the phrase ""How are you?"" to mean ""hello"" or ""I acknowledge your presence as I pass you in the hall."" A foreigner may wonder why Americans don't respond in detail to this question about one's well-being. Thus they may interpret the behavior of walking away before one has a chance to respond to the question to be ""uncaring"", ""superficial"" or even ""rude"". An American knows otherwise and would probably not be offended that someone did not take the time to respond to this question. Remember: If in doubt, check it out!

, Even as you become more savvy about rituals, customs and protocol in your new environment, be careful not to attribute an explanation or rationale to what you now believe you know. A little bit of knowledge can be misleading. Psychologist Geert Hofstede wrote that 'culture' is like an onion that can be peeled, layer by layer, to reveal the content. It takes a long time to really understand a culture in its social and historical context.

, Respectfully ask questions, read newspapers, and attend a variety of festivals and events.

, Establishing a routine will give you a feeling of safety.

, Don't be too hard on yourself if you make a cultural gaffe or don't know what to do in a social situation. Laugh at yourself and others will laugh with you. Most individuals will admire your tenacity and effort to understand their ways, especially if you are devoid of judgment and cultural comparisons that subtly and perhaps unconsciously convey a veil of superiority.

If a U.S. employer wants to hire you, then they can begin the process by filing a petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).


As the employee, you don’t begin the process. Instead, your employer files Form I-140 on your behalf.Employer sponsorship allows you to stay permanently in the U.S. This permanent status is called a “green card.”;
, Family members in the U.S. might also be able to sponsor you if you don’t have an employer willing to do so. Your family member starts the process by filing a Form I-130 petition with the U.S. government.Once the petition is approved, you go through consular processing in your home country.


A U.S. citizen can immediately petition for a spouse, unmarried child under 21, or parent to move permanently to the U.S.A U.S. citizen can also petition for a married child, unmarried child over 21, or sibling. However, they don’t have priority and must wait for a visa to become available before they can move to the U.S.
If your family member is a green card holder, then they can petition their spouse or unmarried children of any age to immigrate to the U.S. Generally, there is a waiting period., You can obtain permission to move to the U.S. in other ways. If you don’t know which applies, then you should meet with a lawyer in your country to talk about your options. Here are a few:



Self-petition if you have extraordinary ability. People with outstanding abilities in the arts, sciences, education, business, or athletics can petition for a green card.Non-immigrant work visas. These are temporary visas that allow you to live in the U.S. for a certain amount of time. When the visa expires, you need to leave. Nonimmigrant visa are available for people who work in specialty occupations that require at least a bachelor’s degree, as well as for people of extraordinary ability.Your employer will file a Form I-129 petition on your behalf.

Intra-company transfers. A business may transfer a manager or executive from a foreign office to a U.S. office. Your employer will file Form I-129 to start the process.Tourist visa. You can only stay in the US on a tourist visa for six months.You shouldn’t get a tourist visa if you intend to stay longer. You also can’t get a tourist visa if you intend to search for work.

Student visa. Talk to your school about whether you qualify for a student visa. They can help you with the process.

, You can apply for a visa by contacting your local U.S. embassy or consulate. You may also apply online at https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/. You will need the following documents to complete form DS-160:passport
travel itinerary
dates of your last visits to the United States
resume or CV
your I-129 (if you are getting a nonimmigrant work visa)
SEVIS ID (if you are a student)
additional information if requested

, The U.S. Department of State processes all paperwork. The State Department’s National Visa Center will review the paperwork and schedule an interview with you.NVC will schedule the interview when a visa becomes available for you. Accordingly, you might have to wait a long time.

, Before the U.S. will give you a visa, you may have to undergo a medical exam, receive immunization shots, and complete other tasks. You want to give yourself plenty of time before your consular interview to complete everything.


Now is a good time to make sure your passport is valid. You won’t be able to travel if it isn’t. Go through all passports for your family members and update any that are nearing expiration., You will finish processing at a Consulate or Embassy. At the interview, you will review your application with a consular official. This official will check your financial, criminal, and medical records. Remember to always tell the truth to the consular official.If you are approved, you will be told when to return to pick up your visa.

, Begin the search early. Depending on where you are moving to, it could take you some time to find something affordable. Housing costs in the U.S. are generally cheaper than in many European countries. However, housing in cities like New York or San Francisco is very expensive.Housing is advertised on the Internet. You can find housing on Craigslist or other websites.
You can also hire a realtor to find housing for you.You might want to use a realtor only if you intend to buy a house or if you want a furnished executive apartment.
If you have pets, make sure the apartment allows them. Not all apartments in the U.S. do.

, You can obtain a short-term visa to visit the United States if you want to check out apartments or houses in person. You can obtain a tourist visa by applying online. Work with the landlord to schedule a time to view the apartment.


Note how clean and safe the building is. Are the stairs and hallways full of trash? Is the lobby dirty? If so, then the landlord might not be diligent.Think about taking pictures of each place you see so that you can remember what they look like when you are back home.
Pay attention to the neighborhood. Some neighborhoods in cities are safer than others. Look to see if there is graffiti on apartment buildings or alleyway walls. Also check how many apartments have iron bars, which is a sign of an unsafe neighborhood.
If you have children, also check how good the local schools are.

, If you rent an apartment, you’ll need to fill out an application. You can pick this up from the landlord when you look at the place. If you can’t visit, then ask the landlord to mail it to you. A typical application asks for the following:personal information
Social Security Number
Driver’s license number
employment information, including proof of income (such as a pay stub or employment offer that states your salary)
references

, Apartments leases typically run for 12 months.The lease should cover what you can and can’t do while living in the apartment. Be sure to read the lease thoroughly and agree to all terms before signing.


You also can expect to pay the first month’s rent and a security deposit soon after signing the lease.
Keep a copy of the lease for your records.

, You might want to wait to perform your housing search until you actually arrive in the U.S. In that case, temporary housing might work for you. There is usually a good supply of short-term housing available in large cities.


Also think about AirBnb. This is a marketplace for short-term rentals. You can find and request rooms on the website., Unless you are relocating from Canada or Mexico, it will be difficult to transport large amounts of furniture to your new home in the U.S. Accordingly, you should decide what you absolutely must take with you. Once you settle on these items, create a checklist so that you will remember them on moving day.You might want to bring clothes and footwear. Remember that the U.S. is a big country with different climates. Hawaii is warm all year, whereas northern states like Maine, Minnesota, and Alaska have very cold winters.
Think about renting storage for what you don’t need. Alternately, you could give it away. You can buy furniture in the U.S. for less money than it will cost to transport your belongings.

, If you intend to move furniture or other belongings, then you should begin researching personal moving companies. Call them up and ask for quotes.After comparing quotes, you should call the movers and schedule a day to come pick up your items.
Get any instructions they may have for packing items.

, Before leaving your home country, you should gather copies of important documents. You will probably need them at some point in the U.S. Get certified (official) copies of the following:


your birth certificate
birth certificates for anyone in your family
adoption records, if you adopted a child
marriage license
divorce decree
transcripts from your children’s schools
medical and dental records for all family members, Go to your post office and tell them your new address. Ask them if mail can be forwarded. Also contact businesses directly and let them know your new address., You should find a nearby bank and open an account. You will want a checking account with a debit card. Many places in the U.S. accept debit and credit cards, so you don’t often need cash. Getting a checking account will allow you to write checks to cover your expenses, such as your rent and utilities.


Each bank will need to see different information from you. Think about talking to a branch representative and asking what you will need.You can gather the information and then return to open the account.
Generally, you need to present your immigration documents, proof of a physical address (such as your lease), your passport, and a Social Security Number (if you have one).
Some banks are located inside and outside the U.S.: Citibank, HSBC, Barclays, etc. If you have an account with them, then they can help you set up a U.S. account.

, Check with your landlord about what utilities you need to turn on. Typically, you need to create an account for the following utilities:electricity
gas
water
heat
telephone
Internet
cable

, Find the nearest school district and contact the principal’s office. If you don’t know which district your children should attend, then stop into your city or county government’s office. Children are usually guaranteed a seat in their district, which is based on where you live.


In the U.S., children typically start kindergarten at age five. However, many schools also now offer a pre-Kindergarten, which is for children ages three and four.
To register in public school, you must typically present a copy of the child’s birth certificate or passport, immunization records, and any prior transcripts.Call the school directly to find out exactly what you need.
You can also enroll your children in private school, which you must pay for. You can find private schools by looking online. The application process varies. Since your child isn’t guaranteed a seat in private school, you should begin the process as soon as possible—even before you leave home.

, A Social Security Number is required if you intend to work in the U.S. This number is used to report how much money you made and to determine if you are eligible for Social Security benefits, which are retirement benefits. You don’t need the number simply to get a driver’s license or open a bank account.You could have applied for the Social Security card when you applied for your visa. Check your application to see if you did.
If you need to apply in the U.S., then visit your nearest Social Security Administration office. Wait 10 days after you arrive. You must present proof that you are authorized to work in the U.S. For example, you can show a permanent resident card or other document. You also need to show your birth certificate or a passport.
Call SSA at 1-800-772-1213 if you have questions.

, You need legal permission to drive in the U.S. The permission you need will depend on how long you are in the U.S. Consider the following:If you are a short-term visitor, then get an International Driving Permit (IDP) from your country’s motor vehicle department. The U.S. does not issue these permits.
If you are becoming a U.S. resident, then you’ll need to get a license from the state where you are living. Contact your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to find out requirements. Visit https://www.usa.gov/motor-vehicle-services and click on your state.

, In the U.S., laws can be set by the federal government, each state government, and local governments. You should familiarize yourself with the laws. Remember that ignorance of the law is rarely a defense.


Gambling is one area where the U.S. differs from many other nations. Gambling is tightly regulated in the U.S. Sports gambling is illegal, and other forms of gambling (such as slot machines) are legal only in certain areas.
Learn local regulations, such as whether you need to clean off the sidewalk in front of your apartment or house after a snow storm.If you don’t know if something is legal, ask a neighbor or stop into your local government office.

, You have to get a dog license in many places. Before you can get a license, your dog must be vaccinated against rabies. Cats generally do not need to be licensed, but you should think about getting them vaccinated as well.


Hold onto your proof of vaccination. You may need to present this document to your city or county government when you license your dog.
You should also think about having your pet sterilized. Typically, your licensing fee will be lower if your dog has been spayed or neutered.

, The U.S. has no official language.However, almost everyone speaks English and business is conducted in English.


It’s okay if you aren’t great at English. You have plenty of time to practice your speaking skills.
You might want to take a class. Many colleges offer English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.
However, the best way to learn may be simply to get out and talk to people.

Get a passport.,
Check the visa requirements for your destination.,
Receive the recommended immunizations.,
Purchase health and travel insurance.,
Decide where you will stay.,
Determine the best way to get around.",How to Prepare for International Travel1," To get a passport, you need a minimum of two passport-size photos, your birth certificate, and one other form of identification (preferably that proves your citizenship in your country of origin). If you have a passport, be sure it has at least 6 months left before it expires. Some countries will not issue a visa if you have less than 6 months remaining before the expiration date.If you don’t already have a passport, you’ll need to allow 4-6 weeks for processing, so be sure to start this process ahead of time.;
, Countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program do not require citizens of reciprocating countries to pre-arrange a visa. However, other countries may require you to apply for a tourist visa (and get that visa approved) before visiting.This can be a costly and time-consuming step, so be sure to get it out of the way ahead of time.
Some countries require that tourists pay entrance and exit fees, so find out if this is applicable to your trip and be prepared to pay the fees.U.S. citizens can visit the website for the U.S. Department of State to find out the visa requirements for traveling to foreign countries.

, You may need to begin immunization injections many months in advance. Immunizations are usually optional but recommended for tourist travel in certain parts of the world. For some countries you need no immunizations at all.Check out the Center for Disease Control website to learn which immunizations are recommended or required based on your destination.

, If your health insurance policy doesn’t cover you while abroad, it’s wise to purchase health insurance that will be accepted in your destination country, just in case something should happen. Similarly, if your trip ends up getting cancelled or postponed, purchasing travel insurance ahead of time can save you money, time, and a lot of hassle., You may choose to stay with friends or relatives, or book a hotel or hostel while on your trip. Though it’s possible to make these decisions last-minute, you’ll feel more prepared if you have sorted out these details ahead of time. Research places to stay online and read reviews from other guests to find the best spot for your money., Depending on the location, you may be able to walk, ride a bike, drive a car, or take a boat or train to get around your destination. It’s a good idea to look into this beforehand, so you know, for instance, if you’ll need a hotel close to the train station, or how to get a ticket for the subway.

Many countries do not recognize a driver’s license from another country, so if you plan to drive while on your trip you’ll need to obtain an International Driving Permit. In the U.S., you can do so through AAA or the National Auto Club."

Respect local customs by accepting frugal conditions.",How to Solo Travel to Bhutan," Independent travel is not allowed in Bhutan, meaning that you need to hire one of the 235 officially endorsed Bhutanese tour operators to guide you in your travels. For the independent, adventurous tourist, this can seem like a hassle, but there are a few upsides to this stipulation: once you hire your tour operator, they’ll help you obtain your visa, as well as book your accommodations and transportation.


The official list of approved tour operators may be found at http://www.tourism.gov.bt/directory/tour-operator, but experienced travelers recommend that you take this list with a grain of salt. As many of these tour operators have been known to charge hidden fees and demonstrate a lack of professionalism, consult tourist sites and forums, such as virtualtourist, lonelyplanet, or worldnomads, before booking a tour operator.Be sure to check how your solo status affects your prospective tour operator’s daily rates. Some operators give a discount for parties of three or less, while others charge more steeply for solitary travelers.;
, In order to travel to Bhutan, you’ll need to pay for your trip’s expenses beforehand. This includes a minimum $200 tariff—covering accommodations, food costs, guide services, transportation, and driver—for each day of your visit, as well as the required visa and any additional surcharges your tour operator sees fit to include.Read your tour operator’s list of charges carefully! As one traveler noted, his tour operator bragged of not tacking on additional local fees as other operators do. Upon further review of their policies, though, the bemused traveler found that he could expect to pay an additional $400 throughout his trip on “tips” to operator employees, such as drivers.In addition to covering your trip expenses, the $200 tariff includes a $65 royalty that goes to the Bhutanese government’s education, healthcare, and welfare services.

, Unless you’re a national of India, Bangladesh, or Maldives, you’ll need to get a visa in order to travel to Bhutan. Fortunately, this process involves minimal fuss, as you simply fill out an online form and send a photocopy of your passport to your tour operator. The Tourism Council of Bhutan (TCB) will process your visa within 72 hours after your full payment—made to your tour operator and passed on to the TCB—has been received.The visa costs an additional $40, which you’ll pay for at the same time as you pay for your daily tariff and any additional tour operator surcharges.

, Once you’ve obtained visa clearance, you can purchase your airplane tickets to Bhutan. Drukair flies into Paro airport—about 34 miles (54 km) fromthe capital city of Thimphu—via India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, and Singapore. Though Bhutan borders China on one side, the border with China is closed, so you can’t fly into Bhutan from there.When planning your trip, be aware that flights into and out of Paro airport operate only during daytime hours.
Due to harsh and wildly fluctuating weather patterns, tourist boards recommend travelers book non-restricted or flexible tickets which allow for passengers to rebook canceled flights or alter plans according to weather conditions.

, Just because you’ve already paid for your accommodations, transportation, guide services, and food, doesn’t mean you won’t need money during your trip. In addition to any tips your tour operator requires, you should expect to pay hefty fees for traditional items, such as Layan headdresses or Bhutanese fabrics.The currency in Bhutan is the ngultrum (BTN), and you should expect to use cash or traveler’s cheques rather than credit cards. Indian rupees are also accepted, but monthly rupee withdrawals are limited to 10,000., Perhaps the most popular cultural attractions in Bhutan are the local Tshechus—festive religious celebrations which take place in every village across Bhutan. In these three-day festivals, villagers don colorful finery, dance and sing with masks and costumes, and consume elaborate feasts of traditional cuisine and drink.You can find a calendar of all the planned Tshechus in Bhutan on the TCB website, but be sure to ask your tour operator to include any specific Tschchus or other events in your itinerary.
Some tourists recommend avoiding the bigger festivals, such as the Thanbi Mani festival, as these tend to be swamped with foreign tourists., Whether you’re feasting at a Tshechu or eating at a tiny, local café, you’ll find that chilis are the invariable trademark of Bhutanese cuisine. They’re so fundamental to Bhutanese cuisine that most Bhutanese natives consider spiciness to be an essential flavor in all dishes and meals. Pair your chili-spiked rice and Momos (spicy pork dumplings) with Ara, the traditional rice wine, and you’ll soon be dining like a local!In larger cities, you’ll also find abundant western and Indian cuisine if you need a break from the peppery plethora of native cuisine.

, Bhutan is home to over forty Buddhist monasteries, many of them set against a stunning natural landscapes and views. The Taktsang Dzong or Tiger’s Nest, for example, dangles precariously from a 3,000 foot cliff, while the Punakha Dzong perches at the scenic confluence of two major rivers.Just be sure to check with your guide regarding photography policies when inside the dzongs—the Bhutanese word for a combination fortress and monastery—and other religious sites. While shots of the exterior and architecture are always permitted, indoor filming is forbidden inside some of these buildings.Double-check your outfit before heading into these religious sites, as long sleeves and pants are expected in dzongs, monasteries, and temples., Bhutan offers a wealth of mountain ranges and valleys perfectly suited to inspiration-seeking photographers and avid hikers alike. To this day, some of their mountain passes can only be reached by foot, so it’s the perfect retreat for the world-weary solo traveler looking to get some quality alone time and inspiration.


Though Bhutan’s jagged mountain ranges would seem a mountain climber’s paradise, mountaineering is actually forbidden. According to local legend, many of the mountain peaks are home to the mountain gods, and it’s considered a sign of disrespect to these gods to climb them., There are more than a dozen languages spoken in Bhutan, with natives speaking such languages as Dzonghka, Lepcha, Nepali, and Tshangla. Fortunately, the majority of the Bhutanese also speak English and are known to be generally friendly and open with curious—and polite!—tourists. Mingling with the locals can be especially easy and enlightening as a solo traveler, so don’t be shy about asking questions and starting a friendly conversation!In any case, your tour operator will provide you a licensed interpreter who can help you to navigate the country and communicate with locals.
While Bhutanese people are typically amiable, they can be touchy about discussing domestic political affairs, such as the attitude toward Nepalese-descended Bhutanese, so be tactful and reserved with your opinions if the talk turns to politics., Most of the towns and popular tourist sites lie below 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), so it's unlikely you'll have to deal with altitude sickness for the majority of your stay. If you’re hiking one of the Himalayan peaks in the country, though, you should be sure to hike gradually and drink plenty of water in order to acclimatize.If you begin to display signs of altitude sickness, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, or headache, tell your guide immediately and stay at your current altitude for 24 to 48 hours.

, If you’re planning to trek long distances while in Bhutan, your wanderings could take you weeks or days from the nearest medical facility. In the event of a fall or severe altitude sickness, your tour operator can arrange for helicopter evacuation through private companies, but the cost will be extremely high. Cover all your bases and give yourself peace of mind by checking with your insurance company before embarking to ensure that emergency services abroad are covered by your carrier.It’s also possible to contract dengue fever and malaria while in Bhutan, particularly in the southern belt districts and along the border with India. The treatment costs and risk of these conditions are relatively low, though, so simply protect yourself against mosquito bites with repellant and long, thick clothing., The government of Bhutan advises all tourists get vaccinated for tetanus, typhoid, and hepatitis A before arrival, and additionally that any at-risk individuals receive vaccines for hepatitis B, Japanese Encephalitis, influenza, and rabies. Bhutan also faces relatively severe problems with tuberculosis, so you should undergo a TB test before and after your trip.In addition to obtaining the government-recommended vaccines and tests above, you should visit your doctor four to six weeks before departure in order to receive any further preventative treatment or vaccines relevant to your personal health history., Bhutan is a remarkably safe place for the solo traveler, but you should take the same, basic precautions you would take anywhere in order to make yourself less vulnerable to petty crime and common hazards. Take care not to approach potentially rabies-infected dogs, keep electronics out-of-sight and locked-up, and try to avoid wandering alone in the city at night, especially if you’re a solo female traveler.Stray dogs are usually more of a barking, howling nuisance than an actual safety hazard. Bring earplugs in order to sleep soundly while the canine inhabitants of Bhutan engage in their nocturnal noise-making., Tap water in Bhutan is untreated, so avoid ice cubes and water from the faucet in order to prevent the contraction of nasty viruses and bacteria. Be careful, too, about any salad that could have been rinsed in tap water or fresh fruit unprotected by a natural peel.Bottled water is widely available in Bhutan, but check the seal before taking a sip to make sure it’s pure., In 2004, Bhutan took the bold step of banning all tobacco sales within its borders. If you’re a cigarette devotee and can’t see yourself traveling solo around Bhutan without your favorite smokes, you can bring up to 200 cigarettes into the country for your own personal use. Just don’t think of selling to the natives! Foreigners nabbed for such transgressions can be charged with smuggling and given up to a three-year sentence.When bringing cigarettes into the country, be sure to keep your customs receipt. If you fail to produce this document when requested by police, you can be charged with smuggling.

, The export of all antiques in Bhutan is strictly prohibited. You can purchase cultural objects and artifacts, but they must be certified for sale and export by the Bhutanese government.When in doubt, ask your tour operator for clarification. If necessary, they can contact the Bhutanese Antiquities Department.

, As many advocates of ethical tourism and Bhutanese culture have noted, emulating or reproducing the luxury of other countries and foreign resorts means altering the traditional lifestyle and conditions of Bhutan. As a guest in this unique society, you should be respectful of local tradition and do your best to help preserve the customary way of life by accepting frugal conditions rather than asking for standards and amenities expected in your home country. In order to make sure money goes to local entrepreneurs rather than foreign companies, experts recommend staying in locally owned accommodations, asking your guide to take you to local cafes and markets, and buying artifacts from independent, native sellers.

Study the native language.,
Research the local atmosphere.,
Inquire about the local dress and customs.,
Find out local etiquette to avoid embarrassment.",How to Prepare for International Travel2," At the very least, you should know a few terms and phrases, such as “hello,” “please,” “thank you,” “my name is…” “what is your name?” and “where is the bathroom?” The more you can understand and speak the language, the better.You can take an introductory language course, purchase language-learning software, or get a language translation book before your trip.
You can also try a language-learning app, like Duolingo, which is free and perfect for learning on-the-go.

, Find an English language newspaper online for the country you are traveling to, then start reading about current events a month or so in advance. Familiarize yourself with sensitive issues.You can also find out about special events that may be taking place while you are there.

, Do research online or buy a guidebook to help you navigate through these issues. Some countries may be more modest, while others have less restrictions.For example, men may get stares if they wear short pants, which may be acceptable only for children in some regions.
For instance, if you are going to a country where most women dress modestly, you may offend someone by wearing a tank top.
In other regions, shorts and no top at all might be normal at a beach or sun bathing location.

, It’s important to learn the rules of dress, touch, table manners, and speech before you go to a foreign country. Don't offend your host by hugging upon arrival if that is not acceptable. Likewise, be ready for a kiss upon first meeting where that is expected.In some countries it is offensive to touch someone's spouse or children, so keep that in mind.
It’s also important to mind your body language. Find out which hand, head, foot, or face gestures might be offensive or misinterpreted.
Keep your mind open when things seem shocking or taboo. Be a respectful observer of the local culture, but not a judge.

Find out the international exchange rate.,
Research electrical standards in your destination country.,
Notify your bank of your trip.,
Add an international calling plan to your phone service.,
Make copies of your travel documents or itinerary.,
Pack wisely.",How to Prepare for International Travel3," You can find international exchange rates by searching for currency converters online. For example, you could search ""convert Nepalese rupees"" to find the rate of that soft currency. Do some calculations and become familiar with what the foreign currency equals in your home currency.You should carry some of the local cash on hand, but be sure to use an ATM or visit a bank, rather than paying exorbitant fees at conversion centers in the airport.It’s also a good idea to see how much things you may need or want (like coffee, a newspaper, a hotel room, a bottle of wine) cost in your destination country so you aren’t surprised upon arrival.

, Do an Internet search to determine if you may need a plug adapter and a converter. Many online travel sites list the type of plug you need.Things that heat up, such as a hair dryer, may not work correctly on the volts and cycles of a foreign country, even with a converter.
Computer batteries and handheld devices may also be affected by electrical conversion.

, Some banks or credit card companies may decline your card if they aren’t aware that you are in a foreign country. Call the customer service center and let them know where you are going and how long you will be staying in order to avoid and delays or declines., Many mobile phones will not work in locations other than your home country. Contact your service provider and inquire about international calling plans as well as data rates.Alternatively, you can purchase pre-paid calling cards before your trip and use a landline phone, such as in your hotel, to contact friends and family members back home.
You can also use free communication apps, such as Skype, FaceTime, and/or WhatsApp that use the Internet for phone and video calls as well as text messages.

, It’s a good idea to make color copies of your passport, plane or train tickets, hotel reservations, etc. If you only have digital copies of your itinerary, you may have trouble accessing them without an Internet connection.Keep copies of all your travel documents in your luggage. It’s also a good idea to provide a friend or family member with copies in case your luggage gets lost or stolen.

, Research the weather, terrain, and airline weight regulations before you travel. Overpacking for international travel is a mistake many people make, but lighter luggage is better. Choose items you really like, and plan on wearing them several times in different combinations.


Don’t forget to bring any medications you may need.

Decide where you want to go and what you want to see.,
Decide what your physical limitations are.,
Decide if you want to go by yourself, or with a spouse or friend, or if you want to plan a tour and find a group of 20 to 40 people to go with you.,
Start looking for tour companies, with your list of preferences in mind.",How to Take a Seniors European Tour1," Europe is an entire continent, so take into account that 1 to 2 countries is a good goal for your first European tour, because it does not require you to take extra flights or train rides. Seniors often choose to visit ancestral countries, art capitals like Florence or Paris, or places they have read about.;
, The senior range is usually between 50 and 90, and there is often a huge difference in mobility, vision and independence during those ages. List all the things that you require, such as airport transfers to your house, a wheelchair, a walker, a slow pace, all meals provided, audio tours, airport assistance and more.

, Tour companies are set up both ways; in some cases, you must find the people and advertise the trip, and in other cases, you can simply sign up for a trip that is coming.

, Keep in mind that you rarely find the perfect tour, but, with a little compromise, you can find one that you are happy with. The following types of tour companies are often used by senior or elderly travelers:


If you want to choose an education-focused tour, then look into Exploritas, formerly called Elderhostels. This organization works with universities to provide classes, seminars, sightseeing, and expert tour guides. They do cruises as well as land-based tours.
AARP, once the American Association of Retired Persons, endorses Grand European Travel. If you get this magazine, or you are a member, look on AARP.org for discounts off European tours. They have contracted with Grand European Travel to give discounts and create tours for seniors that are appropriately paced, have airport transfers, include first-class accommodations, most meals included, tour directors and local guides, entrance fees, first-class coaches and free gifts, such as books or passport wallets.
If you are looking for an all-inclusive tour, with almost everything included in the quote price, look for Grand Circle travel. Their tours focus on participants that are over 50 years old. This is a popular provider, especially for trips to Italy and for cruises.
If you are still very mobile and you want to have an adventure-based trip, get quotes from Eldertreks. This company designs trips that are unusual, or unlike most group travel. You can go farther afield, venturing to Eastern Europe, Scandinavia and smaller, less tourist-based countries.
If you want to travel with your children or grandchildren, then Grandtravel creates trips for this purpose. Unlike student travel programs that often let you take parents or grandparents along, these trips are created with the senior's pace in mind. The trip attempts to bridge the gap of interests between generations.

Research the places you want to visit.,
Research and book accommodations.,
Plan your transportation.,
Check for travel warnings and visa requirements.,
Understand the currency before you go.,
Get a universal electric converter plug if you will be using electronics.,
Plan to use your debit or credit card.",How to Prepare for European Travel," Read guidebooks, maps, websites, message boards and even novels set in the countries you plan to visit. Europe is a continent with many countries, all rich in culture and attractions. Many tourists plan trips to one country at a time, or to major attractions and cities over a period of 1-4 weeks or more.;
, There are many accommodation options in Europe, including budget hostels in major cities, house boats in Holland, camping in the Alps or a night in a castle. There are chain hotels, bed and breakfasts and rental houses. Research online and check message boards for information about places to stay. If you aren't sure where your travels may take you in Europe, many guidebooks have listings for hotels, and you can book as you go. In the summertime, it may be hard to get a hotel room. Be prepared to pay higher prices during peak season.

, Decide whether you want to see Europe by car, train, plane or bike. There are many options for getting to and around the European continent. Most people fly from their home country, then use a local form of transportation while in Europe. If you rent a car, you may need an International Driving Permit, so check with car rental agencies for requirements in each country you intend to drive. Another option is a European rail pass. There are discounts for multi-day passes, so check with the railway company you are originating your trip with. Places like the Netherlands offer cross-country biking tours.

, Contact the office of consular affairs in your country prior to a European trip. It is uncommon for European Union countries to have a travel warning, but it is best to check. Residents of countries in the Visa Waiver Program can get a visa upon arrival to your port of entry. Those from other countries may have to pre-arrange a tourist visa before travel.

, Many, but not all EU countries use the Euro. The UK, Sweden and Denmark still use their own currency as well as Euros. Other countries, like Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Ireland, Greece and Belgium use Euros. Euros can easily be exchanged in any country on the European continent.

, The electric outlets in the United Kingdom differ from those of continental Europe. Search the Internet for ""electrical standards in Europe"" for a list of receptacles. Europe is on a 220-240 volts/50 hertz standard. Be sure any electronics you bring are compatible.

, Call your bank and let them know your dates of travel. Be sure you have enough money in your debit account or available credit to cover your expenses. Check out a trip-advising website for ATM locations in the cities and places you will travel for when you need to withdraw cash.


Make sure your passport is valid for a minimum of 6 months past your return date.
Make two photocopies of all your credit cards, your driver's license and passport. Take copies with you and carry them separately from the originals. Keep copies at home and let someone know where to find them.
Print out copies of your reservations, confirmations, and itineraries.
Write down your embassy's address and phone number in each country you will visit. Each country has an embassy or consulate in its capital city. To find a list of embassies worldwide, go to your country's ""embassies"" website -- for example search ""Australian Embassies."" You will see the official home page listed indicated with a URL containing "".gov."" Search for ""Lost passport"" from the embassy website to get specific instructions on how to get a new passport while abroad.
Print out information from your country on what to do if your passport is lost or stolen.
Check with airlines for security and luggage regulations.
Write down contact information, such as hotels where you will stay or tour operators you will be using. Leave the information with someone back home.

Greek salads are especially tasty. Take advantage of world-famous Greek hospitality on display in restaurants large and small, as well as lively nightclubs and quiet bistros found throughout the country.;
, Greece is famous for its natural beauty, particularly along its many coastlines. Simple hikes can reveal marvelous vistas of white beaches and turquoise bays. Fishing boats and luxury liners take turns gliding in and out of quaint harbors on the country's numerous islands scattered throughout the Aegean Sea.

, You can enjoy Greece by simply relaxing in the sun on a pristine beach or by sailing and snorkeling in a quiet island lagoon. In addition, there are dozens of private tours available to museums, monasteries, wineries, and archaeological sites. Tour on foot, by bus, boat or bicycle. Tours can last anywhere from a few hours to several days. Athens offers many such tours, most notably a walking tour of the Acropolis. You can also sail to any of the most popular Greek islands. Of course you always have the option to ignore the tours and explore Greece on your own schedule. Watch for local events and celebrations.

, One of the oldest cities in the world, Athens is the capital of and largest city in Greece, with a history spanning more than 3400 years. The architecture reflects a perfect blend of days long since past and modern times. Traffic in Athens can be rough, so a walking tour of the shops, galleries, cafes, boutiques and mansions in the city can be very rewarding.

, They offer gorgeous ocean views from hotel windows and harbor jetties. Enjoy some time on foot, since island streets are sometimes too narrow for cars. In fact, some Greek islands prohibit most motorized vehicles. That doesn't mean that the islands are just sleepy outposts, however. You can expect an active nightlife on the better known islands.

, Summer is the most popular season for touring Greece. The days are sunny and hot, particularly inland from the sea. The weather will be mild the rest of the year.

, Don't wait to reserve hotel rooms until summer approaches, because the best rooms will be taken. The more popular islands are very crowded at this time of the year. Some try to avoid the crowds and save on room rates by visiting the lesser-known (and less expensive) islands.

, Such a driver can be invaluable to you as a guide and a source of pertinent information and suggestions. A mainland rental car can be a good idea if you don't want to take public transportation. However, the latter option can give you the chance to meet local residents and learn more about their lives. (Some locals speak a little English and a smattering of other European languages, particularly German.)

, Travel agents and travel websites are both good options in arranging your trip.

, Many travel companies allow you to pay in monthly installments, which can make an expensive tour much more affordable. If you are retired, and you are on a pension, try to choose a tour at least 1 year in advance.

, These include air fuel surcharges, tipping for tour directors or bus drivers, spending money, transportation fees, airport transfers and more. Each company has a different policy about these fees; some companies include some fees in their quote and others do not.

, If there are any medical, family or other problems that could keep you from traveling on your tour, you should sign up for a cancellation policy. It will require a higher fee, but you will usually receive a refund of the base cost of your trip.

, This will hold your space on the trip. Most companies require $500 or more to reserve your place, with part of that sum being non-refundable if you cancel.

, Check into the billing procedure and keep the customer service/billing number close at hand, in case you have questions. Ask if there are any additional fees for paying by credit card.


Realize that most tour companies have a final payment deadline between 45 and 90 days prior to your departure date. This is to guarantee all your services, especially airfare. You risk losing your money if you cancel after this point. It is also the reason to sign up for a tour well in advance.

",How to Take a Seniors European Tour3," Many states or countries are able to deliver a passport within 6 weeks, but it could take up to 3 months. Check to see if the countries you are visiting require a visa for citizens of your country, because some visas take even longer to apply for and receive.

, These are often known as ""commission stops,"" because the company or tour director receives a portion of the money from the goods sold.

, This is a personal preference, so quiz your tour contact before making a decision. They should be able to tell you if your day is completely planned out, or if you have afternoons or whole days free.

, In Europe, this is usually between September and June of the next year. Take into account that the weather during these months can be less desirable, which can be a barrier to people with limited mobility.

, Most tour companies book your travel, but you can ask them to list you as being disabled or needing aid. If you do not see that listed on your ticket, visit the counter on the day of travel to have it added to your boarding pass.

, Europe runs on the Euro, so check the most updated transfer equivalent. You can exchange a small amount at the bank, and then use an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to take out the rest once you get there.


Using an ATM has the advantage of giving you the current day's exchange rate. A small percentage is usually charged by the bank every time you take money out. However, you should not try to take all your money out at once, in case of theft or pick-pocketing. Try to strike a good balance for taking out money every few days or every week.

, Pack lightly, and plan to wear many of your clothes more than once. This will allow you to take a smaller, more manageable suitcase, and you will leave room for souvenirs.

, If the company you are traveling with does not provide a good plan, then find one yourself. It should include an emergency evacuation, medical care and anything that can help with chronic health conditions.

Not only are hostels generally cheaper than hotels, this will help you meet people during your travels. While there are many events you may enjoy alone, Vienna has a booming nightlife. On occasion, you may want company for a night out, so a hostel is a good option for this.If you do stay in a hostel, remember you will be sharing a room with others so basic security is important. You should invest in a small safe to keep expensive items, which can put under your bed or in a closet at the hostel.
If you're uncomfortable with staying in a hostel, consider options like couch surfing. You can find hosts online through the couch surfing website.
If you'd rather not stay with strangers, you can look into affordable options like AirBnBs, which you can also find online. You can always find people via other means, like taking classes in the city.;
, Take a few index cards with you wherever you go. On these cards, write down your emergency contact information, as well as any medical conditions you have or medications you take. In the event of an emergency, people will know who to contact. This is important when traveling alone anywhere., Vienna has a bus system, so stop by a local bus station and get a pass right away. Buses are the easiest way to get around in Vienna, and this will save you from overspending on things like cabs.If you buy a vacation pass for your trip, however, this includes passes for bus tours and a Hop On Hop Off bus pass. This can be purchased online, before you leave for Vienna.
Opt for the option that makes the most sense for you. If you're only staying for two days, for example, see if they have a two day pass. If you're staying for a week, see if you can get a weeklong pass.

, Walking tours are a good idea when you're traveling alone. For one, you will be in a group, so that's great for safety. Also, this will be an opportunity to socialize with others and be shown around the city.Look for various walking tours online. Some walking tours are offered in package deals where you also gain things like access to various museums and tourist attractions.Something like the Vienna Pass, for example, will give you walking tours of places like the Schönbrunn Palace, the state opera house, as well as a few combination bus and walking tours.

, Without another person helping you make decisions, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed. It's a good idea to have a fairly specific itinerary written out for your first few days. After you've seen a chunk of the city, you'll have a sense of what sorts of attractions you like and dislike, allowing you to be a bit more flexible later in your trip.Write down the most important things for you to see and then review transportation routes. See which attractions are in the same area and try to visit these attractions in the same day.
Have a rough timeline. For example, you might hit the museums in the morning and then move on to the zoo in the afternoon.

, When traveling alone, it's a good idea to know where you're going. Try not to rely too heavily on maps or asking directions. If you look like a tourist, this may make you vulnerable to things like theft. People may be more likely to target someone who looks lost., The Austrian strudel and the weiner schnitzel are two well known specialties in Vienna. Make sure to try them while you're there. They're often sold on the street for cheap rates from food carts.There are also several large outdoor markets in Vienna where you can purchase things like fruits and vegetables, as well as meats and treats like ice cream. The biggest of these is Naschmarkt. Save your money eating out one day and fill up on food at the market., Vienna is home to a variety of art and cultural museums. Try to see at least a couple of museums while you're visiting Vienna.To see many different types of museums at once, stop by the MuseumsQuartier. This is a complex that contains museums featuring contemporary art, as well as performance spaces.
If you want to expose yourself to Vienna's art, stop by the Museum of Fine Art. It features art from a variety of eras and countries.

, The Schönbrun Place is Vienna's most visited site, so make sure to see it during your time visiting. The palace housed royalty in the past and has an extensive garden. Audio and walking tour guides are offered, which can help you learn a bit about the palace's history.Do not take pictures inside the palace. This is not allowed.

, Vienna's zoo is fairly small, so it is easy to see in a single day. It's also one of the oldest zoos in the country, making it an interesting piece of history to visit. Despite its size, the zoo has a wide range of animals such as panda bears, lions, and tigers., The Sigmund Freud musuem is located in the former office and living quarters of Sigmund Freud. It contains many of Freud's old belongings as well as educational material. It only costs 8 euros (or $10) for entrance, so it's one of the cheaper exhibits to see in Vienna., The Opera House is a major cultural draw of Vienna, and performances have been taking place since 1869. You can purchase tickets online prior to your visit. If a whole show is not within your budget, you can also peek inside during operating hours.Make sure to read up on the dress code if you do attend a show. The dress code is strictly enforced.

, You want to make sure you're able to communicate in Vienna, so learn a few basic German phrases. You do not need to be fluent, but having a basic grasp of important terms helps. This can also be useful in an emergency if you need to communicate something to, say, a hospital staff or police officer.


There are many websites you can use to learn basic German phrases and terms you will need to help get around in Vienna. Try to commit some of these terms to memory prior to your trip.You can also download translation phone apps, as well as phone apps that help you remember basic phrases.

, Do not be afraid to talk to people. If you're out alone and someone makes eye contact, for example, strike up a conversation. Ask them where they're from, what brings them to Vienna, and so on.If you're on a walking tour that takes a break midday, it's a good idea to ask fellow tourists if they want to get lunch. Having lunch with people you meet on tours is a great way to make friends in the city.
If there is a language barrier, see if you can find someone who speaks multiple languages to help translate. You can also try to learn a few phrases or terms in someone else's language or use gestures to communicate.

, Many hostels have pub crawls for those staying. See if your hostel hosts a pup crawl, or any similar events. This is a great way to meet friends in your hostel, giving you people to hang out with for the duration of your stay. Vienna has a very active nightlife, and it's fun to experience this with others., Create an account on MeetUp.com before your trip. You can enter your interests and then be matched with likeminded people throughout the city. Try attending a meeting and see if you can meet people looking for friends while vacationing.MeetUp has groups for people with a wide array of interests, such as writing, movies, traveling, and so on.

, Hostels usually have flyers for things like cooking, art, sports, and language classes. Try taking a class for a day. Not only will you learn a new skill while traveling abroad, you can meet people through taking classes.A popular choice is a cooking class. You will come home with a few new recipes in hand and also have the opportunity to make friends.

, As you'll be traveling alone, you do not want to lose track of yourself. It's also important not to lower your inhibitions too much, as you want to be able to use common sense when meeting new people. Drink in moderation so you can get yourself to and from your hostel without trouble."

July and August are the months in which the tourist season is at its peak, making it the most expensive time to travel there. Accommodation costs are usually lower between April to June. By September less tourists will be present, hence this is a good time to visit the country and prices will also be comparatively less.

Also, a knowledge of German or Italian is an added bonus., The Croatian kuna is the currency. The Euro may be accepted in some places, but having a small amount of Croatian kuna is always safer. Exchange your currency for the kuna before you go, if possible. If it's not possible, make plans to exchange it once you get there., For example, the ancient city of Dubrovonik, the waterfalls of Plitvice, the town of Opatija, and villages scattered along the Adriatic coast are popular destinations. The war torn town of Vukovar, which still stands as a symbol of the struggle for Croatian Independence, is another destination which should be considered when researching. Croatia is also famous for its spas and health resorts, so you may want to stay at one of those."

For instance, you should get routine vaccines like measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, varicella vaccine and your flu shot.If you are not travelling from the US, you may need Hepatitis A, B and other vaccines.

, You will need official documents to register with the town hall, which is called the Gemeente. If your documents are not written in Dutch, English, French or German, you have to get an official translation. It makes sense to bring extra copies of important documents, such as your birth certificate and marriage certificate. Bring the following documents with you from home:Valid passport (or personal identification).
Residence permit, such as a sticker in your passport, ID card or letter from IND.
Rental contract.
Certified copy of your birth certificate.
If applicable, you need your foreign marriage certificate, divorce certificate or registered partnership.

, You’ll need a rental contract or agreement to get your BSN or social security number, which means you need to find a place to live prior to registering with the Gemeente. When you search for a place to live, you need to ask the property owner if they allow registration at the address - some owners don’t allow registration because it increases their taxes.If you have any friends in the Netherlands, you should ask them for help finding an apartment or room.You can search Facebook rental groups for the Netherlands.If you are studying in the Netherlands, you may want to get university accomodation.

, You should book your appointment with the Gemeente (town hall) as soon as you arrive in the Netherlands. Ask them when the next available appointment is and then book a day and a time.If you are moving to Amsterdam, you can call the Gemeente at 14020 255 29 09.
If you are moving to Utrecht you can call 030 286 00 00.
If you know the city you are moving to, you can see if they have online appointment booking. Find the website for the Gemeente at your final destination and book an appointment online., Although most people in Holland speak English, you should learn the language. People will appreciate it if you make the effort to speak their language.Find a language class upon arrival or use language tapes. Dutch can be tricky to learn, but it is certainly worth the effort if you plan to move to Holland., You should consider your employment prospects before moving to the Netherlands. Because most jobs require strong Dutch language skills and all of the restrictions around hiring people who are not citizens of the European Union, you should prepare yourself for a long job search.If you are a scientist or a highly trained professional in a particular area, your employer may be able to sponsor you.

, Remember, the more money that you bring, the better start that you will get in Holland. Bear in mind that the Euro may be worth more or less than your own currency., Because it is very difficult to pay for anything with foreign bank cards in the Netherlands, you should get yourself a Dutch bank account. Although there are a lot of banking options, few banks have good online English services.Bunq is one of the banks with better online English services.
Establish a budget for yourself, since rent and cost of living can be pretty high in the Netherlands.
Once you have decided on a bank, you can transfer money via an international transfer service.

, You are required to have health insurance in the Netherlands. You can get basic coverage for 110 euros.You should make sure you either have a health insurance plan or travel insurance that includes it.


If you fail to get insurance within three months, you’ll be fined for 375 euros.
If you are not insured, you will receive basic medical aid but you can expect a high bill. However, every hospital has a fund for non-insured or people without papers, so you will never be denied urgent medical aid.
The Netherlands has agreements on health insurance with the EU and EEA countries as well as Australia, Cape Verde Islands, Croatia, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, Vojvodina, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. , Things may take some getting used to, such as driving on another side of the road, or the temperature. However, try to laugh it off! These things will come in time.

, You should find new places to meet Dutch people, such as the local pub, gym or at school. Although the Dutch are known to be a direct and fairly extroverted lot, they generally do not invite you to their home unless you've made your way into their circle of close friends and family.


You can meet acquaintances at work, in the pub, at the gym, at school, or at your hobby club.
When making your first steps into Dutch society, you may find it helpful to get in touch with fellow countrymen. One of the richest resources for expats in Holland is Expatica., After living in the Netherlands for five years in a row, you can become a Dutch citizen. You will need to prove fluency in Dutch, adopt a name that can be easily pronounced in Dutch and renounce your other citizenship. You will need to apply through the IND and the process takes about a year."

For any amount you need over the amount you feel comfortable carrying, try to take traveler's cheques in that currency -- not US dollars.,
Be aware that ATMs can be expensive!,
Understand that credit cards usually get wholesale rates (which is very good) but have fees of 2 - 3% of the US dollar amount of every purchase.

,
Check if your bank has a sister bank in the country you're visiting; this usually means you won't get charged or charged a smaller fee for withdrawals from said bank.

",How to Get Cash when Traveling in Europe," There have been many cases where travelers have their card accounts frozen because of ""suspicious foreign activity"". Your bank means well, but if you don't tell them you might be stranded with no access for cash for several days.;
, Check with your bank to see if they can sell you some currency before you go. Or order cash online.

, If they are not available, plan on using your ATM card.

, While it's true that you'll get very competitive rates from ATMs, the fees will come over the top and eat away the savings.

And this is on every transaction - no matter the amount!

Kenyan products are as diverse and unique as the country itself.,
Excellent, well stocked gift shops can be found in hotels, lodges and camps throughout the country.,
For the dedicated bargain hunter, Kenya's markets are the place to be.,
Bargaining is the expected norm in Markets and even in some shops throughout Kenya.,
Visitors to Kenya should never be afraid to bargain, it is expected and rarely considered offensive.,
The real price is usually somewhere in the lower vicinity of half the initial price.,
If you are in a hurry and need to move on, it is the usual practice to finalize proceedings by declaring your 'absolute final price' (the Bei ya Mwisho) and asking for theirs.,
The basic rule of bargaining is this: Bargain hard but don't be unreasonable.

,
Don't forget that some work, especially good quality carvings and beaded jewelry, takes a long time to make and involves a lot of hard work.,
Some tourists barter goods like old t-shirts, pens and other items for local handicrafts.,
The following is a sample of some of the best buys in Kenya:

",How to Shop in Kenya1," There are traditional artifacts, fantastic jewelry, beautiful carvings, the world's best coffee (or so they say), precious stones, furniture, beautiful cloth, excellent local music, wonderful modern art and so much more to be found.

, But often real finds can be found a little further off the beaten track.

, Markets selling all kinds of local arts and crafts can be found all over the country. In Nairobi, there are large open air markets held each week.

, The art of bargaining has deep roots in Kenyan culture, and is regarded as an essential business skill.

, Opening prices are always an exaggerated gambit, and considered the first step in a long process of bargaining.

, How close you come to the real price is up to you. Bargaining can be a long and convoluted process, involving protracted negotiations. Some westerners can find this frustrating, but it is an essential and usually amicable custom.

, If you can both agree a figure between the two then the deal is done.

,, Prices need to be fair from both sides.

, This practice can be culturally questionable, and it is usually much preferred to use money. Giving sweets and candy for children should definitely be avoided.

,"
"
Fine examples of basketry can be found throughout Kenya.,
One of the most popular is the sisal basket called the Kiondoo.,
These days Kiondoo are often made in a wide variety of colours, and in more modern versions with a clip, buckle or zip, sometimes in a decorative design.

",How to Shop in Kenya2," Baskets vary in size and colour regionally throughout Kenya.;
, These baskets, commonly produced in Kikuyu areas (where you may hear them called Chondo) are a small functional basket with a leather carrying strap. They are popularly used as handbags, although traditionally they are carried by Kikuyu women behind the head, with the strap across the forehead.

,"
"
Carvings are probably the most popular item with visitors to Kenya.,
On the coast carving of ornate doors, furniture and household fittings play a major part in local culture.,
Most Kenyans would agree that the best carvers in the country are the Wakamba from Eastern Kenya.,
The distinctive dark ebony carvings, known as Makonde, actually originate from the coast of Tanzania.,
There is a current trend among tourists for buying huge carved giraffes.,
In recent years, deforestation has become a problem in Kenya.,
However, the industry needs to be sustainable and deforestation is causing major environmental problems.,
The demand for carvings has meant the devaluing of precious woods such as the ebony, ordinarily a highly expensive wood.,
Visitors to Kenya should try to make careful and aware decisions when purchasing wood.,
Try to buy, and thereby encourage the use of, environmentally friendly woods.,
The Kisii people of Western Kenya are gifted stone carvers.,
The soapstone here varies in colour from white (the easiest to carve) through various shades of pink to a deep lustrous red (the most difficult to carve).

",How to Shop in Kenya3," There is a wide variety of carving styles using a range of materials available. It is well worth shopping around for quality and value., The best carvers are found on Lamu, where they produce excellent chairs, doors, brass inlaid boxes, picture frames and small replica dhows. Commonly used woods on the coast are the wood of older Mango trees and the wood of the introduced Neem tree.

, They are well known for producing wood carvings, particularly of animals.

, the popularity of Makonde work means that there are many Makonde artists in Kenya and their work is widely available. Some Makonde work is now made with blackened rosewood. Traditional Makonde designs are thin elongated human figures, towers of intricate intertwined human bodies known as the Tree of Life, figures from the Slave trade and surreal figures based on local mythology.

, There are plenty of these and other large carvings available. If you have a problem with baggage allowances, freight can be arranged to have these items sent to your home country. Contact the post office or a specialist freight forwarding agent.

, While the main causes for this are clearing for farmland and charcoal burning, the demand for wood carving also increases the need of wood. At the same time, the carving industry provides vital labour to many people, particularly the Kamba community, and is an important form of expression of both traditional and modern art.

, The harvest of native Ebony, Mahagony, Rosewood and Olive wood is the greatest threat to indigenous forests and the species they support, through habitat loss for wildlife and destruction of water catchment areas.

, This has led to the rapid and wholesale destruction of Ebony forests.

, Certainly rare native woods (Ebony, Rosewood, Olive and Mahogany) should be avoided, or only purchased when used in high quality and highly priced carvings. Cheap objects such as salad spoons and small mass produced carved animals made from these woods present the greatest environmental threat.

, These include introduced and renewable trees such as the Jacaranda, Neem, Mango, Blue Gum, and Grevillea. Encouraging use of these woods allows you to protect the local environment and support a sustainable carving industry for the future.

, They use a locally quarried soapstone to produce a range of carvings. The most popular items are small animals, chess pieces based on traditional African designs and more functional items such as egg cups, soap dishes, coasters and ash trays.

,"
"
Collectors of ethnic artifacts and objects will find plenty of traditional and tribal items and artifacts in Kenya.

,

Popular items include Gourds, Neck Pillows (small carved stools propped under the neck while sleeping), Shields, Gourds, Spears, Wrist knives and Traditional swords called Simis.

",How to Shop in Kenya4,", Buyers may find a noticeable divide between genuine functional objects and those produced for the tourist market.

,"
"
The best available textiles in Kenya are found on the coast, known as the Khanga and the Kikoi (sometimes spelt Kikoy).,
The kikoi is a bright, usually striped, cloth with knotted tassles along each hem.,
These cloths are synonymous with the Kenyan coast, and their fabrics are often adapted into clothing, tablecloths, bedlinen, and just about anything else possible.,
The coast is also home to excellent tailors, who can produce clothing from local fabrics quickly and cheaply, made to order.

,
Inland, the most common textile is the Maasai Shukka.,
A common item of footwear in Kenya is the 'Thousand miler', a sandal cut from an old car tyre.,
Many Kenyan clothes designers have incorporated traditional designs and textile patterns into attractive modern garments, which are becoming increasingly popular.

",How to Shop in Kenya5," These traditional cloths are worn as a wrap around garment by both men and women all over the East African coast, similar to the sarong of Southeast Asia.

, The khanga is larger, more elaborately patterned and traditionally emblazoned with a Swahili proverb offering a pearl of conventional wisdom.

, A khanga or kikoi is perfect for the beach and can either be worn or used as a beach towel, or both.

,, This is the blanket seen worn by most Maasai, always red blended with black, blue or other colours. They are warm and functional blankets, ideal for the chill of early mornings on Safari.

, These sandals are very tough and surprisingly comfortable once worn in. Thousand milers are available at most local markets.

,"
"
Physical decoration and adornment is of great cultural significance to many of Kenya's tribes.

,
The beaded jewelry and decorative items of the Maasai and other Kenyan peoples has become internationally famous.,
Each of the many designs of bracelets,ceremonial adornments and particularly necklaces has its own particular traditional meaning and purpose.,
Other common items of jewelry include the 'elephant hair' bracelets sold on the streets of Nairobi.,
In Nairobi and Northern Kenya, a wide array of copper, brass and wire bracelets are sold.,
Kenya is also a good place to find antique and reproduction silver jewelry from Ethiopia, Eritrea and the Yemen.",How to Shop in Kenya6,", The beadwork is astonishingly intricate and beautiful, combining thousands of tiny coloured beads with cowrie shells and leatherwork.

, Today, Maasai beading has become so popular that it is possible to find many more modern beadwork items. These include belts, watchstraps, sandals and even mobile phone covers!

, Don't be overly concerned about the fate of the elephants involved, the bracelets are mostly made from blackened grass or twine. This style of knotted bracelet is also often replicated in copper or wire.

, Some of these bracelets feature attractive and unusual designs, and are often made from recycled fencing wire or telephone lines.

, Excellent examples of this work can be bought in Markets and Curio shops throughout Kenya, often incorporating silver designs with stone beading, amber and camel bone ornamentation.

Bring appropriate clothing for the time of year in which you plan to visit.,
Take a range of clothing for different occasions.",How to Prepare for a Trip to the Netherlands," Passports can be obtained at post offices, government offices and passport offices all around your country.;
, Dutch is the official language, though almost everyone speaks at least a little English in Holland. Learn to say please, 'alstublieft' and 'Bedankt', thank you at least. Take an English to Dutch dictionary to smooth things along on your trip.

, Use traveler's checks if possible, or change your currency to the Euro. Some tourist-heavy areas will accept American credit cards, though smaller businesses will require cash Euros.

, The Netherlands uses Type C and D electrical outlets, while most North American outlets are A or B. Take a converter for any electrical appliances you plan on using.

, Amsterdam is home to the Van Gogh Museum, the largest collection of works by Van Gogh in the world in addition to many exhibitions on 19th-century art.

Be sure to bundle up, bringing heavy coats, hats, scarves, sweaters and gloves. The summers are warm with light rainfall, averaging temperatures of 72 degrees Fahrenheit or 22 degrees Celsius. Holland is relaxed about clothing, so shorts and t-shirts are fine tourist garb, along with a raincoat or umbrella to combat the occasional shower.

, For instance, if you happen to be visiting during Queen's Day on April 30th, you would want to wear plenty of orange, as will most of the locals.

Follow your interests.,
Brainstorm possible topics.,
Seek inspiration.,
Start thinking practically.,
Clarify the project requirements.,
Draw from similar projects for help on the details.,
Establish your project type.,
Think scientifically.",How to Pick a Topic for Science Fair," Some science fair projects fail because the people doing them lose interest or can’t stay motivated during the preparation process. Picking a topic that truly interests you will largely eliminate this possibility.Especially when first deciding on your topic, worry less about what will interest the judges or your teacher, and more about what interests you. If you can’t enjoy doing the project, the odds are good that others won’t enjoy observing it.
For instance, if you are interested in resource conservation, you might choose topics ranging from comparing water usage in baths versus showers to rating light bulb efficiency levels, among many possibilities.;
, To begin, jot down every interesting project idea that comes to mind. Don’t worry about whether they are realistic at this point — that part of the process comes later.


One version of brainstorming you can try is called a “mind web” or “mind map.”With it, you start by writing down a basic idea for a topic you like and circling it.
Then, you connect this “bubble” with lines to others that contain words or ideas that come to mind when you think of your topic.
Finally, you connect these secondary bubbles with another group that contains questions that come to mind about your topic.
Repeating this process several times with different ideas can help you decide which ones are most interesting and most manageable.

, If you’re feeling a bit “stumped” because your brainstorming and mind-webbing are not producing many results, you can turn to sample project ideas for inspiration. The internet is full of good sources for science fair project ideas.Don’t just copy someone else’s project, though, especially if yours needs to be original. Let a project for building a pizza box solar oven inspire you to design your own project about solar energy output, for example.
Another option is to try the “Topic Selection Wizard” at http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/recommender_register.php. You provide some basic background info and answer about 25 questions about your interests, and it produces a list of project ideas that might be a good start for you. Again, however, make the project your own, especially if the rules require it.

, Once you’ve come up with a good list of project ideas that interest you, it is time to narrow them down to your one best project idea.At this point, it is not so simple as asking which idea you like best. Instead, you have to consider questions like:


Can I turn this idea into a project that I can finish in the time allotted? (For example, if you have three weeks, you can’t make growing tomatoes from seeds part of your project.)
Do I have the skills and resources to transform this idea into a project? (For instance, building a computer from spare parts is not for everyone.)
Will I have the patience and perseverance to turn this idea into a project and see it through to the end? (After all, good ideas do not always translate into good projects.)

, Before you dive into formulating a hypothesis and setting up experiments, it is always wise to double-check the rules and judging criteria for your project.Make sure you are clear on simple things like the time frame (that is, how long until the due date) and any restrictions on outside help, resources used (or money spent), and so on.
If, for instance, you find that you will be evaluated primarily on the quality of your poster presentation, you will want to devise your project in such a way that you can devote more time to this aspect.

, Having the idea to separate salt from sugar (for example) is one thing, but figuring out a way to do it safely and effectively can be quite another. Use similar project examples, like those found online, as your guide once again.If your project needs to be original, do not just copy an existing one you find. This is cheating and unethical. You can, however, complete this existing project, alter some elements to make it original, then complete your version of it. Be sure to cite the original project in your references, however.
The quest to find the right way to do a salt-and-sugar project may lead you, for instance, to instead move on to a more manageable project that separates salt from sand., Science fair projects generally fall into one of five varieties (presented in typical order of difficulty): description, collection, demonstration, engineering, and experimentation. Experimentation is most common for high school and above levels.Depending upon the requirements for the science fair (or class assignment) and your age / grade level, your idea to investigate why bananas turn brown could range from describing the process to devising an experiment to delay the decomposition of various fruits.

, Though there are variations on what exactly constitutes the Scientific Method, it can generally be summed up by the following steps: 1) research a topic; 2) identify a problem (or ask a question); 3) formulate a hypothesis; 4) conduct an experiment; and 5) draw a conclusion.Moving from an idea to a project basically takes you from step one on through the remaining four steps.


The question(s) you ask that will lead you to your hypothesis — the claim you will test — tend to be of the what / when / which / who / why / where / how variety. The need not always start with one of those words, however. Consider this example: ""Can a simple solar oven be made that works consistently in various conditions?""
Your hypothesis should be a clear, straightforward statement that can either be proven or disproven through an experiment that you can conduct. For example: ""A solar oven made from a pizza box can consistently heat foods any time there is abundant sunshine.""
Your experiment will need to employ independent and dependent variables. These are conditions that you change (independent) and those that change in response (dependent). For the pizza box solar oven example, these could include the time of day and the temperature of the tested food item.
Remember, starting off the process by choosing a topic that interests you will make this job of turning your idea into a workable project much easier and more enjoyable.

Kenya is a good place to find traditional musical instruments.

,
Drums are very easy to find.,
Drums are most large and round with a taut goat or cowhide skin.,
On the coast drums tend to be smaller and are used in traditional Taarab and Swahili music.,
The coast is also home to a unique wind instrument called the Siwa which is a large, ornately carved wooden flute capped off with the horn of a cow.,
Traditional stringed instruments are found throughout Kenya, mostly originated from the tribes of Western Kenya.",How to Shop in Kenya7,", Many of Kenya's traditional cultures developed musical forms based around drumming, called Ngoma. Even today, drumming is used at many festive ceremonies, religious events and political rallies.

, They are predominantly flat based or three legged and played by a seated drummer. Longer drums, like those used by the Shukka tribe, are leant forward and held between the thighs of a standing musician. Some of the larger drums are often bought to be used as coffee tables.

, Elongated drums that are held under the arm and played with a curved stick are used, as are smaller palm and finger drums similar to the Indian Tablas and large flat tambour drums played by rapidly rotating the drum across an open palm.

, Good examples of the Siwa can be found on Lamu, where they play a significant role in local festivities and events.

, The Nyatiti is similar to the European lyre, with strings bound to a curved arm. played like a harp this instrument produces a particularly beautiful sound.

Define the equation to solve for surface tension.,
Construct a small balance beam.In this experiment, you will use a balance beam and a small needle floating on the surface of water to measure surface tension.,
Fold a piece of aluminum foil to form a box or dish.,
Hang a needle or paper clip horizontally from the other end of the beam with thread.,
Place a piece of material such as clay on the beam to counterbalance the aluminum container.,
Place the needle or paper clip hanging from the beam into a container of water.,
Weigh a batch of pins or several measured drops of water on a small postal scale.,
Add the pins or drops of water one at a time to your aluminum foil container until the needle is freed from the water's surface.,
Convert the measurement of pins into force by multiplying the number of grams by 0.00981 N/g.,
Plug the variables into the equation and solve.",How to Measure Surface Tension1," In this experiment, the equation for surface tension will be determined by the equation F = 2sd. F is the force in newtons (N), s is the surface tension in (N/m), and d is the length of the needle used in the experiment. Rearranging the equation to solve for surface tension yields s = F/2d.


The force will be calculated at the end of the experiment.
Measure the length of the needle in meters using a ruler before starting the experiment.;
, The balance beam needs to be well constructed so that you can get an accurate result. You can use many different types of materials for this, just make sure the center beam is something sturdy like wood, plastic, or dense cardboard.


Mark the center of the material to be used for your beam (straw, plastic ruler) and drill or poke a hole through it; this will be the fulcrum point (the point that allows the beam to rotate freely). If you are using a plastic straw you can just poke a pin or nail right through it.
Drill or poke a hole at each end of the beam ensuring that they are the same distance from the middle. Thread string through the hole to serve as holders for the balance dishes.
Support the fulcrum nail or pin horizontally on books or pieces of stiff material that won't collapse. You want the center beam to be able to rotate freely on the pin or nail poked through the middle.

, The dish does not have to be exactly square or round. The dish will be filled with water or another weight, so make sure it is sturdy enough to support this.


Hang the box or dish from one end of the beam. Poke small holes in the sides of the dish and thread the string through to hold up the dish.

, On the opposite side of the beam, tie a paper clip or needle to the end of the string so that it lays flat. For the experiment to work, it is important that the paper clip or needle is horizontal.

, Before beginning the experiment, you want to make sure that the beam is lying flat. The dish will be heavier than the needle, causing the beam to lower in the direction of the dish. Add enough clay to the opposite side of the beam so that the beam is level.


This is called counterbalancing.

, This step may require some extra effort to ensure the needle is resting just on the top of the water’s surface. You do not want the needle submerged in the water. Fill a container with water (or other liquid of unknown surface tension) and place it underneath the needle at a height that allows the needle to rest directly on top the surface.


Make sure the string holding the needle in place remains taut once the needle is on top of the water.

, You will be adding pins or drops of water one at a time to the aluminum dish you constructed earlier. For the calculation, it is important to know exactly how much weight is required to lift the needle out of the water.


Count out a number of pins or drops of water and weigh them.
Determine the individual weight of each drop or pin by dividing the total weight by the number of pins or water drops.
For example, let’s say 30 pins weigh 15 grams: 15/30 = 0.5. Each pin weighs 0.5 grams.

, Slowly add a pin or a drop of water to the aluminum dish one pin/drop at a time. Watch the needle closely to see if it comes out of the water with each new addition. Stop adding pins/drops once the needle is no longer in contact with the surface of the water.


Count the number of pins or drops of water needed to remove the counterweight from the water's surface.
Record each reading.
Repeat the exercise several times (5 or 6) for more accurate readings.
Calculate an average of the results by adding the total number of pins needed in each trial and dividing that by the total number of trials.

, To calculate the surface tension, you need to know the total amount of force required to remove the needle from the surface of the liquid. Because you weighed the pins in the previous step, you can easily do this calculation using the conversion factor 0.00981 N/g.Multiply the number of pins added to the dish by the weight of each pin. For example, 5 pins at 0.5 g/pin = 5 x 0.5 = 2.5 g.
Multiply the amount of grams by the conversion factor 0.00981 N/g: 2.5 x 0.00981 = 0.025 N.

, Using the measurements you gathered throughout the experiment, you can now solve for force. Simply plug the numbers into the correct variable and solve using the proper order of operations.


Continuing our example, let’s say the needle was 0.025 m long. Plugging the variables into the equation yields: S = F/2d = 0.025 N/(2 x 0.025) = 0.05 N/m. The surface tension of the liquid is 0.05 N/m.

Understand capillary action.,
Define the equation to solve for surface tension.,
Fill a container with the liquid of unknown surface tension.,
Place a clear, thin tube into the liquid.,
Measure the height the liquid rises above the liquid in the container.,
Plug the measured values into the equation and solve.",How to Measure Surface Tension2," In order to understand capillary action, you first need to understand adhesion and cohesive forces. Adhesion is the force that causes a liquid to stick to a solid surface, such as the edge of a glass. Cohesive forces are those that pull liquid molecules toward each other.. The combination of adhesion and cohesive forces causes a liquid to rise up the center of a thin tube.


The height the liquid rises can be used to calculate the surface tension of that liquid.
Cohesion causes water to form bubbles or droplets on a surface. When a liquid is in contact with air, the molecules feel attractive forces towards each other and make a bubble on the surface.
Adhesion causes the meniscus that is seen in liquids when they cling to the sides of a glass. It is the concave shape at the top of the liquid seen at eye level.An example of capillary action is watching water rise in a straw placed in a cup of water.

, Surface tension is given by the equation S = (ρhga/2) where S is the surface tension, ρ is the density of the liquid you are measuring, h is the height the liquid rises in the tube, g is the acceleration due to gravity acting on the liquid (9.8 m/s2) and a is the radius of the capillary tube.When working through this equation, make sure all of your units are in the proper metric form: density in kg/m3, height and radius in meters, and gravity in m/s2.
If the density of the liquid is not given, you can look it up in a reference book or calculate it using the equation density = mass/volume.
The unit for surface tension is one newton per meter (N/m). A Newton is equal to 1 kg-m/s2.To work out the units on your own, simply solve the equation with just units. S = kg/m3 * m * m/s2 * m. Two of the meter units cancel out two of the per meter units and you are left with 1 kg-m/s2/m or 1 N/m.

, Using a shallow dish or bowl, fill it with about an inch of the liquid in question. The amount of liquid added does not matter as long as you can clearly see the rise in liquid within the capillary tube.


If you repeat this with different liquids, make sure the dish is thoroughly cleaned and dried before adding the next liquid. Alternatively, just use separate dishes for each liquid.

, This is the tube that you will take your measurements from to calculate the surface tension. The tube must be clear so that you can see how far the liquid rises above the level in the dish. The tube must also have the same radius throughout.


To measure the radius, simply place a ruler across the top of the tube and determine the diameter. Divide the diameter by 2 and you have the radius.

, Place the bottom of a ruler directly above the liquid in the dish and measure how high the liquid has risen into the tube. The water rises due to the upward force of surface tension being greater than the downward force of gravity., Once you have determined all of the necessary variables, you can plug them into the formula and solve for surface tension. Remember to convert all of your values to metric so the problem can be solved properly.


For example, let’s say we are measuring the surface tension of water. Water has a density around 1 kg/m3 (we will use approximate values in this example).The variable g is always 9.8 m/s2. The radius of the tube is .029 m and the water rises 0.5 m. What is the surface tension of the water?
Plugging the variables into the equation yields: S = (ρhga/2) = (1 x 9.8 x 0.029 x 0.5)/2 = 0.1421/2 = 0.071 J/m2.

Gather your materials.,
Drip one drop of liquid at a time onto the penny.,
Repeat the experiment with a different liquid.,
Compare the number of drops it takes to fill the penny for each liquid.",How to Measure Surface Tension3," For this experiment you will need an eye dropper, a dry penny, water, a small bowl, dish soap, oil, and a towel. Most of these items can be found around the house or purchased at the grocery store. You don’t have to use dish soap and oil, but you will want different liquids to compare their surface tensions.


Make sure the penny is completely clean and dry before beginning the experiment. If there are other liquids on the penny, the experiment will not be accurate.
This experiment does not allow you to calculate surface tension, but just determine surface tensions of different liquids relative to each other.

, Place the penny on top of a towel or a surface that you don’t mind getting wet. Fill the eyedropper with the first liquid. Slowly, drip the liquid onto the penny, taking care to only drop one drop at a time. Count the number of drops it takes to fill the penny until the liquid runs over.


Write down how many drops it takes for the liquid to flow over the side of the penny.

, Clean and dry the penny in between each test of liquid. Dry the surface that you placed the penny on before repeating the experiment. Use multiple eyedroppers or clean it in between uses.


Try mixing a little bit of dish soap to the water and dropping again to see if the surface tension changes.

, Try repeating the experiment with the same liquid multiple times to see if you are getting an accurate count. Average the trials together by adding them together and dividing by the number of trials performed. Write down which substances required the most drops and which required the fewest to fill the penny.


Substances with a higher surface tension will have more drops on the penny than substances with a lower surface tension.
The dish soap lowers the surface tension of the water, using fewer drops to fill the penny.

Calculate your VO2 max.",How to Measure Vo2 Max1," Many fitness trackers and watches come with a heart rate monitor. If you have one of these, record your heart rate while at rest (sitting down, doing little-to-no physical activity). The best time to measure your resting heart rate is in the morning before you get out of bed.To determine your heart rate without a monitor, place two fingers against the artery on the side of your neck, just under your jaw. You should be able to feel your heartbeat on your fingers.
Set a timer for 60 seconds and count the number of beats you feel. This is your resting heart rate in beats per minute (bpm).;
, The most common way to calculate your maximum heart rate is to subtract your age from 220.If you’re 25 years old, your HRmax = 220 -25 = 195 beats per minute (bpm).


There is some research that suggests this formula oversimplifies the calculation. You can also estimate your max heart rate with other formulas based on this research., The simplest formula to calculate VO2 max is VO2 max = 15 x (HRmax/HRrest). This method is considered to compare well with other common formulas.The units for VO2 max are milliliters per kilogram per minute (mL/kg/min).

, Using the resting and max heart rate you already determined, you can plug those values into the formula and calculate your VO2 max. Let’s say you’re resting heart rate is 80 bpm and your max heart rate is 195 bpm.


Write the formula: VO2 max = 15 x (HRmax/HRrest)
Plug in the values: VO2 max = 15 x (195/80).
Solve: VO2 max = 15 x 2.44 = 36.56 mL/kg/min.

, Fill your large bucket with water and place it outside. Make sure it is not located near wood, paper or dry grass. For example, a driveway, parking lot, or gravel alley may be the most fire safe place to complete this experiment.

, Roll several pieces of white computer paper as tightly as you can into a single tube. If you wish, you may secure them at one end with a rubber band a quarter of the way down the tube.For peak scientific precision, use a pencil to mark the quarter and halfway points along the tube. This will show you how much of the tube to burn.

, Hold your paper tube by its rubber-banded end over the bucket of water. Light the end that is furthest from you. You should see flame, but no smoke. Allow it to burn into a quarter or a half of the paper has burned away, then gently blow it out.Watch out for stray bits of paper. If you see any, stamp on them or drip water on them so that no fires start.

, After you have blown out the fire, your tube should give off white smoke for a minute or so. The white smoke is the result of burning cellulose that releases water droplets and unburned fuel from the paper.

, You may burn it and blow it out until you are satisfied. Do not burn the paper once you can no longer hold it above the rubber band. Drop the paper in the water bucket before it gets too close to your hand.


Make sure to soak the paper in water when you're done with it to avoid starting a fire.
To produce black smoke, burn the end with the rubber band. It will smell horrible.

, Pick a parking lot, gravel lot, or large driveway. Bring a bucket of plain water with you to douse any potential fires. Light one edge of your smoke bomb, and step back several feet immediately.The flame should burn slowly and should not be visible through the smoke.
Douse in water when you are finished.

Set up a safe fire.,
Get dry and wet fuel.,
Build a file from the dry fuel.,
Pile on wet foliage.",How to Make White Smoke3," Light a fire in a fire pit, barrel or campfire location. If your fire is on or in the ground, clear brush and debris from the site. Choose a spot that is downwind and is at least 15 feet from your belongings.Make sure there is water and a fire extinguisher nearby so that you can douse a runaway fire.

, Gather dried out fallen tree limbs and dry twigs. You will want larger logs and branches for fuel, large twigs for kindling, and small twigs for tinder.Gather dead wood that is thoroughly dry. Tinder can also be made of wadded up paper, bits of wax, strips of cardboard, or wood shavings.For wet foliage, gather leaves, weeds, and grass. If they are not damp, pour a few cups of water along them.

, Loosely pile the fuel logs at the bottom of your firepit. Stack kindling on top in a tipi, cross, or square ""cabin"" shape. Don't pack too much in—there should be air between the branches. Add kindling to the top and light with a match or lighter.Add more tinder as the fire goes.
Blow gently at the base of the fire to encourage it.
When you have strong fire, you can add more kindling or fuel to keep it going., Once your fire has been going for a while, and shows no sign of stopping, dump the wet foliage on it. Step back several feet and admire the results: a tall plume of billowing white smoke.


If you do this in a remote location, you may attract rescuers. Don't build a signal fire unless you are actually in need of help.
Alternatively, add a paper bag of wet straw. You'll get a smaller but longer-lasting plume.
Douse the fire thoroughly with water when you are done. Check on it after the steam clears to make sure it isn't still burning, sparking, or smoking.

Determine the travel dates.,
Find accommodations.,
Confirm the vacation trip is an appropriate gift.,
Purchase the trip.,
Put a description of the vacation in a card.,
Wrap a clue to the destination in a box.,
Include the travel tickets in the gift.,
Surprise the person with the trip.,
Have the person guess the destination.,
Take the person to a specific setting for the gift opening.",How to Give a Vacation Trip As a Gift," Before you plunge into trip planning, consider your budget for the gift. How much can you spend on the vacation trip gift? Think about whether you can afford to pay for just the travel ticket, more than one ticket, or accommodations as well. Come up with a solid amount of money you can spend on the gift and go from there.For example, you may be able to afford to spend $500 on the gift, which will cover travel expenses but not accommodations for two people. Or you may be able to spend $1000 on the gift, which will cover travel expenses and accommodations for one person.;
, Start by determining where you would like to send this person as a gift. Perhaps the person always talks about taking a beach vacation in Mexico or they have always wanted to travel overseas to see a relative. You may decide to choose a destination that will fulfill the person’s lifelong dream or a spot they have often mentioned travelling to. Ask yourself, “Where would this person enjoy travelling to?”You could also pick a destination that you think they may enjoy going to, such as a tropical destination or a destination in Europe. Or you may opt for a destination like Disneyland or Graceland if you think the person will enjoy going there.
Another option is to leave the destination blank and allow the person to choose their own destination once you give them the gift. You may set aside a certain amount of money for the gift and tell the person they can travel anywhere within that budget.

, To book the vacation trip for the person, you will need to choose the travel dates. You may opt for flex dates if you are not sure when the person will be free to take the trip, as flex dates allow you to change the travel dates if necessary. Or you may plan the travel dates for a time you know the person is going to free, such as spring break, summer break, or holiday break.If you do purchase the trip with set travel dates, make sure the person will be available for travel on those dates. You may need to check with the person’s partner or family to confirm they are free. You could also ask the person in casual conversation if they have some free time coming up for travel to confirm the travel dates for the gift.

, You may decide to include accommodations as part of the vacation trip gift. If this is within your budget, you will need to locate accommodations at the destination during certain travel dates. Perhaps you opt for a hotel or you try a home rental service like Airbnb to find accommodations. Search for a hotel or home rental in the destination, located close to must see sites in the area.If the trip is at a resort, you may not need to worry about booking accommodations.
You may not need to book accommodations if there are friends or family the person can stay with at the destination. For example, if you are getting the person a trip to visit a friend in England, you may not have to worry about paying for their accommodations as they can stay with their friend.

, Before you give the vacation trip to someone, you should make sure it is appropriate for you to give it to them. For example, it may not be appropriate for you to give a coworker or a person you do not know well a vacation trip as a gift. You should consider if the gift is too lavish or expensive to give to someone you are only just getting to know or have recently become friends with.


If you are getting the vacation trip for a relative, such as your niece or nephew, you should confirm it is appropriate with their parents before giving it to them. Ask their parents, ""Do you think they would like a vacation trip as a gift?"" or ""Is it okay if I give them a vacation trip as a gift?""

, Once you have figured out the details of the trip, it’s time to buy the trip for the person. You can buy the travel tickets online using a travel site, as you can often get discounts and deals by buying travel tickets online. Or you may consult with a travel agent to find the best rates for the trip.Keep in mind your budget when you buy the trip. Make sure you do not go over budget or spend more than you can afford on the gift. If it ends up being a lot of money, you may try splitting the cost with other friends or family so you can all give the person the vacation trip as a gift together.

, One way you can “wrap” the vacation trip is to write a description of the vacation in a card. Then, you can give the person the card so they can read about their gift. You may include a hand drawn map of the vacation in the card to give the person an idea of where they will be going and what they will be doing once they’re there. Make sure you include the travel dates in the card as well.


For example, you may write in the card, “You will be traveling to sunny California, flying by plane for several hours until you reach your best friend in San Francisco. You’ll be travelling from the 5th to the 15th, just in time for your bf’s birthday!”

, To make the wrapping of the gift more fun, include a clue so the person has to guess where they are going on the trip. You may wrap the clue in a box and give the box to the person or include a small clue in an envelope with the card.For example, if the destination is England, you may include a small red telephone booth figurine in the card. Or if the destination is Paris, you may include macaroons and a statue of the Eiffel Tower in a gift box.

, For a more straight-forward option, include the travel tickets in the card so the person sees them when they open the card. Or you may include the travel tickets in a wrapped box so the person can open it and receive their gift.


This may be an ideal option if you have bought plane tickets or train tickets for the trip already and want to include them in the gift. You may also include an image of the hotel or home rental the person will be staying at in the gift.

, One way to give the vacation gift in a fun way is to surprise the person with the trip. You may wrap the trip details in a card and leave it on the person’s pillow for them to find when they wake up. Or you may leave the card somewhere the person will find it, such as under the Christmas tree or in their pile of birthday presents.If you decide to surprise the person with the trip, try to keep the details secret. Instruct others who know about the trip not to tell the person anything so they can be surprised when they finally open their gift.

, Another fun option is to have the person guess the destination using a clue or a series of clues. You may wrap several clues and have the person open them so they can guess where they are going. You may not hand them the travel tickets until the person guesses the destination correctly.


For example, you may tell the person, ""Use these clues to guess where you are going. Once you guess correctly, I'll hand over the travel tickets.""

, If you want to make the gift opening memorable, you may take the person to a specific setting. The setting may relate to the vacation trip or just be a specific place that you and the person enjoy. You may then have the person open the gift in the setting to make the moment extra special.


For example, if you are giving the person a trip to Morocco as a gift, you may take then to a Moroccan restaurant so they can open their gift there. Or if you and the person have a special park bench you go to often, you may have the person open their vacation trip gift at this location.

Learn the rules of the park.",How to Get to Channel Islands National Park1," The park’s website lists all of the expenses you’ll incur during your trip:


General admission to the park is free.
Those wishing to camp on one of the islands will be charged a fee of $15 per campsite per night. The money is used to help preserve the park. Reservations must be made ahead of time, and can be arranged via the National Recreation Reservation Service website. Reservations can be made no more than 5 months in advance.
Visitors who choose to access the islands by boat will be charged between $50 and 75 round trip per person. Children aged 2 and under travel free. Those bringing surfboards along will be charged extra. Reservations can be made either by contacting the park’s visitor center or through the Island Packers Cruises website.
Visitors who elect to access the islands by plane can do so via Channel Islands Aviation. Costs vary depending on which experience you choose. Day trip flights cost roughly $150 to 160 per adult round trip, and $125 to 135 per child. Exclusive camping trip charters are also available during the summer months at a cost of $300 per person (minimum 4 campers), $1,600 for a seven-passenger charter from Camarillo, and $2,000 for a seven-passenger charter from Santa Barbara.;
, As with most national parks, Channel Islands has restrictions on where visitors can go, and what they can do.

Go to every information meeting you can!

",How to Get Ready for Language Traveling," If it's your first trip, this is the best. The family will help you with everything you need to know and it's the best way to experience the country you're visiting. If you live with other students at a hotel, you will most likely have to deal with stuff you can't handle.;
, These trips are normally 3 weeks or more, if you're not staying for a whole year to study in High School. You will need money, passport and loads more. Check the date on your passport and get a new one in time if it's going to run out soon. You need money for food ( if your stuck somewhere with your group ), for entertainment (if you want to shop, go see a movie and more) and tickets for the bus.

Determine your course and destination island.,
Study your destination island’s landing procedures.,
File a formal float plan with the harbormaster prior to leaving.,
Bon Voyage!",How to Get to Channel Islands National Park3," A number of factors should be considered before choosing deciding when and where you plan to go:



Weather: Conditions in the channel vary dramatically, with shifting swells, high waves, and fog making the trip an even greater challenge. Anyone planning to make the voyage should consult the NOAA Weather Service (phone), the Channel Islands Internet Weather Kiosk (online), or weather radio via VHF-FM 162.475 MHz (marine forecast), VHF-FM 162.55 MHz, or VHF-FM 162.40 MHz (land-based observations).

Shipping Lanes: The trip across the channel will take boaters through some of the busiest shipping lanes on the California coast. Those making the trek should be aware of where the shipping lanes are and use extreme caution when crossing them. Additionally, the waters in and around the islands are occasionally shut down for military exercises.

General information: Before making the trip, all boaters should seek out the U.S. Coast Guard’s “Local Notice to Mariners,” which can be obtained by contacting the USCG directly. Nautical charts can be purchased at nearby marine stores, at bookstores, or online.

, It is suggested that boaters consult each island’s respective park ranger before landing. Boaters can use a VHF channel to hail the rangers, who will then ask the boater to switch to a different channel for the purpose of providing a brief orientation, landing instructions, and other details. Here is a brief look at landing protocol for the five major islands:



Santa Barbara Island: No permit is required. Boaters must access the island through the landing cove, as dock access is limited to unloading vessels.

Anacapa Island: No permit is required for boats landing at East Anacapa or Frenchy’s Cove. A permit is required for boats landing at Middle Anacapa and a park ranger must accompany any visitors. Access to West Anacapa is prohibited. Boaters may not use moorings located at East Anacapa; these are reserved for other boats. Visitors must tie their boats a reasonable distance from these moorings. Permits can be obtained via The Nature Conservatory website.

Santa Cruz Island: The eastern quarter of the island is accessible without a permit. Buoy access is prohibited, though boaters are permitted to use the pier at Scorpion Anchorage or Prisoners Harbor. Surf conditions here are particularly treacherous, so boaters are encouraged to use caution. A permit is required to access the remaining three-quarters of the island. Permits can be obtained via The Nature Conservatory website.

Santa Rosa Island: Boaters can use the coastline or beaches to land without a permit, though access is limited to a maximum of one day. Piers are available at Beaches Bay, but visitors may not use area buoys.

San Miguel Island: Boaters may land at Cuyler Harbor or Tyler Bight for overnight stays. Visitors may only land on the beach at Cuyler Harbor.

, The float plan should be as detailed and specific as possible. Be sure to include personal information for every person in the boat, as well as destination specifics (departure time and date, destination), craft specifics (size, age, color), and any emergency equipment you have with you. The more information included, the easier it will be for search crews should trouble arise.

, Enjoy your trip around Channel Islands National Park. If you find that the weather has taken a nasty turn or that you do not have the required safety gear, do not hesitate to turn around and make the trip another time. Safety should always take precedence.

Read the travel policies carefully.,
Arrive at the airport.",How to Get to Channel Islands National Park4," After you decide which kind of trip you would like to make, you can go ahead and reserve a charter through the company’s website. Channel Islands Aviation (CIA) advises interested parties make their reservations at least a week in advance. Refunds are only offered with 72 or more hours of notice.

, Among the things you’ll need to know:



Day trip travelers are permitted just three hours on the beach. A larger group can work out a deal with CIA to stay longer if interested, but arrangements must be made beforehand.

Campers are prohibited from bringing any hazardous materials along with them. This includes any devices used in creating a fire. CIA provides campers with propane once they reach the campsite, but visitors must provide their own stoves.

Animals and bicycles are not allowed. So leave the cat and the Schwinn at home.

, CIA suggests that passengers arrive 45 minutes prior to departure to make sure they have left themselves plenty of time.

Locate the closest airports to the park.,
Research flight prices to find the best deal.,
Purchase your ticket(s).",How to Get to Channel Islands National Park5," There are two main options that should accommodate most visitors to Channel Islands National Park:



Los Angeles International Airport is easily the most convenient option for the majority of travelers. With thousands of incoming and outgoing flights per day, it is one of the busiest airports in the world and provides regular service to every major North American city—though not all flights will be direct.

Santa Barbara Airport is a much smaller airport, but is closer to the park. Flying to Santa Barbara from outside California will almost always require a transfer.

, Check every website that offers discount fares to see if one might be holding a sale to your destination city. If you’re willing to deal with one or even two transfers, you should be able to save some money over opting for a direct flight.

, Bear in mind that you will save money by purchasing non-refundable tickets over refundable ducats, but that you could be left with nothing if you cannot make the flight. Most tickets can be changed for a pre-determined fee.

An expository essay is an essay that provides the reader information about a particular topic. To write an expository essay on an animal, you'll have to choose an animal and provide a variety of information on that animal. It would likely include things like what that animal looks like, what it eats, where it lives, and so on.Choose an animal that personally interests you.

, Research is the backbone of a solid expository essay. Once you've chosen your topic and learned the proper structure, you can begin researching.


To start researching, ask yourself what kind of information you're looking for. Do you want opinion pieces or pure factual pieces? Do you want researched analysis or personal reflections? For an expository essay, you may want to stick to more neutral sources as you're just presenting information to the reader.
Look for sources that are valid. Major newspapers like the New York Times and the San Francisco Chronicle are a good place to start. You also might want to find some history behind your topic. Go your school's library and ask a librarian to help you use the card catalogue to locate books and magazines on your topic. An encyclopedia could be a good reference for an expository essay.The internet is a major source of information and can be extremely helpful when researching. However, you should know how to evaluate sources before relying on the internet for information. Look for current resources so you know the information is up-to-date. Go for websites associated with universities or government organizations, with domains like .edu and .gov, over business or commercials websites. Go for pages where the author's name is clearly visible and the page is easy to navigate. Personal blogs are not a good resource. Websites for organizations advocating strongly for a particular political cause may have a strong bias. Avoid sites like Wikipedia, as they are user generated and may not have accurate information.Take notes while researching. Keep a notebook with you and jot down relevant information. Write down which source you got this information from so you can refer to the source later on. If possible, print out your own copies of library texts so you can underline and write notes in the margins.

, An outline is a work of writing that breaks down your the body of your paper. An outline can be a helpful tool to have when you begin writing.


Outlines are usually formed using a series of numbers and letter. You write down main points as headings and then expand upon these points in subheadings.For example, you can use roman numerals as headings and then use letters as subheadings. Say you're writing about potbelly pigs. You can start with I. Introduction. Then something like a. Introduce my topic, including a brief description of potbelly pigs and b. briefly state the personality traits and appearance of a potbelly pig.You don't need to use full sentences in an outline. It's just a tool to help you organize your ideas. Don't worry about forming full sentences or thoughts yet. You can get to that during the writing process.

, The first step of an expository essay is your introduction. The introduction is a place for you to state ideas clearly and give your reader a sense of what your essay will discuss.


Begin your introduction with a fun opening sentence that gets the reader's attention. You can open with a question, a quote, a joke, or anything that introduces your topic in a creative manner. For example, let's return to the potbelly pig example. Open with something like, ""Did you know that not all pigs are farmyard animals? Some pigs are kept domestically as pets."" This invites the reader to think about your topic.From there, briefly state what you'll be discussing in your paper. You can provide a brief description of a potbelly pig, including things like a brief overview of their appearance and personality traits.

, An expository essay should inform the reader about a given subject. As you move through your essay, each paragraph should focus on a single idea or claim about your animal.


For example, in the potbelly pig example, one paragraph can describe the appearance of a potbelly pig. Another paragraph can then describe the eating habits of a potbelly pig, and another can talk about how to care for potbelly pigs, health problems they're prone to, and so on.
Make sure you stick to one main topic per paragraph.

, Back up any information you've provided with your own research. Use your sources, while making sure to put information in your own words.


Go to your sources for support of the information you're listing. If you're talking about how potbelly pigs are prone to bacterial infections in the ear, you'll need a source that shows that this is true.

, Once you've finished the main body of your paper, you'll need to write a conclusion. A good conclusion should not just reiterate your thesis but offer some additional insight after leading the reader through a series of arguments.


Certain questions can help guide a good conclusion. Did you think of any new ideas about the animal you're researching? Are there any questions or concerns that need further research? What larger significance does your topic have in the bigger world?However, you should not suddenly introduce new information in the conclusion. Instead, you should speculate and reflect on the information provided. Think of a good closing line that will stay in readers' minds. You want to make sure your essay has an impact., Once you finish the first draft of your essay, it's a good idea to write a second draft. Another draft will allow you to further expand upon ideas in your original work. You should never turn a paper in after a single draft. It might be a good idea to wait a day or so before writing a second draft as you'll have time to rest and further digest your ideas. Start your paper early so you have time for a first and second draft.


Watch transitions between paragraphs. You want to make sure the information flows in your paper. You don't want to jump quickly between topics as this can confuse readers. Make sure there is a transition sentence at the end of each paragraph, alerting the reader as to what you'll be discussing next.

A good way to structure transitions is to make them a bridge between the old paragraph and the new. For example, to connect a paragraph on keeping a potbelly pig as a pet to a previous paragraph about eating habits, you could use something like this: ""Although potbelly pigs can eat a variety of things in the wild, if you're keeping a potbelly pig as a pet, you need to be more careful about providing a balanced diet."" The word Although sets up a connection between the ideas.


Focus on clarity. You want to make sure the information is presented in as straightforward means as possible. If you notice any sentences that seem unclear in your first draft, work on rewording them in revision.

, Once you finish your second draft, proofread. Keep an eye out for spelling and grammar errors, as well as typos and missed words. It can sometimes be hard to spot mistakes in your own work. Reading your paper backwards, that is starting with the conclusion and reading up, can help. It also might help to set your paper aside for a few days. That way, when proofreading you're reading what's written and not what's in your head.

, As it can be hard to spot your own errors, having a friend or family member look over your paper can help. In addition to allowing you spot typos and errors, a trusted friend or family member can also give you feedback on how to improve the overall structure of the piece. Ask for honest feedback and be open to criticism.

Check travel regulations before you pack.,
Make a photocopy of your passport and other important documents.,
Protect travel documents and small valuables.,
Pack clothes that are easy to wash and don't wrinkle easily.,
Roll your clothes.,
Hang on to your laptop.,
Bring some plastic bags.,
Make sure you can keep your devices charged.,
Take along extra digital camera memory.,
Make your contracts for housing before leaving.,
Research your telephone options before you go.",How to Get Organized for Travel," Since new air travel regulations are always popping up, it’s a good idea to do a little pre-packing research if you’ll be going by plane. By investing a few minutes into finding out what you can and can’t take with you, you’ll save yourself the hassle of having to abandon any of your belongings at the airport’s security checkpoint.;
, Keeping a copy of the front page of your passport, personal identification, and credit card information is important should any of the originals be lost, stolen or destroyed! A copy leaves you with makeshift identification, and can help expedite the process of replacing your travel documents. Don't forget to make a copy of the back side of your credit cards as this is usually where the contact information for the company is and what you will need in case your original gets lost or stolen. Always be sure to keep the copies separated from the originals, so that you don’t lose both in one shot! It is good practice to have copies in your suitcase, on your carry-on, and back at home with a friend or family member. The originals should stay with you.

, If you’re going to be roughing it on your trip (especially around water), consider keeping travel documents, currency and other small valuables safe in impact-resistant, watertight, buoyant containers… they’ll help to keep your effects safe, dry and in one piece!

, If you’re not sure about what kind of laundry facilities will be available at your destination, it’s probably not the best idea to leave home with a bunch of “Dry Clean Only” items! Instead, opt for clothes that will stand up to washing, whether in machines or by hand in the bathroom sink.

, Nothing saves room in your suitcase like neatly rolling clothes instead of folding them… you won’t believe how much you’ll be able to fit into one bag! Rolling also has the added advantages of being easier than folding, and rolled clothing isn’t as likely to get wrinkled and full of creases (so there’s less ironing to do when you unpack). You may also want to invest in some travel clothing packs. They are fairly inexpensive and can be any size. They are breathable but zip up allowing you to fit more items than you normally would as well as keep things seperate such as shirts in one, pants in another, undergarments in yet another. This not only gives you more space but really helps keep you organized during the whole trip.

, Whenever you travel by air with a laptop, don’t check it with the rest of your luggage… always treat it as a carry-on. Keeping your laptop in your possession at all times will prevent it from being damaged through mishandling, and helps to ensure that the personal information stored in your computer doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.

, An empty plastic bag tucked into a suitcase can turn out to be a traveler’s best friend! The next time you go to the supermarket, save the bags that you brought your groceries home in, and take them along on your next trip… you’ll be amazed for how many uses you find for them! They’re great for keeping dirty laundry separate from clean items. You can also use plastic bags for wrapping shoes before your toss them into a suitcase with all your clothes, or for isolating toiletries like shampoo and lotion while they’re packed (just in case the bottles start leaking).

, Being on the road can make it quite a challenge to keep small electronics like cell phones and PDAs charged. Think about investing in a portable DC adapter… because they work with both your car’s lighter port and the DC outlets on airplanes, you’ll be able to stay powered-up and connected no matter how you’re traveling!

, Whether you spend them visiting family or exploring exotic locales, vacations are full of once-in-a-lifetime photo ops…so make sure that you won’t have to pass any up because you’ve run out of camera memory! Always tuck an extra memory card or stick into your digital camera’s holding case for emergencies. Remember: breathtaking sunsets and spontaneous moments can’t be put on hold for a trip to the electronics store!

, It is much easier to gather information and make decisions at home than while traveling in a foreign country. If you prefer to not be locked into one accommodation (or to see it first), then build that into your plans, by committing to the first day only, and by gathering detailed information on your options before going to check them out.

, Knowing the local calling procedures and prices can save you a lot of grief should a tough situation arise that requires phone calls. Cell phones can be used to dial emergency numbers, and also to stay in contact with trusted friends and suppliers locally and back at home when other telephoning options are difficult. Whether you rent a cell phone locally (expensive), use your home-country cell phone plan (moderately expensive), a special traveling plan offered by that company (less expensive), or use a local pre-paid plan (often least expensive), know your options before getting there (and you will save time and risk in the long run). It is always a good idea to check with your service provider to see if they have a call/text/data plan and find out if one of their options will work for you. If you have an unlocked GSM cell phone that has a frequency that is used locally, then you have the most options. You can usually use your home country plan, and also plug in a SIM chip from any local GSM cell phone provider. These chips can be bought at cell phone stores in most countries, or on the internet before leaving, and often the pre-paid plans have fixed rates and very low charges for the SIM chip (like USD$5-20). Calling cards that you buy in your home country (in the USA at least) that allow calling from any telephone in the country of travel, can also be quite helpful in fixing your prices and security in being able to call.

Be familiar with the locations in the body of sensory and motor neurons.",How to Learn and Understand the Functions of Sensory Neurons in Humans," The types of neurons in the human body include sensory as well as motor neurons. Generally speaking, neurons are specialized cells of the nervous system of all living systems including mammalians. The two main neuronal types in humans are motor and sensory neurons. Sensory neurons are one type of cells that is very important for the proper communication of the body with the environment. Without these neurons the body would be considered in a state of partial death due to the lack of its ability to communicate with the surrounding environment.;
, Sensation is an important physiological process that is crucial for the sustaining of life of the living tissue. For example instinctual needs of humans such as the need to urinate and defecate are mediated through sensory neurons that are located in the urinary bladder and in the nervous system of the alimentary canal. These sensory neurons send electrical signals that are formed through action potentials to the brain where it is perceived by specialized neurons in the sensory area of the cerebral cortex. In turn motor neurons of the cerebral cortex also initiate the processes of defecation and urination by giving orders to the urinary bladder muscles and the muscles of the colon. These orders include the relaxation of the sphincters of the urinary bladder and the increased peristaltic motion of the colon wall. These two actions involve the muscles of these two structures.

, The result is the expulsion of urine from the urinary bladder and the feces from the colon. These two processes are two basic but very important physiological processes that maintain the normal function of the body. Neurological defects in these sensory or motor neurons can lead to problems in performing these two processes. This can have clinical manifestations such as the development of megacolon and the retention of urine in the body. Retention of urine in the body can lead to the accumulation of waste chemicals in the body to toxic levels such as ammonia and creatinine. Also high blood pressure and edema can develop as a result of this. These two basic processes are just one manifestation of the importance of sensory neurons in humans. Also other instinctual needs of the body are very dependent on the intact structure of sensory neurons in the body.

, The ability of humans and animals to see is dependent on sensory neurons in the eyes that are located in the retinal structure of this essential organ. These sensory neurons of the retinal eye are of two types. One is called rods and the other is called cons. These two types of sensory neurons are specialized in converting light waves into electrical signals that propagate through the optic nerve of the eye to the brain stem where they are perceived by other neurons that have synapses with the rods and cons neurons of the retina. This are of the brain is called the geniculate body. From there the signal proceeds through other synaptic neurons into the visual sensory cortex at the posterior part of the brain in humans. This is basically the process that involves the sensation of vision in humans. Other types of sensations in humans include the sensation of hearing and smelling. Both of these two types of sensations have specialized types of neuronal cells that are sensory in its nature.

, Sensory neurons of the ear are located within the inner ear in a structure that is called cochlea. This structure contains a liquid material within it that can lead to the propagation of auditory signals if deformed mechanically. This deformation process can lead to the formation of action potential in the sensory neurons of the inner ear. This in turn can lead to the propagation of hearing sounds that were converted into electrical signals to the brain stem of the brain. In the brain stem specialized auditory sensory neurons synapse with neurons of the inner ear. These neurons in the brain stem in turn synapse with other sensory neurons that terminate in the sensory auditory cortex of the brain in humans. There they are evaluated and perceived as intact sound.

, The sensation of smelling has similar anatomic progress along the sensory neurons of the nervous system of humans. The sensation of smelling is initiated with specialized sensory neurons at the upper side of the inner nose in humans. These sensory neurons are specialized in converting smelling sensations that are usually obtained through the action of special organic chemical compounds on the epithelial neuronal cells of the nose. These chemical compounds induce action potentials in these sensory neurons that initiate and propagate electrical signals into the brain stem of humans brain. There they synapse with other sensory neurons that are located in specialized clusters of neurons that are called nuclei. From there these electrical signals propagate through other synaptic sensory neurons into the specialized area in the cerebral cortex that is specific for the modality of smell sensation.

, In general, all types of sensory neurons in the intact nervous system of humans synapse with other sensory neurons at two basic levels. One of these locations is the spinal cord. The other location of synaptic sensory neurons is the brain stem in humans. The eventual processing of these sensory signals occurs in sensory neurons that are located in specialized areas of the cerebral cortex. This is a general anatomical map of the pathways for the propagation of electrical signals along sensory neurons in the nervous system of humans.

, Similar anatomical pathways are seen with motor neurons with the difference that these motor neurons descend to the spinal cord and the neurons of skeletal muscles instead of ascending to the brain as occurs with the sensory neurons. The other sensations such as heat and cold sensations occur mainly within sensory neurons that are located within the epithelium of the intact skin in humans. These sensory neurons of the skin are very developed neuronal systems that are of different anatomical structures. These sensory neurons contain free nerve endings that can sense and evaluate various modalities of sensations such as pain sensation. Free nerve endings are the main type of receptors for sensory stimuli in the intact nervous system of humans. Similar situations occur in organs of the body that are located within the digestive system for example.

, Internal organs of the body have also specialized sensory neurons that mostly are specialized for the mediation of pain sensation into the brain. This is very important in the case of pathological conditions of these organs of the body. For example pathology of either the kidney or the liver can lead to the sensation of pain. This can occur for example by the stretching of the tissue of the capsules in these two structures.

Look for a rasp!,
Observe the shape of the raspberry.,
Consider the timing.,
Inspect the plant.,
Finished.

",How to Tell Raspberries and Blackberries Apart," Both raspberries and blackberries produce aggregate fruits composed of many small, single-seeded droplets held together with microscopic hairs. The droplets form around the outside of a core, or rasp.


When raspberries are picked, the cluster of drupelets that we call a raspberry slips off the rasp, leaving it behind. In blackberries, the receptacle breaks off where it connects to the stem and remains inside the fruit.

When a ripe blackberry is picked, the stem left behind is clean and flat, and the berry has a soft white core inside it. The blackberry is not hollow.
;
, If you're looking at a raspberry that's red, it might be a ripe red raspberry, or an unripe black raspberry.


Red raspberries tend to be more oblong in shape (similar to blackberries, actually). Most cultivated raspberries are of this type. The rasp is quite large.
Black raspberries tend to be more rounded, or half-spherical in shape, not oblong like red raspberries. The rasp is very small, but you can tell that it's a raspberry because the berry will be hollow.


, Both red and black raspberries tend to ripen in July, although this will vary with how far north or south they're growing. Blackberries tend to ripen a just a little later than raspberries. There may be some overlap in their seasons.

, The plants look roughly the same to those not familiar with them. All have ""canes,"" that is, long stems coming directly out of the ground. All three have thorns or prickers, and all have similar leaves. But if you look closely, you'll begin to see some differences between the three types.


Red raspberry canes are not nearly as tall as blackberry canes. Red raspberries are about 5 feet (1.5 m) high. When the stems come up out of the ground, they have a pale green color to them. The stems have more thorns than blackberries, but they are more ""fuzzy"", and not heavy like rose thorns.

Black raspberry canes are shorter than those of red raspberry and bend back towards the ground.

The stems have a very pale color, almost bluish, that ""rubs off"" if you rub the stem. The thorns are somewhere in between red raspberries and blackberries in both the number of the thorns on the stem, and also how large the thorns themselves are.

The canes of the blackberries are huge and very vigorous, growing up to 10 feet (3.0 m) in height. The stems themselves are green, and the thorns are substantial, resembling rose thorns.

Confirm your flights and accommodation the night before you leave. Print off any receipts for travel and accommodation you've paid for online in case you need them.


If you're lucky enough to be flying to your weekend destination, don't forget ID. You'll need ID at the airport when you check in.
If you are staying at a friend's holiday house, make sure they're still expecting you and that you know where to collect the keys from. *Check if they have a DVD/Ipod player where you're staying. If they do, you can always take your Ipod and a few DVDs with you.;
, What are you going to do for the time you'll be away?


Are you headed somewhere tropical and warm? You'll need sunglasses, short sleeved tees or singlets, light trousers/shorts or skirts, and flip flops or sandals.
Headed somewhere cold? You'll need warm pants, sweaters, gloves, socks, warm shoes and something warm to sleep in.
Headed out for dinner to fancy places? Take a smart/casual outfit and shoes to match.
Pack things that won't crush or crease in your bag, unless of course, you enjoy ironing!

, At a minimum, you'll need:


Two changes of clothes - and enough underwear- for each day you'll be away.
An evening outfit especially if you know you're headed somewhere fancy.
Swimmers, sunglasses and sunblock if you plan to swim or sunbathe.
Running shoes and clothes if you plan to exercise while you're away.
Stuff to sleep in - unless you are comfortable with your travel companions knowing you sleep naked!
Always pack one light sweater or jacket in case the weather changes.

,,


Pack everything the night before you go. Don't forget your cell/mobile charger. If you have a book you've been dying to finish, throw that in too.
Most hotels have decent toiletries, but if you know you prefer your own (or you have skin allergies and need your own stuff) pack them. *It's always a good idea to put toiletries into a zip lock travel bag, or even into plastic bags, in case they break/ leak during transit.
Solid perfume is a good travel alternative to perfume bottles. You can avoid a perfume/aftershave bottle breaking in transit by putting it inside a shoe.

, If you couldn't bear to lose it, either hide it well in your luggage, wear it every day you're there or leave it at home.

, Seasoned travellers leave room in their bag for the goodies they buy and bring home, or take an empty tote bag they can fill up later.

Include page numbers.,
Add headings for your sections.",How to Write a Biology Lab Report," It should give a clear idea of what the experiment was about. If you have a specific result you should also state it. Don’t overthink the title, just describe the experiment. Do not make it longer than ten words.A good example for a title would be: ""Effects of various chemicals on the growth of Escherichia coli."";
, You want to be sure you receive credit for the work. If you have a group report include the name of all students in your group.

, Your instructor may have a specific set of instructions. If not, you just want to make it easy for them to keep track of your work.

, The introduction should give the framework for the report and shows that you understand the purpose of the study. Explain what you are studying, why it is important and how you are going to attempt to gain knowledge in your study., These are the results that you expect to observe over the course of the experiment. The hypothesis is not always going to be confirmed by the results, rather it is just the prediction made prior to performing the experiment. A good hypothesis will begin with ""We hypothesized..."" and end with the anticipated outcome of the experiment, ""that X affects Y.""

, Include any historical or theoretical background that is relevant to the research. This is usually accomplished by a literature review of published, peer-reviewed, primary materials.Define terminology. If your report uses any specific terminology or jargon, explain it in the introduction.
Use the appropriate word usage to explain what you are doing. You are likely trying to test, document, or describe something. You cannot prove, verify, or demonstrate the truth about something as this is not possible within the realm of science.

, This section is not always include in lab reports. An abstract is a very concise summary of the entire experiment. It should cover why the experiment was conducted, what methods were used, what was the main result, and what were your overall conclusions. Often, this section is only one paragraph (100-200 words) in length.

, Incorporate the material descriptions into the procedural explanation as the items were used during the experiment. Include specific amounts, times and measurements.

, The level of detail should be high enough to allow someone else to duplicate your experiment, without including any unnecessary information that may overwhelm the reader. Describe how you gathered specimens, or if the experiment was done outside you can describe weather that could be a factor on the experiment. If you can reproduce the experiment without the information, then you should leave it out.

, It should read like an accounting of what you did, not an instruction manual. For example, ""We made a solution of 3 oz. of water with 1 oz. of iodine."" This section is usually written in the first person perspective, using either active or passive voice. Some academic requirements use third-person perspective. Try to keep the writing as straightforward and easy to follow as possible.

, This is the collection of all the factual data obtained from your experiment. State the results in the text first, then use visual aids to show the data. Tables and graphs are not self-explanatory and have to be described and explained to the reader in the text.For example, ""An increase in bacteria was found at a temperatures higher than 60º F, but the bacteria levels decreased below 40º F.""

, Charts, tables and graphs are often useful in presenting this information in an easy to understand format. Every chart, table or graph should be labelled.It should also have an accompanying paragraph explaining the information it contains.

, You want to make sure these are made clear to the reader in the results. Do not interpret the data in the results. Interpreting the data will be done in the concluding section.

, Try not to copy from the data section. Highlight key points of information from the data that are most relevant to drawing your conclusion, then elaborate with your interpretation of the data.

, Comment on what you think may have caused the error. Offer an explanation how could the experiment be changed to correct them. Only discuss errors if they are verified by data in your study. If rainy conditions seemed to influence the unexpected outcome, then state that. But do not state that rainy conditions could have caused errors if there is no evidence to support it.

, This is where you interpret the results of the experiment. Accept or reject your hypothesis and explain why. Your goal is to convince the reader that you completely understand the data and have considered it fully and intelligently.Accepting or rejecting your hypothesis can be done easily by stating ""Our hypothesis was accepted/rejected because..."" Then continue with your explanation.

, Having a longer conclusion doesn’t make it better. Just present the information that is relevant to your conclusion in an organized and logical manner.

, Use a formal bibliography format such as APA or MLA, depending on your report criteria.

, Make sure any sources are properly credited. You don’t want to have your hard work discredited because you forgot to cite a source. Schools and professors take plagiarism very seriously and it can have serious consequences.

, They prefer that you paraphrase all your sources and present the ideas in your own words. You can weave the information into your text with a simple lead in phrase and by adding a parenthetical note.


Paraphrasing can be confusing. You can't just change a few words. For example, ""Most professors do not want to see quotations in a lab report,"" can be paraphrased as ""Using quotations to quote sources for your lab report is frowned upon by many professors."" The idea is still clear, though the sentence is unique and original.

, The font size should be in 12 pt unless otherwise specified your instructor. Use a traditional font such as Arial or Times New Roman.

, Check with your professor to see what is acceptable for your class.

, Some instructors will prefer them at the top of the page and some may prefer the bottom. Be consistent in their placement from page to page. Also, check to see if any additional information, such as your last name, is required on each page.

, Each section should be clearly titled and follow this appropriate order:

Focus your high school curriculum.,
Aim for relevant work experience early on.,
Get good grades.,
Choose an appropriate college or university.,
Complete your program of study.,
Complete an internship in botany.",How to Become a Botanist1," Most high schools require specific courses in order to graduate, but there are ways you can focus your studies and learn some important skills during your high school years to help you during college.


In addition to required coursework, choose courses in chemistry, physics, and biology. The more science, the better, but don't forget to also devote yourself to studying English (or your local language), math, and the humanities-- these are all important for your college success and will be used throughout any career.Study a foreign language. You can get a leg up on college studies by beginning your foreign language skills now and honing them further throughout college. If you know a country you'd like to work in, choose that language; if you're American and you don't know what language to choose, learn Spanish, which is increasingly valuable for job seekers in the United States.;
, If you need to take a job during high school or college to support yourself, don't just waste your time at the local fast food restaurant or daycare when you could be using those years to gain valuable work experience. Any experience you gain now in plant-related jobs will help you secure work later on.


Apply for a job with your local plant nursery. You will learn valuable skills about plant identification and care.
Consider landscaping. Mowing lawns may not seem like the job of a botanist, but landscaping requires knowledge of plant diets, climates, plant diseases, and a host of other relevant skills related to botany.
Other choices for part-time or summer work during the high school years include work in a park or farm; florist; or summer camps, particularly science- or outdoor-themed camps., Graduate at the top of your class so that you can attend a well-regarded college with a good reputation in the biological sciences and a good career placement rate. Applying yourself to your studies will not only help you to get the grades you need, it will also increase your skills and knowledge needed to succeed in your career.


Establish study skills early on. Check out this helpful wikiHow guide to learn about establishing and implementing study skills that will help you succeed throughout high school and college.
Develop your research skills. In addition to studying the material you learn in your classes, it is important that you learn how to do your own research from start to finish: that means studying the existing literature on a topic, gathering data, evaluating your data, and writing it up in a report. Take assignments seriously that ask you to research a topic. Visit your local library if you need help with your research skills.

, This will depend on your career goals, your financial resources, and how well you've done in high school in order to get accepted to the college of your choice.


When selecting a college or university, consider the specializations and majors at each school. Larger universities tend to offer more choices for courses and majors and more opportunities to work with professors on research projects, but they also tend to be more expensive and selective in admissions. Smaller colleges may only have a general botany major, but they may meet the requirements of what you need for your career and be more affordable.
Don't overlook rural areas in your search. While a lot of students hope to attend college in a big city or on the coast, many colleges and universities in more rural areas have very well regarded programs in agricultural science or related fields because of their locations in agrarian communities.

, Most undergraduate degrees take four years to complete, and you want to be sure to maximize those years so that you learn all the needed knowledge and skills for your chosen career.


It is helpful if you research and decide early on what you want to do with your degree so that you can focus your program of study and specialize if possible. However, be sure to take into account what jobs are actually hiring and don't just choose based on what you enjoy the most. Many college graduates learn the hard way that just because you love a specific field does not mean you will find a job in that field.
Take core courses such as physics, biology, chemistry, plant pathology, horticulture and agronomy; these will differ depending on your university's offerings and major requirements. Also think about what types of courses will be helpful in your particular career field. Will knowing Spanish be important? Will it be useful to be proficient in computers and software? What about business management, communication, or geography? Sometimes the courses that are not required in a program of study are still necessary for your career success.

, The internship helps you gain the experience you need to become a botanist. Many internships during your junior or senior year of college lead to job offers and help to kick-start your career, so begin talking to your professors early on in your studies to determine what places to apply.


Where you intern should depend on what you hope to specialize in during your career. It will also help you to know if you've made a good choice before committing to a full-time job.
Good professors and advisors will be able to help you locate local businesses with opportunities for interns, but some places to consider include: the local government's parks and recreation department, any local zoo or botanical garden, research internships with faculty, wilderness programs, national parks, or large industrial companies that work with plant sciences like Monsanto, Pfizer, or others that are local to you.

Earn an undergraduate degree in biological science.,
Prepare for graduate school.,
Attend graduate school.,
Work as a botanist.",How to Become a Botanist2," An undergraduate degree takes approximately 4 years to finish. When selecting your college, consider the biological science specializations each school has. For example, larger universities may offer a major in botany along with specializations such as plant pathology, agronomy or horticulture. However, a smaller college may have only a general botany major.


Take core requirement courses such as physics, biology, chemistry, plant pathology, horticulture and agronomy.
Complete undergraduate electives like math, English and speech, paying close attention to what might be useful in your career path.
Complete an internship in botany. The internship helps you gain the experience you need to become a botanist.

, Many careers in botany require graduate training (at the Master's or doctoral level), but attending graduate school takes some forethought and planning. Don’t rush into it: it is a huge commitment of time and money, and you want to be sure you find the right program for you.


Research graduate school programs and find several you're interested in attending. Consider the programs of study offered, the program's prestige, the location of the school, and the packages available to graduate students (tuition waivers, stipends, health insurance, research opportunities, teaching opportunities, etc.) when narrowing down your choices.
If you plan to attend an American university, take and pass the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), a standardized test needed to enter graduate school. The GRE tests verbal and quantitative reasoning and writing skills.Ask professors for letters of recommendation. Hopefully you established close mentoring relationships with your undergraduate professors and they will be able to attest to your work ethic, interest in plant science, and experience in research to date. Don't ask anyone if you are unsure what type of review they would give you.
Complete application requirements such as sending in a letter of intent, application fee, official transcripts and a resume. Graduate school admission committees are typically composed of faculty who will be working with the admitted students, and they tend to admit students that they think will help them with their own research, so be sure to tailor your letter of intent to mention your specific interests in botany and the faculty you want to work with and why. Consider applying to several of your top schools because you are unlikely to be accepted to all of them, especially if your GRE or undergraduate grades are less than stellar or if you have no research or other background in botany.

, Depending on your program of study, this could take anywhere between two and seven years to complete.


A master's degree in biological science usually takes 2 years to complete. You take courses in botany, participate in fieldwork and complete a thesis.A doctorate degree in biological science takes 5 to 6 years to finish if you are able to attend full-time, and longer if you have to work and attend part-time. A doctorate degree generally combines fieldwork and classroom instruction, extensive laboratory research and the completion of a dissertation., Now that you have completed your advanced training, you can begin to apply for and accept a position as a botanist in your field of expertise, working in industry, government, public policy, or as a professor.


You can gain practical experience and additional job opportunities through temporary postdoctoral positions at a local university. Temporary postdoctoral fellowships provide a way to publish research findings and earn a permanent faculty or researching position and also help fill up your resume or curriculum vita.
You can obtain a job through the college career placement center, online job websites, networking or classified job advertisements.
Advancement opportunities for botanists include becoming lead researchers, consultants and managerial positions. Working as a lead botanist researcher includes directing other botanists and botany technicians in research projects. A botanist consultant consists of helping government agencies and businesses with botany issues. A managerial botanist means handling administrative duties such as obtaining funding for research projects.
Attend seminars, workshops and courses and read academic journals to keep up to date with plant science advancements.

Visit the library.,
Take advantage of the internet.,
Consider other local resources.",How to Become a Botanist3," The non-fiction section of the local library often contains many resources on botany. Narrow down your search by considering what exactly you want to learn about (local native plant life? gardening? plant diseases?) and then searching for those types of titles.


Ask the librarian for help to find relevant books you might have overlooked.
If your local library has more than one branch, go online and search the catalog of available books. Sometimes your local branch many not have a copy of a book that you might need, but you can request it from another branch and it will be sent to you.
Don't forget that libraries are resources for more than just books: they often have classes and workshops on topics related to the community, and many libraries offer courses in plants and gardening, particularly in the springtime.

, There are so many resources online for learning about plants and plant care-- there has never been a better time to learn about botany from the comfort of your own home.


If you know what you are interested in learning more about, a simple internet search can yield hours of reading material.
Join a message board or Facebook group that focuses on your area of interest. There are so many to choose from: there are groups that focus on everything from citrus care to tomato blight! Not only will you get advice and answers from people who love to share their knowledge, but you might also make friends with similar interests.

, Depending on where you live, you may have access to many types of places for hands-on learning about plant life.


Check out local farms, orchards, or vineyards and chat up the owners. They usually love to share their knowledge and may even welcome you back as a volunteer if you want to help out and learn more.
Visit the local nursery or even the big-box home improvement store to learn about plants that thrive in your local environment.
Check for local clubs or groups like a gardening club, master gardeners, urban farmers, or horticulturalists. You can sometimes find information about groups on community bulletin boards at libraries or coffee shops, or check online to find information about more tech-savvy groups.

For example the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine are both neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system that are derived biochemically from the amino acid tyrosine.",How to Understand the Biological Importance of Amino Acids in the Body of Humans," This article tries to emphasize the importance of amino acids and their derivatives in the body of humans and in mammalians in general. Nature has selected these organic compounds as building blocks of macromolecules in the body that serve important functions that sustain states of homeostasis in the body or put it in simple words it supports the maintaining of life in the individuals. Amino acids are among many other chemical compounds that have biological importance in living systems of variable structural complexities. It is known experimentally the role of these organic amino acids in the body of humans. Their importance in the body stems from the fact that they are used as the building blocks of proteins in the body.;
, Proteins are polymers of amino acids that have diverse structural and functional roles in the body of humans. These proteins are constructed biochemically in the cells of the body using metabolic reactions that are very organized and accurate in its chemical selectivity as far as metabolic products are concerned. Besides its use in constructing proteins in the various cells of the body amino acids have other biological uses in the body of humans. This includes their use as chemical precursors for the synthesis of various neurotransmitters of neurons of the nervous system.

, These neurotransmitters are very important for the normal functioning of the various branches of the nervous system in humans. For this reason the study of the chemistry of amino acids at the biochemical level is very crucial to the understanding of the various metabolic products that arise from these amino acids in the body. There are 20 known amino acids in the body of humans. Also there are unusual types of amino acids that have no biological roles that are concerned with the production of proteins in the body such the atypical amino acid that is called gamma-amino-butyric-acid or shortly GABA. This atypical amino acid is known experimentally to have biological effect on the central nervous system that is inhibitory in its biological nature. Most information about the biological effects of these amino acids come from experimental observations from experiments on laboratory animals. Amino acids are unusual organic compounds that have both amino group and a carboxyl group on the same molecule.

, This chemical structure is very unusual in the sense that this type of compounds contains both an acid and a base at the same molecule that are adjacent to each other within the molecule. This chemical structure of amino acids is pH dependent. This means that deprotonation of the Bronsted carboxylic acid is dependent on the pH or acidity of the blood or the solution that contains them. Humans have the biochemical machinery to synthesize part of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. They are synthesized in the cells of the body using specific metabolic reactions that are catalyzed by using specific enzymes that serve this function of amino acids synthesis.

, Unfortunately not all 20 amino acids that are usually incorporated into the molecular skeleton of all proteins in the body are possible to synthesize in the body. This is so due to the absence of suitable metabolic pathways in the body which are specific for the synthesis of these essential amino acids in the body. Also there is absence of suitable enzymes for catalyzing these absent biochemical processes of essential amino acids synthesis in the body.

, The metabolic pathways for the biochemical synthesis of these nonessential amino acids are well known and have been reported in the various chemical literature. Their incorporation into the molecular structure of proteins is also a well known biochemical process that is called translational process. This process of proteins translation is based on genetic coding of amino acids using codons of DNA bases. Each codon constitutes of three DNA bases that code for one amino acid. These amino acids are transported in the cells to a cellular organ that is called a ribosome. At this site all amino acids are combined together to form the molecular structure of the specific protein that they serve to synthesize.

, This translational process is very dependent on the normal function of the genetic material in the particular cell that is used to synthesize the specific protein. Defects in the genetic material of the body cell can lead to defective biochemical synthesis of proteins that can be very crucial to the normal body function. This can occur for example with the biochemical synthesis of key enzymes in the body. Enzymes are one type of proteins that serve as catalysts for biochemical reactions in the body. These enzymes are a special class of enzymes that differ than other types of proteins by the presence of active site within their structure. This active site is known to be the place where the catalysis of certain biochemical reactions occurs. Amino acids in this active site are also suspected to participate in the catalytic process of the various metabolic reactions in the body. Also amino acids have biological roles that are concerned with the biochemical production of neurotransmitters in the neurons of the nervous system. Most known neurotransmitters of the nervous system of humans are derivatives of amino acids.

, These two neurotransmitters have biological effects on activating the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system in humans. Also other known neurotransmitters that are synthesized from amino acids precursors include the two neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. These two neurotransmitters have psychiatric effects such as their effects on the mood of the person and their effect on the cognitive function of his brain. Some other amino acids are known to be neurotransmitters of the neurons of nervous system by themselves. An example is the amino acid glycine. Other atypical amino acid that has function as a neurotransmitter is called GABA. This atypical amino acid is known experimentally to induce sedative effects on patients that administer this amino acid. This amino acid is not incorporated into the structure of all proteins in the body of humans but is used clinically to treat patients that have episodes of anxiety and who suffer from panic attacks.

Understand the concept of genes.,
Understand the concept of sexual reproduction.,
Understand the concept of alleles.,
Understand the concept of dominant and recessive alleles.",How to Work With Punnett Squares1," Before learning how to make and use Punnett squares, it's necessary to get some important basics out of the way. The first is the idea that all living things (from tiny microbes to giant blue whales) have genes. Genes are incredibly complex, microscopic sets of instructions encoded into almost every single cell in an organism's body. Genes are responsible, in some way, for virtually every aspect of an organism's life, including the way it looks, the way it behaves, and much, much more.


One concept that's important to understand when working with Punnett squares is that living things get their genes from their parents.You are probably already aware of this subconsciously. Think — don't the people you know seem to be similar to their parents in the way they look and act, generally?

, Most (but not all) of the organisms you are aware of in the world around you make children via sexual reproduction. That is, a female parent and a male parent each contribute their genes to make a child with about half of its genes from each parent. A Punnett square is basically a way of showing the different possibilities that can occur from this half-and-half exchange of genes in the form of a graph.


Sexual reproduction isn't the only form of reproduction out there. Some organisms (like many strains of bacteria) reproduce via asexual reproduction, which is when one parent makes a child all by itself. In asexual reproduction, all of the child's genes come from one parent, so the child is more or less a copy of its parent.

, As mentioned above, an organism's genes are basically a set of instructions that tell every cell in the organism's body how to live. In fact, just like an instruction manual is divided into different chapters, sections, and subsections, different parts of an organism's genes tell it how to do different things. If one of these ""subsections"" is different between two organisms, the two organisms may look or behave differently — for instance, genetic differences may lead one person to have black hair and another to have blonde hair. These different forms of the same gene are called alleles.


Because a child gets two sets of genes — one from each parent — it will have two copies of every allele.

, A child's alleles do not always ""share"" their genetic power. Some alleles, called dominant alleles, will manifest in the child's looks and behavior (we call this ""being expressed"") by default. Others, called recessive alleles, will only be expressed if they're not paired with a dominant allele which can ""override"" them. Punnett squares are often used to help determine how likely a child is to receive a dominant or recessive allele.


Because they can be ""overridden"" by dominant alleles, recessive alleles tend to be expressed more rarely. In general, a child will have to get a recessive allele from both parents for the allele to be expressed. A blood condition called sickle-cell anemia is a frequently-used example of a recessive trait — note, however, that recessive alleles aren't ""bad"" by definition."

Read the question or request from your teacher.,
Research.,
Balance your research.,
Have a strong introduction that sets the scene about the research in your report.,
Leave references for your teacher to follow.,
Use pictures.,
Consider presenting your report as something different by giving it a cover design.",How to Write a Great Dinosaur Report," Be sure to address exactly what it is that your teacher wants out of this report. That is the key step to getting good marks.;
, There is a lot of information out there on dinosaurs. The key to preparing a good report is to choose a distinctive topic within the subject of dinosaurs and to investigate deeply within the narrow confines of that topic. For example, ideas that might be suitable for exacting research include:


Methods of finding dinosaur fossils or methods for preserving them
A study of the eating habits of herbivore dinosaurs or carnivore dinosaurs
Examination of the changes in thinking of paleontologists about the coloring and textures of dinosaurs
A study of how dinosaurs are displayed in museums
Research into the perils of being a young dinosaur

, Good research takes account of competing ideas. This means that you can discuss both arguments while still preferring one side over the other, but you must provide reasons for why you think your ideas are preferable. For example, you might write something like:


Dinosaur display methods are generally able to convey to the public what dinosaurs looked like. However, Hobson says that some museums are not doing a very good job at displaying the larger dinosaur exhibits because they don't have high enough roofs. I disagree with this because I have visited 8 museums and only one of the eight had a roof problem and even then I would propose the following solution to fix that.

, Explain what you looked at, the issues you are raising and your conclusion. Write clearly in the report and avoid making sweeping statements. Try to keep your theme flowing throughout the report and make a sensible conclusion based on the things written in your report.

, A good report will show that you have done the research and not just made up everything off the top of your head. Acknowledge quotes and ideas properly and create a bibliography detailing the books, online resources, museum visits, interviews, etc., that you have used to inform your report.

, With modern printing methods and computing, there is little excuse for not producing wonderful illustrations of dinosaurs to spruce up your report. You can still draw your own illustrations, of course, just be sure to scan them in and include them in your printed report.

, Use hard card, images and fancy fonts to make the front cover. Join the report together with staples, binding, or twine. You might even like to consider making the cover in the shape of a dinosaur.

Understand genes and genotypes.,
Draw a 2 x 2 grid.,
Label the top of the square with one parent genotype.,
Label the left side of the square with the other parent genotype.,
Match the alleles together using the boxes as guides.,
Count the number of each genotype.,
Calculate the phenotype ratio.",How to Use a Punnett Square to Do a Monohybrid Cross," A genotype is the heritable, genetic code of an individual.An individual’s genotype comes from the alleles on the two chromosomes inherited from their parent. An allele is the specific form of a gene.For example, a gene codes for hair color but one allele could code for blonde hair, while another codes for brown hair.


Every individual has two chromosomes with two alleles that make their genotype so it is represented with two letters.
Capital letters indicate dominant alleles while lowercase letters represent recessive alleles.It doesn’t matter what letter you choose to represent your gene of interest, so choose something that makes sense to you. Usually, the first letter of the dominant allele is used.
For example, B represents the dominant gene for brown hair and b represents the recessive gene for blonde hair.;
, As its name suggests a Punnett square is just a divided square. Draw your square and divide it into four smaller squares by drawing two lines (one horizontal and one vertical) through the center of the square.


Leave enough room in each box for two letters.
Also, leave room at the top and left side of the square.

, For example, let’s say the mother has brown hair and a genotype of Bb, then you would put a B over the top left-hand square and a b over the top right-hand square.


It doesn’t matter where you put each parent’s genotype.
Only one letter goes above each box.

, For example, if the father also has brown hair, but his genotype is BB, you would put one B to the left of the upper left-hand square, and another B to the left of the lower left-hand square.

, Each allele will fit into the two boxes below it or to the right of it, depending on its placement. For example, if the allele B is in the horizontal top-left corner, write B in the two left boxes below. If the allele B is in the vertical top left corner, you must write B in the two boxes to the right. Continue to fill in the boxes with alleles until each box has two alleles, one from each parent.


The convention is to always write the capital dominant allele first followed by the lowercase recessive allele.
For our hair color example two brown-haired parents could either be BB or Bb. You would have to know their specific genotype. However, if the parent is blonde you know their genotype is the recessive bb.

, For a monohybrid cross, there are only three possible genotypes: BB, Bb, and bb. BB (brown hair) and bb (blonde hair) are homozygous for a gene meaning that they have two identical alleles for one gene. Bb (brown hair) are heterozygous meaning that they have two different alleles for the gene.Some crosses may only give you one or two genotypes.


For our example, using the cross BB x Bb, the Punnett square would show the possibilities as two BB and two Bb.
If you cross two homozygous parents with the same genotype (BB x BB or bb x bb) all of the genotypes will be homozygous (BB or bb).
If you cross two homozygous parents with different genotypes, BB x bb, all of the genotypes will be Bb.
If you cross a heterozygous with a homozygous parent (BB x Bb or bb x Bb), you will have two homozygotes (BB or bb) and two heterozygotes (Bb).
If you cross two heterozygous parents, Bb x Bb, you will have two homozygotes (1 BB and 1 bb) and two heterozygotes (Bb)

, Using the counts from the previous step, you can determine the phenotype ratio. A phenotype is the physical characteristic of the gene, such as hair or eye color.Assuming the trait shows complete dominance, the heterozygous genotype (the cross showing dissimilar pairs of genes for a hereditary characteristic) will display the dominant phenotype.


In the BB x Bb cross, the phenotypes will be four dominant brown-haired offspring (2 BB and 2 Bb) to zero recessive blonde-haired offspring (bb) so the ratio would be 4:0. 100% of the offspring will have brown hair, but 50% of them will be homozygous while the other 50% will be heterozygous.

Make a 2x2 square grid.,
Use letters to represent the parent alleles for each row and column.,
Write the letters for each space's row and column.,
Determine each potential offspring's genotype.,
Determine each potential offspring's phenotype.,
Use the squares to determine the probability of different phenotypes.",How to Work With Punnett Squares2," The most basic Punnett squares are quite simple to set up. Begin by drawing a good-sized square, then dividing that square into four even boxes. When you're done, there should be two squares in each column and two squares in each row.;
, On a Punnett square, columns are assigned to the mother and the rows to the father, or vice versa. Write a letter next to each row and column that represents each of the mother's and father's alleles. Use capital letters for dominant alleles and lowercase for recessive alleles.


This is much easier to understand with an example. For instance, let's say you want to determine the odds that a couple's child will be able to roll its tongue. We can represent this with the letters R and r — uppercase for the dominant gene and lowercase for the recessive. If both parents are heterozygous (have one copy of each allele), we would write one ""R"" and one ""r"" along the top of the grid and one ""R"" and one ""r"" along the left side of the grid.


, Once you've figured out the alleles that each parent is contributing, filling in your Punnett square is easy. In each square, write the two-letter gene combination given from the mother and father's alleles. In other words, take the letter from the space's column and the letter from its row and write them together inside the space.


In our example, we would fill in our squares like this:
Top left square: RR

Top right square: Rr

Bottom left square: Rr

Bottom right square: rr

Notice that, traditionally, dominant alleles (capital letters) are written first., Each square of a filled-in Punnett square represents an offspring that the two parents can have. Every square (and thus every offspring) is equally likely — in other words, on a 2x2 grid, there is a 1/4 possibility for any of the four possibilities. The different combinations of alleles represented on a Punnett square are called genotypes. Though genotypes represent genetic differences, the offspring won't necessarily turn out differently for each square (see step below.)


In our example Punnett square, the genotypes that are possible for an offspring from these two parents are:

Two dominant alleles (from the two Rs)

One dominant allele and one recessive (from the R and r)

One dominant allele and one recessive (from the R and r) — notice that there are two squares with this genotype

Two recessive allele (from the two rs)

, An organism's phenotype is the actual physical trait that it displays based on its genotype. Just a few examples of phenotypes include eye color, hair color, and presence of sickle cell anemia — all of these are physical traits determined by genes, but none are the actual gene combinations themselves. The phenotype a potential offspring will have is determined by the characteristics of the gene. Different genes will have different rules for how they manifest as phenotypes.


In our example, let's say that the gene that allows someone to roll their tongue is dominant. This means that any offspring will be able to roll their tongue even if only one of their alleles is dominant. In this case, the phenotypes of the potential offspring are:
Top left: Can roll tongue (two Rs)

Top right: Can roll tongue (one R)

Bottom left: Can roll tongue (one R)

Bottom right: Cannot roll tongue (zero Rs)


, One of the most common uses for Punnett squares is to determine how likely it is that offspring will have specific phenotypes. Since each square represents an equally-likely genotype outcome, you can find a phenotype's likelihood by dividing the number of squares with that phenotype by the total number of squares.Our example Punnett square tells us that there are four possible gene combinations for any offspring from these parents. Three of these combinations make an offspring that can roll its tongue, while one does not. Thus, the probabilities for our two phenotypes are:
Offspring can roll its tongue: 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%

Offspring cannot roll its tongue: 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%

"
Double each side of the basic 2x2 grid for each additional gene.,
Determine the parents' genes being contributed.,
Write the different gene combinations along the top and left sides.,
Fill in the spaces with each combination of alleles.,
Find the phenotypes for each potential offspring.,
Use the squares to determine the likelihood of each phenotype.",How to Work With Punnett Squares3," Not all gene combinations are as simple as the basic monohybrid (one-gene) cross from the section above. Some phenotypes are determined by more than one gene. In these cases, you must account for every possible combination, which means drawing a bigger grid.


The basic rule for Punnett squares when it comes to more than one gene is this: double each side of the grid for each gene beyond the first. In other words, since a one-gene grid is 2x2, a two-gene grid is 4x4, a three-gene grid is 8x8, and so on.
To make these concepts easier to understand, let's follow along with a two-gene example problem. This means we should draw a 4x4 grid. The concepts in this section hold true for three or more genes as well — these problems just require larger grids and more work.

, Next, find the genes that both parents have for the characteristic you're examining. Since you're dealing with multiple genes, each parent's genotype will have an additional two letters for each gene beyond the first — in other words, four letters for two genes, six letters for three genes, and so on. It can be helpful to write the mother's genotype above the top of the grid and the father's to the left (or vice versa) as a visual reminder.


Let's use a classic example problem to illustrate these conflicts. A pea plant can have peas that are either smooth or wrinkled and yellow or green. Smooth and yellow are the dominant traits.In this case, use S and s to represent dominant and recessive genes for smoothness and Y and y for yellowness. Let's say that the mother in this case has an SsYy genotype and the father has an SsYY genotype.

, Now, above the top row of squares in the grid and to the left of the leftmost column, write the different alleles that can potentially be contributed by each parent. As when dealing with one gene, each allele is equally likely to be passed on. However, since you are looking at multiple genes, each row and column will get multiple letters: two letters for two genes, three letters for three genes, and so on.


In our example, we need to write down the different combinations of genes that each parent can contribute from their SsYy genotypes. If we have the mother's SsYy genes across the top and the father's SsYY genes on the left, the alleles for each gene are:
Across the top: SY, Sy, sY, sy

Down the left side: SY, SY, sY, sY


, Fill in the spaces in the grid just as you would when dealing with a single gene. However, this time, each space will have two extra additional letters for each gene beyond the first: four letters for two genes, six letters for three genes. As a general rule, the number of letters in each space should match the number of letters in each parent's genotype.


In our example, we would fill in our spaces like this:
Top row: SSYY, SSYy, SsYY, SsYy

Second row: SSYY, SSYy, SsYY, SsYy

Third row: SsYY, SsYy, ssYY, ssYy

Bottom row: SsYY, SsYy, ssYY, ssYy


, When dealing with multiple genes, each space in the Punnett square still represents the genotype for each potential offspring — there are just a greater number of choices than there are with one gene. The phenotypes for each square are, once again, dependent on the exact genes being dealt with. However, as a general rule, dominant traits need only one dominant allele to be expressed, while recessive traits need all recessive alleles.In our example, since smoothness and yellowness are dominant traits for our peas, any square with at least one capital S represents a plant with a smooth phenotype and any square with at least one capital Y represents a plant with a yellow phenotype. Wrinkled plants need two lowercase s alleles and green plants need two lowercase ys. From these conditions, we get:
Top row: Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow

Second row: Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow

Third row: Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow, wrinkled/yellow, wrinkled/yellow

Bottom row: Smooth/yellow, Smooth/yellow, wrinkled/yellow, wrinkled/yellow


, Use the same techniques as when dealing with one gene to find the likelihood that any offspring from the two parents can have each different phenotype. In other words, the number of squares with the phenotype divided by the total number of squares equals the probability for each phenotype.


In our example, the probabilities for each phenotype are:
Offspring is smooth and yellow: 12/16 = 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%

Offspring is wrinkled and yellow: 4/16 = 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%

Offspring is smooth and green: 0/16 = 0%

Offspring is wrinkled and green: 0/16 = 0%

Notice that since it is impossible for any offspring to get two recessive y alleles, none of the offspring will be green.

Put everything together to build a DNA strand.,

Use mnemonics to remember the base-pairs.",How to Understand DNA Structure," A deoxyribose sugar forms part of the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA. The other important group is the phosphate group which will be discussed in the next step. Deoxyribose forms a ring structure with five carbons and an oxygen. Other hydrogen and hydroxide groups complete the sugar.Deoxyribose is called a pentose sugar because the ring structure is in the shape of a pentagon.
The carbons of the sugar are numbered from 1’ (one prime) to 5’ (five prime), starting with the first carbon on the right side of the ring and moving clockwise.
Deoxyribose is similar to the ribose sugar group, but it has one less oxygen, hence “deoxy” in the name.;
, A phosphate groups has one hydrogen, one phosphate, and four oxygens. The phosphate group attaches to the 5’ carbon of deoxyribose to make up one block of “sugar-phosphate” that makes up the backbone. This backbone of DNA repeats with every phosphate group attaching to the 5’ end of deoxyribose and forming phosphodiester bonds with the 3’ end of the next deoxyribose molecule.Just as we generally read from left to right, DNA is always read from 3’ to 5’., There are four nitrogenous bases that encode all genetic information in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The nitrogenous bases are ring structures formed of carbons, hydrogens, nitrogens, and oxygens. Adenine and guanine are large with a double ring structure while cytosine and thymine are smaller being made up of a single ring.Cytosine and thymine are known as pyrimidines and have a hexagonal ring structure.
Adenine and guanine are known as purines and have one hexagonal ring attached to one pentagonal ring.
Bases with one ring can only pair with bases with two rings; hence, A always pairs with T and G always pairs with C.

, The nitrogenous base always attaches to the 1’ carbon of the deoxyribose molecule. The complete molecule of sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base is called a nucleotide. Many nucleotides combine together to form a strand of DNA.Remember, there are two complementary strands that make-up DNA.

, Each nucleotide of DNA contains a single nitrogenous base: either a purine (two-rings) or a pyrimidine (one ring). A purine must always pair with a pyrimidine to form the correct structure of DNA. Adenine always pairs with thymine while cytosine always pairs with guanine. This is referred to as complementary base-pairing.Each base pair is held together by a weak force called a hydrogen bond. These weak hydrogen bonds allow the strands to be easily broken apart when they need to be copied during cellular replication.

, The DNA winds like a spiral staircase into a double helix. The sugar-phosphate backbone is always the outside or “handrails” of the staircase. The nitrogenous bases are on the inside of the structure and can be considered the actual “stairs”.


The 3’ end always has a sugar group while the 5’ end is always a phosphate.You can draw a simplified version of a DNA strand by drawing two backbone strands that wind around each other and then drawing lines to represent the nitrogenous bases between the backbone lines.

, Every single strand of DNA has a complementary strand that pairs with it. Practicing writing out the complementary strands will help you understand DNA better. Remember, every DNA strand is read from 3’ to 5’ and its complementary strand will be written in the opposite direction.


Write the complementary strand to: 3’- GACTCCCTGGAAAGTCCAT-5’.
The complementary strand is 5’-CTGAGGGACCTTTCAGGTA-3’.

, Flashcards are one of the best ways to memorize things and reinforce that knowledge.Make cards for all of the base pairs to remember which ones pair together and whether they are purines or pyrimidines.


You can also make flashcards with pictures of the structures so you can easily recognize them when you see them on a test.

, Another good way to learn and understand the DNA structure is to draw it multiple times.Repetition is important to learning and remembering. If you practice drawing the structure a few times a week, it will soon become very easy to do.


Label all of the important features as you draw to keep those in your memory as well.

, Mnemonics are memory tricks to help you remember complex things in an easy way. There are a handful of mnemonics that you can use to remember which bases pair with each other. Choose the one that works the best for you, or make up your own.The “circle” letters C and G pair with each other, while the “stick” letters A and T pair together.
Remember the phrase, “I like to look AT George Clooney.”
To remember which bases are pyrimidines versus purines: “Think of pyramids in Turks and Caicos” (T and C are the pyrimidines) and “All gold is pure” (AG is the chemical symbol for gold, A and G are the purines).

Understand the differences between peripheral and centralized bone scans.,
Know the purpose of a bone density test.",How to Understand Bone Density Score1," Besides cost and ease of screening, these tests also vary in accuracy. Some physicians will start with the peripheral test and only conduct the centralized test if the first screen indicates poor bone density.


Peripheral machines are small and portable, and they check bone density on the periphery of your skeleton, such as finger bones or the heel. They are much cheaper but not always a good indicator of bone health in bones that are the most likely to break.
Centralized bone scans involve a large X-ray machine with a movable arm that will scan different parts of your skeleton while you lie on a padded table. This machine tests bone density at your hip, lower back, and forearms to get a good measure of the strength of bones that are most likely to break in a slip or fall.;
, Most individuals receive bone density scans to check for signs of osteoporosis.


Bone density scans are often used to detect your individual risk of bone fracture and your personal chance of developing osteoporosis if you do not currently have the condition.
Bone density scans can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of osteoporosis treatments.

Evaluate your T-score.,
Evaluate your Z-score.",How to Understand Bone Density Score2," T-scores are typically reported in terms of standard deviations from the mean bone density score for young, healthy adults of your gender. The number indicates how close or how far your bone density measure is from the average.


If your T-score is -1, 0, or a positive number, your bone density is considered normal and healthy.
If your T-score is between -1 and -2.5, your score indicates that you may be at risk of osteoporosis. Your bone density is lower than average and you may have osteopenia, which can lead to osteoporosis.
If your T-score is below -2.5, you likely have osteoporosis. Your bones are likely weak, brittle, and prone to breaks from falls or even from some regular activities.

, This score gives a reading of your bone density in comparison with other individuals of your weight, sex, racial or ethnic background, and age.


If your Z-score is -1, 0, or a positive number, your bone density is comparable to that of other people of your demographic characteristics.
If your Z-score is -2 or below, your bone density is worse than average for people of your demographic characteristics. This result points to the possibility that there may be a cause of your bone loss other than aging; you may need additional testing and treatment to delay or prevent additional loss of bone density.

"
"
Ask how to prevent bone density loss.,
Discuss your bone health before it is necessary.,
Ask whether further testing may be necessary.",How to Understand Bone Density Score3," Even if you have a normal or healthy bone density score, you may wish to discuss ways to protect and promote bone health through diet, exercise, and calcium supplements or multi-vitamins.


Men and women ages 18 to 50 need an average of 1000mg of calcium and 1000 to 4000 IU of vitamin D each day. Women over 50 and men over 70 should up their calcium intake to 1200mg per day through supplements or a targeted diet.
Get calcium from supplements or green leafy vegetables, low-fat dairy products, canned fish with bones, and fortified juices or cereals. Vitamin D is necessary for your body to absorb calcium; your daily needs can be met through sunshine and supplements or fortified foods such as dairy or orange juice.

, If you have relatives with osteoporosis or who frequently experience bone fractures, or if you are otherwise at risk for bone density loss, it is important to discuss bone health with a professional while you are still healthy.


Be sure to reach your recommended daily intake each day and participate in regular exercise to promote bone health. With early steps toward bone density maintenance, many individuals can prevent osteoporosis in old age.

, If your Z-score is very low or if you only received a peripheral screen that indicated bone density loss, discuss what type of further testing you may need.


If you have very low bone density, your doctor may recommend tests for hyperparathyroidism or another bone scan to confirm osteoporosis. Hyperparathyroidism may result from too much calcium in the blood or a second condition causing a calcium deficit in your whole body.
Depending on your dietary habits and other health information, your physician may check for vitamin or mineral deficiencies.

Push down on the back of the stage clip to raise the clip and allow you to place the slide under it. This clip will hold the slide in place while you view your sample., When you start, the microscope should be set to the lowest power lense. On the side of the microscope, there is a knob called the coarse adjustment knob. The coarse adjustment knob will allow you to move the lense up and down to focus., If your sample is not in the center of the viewing field, you can use your fingers to gently move the slide. Be careful not to move too much. Also, take care to only touch the outside of the slide. Fingerprints on the slide can make it difficult to see your sample.


After making this adjustment, you might need to refocus your lense slightly.

, Once you have your sample in focus with the low powered lense, you can use the high powered lense to get a closer look. Change to the high powered lense, but be careful not to let it touch the slide. You may have to refocus slightly when you change lenses. Some microscopes have a fine adjustment knob on the side that is ideal for this., You can use a diary or journal to write down what you see in the microscope. Drawing what you see is another good option. Be sure to include any structures that you notice in your microorganisms.


Some microscopes have the ability to hook up to a laptop and take pictures. This is a great way to capture what you see.

, This is the best way for a beginner to know that they will be able to find a sample. Slides can be purchased that have permanently fixed samples of microorganisms. If you are using a microscope in a school lab, you will likely use this kind of slide.

, If you do not want to use a pre-made slide, you can make your own. You should be very careful about the microorganisms you select. Do use any microorganisms collected from rotting food or the human body. This can be very dangerous., Since you are dealing with organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye, chances are that you will be using a sample that is already suspended in a liquid (probably water). Use a pipet to place a drop of water on your glass slide. Try to center the water droplet on the slide.Glass slides are the standard, but plastic slides may be used as well., A coverslip is a small thin square of glass (or plastic) that covers your sample. It helps to flatten out the water droplet and hold your sample in place beneath the lense. If you do not have coverslips, another slide can be used to do this.Depression slides have a well that holds the sample. They are usually more expensive, but they do not require a cover slip.

, Anytime you are carrying your microscope, you should have two hands on it. One hand goes under the base. The other hand holds the arm of the microscope., Make sure that the lowest power lense is in place before proceeding. This will allow you to get your microorganisms into focus before trying a high powered lense. The lowest power lense will be the shortest lense and will have the lowest number written on the side (for example 40x)., It is best to bring your microorganism into focus by adjusting the lense up. This way you do not go too far down and touch your slide. For this reason, you want your starting point to be as low as possible. Look at the microscope from the side while turning the coarse adjustment knob until the lense is as far down as it will go without touching the slide., Opening the diaphragm will allow more light to shine through the slide into the lense. Adjusting the mirror will make sure that the light is directed to the right point. open the diaphragm all the way, and adjust the mirror to get the most light possible."

Determine whether you are eligible for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing.If you have a first degree family member (a parent, a sibling, or a child) with breast cancer before age 50 or ovarian cancer, who has tested positive for either BRCA1 or BRCA2, you are eligible for genetic testing.,
Tell your doctor if you had breast cancer before age 50 or ovarian cancer.If you have a personal history of breast cancer before age 50, or ovarian cancer at any age, you are also eligible for genetic testing.,
Take note if you or a family member has had ""triple negative"" breast cancer.If you or an first degree family member has ""triple negative"" (negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER2) breast cancer before the age of 60, the person who had the cancer is eligible for genetic testing.,
Seek pre-test genetic counselling.Prior to receiving the blood test, it is mandatory to receive pre-test genetic counselling.,
Go for the blood test.The blood test itself is very simple.,
Book a post-test genetic counselling appointment.Because of the gravity of this particular test, you will be required to receive your results in the presence of a genetic counsellor (just as you had to see one prior to receiving the test).",How to Test BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genes," Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that can be passed on from parents to their children.


Testing positive for either one carries a heightened risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer during your lifetime.;
, The purpose of genetic testing in this case is to determine your risk of developing cancer again down the road (as the risk may be heightened if you test positive for the mutation), and also to provide information that may assist your children in making decisions about their own healthcare.


If you test positive for a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, your children will also be eligible for genetic testing as the mutation may have been passed onto them genetically.
Children are not eligible for testing without a positive result in their parent to first confirm that the mutation is indeed present (and that the breast cancer or ovarian cancer is not related to other factors or to random chance).

, Again, the person with the cancer must test positive for the genetic mutation before any other family members are eligible for testing. This is to ensure that the mutation is present, before investing the time and money in testing relatives.

, Because the implications of testing positive can be life-changing, you will need to talk through all of the possible outcomes with the genetic counsellor, and discuss a plan of action as to what you will do and how you will move forward once you do find out the results.


While a negative result can provide some measure of reassurance, it does not eliminate the possibility of developing these cancers. Rather, it means that your risk is the same as the general population (11% risk for breast cancer in your lifetime and 1.3% risk for ovarian cancer). Furthermore, the test is not 100% accurate, so there is a very small chance that you could test negative and still be positive for a BRCA mutation.
A positive BRCA test puts you at up to an 85% risk of developing breast cancer at some point in your life, and a 30-50% risk of developing ovarian cancer. Needless to say, knowing these risks will add worry and stress to your life.
Consider the implications of a positive result on your children. If you test positive for a BRCA mutation, there is a 50% chance for each of your children to have the mutation (note that the mutation is most significant for girls, as male breast cancer is extremely rare and men cannot get ovarian cancer).

, You can get it done at any medical laboratory or hospital. Simply have your doctor fill out the required paperwork (which he or she will do only after you have had a consultation with a genetic counsellor), and bring it with you to the lab.


It will take a few weeks, or possibly even a couple of months, for you to receive the results.The genetic counsellor will either book a follow-up appointment with you when he or she knows the results will be ready (as he or she may be familiar with the lab's processing time in your area). Alternatively, you may receive a phone call from the genetic counsellor when your results are ready to be reviewed.
If you have not heard back within a couple months, phone the lab or your genetic counsellor to check in about the status of your BRCA testing.

, The reason for this is that they can help you to handle the impact of the results (either good or bad), and to choose an appropriate course of action moving forwards.


If you test negative, you can continue to live your life as normal, knowing that your risk is no greater than the general population.
If you test positive, however, there are a number of things to consider moving forwards. You may opt to get your breasts and/or your ovaries removed prophylactically (preventatively).You may need to discuss with the genetic counsellor the impact the result may have on your children, how you plan to tell your family, and/or how it may impact your decision to have more children down the road.
If you test positive for a BRCA mutation, it is important to inform your children in age-appropriate ways; they will then be invited to speak to a genetic counsellor and to decide for themselves whether or not they want to be tested.
However, genetic testing for people under 18 is highly controversial, as they may not be mature enough to make an informed decision about a disease that will not onset until they are adults.
The invitation will remain open to them at any stage in life, so even if they decline in their twenties, for instance, they may return for the test in their thirties if their perspective and desire for testing has changed.
It is for all these reasons that it is important to see a genetic counsellor, as he or she is someone who has been specifically trained to help people navigate this challenging time in their lives.

Relate biology to everyday life.,
Incorporate hands-on activities.If you can make the study of biology tangible for students, they are likely to be more invested in their education.,
Incorporate multimedia materials.Creating a little variety in the format of your instructional materials can make your biology course more lively.,
Look for ways to bridge technology and biology.,
Utilize science games to teach biology.,
Host biology-centered field trips.,
Try different approaches to teaching.,
Make lectures participatory.Oftentimes, lectures are the most efficient way to present information to students.,
Incorporate writing.Some students might think of biology as all about facts, data, and multiple choice questions.,
Use peer teaching methods.Allow some opportunities for collaborative learning.,
Read journals and other resources on teaching biology.",How to Teach Biology," Some students will be naturally drawn to biology, while others will ask why they should care about it. All students will benefit if you can show how biological concepts and questions are relevant to daily life. This will deepen their appreciation of the science and make it more relatable. Do things like:


Share with your class news items on medicine, DNA, the environment, population growth, and other topics that biology touches upon.Offer extra credit to students who will give a brief in-class report on a reference to a biological concept they came across in a television show, movie, etc. Ask them to explain the reference, what biological concept it dealt with, and why it is important.
Talk about careers that draw on biology, such as medicine, pharmaceuticals, conservation, public health, etc. You can even invite individuals practicing in these fields to visit your class, talk about their work, and answer student questions.;
, There are lots of ways of bringing biology to life, so to speak. Students can do things like:


Plant a garden to learn about photosynthesis.
Raise butterflies or other animals to learn about the life cycle.
Dissect specimens to learn about anatomy.
Test samples of store-bought yeast to see whether or not they are alive.
Look at slides of various kinds of cells.

, In addition to textbooks, try to incorporate videos, podcasts, and other forms of media when introducing topics in biology.

, There are lots of opportunities for those interested in technology to deepen their involvement with biology, and vice versa. Be open to new and exciting modes of instruction, and invite your students to share the technological concepts and tools that interest them. For instance:


There are valuable resources devoted to using the popular game Minecraft in educational contexts, including biology courses.Allow students to utilize technology for assignments in your course. For instance, students with interest in web design might develop a website to illustrate a biological concept.

, A little friendly competition in the form of educational games can be a nice way to spice up your biology course. There are resources available for developing biology-centered versions of games like:Jeopardy
Quiz bowl
Taboo
Pictionary
Twenty questions

, An occasional trip outside of your classroom can be a welcome change of pace and a real opportunity to enrich student’s understanding of biology. Depending on what is available in your area, and what your school will allow, you might be able to arrange a visit to places like:


A local science museumA botanical garden
A zoo
A farm
A research lab

, Some learning is passive (students receive knowledge from an instructor), while some is active (students take more responsibility for exploring and understanding topics). There is room for both types in any classroom. The key is to find the right mixture and balance of the two. Incorporate a variety of instructional methods, including:Lecturing
Cooperative learning (students help each other learn about a topic)
Concept mapping
Discussion
Reading
Hands-on activities

, However, both students and instructors often want lectures to be more interactive. This can be a challenge if you are lecturing to a large number of students, but there are certainly ways of making it work.


Utilize the Socratic method by periodically asking students questions. In a large lecture course, not everyone may have the chance to speak each day, but students will feel more involved.Have students come to the lecture with pre-prepared questions.You can then address some of their questions. This lets students know that they are being listened to.
Consider incorporating iClickers or similar technologies into your lecture courses so that students can respond to informal quizzes or polls during class. This lets you gauge how well they are understanding a topic, and gives them an opportunity to get involved.
In smaller classes, set aside plenty of time for open discussion. Expect students to be able to talk about biological topics, ask questions, etc., By giving them writing assignments, however, you will share an important part of the scientific process with them, and have an additional opportunity to assess how well they understand a given topic.


You don’t have to overgrade students.It’s easy to incorporate low-stakes writing exercises in your class. For instance, at the end of each session, have them write a paragraph summarizing what they learned. Rather than assigning a grade to their responses, open the next class session by discussing them.

, For instance, break students into groups and assign each group the task of researching a certain aspect of a topic (such as stages in the life cycle of plants). Then, have each group report to the whole class on what they have learned. Students will enjoy the fun and responsibility of teaching their peers.

, There are a variety of resources that can help you teach biology in fresh and exciting ways. For specific ideas, and to learn about new developments in teaching biology, regularly read journals and websites like:


The biology collection at the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT).The American Biology TeacherCBE Life Sciences EducationBiochemistry and Molecular Biology EducationBioscene: Journal of College Biology Teaching

Schedule time each day for reading the course's material.
Take notes as you read or highlight areas you feel are important.
Don't put the reading off till the last minute.;
, As you study, you will be exposed to a great deal of new information. The amount of information that you come across during your class can feel overwhelming at times. To avoid becoming overwhelmed focus on the big ideas and key concepts of the course.Getting a broad view of key concepts can help you recall more detailed information later.

, Although the idea of a perfect study space may vary from person to person, there are some areas that are more conducive to studying than others. When you are looking for or creating a good study area make sure it includes some of the following aspects:Try to avoid any noisy environments.
Remove any distractions from your study environment.
Having some light music playing in the background can help you retain information.
Avoid having the TV on or wearing headphones during a study session.

, Before you get too far into your biology class it can be helpful to discover what your learning style is. A learning style is a sensory method of acquiring information and everyone has one that they tend to learn best with. Once you know which style you learn best with you can focus your notes and study material into a way that fits that style.


Visual learners retain information best by video, written word or graphical representations.
Auditory learners can learn best from spoken word and instruction and can benefit from listening to light music while studying.
Kinesthetic learners would prefer a demonstration rather than an explanation and do well in group learning or study.

Grasp the overview of water's role in biological systems.,
Study water in the cellular environment.,
Study how the body controls water levels.,
Be aware that water also has solvating purposes beyond biological systems.",How to Study the Physiological Role of Water As a Solvent in the Human Body," The role of water in biological systems of the human body, as well as in other organisms, is similar in its function. Also in non-biological systems, the role of water is also similar with minor differences. Due to its unique chemical structure and the huge resources of this compound, it functions in the body as a medium in which all other compounds in the body are dissolved. This is important for several reasons:


One reason is the ability of the water medium in the body through its continuous movement between the different parts of the body tissues to transport important molecules to needy tissues such as nutrients and oxygen. The mechanism of exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lung is possible due to this transport system that involves the water medium. Also, many other important compounds in the body are shifted from one place to another by the assistance of the continuous movement of the blood in the arteries.

Examples include the transport of the hormonal system in the body which is mainly done by traveling in the blood stream. Also, cells of the immune system in the case of inflammation are able to migrate to the site of inflammation by traveling in the blood stream. All these show the important function of water as a solvent for most molecules in the body. The continuous movement of water in the arteries is possible due to the efficient process of blood pumping in the heart. Compounds that are usually not soluble in water by itself become soluble by binding to carrier molecules in the body such as proteins.
Examples include lipids that are normally insoluble in the blood medium. They become soluble in water by binding to special type of proteins that can increase their solubility in the blood. Cells by them are not water soluble otherwise our life would be terminated by the effect of dissolution of the body tissues.

;
, Inside the cellular environment water also has the distinct function of solubilizing the compounds inside the cells. The amount of water inside the cell is carefully monitored and controlled. Any change in the amount of water inside the cell can harm the cell and cause its death. The mechanism that controls the amount of water in the various compartments of the body is mediated by the phenomenon of osmosis. This phenomenon is characteristic of all biological systems and is dependent on the degree of salts concentration in the cell and out of it which is called degree of osmolality.


The osmolality degree inside and outside the cell will dictate the direction of movement of water between the two sides of the cell. Osmosis is a very important process that can maintain homeostasis in the body by preventing cellular death. Too small amount of water inside the cell can lead to its shrinkage and subsequently its death. Analogously, too high water content inside the cell can cause its rupture and death. For these reasons patients that are severely dehydrated are not treated with infusion that is of pure water but instead they are infused with saline water that has similar concentration to that of the blood. This is so in order to prevent the movement of water in and out of the cell.

, Due to all these important functions, biological systems in the human body use special forms of mechanisms in order to monitor and control the amount of water in the body in general and in the cells and the body compartments in particular. These mechanisms involve in most cases hormonal molecules that can affect the amount of water in the body by either inducing its diuresis in the urine in the case of high level of water in the blood or through inducing its retention as occurs in a state of low blood volume or shock. These two basic hormonal functions are mediated by receptors at the surface of the kidney cells that respond to the amount of the specific hormone in the blood.


There are several hormones that have effect on the water level in the body and on the blood pressure in particular. Pharmacological drugs that are called diuretics are drugs for the treatment of excess water in the body. Other drugs are designed the opposite way to retain water in the body. These drugs usually agonize or antagonize the effect of the particular hormone.

, Water function as a medium for solvating macromolecules in the body is not restricted to biological systems. It is also used for other purposes such as to dissolve electrolytes in chemical reactions. Also, water is being used nowadays extensively as a solvent for carrying chemical reactions instead of volatile organic solvents that can be harmful to the person that is using them.

Obtain a specimen slide.,
Place your specimen slide on the microscope stage (the platform that holds the slides).,
Ensure the microscope is on the lowest magnification.,
Focus the image.,
Increase the magnification if necessary.,
Identify the features of eukaryotes.,
Identify the features of prokaryotes.,
Observe the image through the microscope.",How to Tell the Difference Between Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes," Specimen slides of prokaryotes and eukaryotes can be obtained from biological supply companies.


If you are in school, ask your science teacher if they have access to slides.;
, Some microscopes will have stage clips that allow you to secure the slide in place to prevent movement during focusing and viewing. If there are clips on the stage, gently push the slide underneath to secure in place. If no clips are provided, place the slide directly under objective.


Be careful when pushing slides underneath the clips. Too much force can damage the slide.
You may have to move the slide while looking through the eyepiece to find the desired area of the specimen.

, The part of the microscope that allows for magnification is called an objective. Objectives for compound light microscopes usually range from 4x to 40x. You can move to higher magnifications if necessary, but starting low allows you to easily find the specimen on the slide.


You can determine the magnification of the objective by looking at the objective itself where it will have a label.
The lowest magnification objective will also have the shortest length, while the highest magnification will have the longest length.

, Looking at a blurry image makes it difficult to make out small structures and define aspects of the cell. To more clearly see every detail, make sure the image is in focus.


While looking into the eyepiece, use the focus adjustment knobs found below the stage on the side of the microscope.
By turning the knobs, you will see the image come into sharper focus.

, At the lowest magnification, you might notice that it's difficult to see smaller features and cellular structures. By increasing the magnification, you will be able to see more details within the cell.


Never change the objective while looking through the eyepiece. Because higher magnification objectives have longer lengths, changing the objective before lowering the stage can result in damage to the slide, the objective, and the microscope itself.
Use the focus knobs to lower the stage to the appropriate height.
Shift the objectives until the desired magnification is over the slide.
Refocus the image.

, Eukaryotic cells are large and have many structural and internal components. The word eukaryote is rooted in the Greek language. ""Karyose"" means ""kernel"" which refers to the nucleus, while ""eu"" means ""true"" so eukaryotes contain a true nucleus. Eukaryotic cells are complex and contain membrane-bound organelles that perform specific functions to keep the cell alive.


Look for the nucleus of the cell. The nucleus is the structure of a cell that contains the genetic information encoded by DNA. Although the DNA is linear, the nucleus generally appears as a dense circular mass inside cell.
See if you can find organelles within the cytoplasm (the jelly-like interior of the cell). Under the microscope you should be able to see distinct masses that are rounded or oblong in shape and smaller than the nucleus.
All eukaryotes have a plasma membrane and cytoplasm, and some (plants and fungi) have a cell wall. The plasma membrane will not be obvious under the microscope, but the cell wall should appear as a dark line outlining the edge of the cell.
Although there are single-celled eukaryotes (protozoa), most are multi-cellular (animals and plants)., Prokaryotic cells are much smaller and have fewer internal structures. In Greek, ""pro"" means before, therefore prokaryote means ""before a nucleus"". Due to the absence of organelles they are simpler cells and perform fewer functions to stay alive.


Look for the absence of a nucleus. Their genetic material is a small simple circle called a nucleoid. The nucleoid will generally appear lighter in color inside the cell and will be circular.
Look for the presence of ribosomes. Although prokaryotes do not have complex organelles, they do have simpler structures called ribosomes. With high enough magnification, ribosomes look like black dots within the cell cytoplasm.
Like eukaryotes, prokaryotes do have a cell wall, a plasma membrane, and cytoplasm. As with eukaryotic cells, the plasma membrane may not be obvious under the microscope, but the cell wall should be visible.
All bacteria are prokaryotes. Example bacteria include Escherichia coli (E. coli), which lives in your intestines and Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause skin infections. , Look through the microscope and write down the defining characteristics you see from the slide. Based on the specific features of eukaryotes and prokaryotes, you should be able to determine what is on your slide.


Make a checklist for eukaryotes and prokaryotes and check off the features that apply to the specimen you're looking at.

Start at the mouth.,
Follow the path of food to the stomach.,
Recognize that the endocrine system aids in digestion.,
Know where most nutrients are absorbed.,
Learn how your colon absorbs water.,
Think about how waste leaves the body.",How to Study the Physiology of Digestion in the Human Body1," The digestive system starts at the mouth. You take in food and drink from your mouth and pass it down to the the rest of your digestive track. The mouth also starts mechanical and chemical digestion of the food., The esophagus is the long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. When you swallow food, it travels down the esophagus until it reaches the stomach. In the stomach, the food is combined with hydrochloric acid and enzymes that break the molecules down., The endocrine system consists of glands that produce hormones. One of these glands, the pancreas, also aids in digestion. The pancreas produces enzymes that help the body break down proteins and regulate blood sugar..

, The majority of nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine. This organ is broken into three sections: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Each section has a unique purpose.In the duodenum, food is mixed with pancreatic juices to be broken down even further for absorption.
Most absorption of nutrients takes place in the jejunum.
The ileum connects the small intestine to the large intestine. It also absorbs the last bit of nutrients available in the food.

, After the nutrients have been extracted from the food mass and absorbed by your body, the remaining waste is saturated with water. This water can be reabsorbed and reused by the body. The absorption of water happens in the large intestine (also known as the colon). Aside from keeping your body hydrated, this process also helps form a solid stool that your body can easily eliminate as waste., A buildup of waste in your body can be toxic. In order to prevent a buildup, your body has to shed the waste left behind after digestion. Waste is moved along the length of the long intestine until it reaches the anus. The anus allows waste to exit the body.The anus is very short. It is usually only about an inch long.

Learn how enzymes are used to break down large molecules.,
Study the absorption of nutrients.,
Study the absorption of water.,
Understand how waste is eliminated.",How to Study the Physiology of Digestion in the Human Body2," The first step of the digestive process takes place in the mouth. Your teeth are used to mechanically grind down foods into smaller, more manageable pieces. The smaller pieces provide more surface area for stomach acid to react to., The chemical breakdown of food molecules also starts in the mouth. Your saliva contains enzymes that begin breaking down food molecules while you chew. Once you swallow the food, it encounters more enzymes in the stomach and the duodenum. Some of the most common uses for enzymes are:Breaking proteins into amino acids
Breaking down complex carbohydrates into simpler ones
Breaking fats into simpler fats

, Your digestive system absorbs the nutrients that the rest of your body needs. It passes these nutrients into the bloodstream, where they are carried to all of the cells of the body. Most nutrient absorption takes place in the jejunum, the second section of the small intestine.Additional nutrients are absorbed in the third chamber of the small intestine, the ileum. Even still, a very small amount of nutrients can be absorbed in the colon, also known as the large intestine.

, Once the nutrients have been taken from the food, your body has to prepare the leftover food mass for elimination. The first step is to solidify the the mass. The colon is responsible for absorbing water from the food mass and forming it into solid feces. This also serves to keep your body hydrated., Once solid feces has been formed in the colon, it must exit the body. The waste moves the length of the colon until it reaches the anus. At the anus, your body expels the feces."

Read ahead of time.,
Make diagrams.,
Join in class discussions.,
Pay attention to lab classes.",How to Study the Physiology of Digestion in the Human Body3," Anatomy and physiology classes cover a large volume of information in a short time. Lectures may go by quickly, and if you aren’t prepared, you can easily fall behind. Set aside time to read the upcoming chapters or sections before each class. Take notes on relevant information, and bring them to class with you., Many of the structures in the body have names that are difficult to associate with the functions they serve. One way to help you keep track of different structures and systems is to create diagrams, or sketches, of each structure you study. These diagrams do not have to be drawn perfectly, but you should label all parts and make notes about the content of the picture..

, Some people can listen to an instructor give a lecture and retain nearly all of the information presented. Most people, however, struggle with this. Aside from taking class notes, you should join into any class discussions. The interaction will help solidify the information in your brain. Some ways you can contribute to a class discussion are:Ask questions if you do not understand something.
Answer sample questions given by your instructor.
Provide an argument to support your answer when appropriate.

, Anatomy and physiology labs will help you to relate the information you learn in class to real organisms. Choose a lab partner that is serious about doing well instead of picking a friend that you can goof off with. Split the work evenly, and make sure that each of you understand the lab in its entirety."

Use the mnemonic FLAT PEG to memorize the hormones of the pituitary gland.,
Make flashcards for each hormone.",How to Study the Functions of Protein Hormones in Humans," Protein hormones are a type of chemical compound in the body that regulate metabolism and cell function. They are derived from amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and facilitate signaling between cells of the endocrine system and various other cells of the body.Hormones regulate a number of biological processes such as muscle growth, heart rate, hunger, and menstrual cycles.Proteins are a class of biochemical compounds in the body of all living systems.;
, The endocrine glands are the parts of the body that secrete hormones. These glands are all over the body and each one secretes a specific set of hormones that perform a special function. The following is a list of the endocrine glands in the human body:Brain: hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal
Neck/Chest: Parathyroid, thyroid, thymus
Midsection: Adrenal (above the kidneys), pancreas, ovaries (females), testes (males)

, There are two types of hormones: those that can signal far away throughout the body, and those that only act locally on cells directly next to them. The far-acting hormones are endocrine and neurosecretory signals. The hormones that act locally are called autocrine, paracrine, and synaptic signals.Hormones capable of signaling far away cells travel through the bloodstream.
Autocrine means that the signal acts directly on itself (a cell releases a signal to itself).
Paracrine means it acts on nearby cells.

, The basic function of a hormone is to bind to a receptor that will trigger some type of change within a cell. This change can be to activate other proteins or influence gene expression and lead to protein synthesis. Hormonal effects can be rapid or produce long-term effects.Hormones are diverse and have very specific targets. Hormones will only bind to the special receptor that is specific to them. Think of it like a lock and a key. Each hormone is a key and the receptor is the lock.

, There are two general types of hormone structures: steroid hormones and protein hormones. Steroid hormones are made from cholesterol and are fat-soluble, meaning they can pass through the plasma membrane of a cell without assistance. Because they are made of cholesterols they are not proteins. Protein hormones are made of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), are water-soluble, and are not capable of passing through the plasma membrane.Amino acid hormones can be further divided into two types: short molecules and long-chain polypeptides. Both types act by binding to receptors on the surface of a cell that trigger a cascade within the cell for a certain function.
Steroid hormones act from within the cell by binding to receptors inside of the cell and triggering protein synthesis.
Protein hormones are also synthesized in the cells of the endocrine system by completely different metabolic pathways than the steroidal hormones' metabolism.
Proteins in general are synthesized in the body using well known biochemical processes that are called translation of proteins. This process of translation is common to all types of proteins regardless of their chemical structure and their predestined function in the body.

, The main protein hormones in the body are synthesized and secreted into the blood circulation from the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. All the hormones of this gland are polypeptides that have variable length of amino acids chains. This length of the amino acid chains can vary from ten amino acids to more than one hundred. The pituitary gland is so important because the hormones secreted regulate many biological processes within the body (metabolism, growth, reproduction, blood pressure, and sexual maturation).Examples of short chain hormones are vasopressin and oxytocin. These two hormones each possess a chain of nine amino acids. The sequence differs allowing them to be completely different proteins.
An example of a large protein hormone is the hormone insulin. This hormone has a sequence of amino acids that is of hundreds of amino acids.

, Because protein hormones are water-soluble, they can easily travel through the bloodstream which is water-based. For the hormones that are secreted and then act on cells far away from their original source, this is particularly important. Once they are secreted, they can travel directly through the bloodstream to get to the cells they need to act on elsewhere in the body.Steroidal hormones are also capable of traveling through the bloodstream, but they need to be attached to carrier proteins that are water soluble in order to do this. When they get to their destination, they are released from the protein carrier and then travel through the plasma membrane into the cell.

, While the general function of a hormone is to trigger an event within a cell, each individual hormone will trigger something specific within the cell. There are many protein hormones, but the following is a list of a few and their associated functions:


Enkephalins: found in the thalamus; help moderate pain within the body by suppressing pain signals in the brain.Insulin: produced by the pancreas; allows your body to use glucose for energy and store it for later use.Thyroid hormones: important for the proper development of brain, skeleton, and organs., A quick way to identify if a hormone is a protein hormone is to see if it ends in “-ine”. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroxine are all amino acid derived hormones.As always, there are exceptions: melatonin almost ends in “-ine”. It is derived from the amino acid tryptophan.

, If you need to memorize the specific hormones secreted by a certain gland, an easy way to do this is with a mnemonic. Mnemonics are memory tricks that make it easier to remember a lot of information. To memorize the hormones that are secreted by the pituitary gland, use the phrase FLAT PEG:F: FSH – follicle stimulating hormone; stimulates ovary follicles to mature or testes to produce sperm
L: LH – luteinizing hormone; LH surge triggers ovulation or stimulates testosterone production in the testes
A: ACTH – adrenocorticotropic hormone; stimulates the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.
T: TSH – thyroid stimulating hormone; triggers the thyroid to release thyroid hormones
P: PRL – prolactin; triggers the breasts to produce milk
E: endorphins
G: GH – growth hormone; triggers growth of muscle and bone, and burns fat

, The easiest way to study the function of individual hormones is to make flashcards for them. Write the hormone on one side and write its function on the other side. You can flip through the cards until you have them all memorized.


Flashcards are a great way to study because they are easily transportable and you can study a few at a time.
Take them out when you are waiting around or riding the bus/train to school to get in a short study session.

Study the biochemistry of dopamine in details.,
Know the main pharmacological drugs that are used to treat psychotic patients and their manner of function.",How to Study the Physiological Effects of Dopamine on the Human Body," Disturbances in the concentration of this organic compound in the body have many clinical manifestations that are well documented by experimental observations on laboratory animals. These experimental clinical manifestations of the abnormal concentrations of this neurotransmitter in the body of humans were also corroborated by similar findings in human samples that were used to see the effects of this neurotransmitter on the performance of their nervous system. These clinical findings are considered nowadays well established diagnostic tools for disorders that involve changes in the concentration of this neurotransmitter in the body.;
, On the biochemical level of metabolic pathways for the synthesis of this compound in the neurons of the nervous system also disturbances in the biochemical synthesis of this organic material are also well established and are used clinically to design pharmacological drugs to treat these metabolic abnormalities in the biosynthetic pathways of this important neurotransmitter in the nervous system of the human body.

, Due to its extremely significant clinical effects on the body of humans, this material and its originating neurons within the basal ganglia of the human brain are the subject of intensive scientific research at both the synthetic as well as on the biological levels. The various receptors of this neurotransmitter along the neurons of the nervous system have been extensively studied. The results show that this compound has distinct clinical effects on the performance of the brain at the cognitive level as well as clinical effects at the other physiological levels such as its effects on the neurons in the brainstem that are concerned with the sensations of hunger and sexual desire. All these supposed clinical effects of this neurotransmitter were observed experimentally in all patients with excessive amount of this neurotransmitter in their body. The neuronal structure in the brain of humans that is called the basal ganglia was found to be the main source of this compound in the brain of humans.

, The secretion of this neurotransmitter is performed by specialized cluster of neurons that is clinically called the substantia nigra. This nucleus of neurons within the basal ganglia of the brain is presumed to be the main source of this neurotransmitter in the brain of humans. Biochemical disturbances in the function of the cells of this anatomical structure of the basal ganglia show strong associations with psychiatric disorders such as Parkinson disease and schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that is a major health issue in the practice of mental health medicine.

, A large number of population in the world suffer from this debilitating and potentially progressive mental disorder. This psychiatric disorder has clinical manifestations that usually interfere with the normal life of the affected persons. This is so due to the severe mental disturbances which are usually associated with this disorder.

, For example cognitive ability of most schizophrenic patients is severely diminished by the effect of dopamine excess in their body. These patients can sometimes show behavior that is very odd due to its being of illogical coherence. Detachment of thinking processes from the real conscious world is often observed in these patients. Psychotic episodes of irrational and completely illogical behavior are also well established in patients of this type of mental disease. This psychotic thinking in these patients shows strong association with the level of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the body of these patients. It is well established today that excessive amounts of this compound in the body are the direct result of the psychotic symptoms and the other symptoms that are also observed such as increased sexual desire and increased appetite for food. On the level of low dopamine concentration in the body the clinical symptoms are entirely different.

, Dopamine is a known inhibitory neurotransmitter. This fact is observed for example in Parkinson disease where the deficiency of this compound in the brain removes the inhibitory effect of this neurotransmitter on the body. Therefore clinical symptoms such as tremors of the extremities are often observed in patients that suffer from Parkinson disease. This state of dopamine deficiency in the brain can also be triggered by the effect of pharmacological drugs that are used to treat schizophrenic patients and to treat people who have episodes of psychotic thinking such as auditory and visual hallucinations. Also this type of neuroleptic drugs is often used to treat cognitive dysfunction such as the presence of ideas of reference and grandiose thinking of these patients.

, Examples of pharmacological drugs that are used to treat schizophrenic patients include the commercially available drugs of Zyprexa and Perphenan. These two types of drugs share the common pharmacological effects of antagonizing the effects of dopamine in the brain.

Define a hormone.,
Study how charged residues impart polarity for the whole compound.,
Study polar hormones.,
Study feedback mechanisms.,
Understand what happens with a change in osmolality of the blood.",How to Study the Medical Concept of a Hormone," A hormone is usually an organic compound that is synthesized and secreted by endocrine glands in the body into the blood circulation in response to stimulation that they receive by a specific stimulus. Hormones are the secretory materials of the endocrine system. They are mostly small proteins or polypeptides that are synthesized the usual way other proteins in the body are synthesized using translational method of the genetic code of the DNA molecules.


Other forms of hormones include the important steroid hormones that are synthesized in the adrenal gland and the gonads of both males and females. Steroids and polypeptides are the two main groups of hormones in the human body. Polypeptide hormones are water soluble hormones like all other proteins of the body. This is so due to the presence of charged amino acids residues on its amino acids.;
, This it makes it easily soluble in water. This fact makes this type of hormones to use different method of cellular signaling than the steroid hormones which are usually not water soluble due to their hydrophobic chemical structure. This hydrophobic structure is ascribed to the numerous carbon rings in the compound. Steroid hormones signal cells by different mechanism than that of the polypeptide hormones.

, Polar hormones are usually unable to penetrate the cell by virtue of the hydrophobic cellular membrane that repels that polar hormone. Therefore, this type of hormone bind to cellular receptors that are located at the cellular membrane. On the other hand, steroid hormones are able to penetrate the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer by virtue of its hydrophobic structure. These hormones in turn have cellular receptors that are located inside the cells mostly at the nuclear level where they induce the synthesis of new proteins.

, Hormones are usually secreted into the bloodstream using special mechanisms that are called feedback mechanisms. All hormones of the body have similar mechanisms of feedbacks except the hormones aldosterone and vasopressin. Hormones in the body are usually secreted to the blood using stimulation by hormones of the master gland, the pituitary gland. Increased amount of the pituitary hormone usually induces an increase in the secretion of the hormone of the endocrine gland in the body.


For example, the thyroid stimulating hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland stimulates the secretion of the thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. Increased amount of the thyroid hormone in the blood exerts a negative feedback effect on the pituitary gland causing it to reduce the secretion of the thyroid stimulating hormone. On the other hand, a reduced amount of the thyroid hormone in the blood lifts the negative feedback and allows for more secretion of the thyroid stimulating hormone by the pituitary gland.
This mechanism of feedback is typical of all hormones except the hormones aldosterone and vasopressin. These two hormones share similar manner of negative feedback that is manifested by the change in osmolality of the blood and the blood volume level in the arteries.

, An elevated level of osmolality of the blood causes an increase in the secretion of both of these two hormones into the blood. Also low blood volume in the arteries causes an increase in the secretion of both of these two hormones into the blood circulation. The reverse is also true. High blood volume in the arteries causes diminished secretion of both of these hormones. Also a decrease in the blood osmolality causes an increase in the secretion of both of these hormones. Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that has completely different mechanism of cellular signaling than vasopressin which is a protein hormone.


Each hormone has different and typical function that characterizes it. For example, the hormone vasopressin has an effect on water balance in the body.
Aldosterone has also an effect on water balance in the body but through a different mechanism than that of vasopressin. Hormones need special mechanisms to neutralize their effect after the completion of their physiological effect. This is usually achieved in the liver cells where these hormones modified in their chemical structure. In liver failure some of these hormones can maintain their function endlessly causing clinical symptoms.

Learn the definition of hypoglycemia.,
Study the role of glucagon.,
Study the role of malignancies in bringing about hypoglycemia.,
Study the role of adrenal cortex insufficiency in causing hypoglycemia.,
Study the role of chronic renal failure and chronic liver failure in bringing about hypoglycemia.,
Consider doing a case study on diabetic mothers to further examine hypoglycemia.,
Learn how drugs can cause hypoglycemia.",How to Study Hypoglycemia," Hypoglycemia is a disorder of glucose balance in the blood in which there is a lower than normal concentration of glucose. Usually glucose transport in the blood is done using the protein hormone insulin. Usually also insulin helps glucose to enter the cells where it is metabolized in the energy producing processes which are called glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.


Without the help of insulin, namely in diabetic patients glucose cannot enter the cells and a state of hyperglycemia ensues. There are many causes to hypoglycemia. One of them is insulin excess in the blood. Insulin is usually secreted to the blood by the islet cells of the pancreas in response to high glucose level in the blood.
A tumour of the islet cells of the pancreas either isolated or as a part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome or MEN can cause a state of insulin excess in the blood which is called insulinoma which can trigger a state of hypoglycemia.;
, Hypoglycemia in turn stimulates the release of glucagon from the islet cells and epinephrine and Norepinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system in addition to growth hormone which is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. All these hormones and neurotransmitters stimulate the release of glucose in to the blood from its storage site in glycogen.


Glucagon is a protein hormone which is an antagonist to the action of insulin. It functions by increasing the degradation of the biopolymer glycogen into its glucose units. Thus increasing its concentration in the blood. In some cases there is a tumour of the islet cells of the glucagon secreting cells. Thus causing a state of hyperglycemia with its accompanying diabetic symptoms.

, Another cause to hypoglycemia occurs in certain types of malignancies in which the malignant cells secrete an insulin like growth factor which mimic insulin in its function and has similar activity to insulin. Thus causing a state of pseudoinsulinoma. The treatment to this condition is by surgical removal of the tumor cells or by chemotherapy that destroys the malignant cells.

, Usually the adrenal cortex secretes important hormones to the circulation such as cortisol and aldosterone in addition to androgens. These hormone have important physiological roles and there absence or excess can be manifested clinically by metabolic diseases such as Addison's disease and Cushing's syndrome.


Cortisol acts among its many functions by increasing glucose level in the blood. In adrenal cortex insufficiency cortisol secretion is insufficient. Thus, causing a state of hypoglycemia. Cortisol antagonizes the action of insulin the same way that glucagon antagonizes the action of insulin.

, The kidneys and the liver are potential sites for the synthesis of glucose through a process which is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is an anabolic process in which glucose is synthesized in the body from amino acids. This is usually done in the case of hypoglycemia or shortage of glucose in the blood. Gluconeogenesis is the reverse of glycolysis. Glycolysis is the process of glucose metabolism to generate energy rich ATP molecules. In gluconeogenesis glucose is synthesized from amino acids and this process requires energy in contrast to glycolysis process which releases energy.


Therefore, liver and kidney failure deprive the body from a route to generate glucose. Thus these conditions can predispose to hypoglycemia.

, Diabetic mothers usually give birth to children with overweight due to the high glucose concentration in their blood. Also the high glucose concentration in the fetus blood causes a state of pancreatic islet cells hyperplasia which over-secretes the hormone insulin after birth. This hyperplasia is not corrected after birth and thus causing a state of hypoglycemia.

, Drugs administration against hyperglycemia states such as sulfonylurea can cause a state of hypoglycemia as well if taken in overdose. Alcoholics are especially vulnerable to develop hypoglycemia state possibly due to malnutrition or due to inhibition of gluconeogenesis.

Understand the difference between the metallic and ionic forms of calcium.,
Study the use of calcium by the body.,
Study the parathyroid hormone.,
Locate calcium in the periodic table.,
Study the reactive nature of calcium.,
Study how calcium is (or is not) dissolved.,
Learn the calcium compounds.",How to Study the Chemistry and Physiological Roles of Calcium Ions in the Body," The element calcium follows the trend in properties that is seen with magnesium, sodium and potassium elements. Namely, it is toxic to mammals in its metallic form, while it is benign in its ionic form. Actually, calcium ions are not only benign but also essential for the metabolism of the body.;
, Calcium ions are required for the construction and building of bone tissue. It is also important for the proper functioning of the hormone insulin. Its concentration in the blood is controlled by two hormones. These are parathyroid hormone and calcitonin.

, This hormone is secreted by the parathyroid gland and it stimulates the release of calcium ions into the blood. Calcitonin, on the other hand stimulates the deposition of calcium ions to bone tissue. Therefore, we see the importance of calcium ions by the number of hormones that the body uses to regulate its function.

, It is next to sodium. In addition, it has the electronic configuration of sodium plus an additional electron in the 3s orbital. It has the electronic configuration of neon plus two additional electrons in the 3s orbital.


The ionic diameter of the calcium ion is 200 pm which is comparable in value to that of sodium ion. The sodium ion has an ionic diameter of 204 pm. This proximity in ionic diameter values makes the chemistry of both of these elements similar to each other. It is important to note here that this phenomenon is called in chemistry the diagonal relation between elements in the periodic table. It is a general trend for elements of the periodic table.

, Calcium is more reactive than magnesium. This is due to the higher energy of the 2 electrons in the 3s orbital of calcium, in contrast to the 2 electrons of magnesium which reside in the 2s orbital. This 2s orbital is energetically lower than the 3s orbital of calcium.


Neon is a noble gas which is inert at room temperature. Therefore, calcium metal is reactive due to the existence of the two additional electrons in the 3s orbital. It therefore tends to lose these electrons easily in order to achieve the electronic configuration of neon.

, Crown ethers can dissolve calcium ions and organic solvents cannot dissolve it. Due to its positive charge non-polar organic solvents are especially not capable of dissolving alkaline earth ionic metals nor alkali metals ions.

, Calcium has many compounds that are produced on a commercial basis. Calcium carbonate or CaCO3 in the form of limestone is the most important row material of calcium. CaCO3 occurs also in other minerals such as chalk and marble and calcite. CaCO3 is used to generate calcium oxide CaO. By heating CaCO3 to elevated temperature it gives CaO and CO2.


CaO is a base while CO2 is an acid. The combination of an acid an a base in inorganic chemistry usually gives salt. Calcium metal is generated by the electrolysis process of the halide of calcium.
Another compound of calcium is calcium hydroxide. It is used in paper industry and in pulp industry. Organic compounds of calcium are more reactive than their counterparts of magnesium. Strontium and barium compounds are more reactive than that of calcium.
Calcium forms ionic compounds with all non metals such as the halogens and chalcogens. The reactivity of calcium column in the periodic table increases as we go down the periodic table. Thus, while magnesium is less reactive than calcium one observes that strontium and barium are more reactive than calcium.
This trend in reactivity is ascribed to the higher energy of the loosely bound 2 electrons in the outermost s orbital of these metals.

Have a positive attitude towards biology.,
Break down complex words into their roots.,
Make flashcards for the vocabulary words.,
Draw and label diagrams.,
Read the textbook before class.,
Learn concepts from general to specific.,
Answer the questions at the end of each chapter.,
Review your notes within a day of each lecture.,
Set aside time specifically for studying biology.,
Study old quizzes and exams before tests.",How to Study for Biology," Biology can be complicated, but it is also very interesting if you take a step back to think about what you’re studying. Having the right attitude can make it more fun to study. It will still be difficult, but if you’re interested in what you’re learning, it won’t feel like such a burden.


Think about how your body works. How do your muscles work together to allow you to move? How does your brain communicate with those muscles to tell your body to take a step? It’s very complex, but all of the cells in your body work together to keep you healthy.
Biology teaches you all about these processes and how they work. That’s pretty fascinating if you think about it.;
, You might find the vocabulary of biology complicated and difficult to spell. However, most words in this subject come from Latin, and have a prefix and suffix. Knowing the prefixes and suffixes that compose the terms can help you spell difficult words and grasp their meaning.


For example, the word ""glucose"" can be separated into two parts, ""gluc"" means sweet, and ""-ose"" means sugar. As ""-ose"" means sugar, you know maltose, sucrose, lactose are sugars as well.The term ""endoplasmic reticulum"" seems difficult. However, if you know ""endo"" means ""within/ inside"", ""plasmic"" means cytoplasm and ""reti"" stands for net, you will know that it is a net-like structure that is found inside the cytoplasm., Flashcards are one of the best ways to learn the meanings of the many words you’ll come across in biology. You can carry them around with you and study them at any time. In the car on the way to school is a great time to flip through your flashcards. While the process of making flashcards is a helpful way to study, the cards themselves are only useful if you actually study them as well.At the beginning of each new unit, identify the vocabulary words that you don’t know and make flashcards of them.
Study these cards all throughout the unit and by the time the test comes, you will know them all!

, Sketching a diagram of a biological process can be a simpler way to learn the concept than just reading about it. If you really understand it, you should be able to draw the entire process and label all of the important aspects. Study the diagrams that are in your textbook as well. Read the captions and truly understand what the diagram is representing and how it relates to the concept you are learning.Many biology courses will start by learning about the cell and the various parts and organelles that makeup the cell. Being able to draw this and label all of the pieces is important.
The same goes for many of the cell cycles such as ATP synthesis and the Krebs Cycle. Practice drawing these a few times a week to make sure you have them down before the exam.

, Biology is not a subject that can be absorbed in the short period of time you are in class. Reading the material before it is covered in class will give you a head start on the concepts and you’ll know what is coming up. The text will introduce the topics to you and you will get much more out of class if you come prepared to ask questions based on your reading.Refer to your syllabus to know what parts of the book to read before class.
Take notes on the material and come to class with questions in hand.

, Understanding biology requires that you have a general understanding of the broad concepts before you can really get into the details. Really master the broad topics before trying to comprehend the details of how they work.You need to know that proteins are made from the blueprints of DNA before you can understand how the DNA is read and then translated into these proteins.
Outlines are a great way to organize your notes from general to specific.

, Biology textbooks have really good questions at the end of each chapter that reinforce the concepts that you need to understand from the material. Try answering the questions and see how many you can get through. Take note of the questions that are more difficult to answer. Revisit your notes on these topics and/or reread that part of the chapter.If you’re having a lot of difficulty answering these questions, seek extra help from your classmates or teacher.

, Avoid walking out of class and forgetting about everything you just learned. Reviewing your notes later that evening or the next day can help you synthesize what you have learned. When reviewing, ask yourself if everything makes sense.


If something stands out that confuses you, reread the material on that concept in your textbook. If it still doesn’t make sense, ask your teacher about it in the next class.

, Because biology can be difficult for many students, you must put in the time to do well. If you set aside time every night or every other night for biology, you will get into the good habit of frequently studying. You will thank yourself later when you don’t have to cram for the exam because you have been reviewing everything this whole time.Stick to your study schedule and make it a habit. If you skip one day, be sure to get back on track the next day and not let yourself slip into not studying multiple days in a row.

, If you have access to exams from previous years, try taking them and see how much of you get right. If you don’t have access to these, study your quizzes and previous tests for an idea of the types of questions you will get asked.Answering questions from old tests will give you an idea of what you need to keep studying and what topics you have mastered.

Learn about the structure of the liver.,
Study the role of the blood supply to the liver.,
Study the role of the liver's immune cells.,
Learn about how humans metabolize fatty acids.,
Study diseases of the liver.",How to Study and Understand the Functions of the Liver in Humans," Its structure is unusual in the sense that it has dual blood supply from two different sources. One of them is through the hepatic artery that supplies blood that is rich in oxygen to the liver tissue. The other blood source is from the portal vein which originates in the digestive system in its various parts.;
, This blood supply to the liver carries blood that is rich with nutrients and small molecules such as amino acids and glucose molecules. This blood supply can also bring to the liver tissue other compounds that can be toxic to the liver cells. This can include for example, bacteria and other pathogens that can enter the blood stream to reach eventually the liver sinuses.

, The liver has special type of immune cells that can neutralize pathogens and bacterial forms. These cells are a special type of macrophages that help in fighting pathogens and keep the body in healthy condition. The liver in humans plays a major part in the metabolic reactions inside the body. For example, the liver is the site of energy production for the body. The glycolytic pathway and the Krebs cycle both occur in the liver cells that are called hepatocytes.


These two processes of energy production are crucial for the sustaining of life to the individual. Metabolic reactions for the production of energy-rich molecules in the form of ATP molecules are very important processes that have been studied extensively, and their detailed reactions are clear and understood. The other significant function of the liver is the synthesis of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors in humans are a group of proteins that have physiological effect to cause blood clotting.
These clotting factors are very important to the body in order to prevent bleeding disorders in the individuals. In the case of liver failure, the capacity of the liver to synthesize these proteins is impaired. If severe enough this can lead to bleeding disorders in affected individuals.

, Another important function of the liver in humans is the metabolism of fatty acids. This process is especially important in diabetic patients who rely on the metabolism of fatty acids for their generation of energetic molecules of ATP. Furthermore, certain hormones are modified in the cells of the liver or hepatocytes.


An example is the hormone vasopressin. This hormone usually functions by regulating the level of water in the blood.

, In liver failure, the liver cells are unable to modify its structure and neutralize its function. The result is the sustaining of its continuous function. This can lead to the clinical symptoms of edema and hypertension due to the accumulation of water in the body. The liver has also another important function that is related to neutralizing and removing toxic compounds from the blood.


A typical example is the molecule of ammonia. This compound is the degradation product of amino acids metabolism in the liver. The delamination process of amino acids yields ammonia molecules as byproducts. This compound can potentially accumulate in the blood to toxic levels in the case of liver failure causing a medical condition which is called hepatic encephalopathy. This condition involves also the brain in addition to the liver.
The accumulation of ammonia in the brain can cause brain tissue damage that can be irreversible. Hepatocytes can also synthesize and secrete the important pigment of bilirubin. This compound is the major constituent of bile. Bilirubin and bile acids are secreted to the biliary canals into the gallbladder where it is stored and concentrated. Upon receipt of a hormonal signal from the stomach the gallbladder contracts and releases its bile content into the intestine.

Learn what is pancreatic failure.,
Study the causes of pancreatic failure.,
The process of pancreatic insufficiency refers to primarily to the exocrine pancreas.,
Know the enzymes that are secreted by the pancreas.,
One of them is called amylase.,
This enzyme is also secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth.,
Proteins are also digested in the stomach by the enzyme pepsin.,
In addition lipase deficiency can have remarkable effects on the digestive system that can be manifested as steatorhea or passing fatty stool.,
These enzymes can in turn autodigest the pancreas its self.,
The treatment of this medical condition can be done through the administration of supplementary amounts of pancreatic enzymes that are called pancreatin.",How to Study and Understand Pancreatic Failure in Humans," Pancreatic failure refers to a disorder of the pancreas in which its exocrine cells are degenerated and destroyed. This in turn leads to its inability to secrete its usual digestive enzymes into the intestinal canal. This in turn causes maldigestion and accompanying constipation symptoms.;
, The reason for the pancreatic failure can be due to autodigestion process of the pancreatic tissue its self by its digestive enzymes. Alternatively it can occur due hypothermic conditions or due to ischemic conditions which are short blood supply to the pancreatic tissue.

, This is so because the pancreas has in addition endocrine function that is distinct than the exocrine function. The exocrine pancreas has important function that is related to the digestion process of food in the intestine.

, There are three main types of digestive enzymes that are secreted by the pancreas.

, This type of enzymes is specific for the degradation and digestion of carbohydrates that are polymers of glucose molecules.

, The other important enzyme that is also secreted by the exocrine pancreas is called trypsin and chymotrypsin. These two types of enzymes are specific for the cleavage of peptide bonds in proteins. Each of them is specific for a different type of peptide bond.

, The third enzyme that is secreted by the pancreatic cells is called lipase. This enzyme is specific for the cleavage of ester bonds in lipids to form glycerol and three fatty acids. This enzyme is characteristic only for the pancreatic tissue and is not secreted by other organs in the body. In pancreatic failure all these enzymes can be deficient in the intestine. This can lead in turn to maldigestion and constipation symptom. Also the maldigestion can lead to lack of energy for the body which can be manifested as loss of weight.

, This fatty stool can be confirmed by the observation of floating stool in water. The reason for the pancreatic failure can also be due to blockage of the head of the pancreatic canal by a cholesterol stone in the bile secretions to the intestine. This blocking of the pancreatic canal leads to the reflux of pancreatic enzymes that are activated into the pancreatic tissue.

, This in turn can cause destruction of the pancreatic cells that are part of the exocrine pancreas. Also in cases of cancer of the head of the pancreas it is observed that the pancreatic canal is blocked by the cancerous tumor. This in turn can cause reflux of the pancreatic enzymes into the pancreatic canal which leads to the digestion of the pancreatic tissue by its own enzymes.

, This usually helps in the digestion process of food in the intestine.

Enroll in the right class for you.,
Check your degree requirements.,
Use visual aids.,
Collaborate with your peers.,
Teach the subject.,
Study related subjects.",How to Study Anatomy1," Are you a novice when it comes to anatomical studies, or do you have experience with the subject? Is there a particular component of anatomy, such as the skeletal structure or the central nervous system, that interests you? Make sure you are in an anatomy class that caters to your level of understanding and your needs.


If you are new to studying anatomy, it is advisable to take an introductory course in order to provide you with basic concepts, theories, and terms that will be needed for your future studies.
If you have the ability, you may want to ask a friend or peer who has previously taken an anatomy course if you can look over their notes and syllabus to see if the class meets your needs.;
, If you are studying anatomy as part of a diploma, degree, or certificate program, work with your academic advisor to make sure you are taking the correct course for your program. You may want to ask, “Does this course have a lab component that requires separate enrollment?” so that you can ensure you are in all of the right classes to get the credit you need.Check with your academic advisor regularly to make sure that your courses are correct.

, Anatomy deals with a large number of components of the human body. Use labeled diagrams and sketches in your notes so that you understand how the specific parts you study fit and interact in the rest of the body.Ask your teacher, “Do you have any images or diagrams I can copy for study aids?”
Use unlabeled versions of your diagrams or note sketches to test yourself and help reinforce your knowledge.

, Look to your classmates and see if you can create a study group or weekly meeting group to exchange notes and talk about the course. Use this time to have your peers help you with concepts that aren’t sticking with you.


This is also a great space to help tutor your peers, which in turn allows you to review and reinforce information in your own mind.
Make these meetings fun, informal spaces where you and your peers can talk freely about what you are learning. Allow for conversation, rather than the question and answer format you have in class.

, Tutor for the subject, or teach your friends, your family, your roommates, or someone else who wants to learn more. Trying to teach is one of the best way to know whether or not you fully comprehend the subject, and this way you and your student both benefit.Ask a friend or family member, “Can I try to teach you this particular anatomy concept?” Explain it to them as best as you can, and have them repeat it back to you. Use their informational gaps as guides for where you should study.
Offer to tutor a lower grade level in their anatomy class. This gives you the chance to review material while helping another student of anatomy.

, Anatomy has a lot of shared information with subjects such as embryology, comparative anatomy, and evolutionary biology. Enroll in classes in related subjects that might help you with your educational goals.


Comparative anatomy and evolutionary biology look at how the human anatomical structure developed and how it relates to the anatomy of other animals.Embryology focuses on the development of sex cells in the womb up to birth."

Learn to dissect.,
Look for what is different.,
Write in-depth lab reports.",How to Study Anatomy2," Anatomy resides inside the body. If you have the opportunity, watch or participate in a dissection. Try to study the cadaver as much as possible, relating what you have recently studied to what you see before you.Discuss this with your labmates and listen to what they have to say, so as not to miss out on any insight. Try not to skip any dissection labs, even though you may not enjoy doing them. Little else can give you this hands-on experience.
If you are truly opposed to human dissection, ask your teacher for guidance finding an online dissection module. This allows you to digitally dissect the body without actually having to work with a cadaver.

, Anatomy books focus on the average human condition, but no individual is going to completely align with the average condition. Take a look while you are in the lab at what may be different than in your book to get an understanding of what is normal and what is abnormal.Talk with your teacher about your observations. Ask them, “If a certain condition is considered average, is what I observed considered abnormal or problematic?”
Always follow up by asking, “Why is that?” so that you understand not only how certain parts of the body may differ, but also why.

, You are likely graded on your lab reports, but you should think of them as a tool for your as well as a grade. Write in-depth, well-researched lab reports that contains not only the information requested by your teacher, but also information you find valuable.Your report should include your hypothesis, your tests, your raw data, and your interpretations of the data.
Use your data interpretation to include information from your course and from other sources such as peer-reviewed journals and monographs. Make notes of why you think what you think in your lab report.

Do the readings.,
Find an online resource.,
Look into an open learning program.,
Write concepts in your own words.,
Study Greek and Latin.",How to Study Anatomy3," Your assigned readings are there for a reason. Read your textbook and any assigned articles, and take notes as you go through if any concept confuses you. Set a reminder for yourself to ask questions about your reading during or after class.Look for supplemental readings that may engage you, such as medical novels or historical accounts of early dissections. Make notes of what you find interesting and what you think might be inaccurate so that you can ask your peers or teacher.

, Use online modules or tutorials to help reinforce the information you learn. You may even opt to use online models to help you recognize parts of the body, or create digital flashcards to help you study.Use online materials as a supplement to your studies. Do not expect to get all of the information you need to know strictly from online materials. Lab and class time are equally important in studying anatomy.

, If anatomy is an interest or hobby rather than part of your formal education, look at learning through an open platform such as Coursera or the Open Learning Initiative.These allow you to connect with courses from universities all over the world for free.


If a general anatomy course is not being offered, look for a specialized one to get you started in your studies.
These courses include a lot of material, but are largely self-directed. Do all of the readings, assignments, quizzes, and discussion posts to get the most out of them.

, Take large or complicated concepts and rewrite them in your own words. Instead of trying to memorize your book, break down concepts in your own terms so that you better understand them when you review them.


Try using flash cards with the concept on the front, and your description on the back. Use these to review as you study.
You may also find it useful to use mnemonic devices to help you remember key concepts or phrases. For example, the word ""SCALP"" can help you remember the anatomical layers of the scalp (skin, connective tissue, aponeurosis, loose connective tissue, periosteum)., Medical terminology is full of Greek and Latin roots and words. For example, the cardiovascular system comes from the Greek root καρδιά (kardia), which means heart. Look for books or online lessons in basic Greek or Latin to help you more easily understand medical terminology.


There are many publications that focus on Greek and Latin roots for medical students. Check online or with your local book store to find specialized text for anatomy students.
Use online learning modules and focus on lessons about body parts or medical terms.

Use a cup of plain, white vinegar.,
Try lemon juice.,
Use orange juice.",How to Simulate Stomach Acid1," While vinegar is not as acidic as stomach acid, it can be used to simulate what a stomach does in a simple experiment. To use it, simply fill a cup with vinegar, and drop what you want to test into the cup.Vinegar ranks at about 2 on the pH scale, so it is about as acidic as stomach acid.


The acidity of stomach acid is usually in the range of 1 to 3 on the pH scale. It can decrease in acidity as food enters the stomach.The pH scale goes from 0 (extremely acidic) to 15 (extremely basic). Water is neutral at 7.;
, Like vinegar, lemon juice can be used to simulate stomach acid. Bottled lemon juice tends to be more stable in its pH than fresh squeezed, though you can use either. Lemon juice is at about a 2 on the pH scale.Lime juice is on par with lemon juice, at about 2 on the pH scale., Orange juice isn't quite as acidic as lemon juice. It's about a 3 on the pH scale. However, it will do in a pinch, as it is still acidic.Grapefruit juice is on a similar level to orange juice and can also be used; the canned version is slightly more acidic."
"
Gather your materials.,
Combine the ingredients.,
Make the stomach action.,
Decide if you want to continue the experiment.",How to Simulate Stomach Acid2," For this type of experiment, you can simulate a stomach with a strong zip-top plastic bags. Freezer bags are usually stronger than regular bags. You'll also need water (or one of the liquids from the first section) and food (bread works well).While using water doesn't simulate stomach acid, most foods will break up in water eventually, especially bread or crackers.
You also may want to wear latex gloves for this experiment, as well as put down newspaper or paper towels.

, Tear the food into larger pieces to simulate the teeth breaking it apart. Add the food to the bag. Pour in enough liquid to cover the bag. Squeeze out the extra air, and zip up the bag., Gently squeeze the bag back and forth. This motion simulates how the stomach works. Keep working at it until the food is mostly broken apart., At this point, you can end the experiment, as you've simulated the stomach. However, you can also simulate the small intestine. For this part of the experiment, you'll need a single stocking, with the foot cut out. Scoop the food in one end. Squeeze the food down the stocking, noticing how liquid comes out through the stocking as you go. When you've reached the other end, squeeze the food out onto a plate, simulating how food is turned into feces and squeezed out of the anus."

Know what are neurons.,
Understand the physiology of neurons.,
Know the importance of the nervous system in humans.,
Learn about the physiology of sensation.,
Understand the various disorders of the nervous system.,
Understand the nature of pain sensation.,
Know the difference between neurons of humans and animals.",How to Study and Understand the Function of Neurons in Humans," Neurons are specialized cells in the body of living organisms such as mammalians. In particular these cells are important in humans. Neurons are of two types in humans. One of them is called neurons and the other type is called glial cells. Neurons are the functional cells of the nervous system. On the other hand glial cells have secondary supporting function in the various parts of the nervous system. These glial cells are of different types that depend on the branch of the nervous system.;
, Neurons in humans do not have capacity to divide and multiply. This is important clinically because these cells do not undergo mutagenesis or transform into cancerous cells. Also this fact is important for the maintaining of proper function of the memory in humans. On the other hand, their inability to divide and multiply has the clinical disadvantage of irreversible damage to the nervous system in injuries of this biological system. Therefore injury to the nervous system such as spinal cord injuries can be irreversible. Manifestations of this type of injury can be paralysis of the extremities or gait disorders or walking problems in affected individuals.

, The nervous system in general and its neurons in particular are very crucial for the sustaining of life of the individual. Neurons are the mediators of cellular communication between muscle cells and the cells of nervous system. This is important for example in the processing of memory and the mediation of logical reasoning. In addition other processes are involved such as the secretion of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft between neurons. These neurotransmitters are the main chemical mediators of cellular signaling between cells of the nervous system and between neurons and muscle cells.

, Sensations such as heat and cold sensations are perceived in organs of the body such as the skin through free nerve endings which are specialized types of neurons in the body that are specialized for sensory functions. Neurons are divided functionally into motor neurons and sensory neurons. Most cells in the nervous system are of these two types. Sensory neurons are the source of incoming information into the body such visual and hearing signals. Motor neurons are responsible for the muscles contraction and relaxation in the various parts of the body. Special parts of the nervous system in humans that are important for the motor function of neurons include the basal ganglia and the cerebellum of the brain. Also the cerebral cortex has motor neurons that carry motor function in the body.

, The spinal cord in humans has both motor and sensory neurons. Disorders of movement in humans are mostly disorders of motor neurons in either the brain or the spinal cord. For example, gait disorders can be caused due to dysfunctional cerebellum or dysfunctional basal ganglia. Also dysfunctional motor neurons of the brain cortex can cause gait disorders. In addition injuries to motor neurons of the spinal cord can trigger gait disorders such as dysfunctional spinal reflexes. Pain sensation is mediated through special type of neurons in the body. These neurons are not adaptive in its function. This means that the strength of their signals is constant in its value.

, Pain in the nervous system is of two types. One of them is physiological that is caused due to organic cause such as tissue injury. The other cause of pain is due to psychological undefined causes. This is triggered for example in people who are depressed or suffer from psychological conflicts. This type of pain is ill defined physiologically that does not have an apparent organic cause. Neurons of the nervous system in humans are much more developed than other neurons of other living organisms such as the reptiles.

, Humans neurons have capacity to translate electric signals into logical and predictable behavior in contrast to animals who can have unpredictable ill-defined behaviors. Also neurons in humans have the capacity to store large amount of memory in their structures. This is possible due to the morphological changes that these neurons undergo in their chemical structure such a change in their axons and their cell bodies.

Do exercises that target fat cells.,
Perform cardiovascular/aerobic exercises on a daily basis.,
Perform weight resistance exercises on a daily basis.,
Do short bursts of High-Intensity exercises.,
Eat more dark-colored fruits and vegetables.,
Consume more omega-3 fatty acids.,
Opt for flavor that is naturally nutritious.,
Lower your triglyceride levels.,
Get a good night's sleep every night.,
Stay hydrated.,
Consider taking supplements.,
Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.",How to Stimulate a Leptin Response in Your Body," Simply shedding numbers on a scale will not be good enough if you want to improve your body's leptin response. You'll need to burn off as many fat cells as you can. Although obese people have leptin in their system, their appetites are rarely quenched because they have developed a resistance to leptin, or a leptin resistance, via their fat cells. Leptin regulates metabolism and appetite — as leptin levels rise your appetite diminishes and your metabolic rate increases.;
, Cardiovascular exercise is any workout that increases oxygen intake, while aerobic exercises increase blood flow. Often these activities coincide. Simply walking 30 minutes every day can burn enough fat to trigger a leptin response. Ideally, do a high level of sustained activity that increases oxygen intake and blood flow.


Shoot for 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every week. This is about 2 ½ hours weekly. The burning of fat cells releases the leptin that was stored in them. Additionally, this kind of exercise increases the overall amount of active leptin receptors.As an added benefit, cardiovascular exercise also boosts your metabolism (which has to do with the rate at which you burn calories) if you vary your routine.
Your max heart rate when exercising is roughly 220 - your age (so if you're 35, 220 - 35 = 185 beats per minute). You can exercise up to 80% of you max heart rate for best cardiovascular training.

, Lifting weights regularly burns off fat cells and calories and strengthens your muscles. An increase in muscle mass has been shown to improve metabolism, which aids in the burning of fat cells and the release of leptin into the system.


One weight resistance routine you can do without needing any expensive weights or a gym membership is the ""Tone Up All Over"" strength routine, which has the following moves: the squat to overhead press; single-leg dumbbell row; step-up with bicep curl; dolphin plank; curtsy lunge; and superman., High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a form of anaerobic exercise in which you perform short bursts of workout at maximum intensity (sometimes for as little time as twenty seconds) with periods of less-intense movement for recovery.


HIIT encourages the natural release of Human Growth Hormone (HGH) which helps with fat burning and the regulation of leptin. Some popular HIIT workouts are CrossFit, Fartlek, and the Seven-Minute Workout.
Try and get two to three strength training workouts in every week., Fruits and vegetables with dark skins are excellent sources of phytonutrients, such as carotenoids and flavonoids, which are anti-inflammatory agents that help oxidation in and the body and increase levels of leptin.Carrots, broccoli, spinach, tomatoes, winter squash and papaya are all excellent sources of carotenoids.
Blueberries, cherries, pomegranate, citrus fruits, green tea, onions and dark chocolate are all excellent sources of flavonoids.

, Not all fats are harmful to your body. Omega-3 fatty acids have a unique chemical structure and they are good for you when consumed in moderate amounts. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to the proper functioning of the body and brain. Omega-3 promote healing and decrease inflammation as well as being involved in a wide range of cellular activities, most notably neurological development and functioning.


Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in fish, green and leafy vegetables, nuts and beans. The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids aids in the reduction of blood vessel inflammation, which improves the body's ability to respond to leptin.Selected food sources of omega-3 fatty acids include vegetable oils such as soybean, canola, flax seed oils. Fish oils, fatty fish, and to a lesser extent meats and eggs contain omega-3 fatty acids.
The recommended daily allowance of omega-3 fatty acid is between 1.1 – 1.6 grams per day for females and males, respectively.

, Many food producers overload their products with salt and sugar as a means of covering up the tasteless nature of artificial food. Even the diet varieties (e.g., Diet Coke) rely on sugar substitutes to mask unsavory flavors. Because of this, unnaturally processed foods lack the necessary nutrients and properties that the body requires, resulting in a deficient leptin response.


Instead of fast and processed food, go for foods that are naturally rich in flavor like grains, vegetables, and nutrient-rich fruits.
Use natural herbs that will add a kick to your meals such as sage, thyme and basil instead of artificially flavored foods. , Triglycerides are a major contributor to leptin resistance by inhibiting the transportation of leptin across the blood-brain barrier. To increase leptin sensitivity, decrease your intake of triglycerides.Lower triglycerides by maintaining a healthy weight, limiting fat and sugar intake, maintaining an active lifestyle, not smoking and limiting alcohol.
Certain medications may also contribute to high triglyceride levels, as well as genetic factors. One supplement that is known to reduce triglyceride levels in Niacin, or vitamin B 3. Niacin has been know to lower both cholesterol and triglycerides. This will help with cardiovascular functioning and lower cardiovascular risk levels., There's a lot of debate among people in health science about the best ways to lose weight and keep it off, but everyone agrees that getting adequate sleep is essential. Likewise, getting enough sleep is essential to regulating leptin. Aim for at least seven to nine hours each night.


Scientific study has shown that those who didn't get enough sleep had leptin levels 15% lower than those who had. Not getting enough sleep means you'll have a stronger appetite that is harder to satisfy the next day and throws your whole body out of energy homeostasis, or the balance between energy input and expenditure, which is what leptin is trying to promote.Improve your sleep by practicing good sleep hygiene.

, Most people know that drinking water is important but as much as 75 percent of Americans may be chronically dehydrated. Staying hydrated helps with digestion, mood and controlling hunger, but also contributes to how easily the body absorbs nutrients and vitamins. As such, constant dehydration is likely to severely inhibit your sensitivity to leptin and increase your resistance to it. Stay hydrated to reverse this.


Drink at least eight to ten cups of water, or 64 to 80 ounces, every day.This may seem like a lot, but if you carry a refillable water bottle with you throughout your day, you'll be surprised at how quickly you can get your daily dose.
Avoid alcohol and beverages with caffeine. Do not count them to your daily water intake.

, While there are a number of supplements you can find online that claim to give you more leptin, these are misleading, as leptin doesn't actually enter the bloodstream and so cannot be taken as a supplement.However, there are supplements you can take to encourage leptin sensitivity and/or decrease leptin resistance.


Irvingia is a supplement made from mango extract that can improve leptin sensitivity, among other beneficial effects. If you are over 18 you can take 150 mg a day with food.Antioxidants can be taken as supplements such as Taurine and Acetyl L-Carnitine supplements to help decrease leptin resistance.Grapes, blueberries, nuts, dark green veggies and sweet potatoes are all some natural sources of antioxidants.As always, consult your doctor before taking any new supplement. While most people equate supplements or natural remedies with being harmless, supplements can interact with other medications and cause serious reactions, so it's important you talk to your doctor first.

, Studies seem to indicate that smokingand alcohol consumptioncan inhibit leptin secretion. Additionally, overconsumption of alcohol impairs judgment, which can lead to bad decision about eating, which can further inhibit leptin stimulation.


Check How to Quit Smoking and How to Quit Drinking Alcohol for help.

Gather your materials.,
Make a paste with cornstarch.,
Pour in water and boil.,
Place 10 drops of the starch solution to 75 milligrams of water.,
Add drops of iodine until the solution changes color.",How to Make a Vitamin C Indicator1," Before you can begin to mix your indicator, you must first gather your materials. Most of these materials can be purchased at a supermarket, health store, or pharmacy. However, some ingredients may be tricky to find, so you might have to order them online:Cornstarch
2% iodine solution
Test tubes, which have measurements on the side in milliliters.
Gather liquids of you're choosing, like orange juice, lemon juice, and so on. Once you're vitamin C indicator is ready, you probably want to test the vitamin C level of a variety of substances.
An eye dropper
A pot;
, To start, take a tablespoon of cornstarch and put it in a small bowl. Add a small amount of tap water, just enough to work the cornstarch into a fine paste., Once your paste is ready, measure out 250 milliliters of water with your test tube. Pour this into the cornstarch paste. Put this in a pot and heat over the stove until it boils. Boil for 5 minutes., While your water is boiling, measure out 75 milligrams of water in a test tube. Once your water is done boiling, take your eye dropper. Use your eye dropper to add 10 drops of the starch solution to the 75 milliliters of water., You can now add your iodine. Clean out your eye dropper and then fill it with iodine. Gradually add drops of iodine until your solution turns a dark purple-blue color. Your vitamin C indicator is now finished."
"
Prepare your indicator for use.,
Add 10 drops of various juices to each test tube.,
Measure the samples from lightest to darkest.,
Count how many drops it takes for a sample to change color.",How to Make a Vitamin C Indicator2," You can use your indicator by placing drops of various liquids into the indicator. Indicators turn colorless when exposed to vitamin C. Therefore, you only need a small amount of liquids with a high level of vitamin C to cause the indicator to lose color. You need a larger amount of liquids with a low level of vitamin C to change the indicator's color.If you want to test various liquids, put a bit of the indicator in a few different test tubes. You will be adding drops of different liquids to each test tube. You do not need a lot of indicator to start with, but make sure amount are consistent from test tube to test tube. For example, if you put 5 drops of indicator in the first test tube, you should put 5 drops in all other test tubes.

, Assemble a variety of liquids to test. Use your eye dropper to add 10 drops of each liquid to each test tube of indicator. Then, see how much the color has changed in each tube. Make sure to wash your eye dropper each time you measure out a new liquid. You do not want to accidentally mix liquids, as this will cause inaccurate results., Liquids with a high concentration of vitamin C will have changed the indicator to a light, possibly clear shade. For liquids with a low concentration of vitamin C, the indicator will be darker, retaining a lot of it's purple-blue shade.Some test tubes may be very similar in color. If you're struggling to see which is lighter and which is darker, hold the test tube up against a white background like a white wall or a piece of paper.

, If you only have one test tube, there is another way to compare and contrast vitamin C levels. Using one liquid at a time, record how many drops of each liquid it takes to cause the indicator to change color. The lower the number of drops, the higher the concentration of vitamin C in a substance."

Practice basic safety when using the stove.,
Be careful handling iodine.,
Consider purchasing indophenol.",How to Make a Vitamin C Indicator3," As you'll need to use the stove to make your indicator, practice basic safety. If you're younger, ask an adult to help you before you use a stove.Do not leave the handle of a pot pointed off the edge of the stove. You could accidentally bump into the handle, causing boiling water to fall on you.
Do not use metal utensils to stir you solution. These heat up in hot water, and can burn your hand.
If you're using a metal pot, use oven mitts to remove it from the stove to avoid burning your hand.

, Iodine is safe, but can be toxic if swallowed, so it should not be ingested. It's safe otherwise, but can easily stain clothing. If you're handling iodine, it's a good idea to wear old clothes or an apron., If you do not want to make your own vitamin C indicator, you can purchase a bottle of idophenol online. This is a liquid that, like a cornstarch solution, turns colorless in the presence of vitamin C. You can buy a bottle of indophenol online, and use it as you would use a cornstarch solution."

, Instructions on how to assemble the supercritical dryer will be included here, but it is highly recommended that you take a look at the actual visual schematics provided by the aerogel website.These schematics can be viewed here: http://www.aerogel.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/manuclave-design2.jpg


, This pipe tee body should be 3/4 inch (1.9 cm).


To the two sides of the tee body, you should attach the pipe plugs or door.
You could install a sight window on one side instead of a second pipe plug, if desired.
At the bottom of the tee body, you should connect a ball valve using a 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) reduction bushing.
To the top of the body, screw on, in order: 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) reduction bushing, 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) nipple fitting, and 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) cross.

, The remainder of your valves and gauges will connect to this second cross pipe.


Connect a Bimetal thermometer to the top of the cross pipe.
To the left side, attach 1/4 inch by 1/2 inch (6.35 mm to 1.2 cm) nipple fitting. To date, attach a ball valve.
To the right side, attach another 1/4 inch by 1/2 inch (6.35 mm to 1.2 cm) nipple fitting. To date, attach a 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) cross pipe with a pressure gauge fixed to the top and a pop-safety valve fixed to the bottom.
On the open side arm of the smaller cross pipe, attach another 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) nipple fitting and a needle valve.

, Stainless steel is preferable since it is clean and strong.


You can have gauges with brass threads and valves with carbon steel bodies.
Do not use pipe fittings made of brass or carbon steels, and do not use any part rated for lower than 2000 psi.

, You will need to securely connect the tank to the dryer so that the liquid carbon dioxide can easily flow into the dryer.


It is recommended that you look at the official schematics, found here: http://www.aerogel.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/gastank-1.jpg

Connect to the carbon dioxide tank, in this order: CGA320 male thread, Teflon gasket, CGA inlet nipple, CGA inlet nut, 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) NPT female quick disconnect socket, 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) NPT male quick-disconnect plug, and a braided high-pressure hose, rigid 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) NPT, with female fittings.
To the other side of the hose, attach in this order: 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) NPT male quick disconnect plug and 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) NPT male quick disconnect socket.
Attach the final socket to the intake ball valve of the manuclave or dryer. With this, you should be ready to go., Combine 4.86 g or 5.4 ml concentrated ammonium hydroxide with 1000 ml of water in a glass or plastic bottle.This bottle should be labeled as ""ammonium hydroxide stock solution."" You can store it sealed and at room temperature to be reused at a later date.

, Combine 10.2 g or 10 ml tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) with 7.82 g or 10 ml methanol in a glass beaker. Stir until mixed.


This should be labeled as ""alkoxide solution"" or ""solution A.""
Note that TMOS can be very difficult to purchase since many chemical suppliers are hesitant to sell chemicals to individuals.Even so, you must make sure that you obtain the TMOS from a reliable source so that there are no dangerous impurities in it.

, Combine 5 g or 5 ml of the stock solution previously prepared with 7.92 g or 10 ml of methanol in another glass beaker. Stir until well mixed.


Label this beaker as ""catalyst solution"" or ""solution B.""

, Carefully pour the catalyst (solution B) into the alkoxide (solution A) and stir with a glass stirring rod until completely combined.


Note that the resulting solution is called the ""soul.""

, Line your molds with silicone-based baking paper before pouring the liquid sol into them. Let the sol sit until gel forms.


This can take anywhere from 15 minutes to 1 hour.
You could also pour the sol into syringes with no needles or tops. That way, you can remove the finished gel by pushing it out with the plunger.
TMOS is the source of the silica in this method. The water allows the TMOS to polymerize, and the methanol lets both the water and TMOS enter into the same phase so that they can react. The ammonium hydroxide lets the reaction go faster.

, After the gel sets, place it under methanol and let it age for a full 24 hours, at minimum.

, Change the methanol out for fresh methanol, 200-proof ethanol, or acetone at least four times over the course of a week.


This process draws the water out, leaving you with a pure methanol gel.

, Place the gel in the supercritical dryer's compartment and heat the carbon dioxide through its critical point, 31.1 °C (88.0 °F) and 72.9 bars, to about 45 degrees degrees at a pressure of about 100 bars.


Super critical drying causes the methanol to get drawn out of the gel.
Depressurize the machine at a rate of about 7 bar h-1.
When done, you should be left with a finished silica aerogel.

, Prepare the silica aerogel as instructed previously, combining the same chemical ingredients to produce the ""sol,"" the liquid state of the gel.

, Cover it in ethanol or acetone, changing the solution out four times over the course of a week.

, Mix one part hexane with three parts ethanol until you get a volume that is at least five times as great as the volume of gel currently being processed.Note that you could use acetone instead of ethanol, if desired.
As an example, if you are processing 20 ml of aerogel, you should prepare a solution of 25 ml hexane and 75 ml acetone or ethanol.
Label this as your 25-75 mixture.

, For the second, use equal amounts of both. For the third, use three parts hexane to on part ethanol.


As before, acetone can be used instead of ethanol.
Label the second solution as your 50-50 mixture and the third as your 75-25 mixture.

, Let the gel soak in your 25-75 mixture for 12 to 48 hours.


Afterward, let it soak in your 50-50 mixture for the same amount of time, finishing up by letting it soak in the 75-25 mixture for another 12 to 48 hours.

, Change out the pure hexane three times over the course of 24 to 72 hours.

, Add TMCS to hexane so that 6 percent of the solution's weight is due to TMCS.


Make enough so that you have roughly 15 times as much solution as you have gel.
Label this as your TMCS solution.

, Place the gel in a sealed, chemical-resistant container with a wide mouth. Add enough TMCS solution so that you have 5 to 10 times the volume of the gel. Seal the container.


Lubricate the lid with silicone vacuum grease if using glass. Otherwise, the lid might get stuck.

, Heat the container for 12 to 24 hours at a steady 60 °C (140 °F), using a hot plate or oven. Let it cool to room temperature before exchanging  the TMCS solution with fresh solution.


Repeat this procedure twice more.

, Swap out the TMCS solution for pure hexane and allow the aerogel to soak in it for another 12 to 24 hours.


Over the course of 24 to 72 hours, change out the hexane in the container for fresh hexane at least twice.

, Place the gel i a jar with a little hexane and secure the lid only halfway. Let the gel dry out for 1 to 2 days in this manner.


At the conclusion of this step, your aerogel should be complete.

Stand back!",How to Make an Explosion1," Get a large 2 liter (0.5 US gal) soda bottle and pour in some hydrogen peroxide.The stronger (high concentration or percentage) the hydrogen peroxide you use, the bigger the explosion will be...but be careful: hydrogen peroxide can easily burn you! When you pour it in, use a funnel and get help from an adult.


A 30% hydrogen peroxide will be needed to make the most impressive explosion, but you'll definitely need an adult to help you with this.;
, Pour a tablespoon or two of liquid dish soap into the soda bottle.

, Add a healthy squirt of food coloring if you want your explosion to have a color.

, Mix 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of dried yeast with 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of water in a separate, small bowl.

, Pour it in quickly and stand back!

, The yeast and the hydrogen peroxide will combine to make an explosion of foam. Be careful, this reaction is exothermic, which means it creates heat. Don't touch the foam right away because it will be hot!

, It needs to be Ivory specifically and it needs to be fresh and unused.

, Cut the bar of soap into about 6 pieces. You might need an adult's help to cut the bar safely, but it shouldn't be too hard. Just use a butter knife and cut it into 6 pieces.

, Put the pieces of soap onto a microwave-safe plate or a piece of wax paper.

, Microwave the plate of soap for about 1 1/2 minutes.

, Watch the soap as it goes through the microwave and you will see it grow to enormous size!

, Get a large bottle (2 liter, preferably) of Diet Coke or Diet A&W root beer.


The aspartame in the ""diet"" variety is needed to make the reaction work, so don't try it with regular sodas.Use a soda that is fresh and has not been opened before. A flat soda will make a smaller explosion.

, Usually mint, Original Mentos are used for this experiment, but you can also use rock salt.


Try experimenting with lots of different highly porous materials, as the porous surface is what makes the reaction occur. Can you make a bigger explosion?

, Open the soda bottle and drop in the Mentos or rock salt.

Place the solar cell in the sun.,
Hook the alligator clips to a multimeter.,
Set your meter to read microamps.",How to Make a Solar Panel (Copper Sheet Method)," You can use sheet metal sheers to do this easily. Make the sheets the same size. You want one sheet to fit on your burner or hotplate, and both to fit in the two liter bottle. Making them both six inch squares should work well., Use a degreaser to remove any oils or grease from your copper sheet. You do not want them to react with the copper or to prevent oxidation from happening. You should also wear gloves to avoid getting oil from your skin on the copper. Also be sure to scrub the copper with steel wool or sandpaper to remove any corrosion., Once you have placed a sheet on the hot plate, turn the hotplate on. This will heat the copper and provide the energy needed for the copper to react quickly with the oxygen in the air. This speeds up the natural oxidation process considerably., As the copper heats up you will see varying shades of red, pink, purple, and possibly other colors. This is a sign that oxidation is taking place. Finally, you will notice that these colors are all being replaced by a black covering. This covering is cupric oxide. Once the whole sheet is covered in cupric oxide, allow it to cook at least thirty more minutes.Cooking the extra thirty minutes makes the cupric oxide layer thick and brittle. This allows it to break away from the copper. A thin layer of cupric oxide would remain on the copper, covering up the cuprous oxide layer that needs to be exposed., When you are finished cooking the copper, turn the burner off. Leave the copper on the burner to cool. This allows the copper to cool very slowly. During the cooling process the copper and the cupric oxide layer shrink at different rates. As long as your cupric oxide layer is thick enough, this will result in the black cupric oxide flaking off and exposing the red cuprous oxide layer.Cuprous oxide is a semi-conductor and must be exposed in order to make the solar cell function.

, You will need to bend both pieces to match the curvature of the plastic bottle. Both pieces need to be able to fit in the bottle without touching each other. Be sure not to damage the red cuprous oxide layer when bending the cooked sheet., Use the alligator clips to attach both pieces to opposite sides of the plastic bottle. The copper sheet with red cuprous oxide should be connected to the clip that will lead to a negative terminal, and the clean copper sheet could be joined to a clip leading to a positive terminal., Dissolving salt into the water will provide electrolytes that carry the current from the cuprous oxide layer to the clean copper sheet. An effective solution will be comprised of roughly one part salt (table salt is fine) to three parts water. Stir well to make sure that the salt is all dissolved. Heat if needed.


For example, dissolve ¼ cup of salt into ¾ cup of water.
Using distilled or deionized water will reduce the risk of contaminants.

, This will allow current to travel from the negative terminal to the positive terminal. Be careful to keep the clips at the top of the two sheets dry. Otherwise, the water on the clips might interfere with your readings., When the sun hits the cuprous oxide layer, it causes electrons to be released. The cuprous oxide is not conductive, but the electrons are able to move through the salt water to the conductive copper plate. This plate transfers the electrons to the wires., Plug the other end of your alligator clips into a multimeter or ammeter. Be sure that your meter can function in the microamp (0.000001 amps) range. Plug the positive alligator clip into the positive terminal of your meter and the negative alligator clip into the negative terminal of your meter., A very small amount of current will be flowing. This current should fall somewhere between 0 and 50 microamps. Turning the cell so that the cuprous oxide layer is facing the most direct sunlight will give you the most current."

Working close to the flame, transfer 5 milliliters (0.17  fl oz) of liquid Yeast Extract-Peptone-Adenine-Dextrosemedia to a culture tube with a serological pipet.
Scrape a small amount of cells off of the plate with a pipet tip, being careful not to puncture the solid media.
Carefully lower the tip into the tube, being careful not to touch the cells to the inner wall of the tube.
Pipet the liquid up and down until you can see the clump of cells on the tip dissolve.
Cover the tubes loosely to ensure oxygen flow to the cells.
Incubate the tubes in a 30⁰C shaker overnight.
Remove the cultures from the 30⁰C shaker from the night before and close the caps tightly.
Remove the plasmid DNA and single stranded DNA from the freezer (they are normally stored at -20⁰C). Leave the plasmid DNA to thaw at room temperature. Heat the single stranded DNA in the 95⁰C hot plate. The solution should become very hot (almost boiling) by the time single stranded DNA is used in the procedure.

,,,,, Tubes are normally labeled with the content (transformed plasmid), date, and scientist’s initials.,, Make sure to balance the centrifuge evenly.,,,,, PEG is a very viscous substance, so be careful when pipetting.

Determine the probability of different eye colors.",How to Predict Your Baby's Eye Color," Babies inherit genes from both the mother’s side and the father’s side to determine eye color. This means that the mother’s eye color will have a direct influence on the baby’s eye color, though they may not be the same. The first step to a good prediction is to note the eye color of the mother as one of the following:Brown
Blue
Green
Hazel;
, Since only 50% of the genes determining eye color come from the mother, the father’s eye color should also be noted. Again, the baby’s eye color could be different from either or both parents, but knowing the parents’ eye colors gives you a starting point. Label the dad’s eye color as brown, blue, green or hazel., This is most helpful when the two grandparents from either side have different colored eyes. By comparing their eye colors, you can learn more about the genes that their children (including one of the baby’s parents) carry., Parents’ siblings can also shed light on the variety of genes in the family. When siblings have different eye colors, it can indicate that the parents carry two different genes for eye color (heterozygous) instead of two copies of the same gene (homozygous). This information can help determine whether the baby’s parents are heterozygous or homozygous, and increase the accuracy of your prediction., If a parent is homozygous for the genes determining eye color, that means that they have two copies of the same allele. If a parent is heterozygous for eye color, then they have two different alleles for that gene. The most dominant allele is the one that will be expressed (the eye color you will see)., The goal of analyzing additional family members is to attempt to discern whether parents are homozygous or heterozygous. If a parent is homozygous, there is a 100% chance that they will pass the gene for their eye color to the child. However, that drops to 50% for a particular gene if the parent is heterozygous.For example, blue eyes indicate a homozygous parent because the gene that expresses blue eye color is a recessive gene.
Brown eyes can be homozygous or heterozygous because the gene that expresses brown eye color is a dominant gene.

, Polygenic traits are traits that rely on more than one gene for expression. This means that several genes influence eye color, making predictions based on the parents’ eye color even less certain. With that in mind, it is still a good starting point for an educated prediction.For example, if both parents have blue eyes, they will both pass a gene for blue eyes to the child. This means that in the vast majority of cases, that child will have blue eyes. However, in rare cases, other genes change the color of the eye from blue to brown, hazel, or green.

, Once you have analyzed all of the family members that you plan to include, make a list of their eye colors. This list will need to be analyzed either by hand or using computer software to determine possible eye colors for the baby. If you have no experience with inherited genes, you should use a computer program or consult someone that has knowledge of how genes are passed down. For example:Father : blue eyes
Mother : brown eyes
Paternal Grandmother: brown eyes
Paternal Grandfather : blue eyes
Maternal Grandmother : brown eyes
Maternal Grandfather: blue eyes

, Online calculators do most of the biology and math for you. Enter the eye color of each relative (e.g. parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles) in the indicated fields. When you are finished, the program will analyze the data and tell you the likelihood of each eye color., A Punnett square can be made for eye color by drawing a chart with three columns and three rows. In the first (left) column, list the father’s alleles (genes) for eye color. In the first (top) row, list the mother’s alleles for eye color.If you can determine the two genes that each parent has (this is easiest if both parents are homozygous), you can make a Punnett square. This square will tell you the possible gene combinations for your baby, which will indicate the possible eye colors. The Punnett square will also show the probability of each color.

, There should be four blank spaces to the right of the father’s alleles and under the mother’s alleles. In each space, write the father’s allele from the left of it and the mother’s allele from above it. These four gene combinations are the possible combinations of your baby., The four boxes represent possible combinations of alleles. Each box represents a 25% chance that your baby will have that combination of alleles, and thus the eye color that it represents. If a certain combination does not appear in any box, there is no chance of having that combination. If a combination appears more than once, the chance of the baby carrying those alleles is greater.


In the example above, it is clear that the father is homozygous (because blue eyes are recessive) and that the mother is heterozygous (because her father had blue eyes and could only have passed that gene). This allows you to make a Punnett square with four boxes. The likelihood of the baby having brown eyes will be 50% and the likelihood that it has blue eyes will be 50%.

Sterilize the vials.,
Rehydrate drosophila media in vial.,
Culture the flies at room temperature.,
Plug the vial when not in use.,
Place a funnel in the freshly prepared new vial.,
Gently tap the flies down.,
Remove the plug and invert the vial into the funnel.,
Store at room temperature out of direct sunlight.",How to Perform Vial Transfers With Fruit Flies," Use plastic or glass vials that can be sterilized in an autoclave. An autoclave is a process that uses super-heated steam to sterilize laboratory equipment.Wash the vials with a gentle cleanser and water, then sterilize in the autoclave for 20 minutes at 121°C.If you don’t have access to an autoclave, you can wash the vials in a 10% bleach solution. Rinse well after washing.
This step is important to remove any sort of contaminant that could affect your colony of flies.;
, Fill the tube about 1/5 of the way with the dehydrated media. Add enough water so that the food is completely moist. Let it sit for a few minutes, adding more water as necessary to ensure the food is fully rehydrated.The surface of the food should look wet and have a shiny appearance.
Add a few grains of yeast to the top of the media before adding the flies to the vial.

, Flies enjoy an ideal environment of 25°C and 60% humidity, however, leaving them at room temperature and out of direct sunlight will suffice. You want to make sure the media stays moist so the flies do not get dehydrated.If the media dries out, you need to change it by transferring the flies to a new vial with fresh food.

, To maintain the sterility of the vial before fly transfer, keep the vial closed by sealing it with the plug. Use a cotton or foam plug to stop the vial. Do not use a rubber stopper as this will suffocate the flies.


Stretched cotton balls can be used if you don’t have a foam plug handy.

, Make sure the vial can stand up on its own or place it in a rack to hold it upright. Remove the plug and place a small funnel in the mouth of the vial. You will use this funnel to transfer the flies from the old tube to the new.


The new tube must have the prepared media in it before transferring the flies.

, Place the vial of flies on top of a soft surface such as a rubber mouse pad. Gently tap the vial down on the surface so that the flies fall to the bottom of the vial. Continue to tap the vial until all of the flies fall to the bottom.


The flies will only be stunned for a moment, so the next few steps need to be performed quickly.
Alternatively, you can place the vial in the freezer for 8-10 minutes and anesthetize the flies. The cold will put the flies to sleep and they will fall to the bottom of the vial. They will remain in this stupor for a few minutes, making for easy transfer., With the flies at the bottom of your working vial, quickly remove the plug and invert the vial into the funnel of the new vial. Gently, tap the vials together to get the flies from one vial to the next. Continue to tap the new vial until the flies are all at the bottom. Plug the new vial to contain the flies.Make sure all of the flies have been transferred before plugging the new vial.
The first few times you make this transfer, it is helpful to have a second person around to help you with the process.

, Fruit flies thrive in an environment of 25°C with about 60% humidity. If you are unable to replicate these conditions, simply leave them at room temperature, but avoid a dry environment. Lack of humidity will dry out the food and lead to more frequent vial transfers.


Flies should be transferred about every 10-14 days as long as the food stays moist."

Hold the loop at the end and place the loop part into the fire. You want the loop to red hot which will let the loop become sterile.

,


Hold the loop for a few seconds to cool, if the loop is too hot you will burn your bacteria.
Do not swing the loop around to cool it or you will burn someone around you

, Placing the loop on the organisms you want and GENTLY rub the organism around on the surface to get it on the loop. Do not get too much or it will be too thick to see under the microscope

,, Flaming the loop again is help keep it sterile, let is cool again and set to the side

,


Using your slide holder, grab the slide and pass it through the flame several times allowing the heat-fix process to occur. The Heat fixing process kills any bacteria that may be present and causes the cell stick to the slide.
Do not over-heat the slide or the cell can become distorted or unclear under the microscope

, Still holding the slide, let it cool for about a 30 seconds to a minute

, The gloves will protect you from the dye that will be used to stain the slide

, This will allows the excess stain you put on the run off into the sink. It will make a big mess in the sink

, Try to cover the whole target circle with the stain, but don’t have too much of the stain or it will be too hard to observe under the microscope.

Having your instruments and containers ahead of time will allow you to complete the experiment without having to run back and forth to the cabinet. It is important to know what each piece will be used for up front. You should know some basic terms as well.


Get a counting chamber. These tools have a chamber, slide, and microscope built in, so they are easy to set up and use. You can buy them from lab and classroom supply companies. They come with instructions that guide you through the whole process. Get a pour plate or a spread plate. These are the containers you will observe the bacteria in.
Culture is the term used to describe an organism grown artificially for an experiment.
Broth is a liquid medium that the culture grows in.;
, You can also place the bacteria directly onto a plate for viewing under a microscope. Apply the culture to the plate and place under a microscope. Observe how many bacteria cells there are., If there are too many bacteria, they will overlap and you won’t get an accurate count. Dilute the culture by mixing it with more broth. If there are too few, you won’t have enough for an accurate number. Filter out the broth using a filtration system.

, The last step is physically counting them. Look through the magnifier on the counting chamber and write down how many you see. Compare this with other tests.

Unless your lab is stocked with the right equipment, consider trying a different method. However, if you can, measuring wet and dry mass gives you more consistent readings. You will need:Hydraulic gravity convection oven
Aluminum weighing pan
Set of flasks
Centrifuge or laboratory filtration system

, If not, pour it into one. It should be in broth at this stage, though it will be separated out again later.

, An alternative is a cellulose acetate filter membrane, 47mm in diameter, 0.45µm in pore size.Whichever you use, weigh it now so you know how much to subtract from your measurement later when you have the bacteria cells on it.

, The cells will naturally sink due to gravity. Give them a stir to make sure they are evenly spread out in the flask. This way you will get a more representative sample.

, This tool spins the flask and a counterweight rapidly, draining the broth and leaving the culture. See this guide for a more detailed description of the process.

, Discard the broth. You won't need it any more, but you will need the flask, so hold onto it.

, Add the flask of rinse water to the bacteria cells. This gives you wet weight.

, To measure dry weight, place the pan in the oven and dry at 100ºC for 6 to 24 hours, following the instructions of your specific oven and/or weighing pan. Make sure you are not over this temperature so the bacteria don't burn. Weigh the bacteria after this time, and remember to subtract the weight of the weighing pan."

Get the necessary equipment.,
Shine the light through the sample.,
Make some notes.",How to Measure Bacterial Growth3," You will need a light source and a spectrophotometer. These are available in science lab supply stores. The spectrophotometer will have instructions for the proper usage of the model you bought. This equipment is inexpensive and easy to use, so this is one of the more common methods for measuring bacterial growth., In layman’s terms, turbidity is how cloudy your sample is. You should get a turbidity reading, which is measured in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). The equipment may take some calibration before you can accurately measure the turbidity of your sample.

, Turbidity corresponds to the amount of bacteria in the sample. The spectrophotometer will also tell you the percent transmission (%T). This number will be higher if the turbidity is lower. Compare your numbers from different tests to measure bacterial growth."

If you are looking to catch a single kind of insect, you can read about its habitats and preferences online. It's important to know what kind of insects you are trying to catch, as your kit will be comprised of traps and bait that work for just such an insect.;
, To create a helpful tool with many uses, find a glass jar, clear Tupperware, or a lidded cup. These will allow you to store insects you have caught, as well as build ""pooters"" and subterranean traps. Find jars that are small, but not so small that your chosen insect will not fit.

, You will need fine wire mesh, netting, or muslin to build insect traps. Buy at craft or fabric stores. Any material that you can easily breathe through, but that an insect couldn't fly through, will serve.


To make your own net, sew netting in a cone shape to a wire hoop, and use wire to attach the hoop to a stick., You can buy ordinary drinking straws to catch small insects. You can also buy flexible rubber tubes in craft stores, hardware stores, or online. Buy tubes or straws large enough to fit the insect you are trying to capture, but small enough to fit in your mouth.

, Ruined bedsheets can be recycled as insect catching sheets. Make sure your sheet is bright and mostly stainless, so that you can see the insects when they land on it.

, Get battery-operated source of light for nighttime insect hunting. A plastic ""votive"" candle, could work, or a flashlight.

, Bags will help you in a pinch. You can make a fast container for an extra bug by bagging it and poking some airholes. Be careful not to squish a bug you catch this way: release it into the wild or into a jar as soon as possible. You can also wear a bag over your hand to grab a specimen., Learn what kind of foods, colors, and odors your insects are attracted to. Does your insect like honey? Sugar? Raw meat? Keep sticky or smelly in sealable plastic bags.

, If you are catching bugs that bite or sting, you may want to wear gloves. You can buy plastic disposable gloves, dishwashing gloves, or ordinary gloves that will allow you to handle insects without getting hurt.

, This could be a designated insect-kit backpack, a large lunchbox, a fishing tackle box, a valise, or any other kind of container you can find that will keep your tools safe.

, A ""pooter"" is a trap that uses a tube to suck up insects. Sucking allows the entomologist to quickly collect specimens without touching them. Take a jar and two straws. Use a nail or drill to poke two holes in the jar's lid. The holes should be large enough for the straws to fit snugly. Trim one straw a few centimeters, and use glue or a rubber band to fit a piece of net, muslin, or mesh over one end.Insert both straws into the lid, and screw the lid on the jar.
To use, point the long straw at an insect you would like to collect.
Suck on the short straw to vacuum the insect into your pooter.

, Similar to the pooter, this tube will allow you to suck up larger insects and deposit them in containers. Take your rubber tube, and sew or tape fine mesh, net, or muslin to one end. To use, point the vacant end at insects and suck. Pinch the vacant end of the tube to prevent insects from escaping. The mesh will prevent the insect from entering your mouth.To keep the insect, insert the vacant end of the tube into a container large enough to hold your insect, and wait for your insect to emerge. Shake or blow lightly if it needs encouragement.

, For bugs that scuttle on the ground, dig a small hole the size of your jar, cup, or other container. Stick your jar in the ground so that its edges are level with the earth.Watch your trap so that you can quickly cover it if an insect falls in.


If you are collecting specimens for preservation, you can fill the cup with preserving liquid. That way, if an insect falls in, it can't crawl out., Hang a white sheet near a light source at night. When insects land on the sheet, catch them with your pooter, net, or gloved hands.

Gather your materials and ingredients.,
Place the stir bar in the beaker and place it on top of stir plate.,
Measure out 800 mL of distilled water into the 2 L beaker.,
Weigh out the proper amounts of each chemical.,
Add all of the chemicals to the solution and dissolve.,
Adjust the pH of the solution to 7.4.,
Top off the water until the solution is 1 liter.,
Sterilize in an autoclave.,
Store PBS at room temperature.",How to Make Phosphate Buffered Saline1," To make a 1X (the normal concentration used for experiments) solution of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), you will need a 1 L graduated cylinder, a balance, a 2 L beaker, stir bar, stir plate, pH meter, autoclave, and a glass bottle for storage. To make 1 L, you will need the following amounts of each ingredient:You will need small amounts of dilute HCl and/or NaOH to pH the final solution.
start with 800 mL of distilled water
8 g of NaCl (sodium chloride)
0.2 g of KCl (potassium chloride)
1.44 g of Na2HPO4 (disodium phosphate)
0.24 g of KH2PO4 (monopotassium phosphate)
The final concentrations of each compound should be 137 mm NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl, and a pH 7.4.;
, When making any solution, you want to keep the solution constantly moving. This will help everything dissolve faster. To avoid anything splashing, place the stir bar into the empty beaker and then put it on top of the stir plate.Wait until there is solution in the beaker before turning it on.

, When preparing a solution, start with less than the final volume of water. At the end, you will add the rest of the water to bring the total volume up to 1 L. Using the graduated cylinder, measure 800 mL of water and pour this directly into a clean beaker.With the water in the beaker, turn on the stir plate to a medium speed. You should see a small whirlpool form in the water as the stir bar begins to spin.

, Weigh out 8 g of NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.44 g of Na2HPO4 and 0.24 g of KH2PO4. Use the balance to weigh out each chemical one at a time in their own weigh boats.If you add too much chemical, simply remove the excess until you have the right amount.

, Pour each chemical into the water while it is stirring. There is no special order to add each one, so you can add everything all at once. Let everything continue to stir until it is fully dissolved.You can let this sit while you do something else and check on it later. It will take at least 5-10 minutes to dissolve.

, Once everything has fully dissolved, you need to adjust the pH of the buffer until it is 7.4.Keep the stir bar on and place the pH meter into the top of the solution. Let the numbers on the pH meter stop moving. The solution will likely be too acidic so you’ll need to add dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to adjust.


Use a small pipette to add NaOH a few drops at a time. After each addition, let the solution stir for a moment and check the new reading on the pH meter.
To pH a solution is a process that requires patience. If you accidentally go higher than 7.4, you can add a few drops of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to bring it back down.

, After the pH has been properly adjusted, you can bring your solution up to the final volume of 1 liter. Carefully pour the entire solution from the beaker into the 1 L graduated cylinder. Add enough distilled water to make it 1 L.Pour the final solution into a 1 L glass bottle safe for autoclaving.

, Place the lid on the bottle, but do not screw it down. During autoclaving, the pressure in the bottle can build up and explode if you tighten the lid. Put a strip of autoclave tape across the lid to hold it in place while autoclaving.Set the autoclave to sterilize for 20 minutes at 15 psi on the liquid cycle.Autoclave tape has a temperature indicator in it. If the autoclave tape doesn’t turn black when the process is done, the autoclave did not get hot enough and you will need to re-sterilize.

, After autoclaving, let the PBS cool to room temperature and then tighten the lid to keep the contaminants out. Tightening the lid before the bottle cools can create a vacuum and make it very difficult to remove the lid later. PBS is stable at room temperature.You can also aliquot the PBS into smaller containers to use one at a time.

14.4 g of Na2HPO4 (disodium phosphate)
2.4 g of KH2PO4 (monopotassium phosphate)
You will also need small amounts of dilute HCl and/or NaOH to pH the final solution.
The final concentrations of each compound in the 10X solution are 1.37 M NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 100 mM Na2HPO4, and 18 mM KH2PO4.

, To help dissolve everything quickly, use a stir bar and stir plate to keep the solution constantly moving. Place the stir bar into the empty beaker before beginning to avoid splashes.Wait until there is solution in the beaker before turning it on.

, You want to start with less than the final volume because the volume will change as you add the compounds to it. After everything has been added and dissolved, you will add the rest of the water to bring the total volume up to 1 L. Measure 700 mL of water with the graduated cylinder and pour this directly into a clean beaker.Once water is added, turn on the stir plate to a medium speed.

, Add each chemical to the water while it stirs. There is no special order to add each one, so you can add everything all at once. Continue to stir until all the powder is fully dissolved.It will take at least 5-10 minutes to dissolve, so let it stir and check on it later.

, With everything fully dissolved, you need to check the pH of the buffer and adjust it to 7.4.Keep the stir bar on and submerge the tip of the pH meter in the top of the solution. Let the numbers on the pH meter stop moving to measure the current pH. The solution will likely be too acidic so you’ll need to add dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to make it more basic.


Use a small pipette to add NaOH a few drops at a time. After each addition, let the solution stir for a moment and wait until the numbers stop moving. Keep adding NaOH until you reach 7.4.

Determine the amount of 1X solution you will need.,
Calculate the amount of 10X stock needed.,
Subtract the 10X volume from the total volume.,
Dilute the 10X stock with distilled water.,
Check the pH of the 1X stock.",How to Make Phosphate Buffered Saline3," First, you must know how much 1X stock you want before you can calculate how much 10X stock you will need. The amount to make will be dependent on the type of experiment you are doing.


If you just need an aliquot of 1X stock to have around, make around 500 mL. You can use this 1X stock for a while and won’t have to make it as often.

, To calculate the amount of 10X stock needed, you simply divide your total volume by 10.Remember, to get the correct volume, your units must match: if the volume you are making is in milliliters, the volume you add will be in milliliters.


For example: If you want 500 mL of solution, divide 500 by 10 and you get 50 mL. You need 50 mL of 10X stock to make 500 mL of 1X.
For example: If you want 2 L of solution, divide 2/10 and you get 0.2 L. You can convert this to mL by multiplying by 1000. You need 200 mL of 10X stock to make 2 L of 1X.

, To determine the amount of water needed to dilute the 10X stock, you just need to subtract the calculated 10X volume from the total volume that you want.For example: To make 500 mLs, you need 50 mLs of 10X stock. 500 – 50 = 450, so you need 450 mL of distilled water to dilute.

, Using the volumes that you have calculated, add distilled water to the 10X stock. You have now made a 1X stock of PBS.For example: Add 50 mL of 10X stock to 450 mL of distilled water to make a 1X PBS stock. Swirl the container to mix.

, Sometimes the dilution process affects the pH of the buffer. It is prudent to check the pH of the 1X stock and make sure it is at 7.4 following dilution.Use the pH meter to measure the pH and use HCl or NaOH to correct the buffer to a pH of 7.4.

Hold a classroom ceremony.",How to Mummify a Chicken," Depending on how your class is structured, you'll probably need to set aside enough time on either side of a particular unit to complete the job. The total mummification of a chicken should take between 40 and 50 days, when done properly. Since it's unlikely that you'll want to spend that much of class time consistently teaching about ancient Egypt, it would probably make sense in your lesson planning to spread out lessons about it throughout the unit, during history time, however you choose.


Alternatively, you could do a little infomercial magic and start a chicken ahead of time, leading up to your project, so it'll be ready for the students to finish themselves. You can still start one and let it slowly preserve over time, then check out later after the unit is over. Make the project fit your time constraints.;
, The supplies necessary for classroom mummification are all available at most grocery stores, for relatively cheap. The most expensive ingredient will be the chicken itself.1 raw chicken. Preferably, store-bought chickens should be smaller than three pounds to dry out more thoroughly and more quickly. Any larger will require larger and more materials, and will produce more of a smell upon mummifying the chicken.






Isopropyl alcohol. You'll only need a small amount, used to blot the inside and outside of the chicken.






Rubber gloves for the students. If you're going to have the students ever handle the chicken itself, it's necessary for them to wear rubber gloves and wash hands before and after.






Raw herbs, like sage, rosemary, and thyme can be useful for performing a ""ceremony"" after the chicken has been preserved.






A roll of gauze can be used to wrap the mummy at the end of the project.






A plastic tub. It's important to have a Rubbermaid or other brand locking plastic tub to mummify the chicken in. This will produce an unpleasant odor, so keeping it in a relatively tight seal will help to keep it from stinking up the classroom.






50/50 mixture of salt and baking soda. You'll end up needing about 4 pounds total of this mix over the course of the project, depending on how big your chicken is.







, When you're ready to start the project, it's important to rinse the chicken thoroughly and dry it out to eliminate bacteria and other particles on the outside of the chicken that may promote spoilage. If you have a sink in your classroom, do it in the sink and make sure you clean it thoroughly afterward.


Rub down thoroughly with paper towel to eliminate any moisture, then blot the inside and outside of the chicken with a small amount of rubbing alcohol.

, You'll need a steady supply of baking soda and salt over the course of the project, so you should probably buy a couple of one-pound bags of each to get started. You can mix them in a ziplock bag to keep the mixture fresh and easily accessible in the classroom, or make the mixing-together process part of the project that your students complete themselves.


You'll be changing out the salt and baking soda every ten days throughout the project, so you could also have students bring in small amounts from home to make sure that you have enough to last throughout the project.

, Pour a small pile of the preserving mix in the bottom of the plastic tub, then lay the chicken on top of it. Cover the chicken completely with the mixture, both inside and outside, rubbing it thoroughly on all exposed sides of the chicken. Pour a little more on top to make sure it's thoroughly covered.


If you have students helping you, make sure everyone wears rubber gloves and washes up thoroughly afterward.

, After covering the chicken with the mixture, snap your lid onto the plastic tub and keep the chicken in a cool, dark place. If your classroom has some cabinets tucked away, that'd be the perfect location for the make-shift preserving chamber. If you get a clear plastic tub, it can be nice to allow the students to see in and check out what's happening without having to open the tub.

, Gradually, the salt and the baking soda will absorb the moisture from the chicken, leaving it dry and desiccated. When you start to see the salty crust looking hard and brown, it's time to change it. Remove the chicken from the tub and shake as much of the mixture off as possible, wiping it off from the inside, as well. Get as much of the old mixture out and off as possible, and discard it.


Replace with fresh salt and baking soda, as before. You may elect to make this process part of the classroom activities, or just start doing it yourself to keep class time moving along. Alternatively, it might be nice to let small groups of students help in the changing out process, to give some hands-on time while other students stay busy doing other things.

, Every time you take the chicken out and change the mixture, it's a good idea to let them observe it. How has the texture of the skin changed? How has the color changed? Let them feel the skin of the chicken and describe the way it has changed.Have each of the students keep the ""Mummy journal"" or some other kind of record keeping lab report documents to note their observations. This can be both fun and informative for students, giving them something active to do.

, Even if you've got a relatively-tight seal on your plastic tub, you might start to notice a kind of nasty odor in the area. It's a good idea to stay active about deodorizing to avoid stinking up your whole classroom. You could use car air fresheners, aerosol disinfectant spray, or other types of cleaners in the area, if you wish.


Talk to the custodians and your supervisors at the school if you're going to be doing this project, to make sure nobody gets a disgusting surprise if they try to investigate the cabinets in your classroom.

, After changing out the salt mixture four times, or so, the chicken should be well preserved, and you should be able to remove it from the mixture and wrap it up with the students to complete the project. Rub all the salt mixture from the body of the chicken thoroughly and have your students observe the finished product one more time.


Depending on the moisture levels in your area, it may take more or less time to complete the job. Keep a close eye on the chicken to make sure it's not molding or otherwise spoiling, and it should be done after a little more than a month.

, To wrap the mummy, you'll wrap it in gauze strips, but those strips need to be soaked in hardening solution to make them stick and to form a hard, mummy-like carapace for the chicken. To create this mixture, thin some regular classroom glue with warm water, until it drips evenly from a spoon.

, Tear off enough gauze strips that are long enough to wrap all the way around the bulk of the chicken, and start soaking them in the glue mixture. You can also have students do this in small groups, if you like. You shouldn't have to soak them for long, just a few seconds, to get them coated evenly with the glue mixture.

, Use gauze to wrap the chicken, starting by wrapping around the fattest part of the chicken, and letting students wrap around the individual legs and the other parts of the chicken. It looks better the more gauze you use, in general, and the students usually have a good time completing this stage in the process.


Allow the carapace to dry thoroughly before moving on. The outer layer should be dry in 24 hours or so, during which you might put the chicken back into the plastic tub after cleaning it out.
The chicken should be fine to sit out without worrying about spoiling, but just to be on the safe side, it might be a good idea to keep it in the tub, so you're not welcomed back to the classroom with an accidental horrible odor. It was common to use fresh herbs in the cavity of real mummies, helping to control odor and purify, which might be a nice step to add to the project for your students, as well.

, Let the students decorate the outside of the mummy with symbols, designs, and drawings, using paints. If you've been studying Egyptian symbols and mummification, you might have them use symbols they find, or make their own to represent the chicken and the chicken's life. Have fun with it, and let them design the project how they'd like.


It can also be fun to make a shoebox sarcophagus, instead of the chicken itself. Have students each design their own, or design one as a class, and then lay your chicken to rest for good in the shoebox.

, When all is said and done, this can be a good ending day for your Egyptian unit, if you like. Have a class party, or hold some kind of ceremony outside to say goodbye to the chicken. Light incense, say your peace, and do other Egyptian-type activities to end the unit.

Follow the instructions on the package to bake the cake. You can also set aside a little of the batter to make one cupcake to represent the nucleus.
Let the cake cool completely and then remove it from the pan. Place it on the cake board.
You can also make two 9 inch cakes to layer on top of each other, if you’d prefer a taller cell model.

, Dye the vanilla icing with the food dye, based on the color(s) you’d like to use to represent the cell components.


One option is to make separate colored icings to represent the different layers of the cell. For example, to make an animal cell, you could use yellow icing to represent the cytoplasm, and red icing on the cupcake representing the nucleus.If you are making a plant cell, you can make colored icing to distinguish the cell wall and spread it on the sides of the cake.

, It may be helpful to have a print out or image of the cell to identify the cell components as you place them on the cake. An example of good candies to use as components for an animal cell include:Pink Mike and Ikes for the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

Collect the necessary supplies including tooth picks, a bag of candies with four different colors, and, if possible, licorice sticks.


There are limitless number of food items that can be used to represent the DNA, it just need to be color coded and soft enough to put a tooth pick through. Colored marshmallows are a popular option, as are gummies.For a healthier option chop up four types of fruit, like strawberries, bananas, grapes, and pineapples.;
, Each of the color-coded items represents one of the four chemicals that make up the DNA code: Guanine, Adenine, Cytosine, and Thymine. It is important to decide in advance which marshmallows represent which chemicals, because the chemicals based bond in specific ways.

, Use the toothpicks to connect the marshmallows into pairs. Poke the toothpick through two marshmallows so that they are firmly stuck together. Remember, that in nature only two types of bonds are possible. Guanine must bond with Cytosine and Adenine must bond with Thymine. Consult your color key to verify that you aren’t breaking this pattern.Push the marshmallows close to one another on the toothpick so that there is plenty of space on the ends of the toothpick left to attach licorice.
You should repeat this process to create approximately six base pairs.
Base pairs can be arranged in any order. However, you should have at least one of each type of base pair for the sake of the project., The backbone is what holds the bases together into a single strand of DNA. Take the toothpicks with the marshmallows bases poke the end of the toothpicks through a stick of licorice on each end of the base.


If you don’t want to use licorice, you can also connect the bases to one another with toothpicks. You should also aim to make a ladder shape, taking several base pairs and lying them next to one another to form a line of parallel bases. Insert toothpicks into the top of the marshmallow on each side of the base, connecting it to the bottom of the marshmallow on the next base. Repeat until all of the bases are connected., Once you have connected enough bases that it resembles a ladder, twist the licorice so that it looks like a “double helix” or a spiral staircase. This is the shape that DNA takes in the real world., Review the color key to see if the bases are properly bonded. Remember, Adenine should pair with Cytosine and Thymine with Guanine.If Thymine is bonded with Thymine or Adenine with Guanine, the model is wrong, because these nucleotides cannot form a hydrogen bond with one each other.Remember, that the order of base pairs forms a code that tells your body how to work. Think of these two bonds as somewhat like binary code--the system of ""0""s and ""1""s that tells your computer what to do.

, If several students have made DNA together, have them compare what they made. See how they differ. Remind your students that an actual human gene can have as many as two million base pairs.Explain that the differences they see in their model DNA grow as a strand reaches two million base pairs, so that these strands can store an incredible amount of information, enough to make each person in the classroom unique and different from their peers.


If you have done the project alone, you can also make multiple strands and compare them to each other. Consider how many different arrangements were possible,

, The backbone of the DNA, in this case represented by the licorice, is ease to forget about because it doesn't store any information. However, as the name suggests, it holds the whole thing together.The backbone is composed of a sugar, deoxyribose, bonded with a phosphate group.These give structure to the DNA

, Build a checklist of genetic traits and have students compare their DNA to another student in the classroom or to their parents. Some genetic traits that you can compare include: eye color, hair color, dimples, dominant hands, freckles, curliness of hair, and color blindness., Remember, science isn’t just about abstract ideas; it’s about making our lives better. Science puts food on our table every day. What better way to realize the practical benefits of science than to eat it in all of its glorious sweetness? Edible DNA was literally made to be eaten.

Take care of your body.",How to Study Effectively for Biology Finals," Most likely, you have multiple finals coming up and you want to make sure you have enough time to study effectively for all of them. Draw up your study plan and give yourself plenty of time to study for biology.


If you’re already a little bit behind and only have a few days to study, you can condense the study plan into a few days or even hours.
Study the major topics you know will be on the test first. Also, study the concepts you have had trouble with and briefly review the concepts you know pretty well right before the final.;
, To start your study plan, you need to figure out when you have free time to actually study. Grab a calendar and fill in all of your activities for the two weeks before your finals. Studying is the most effective in 20-30 minute chunks of time, so schedule study sessions of this length.Color code the activities on your schedule. Have separate colors for classes, appointments, meetings, leisure time, and study time.
The best case scenario is to study a little bit each day, but if you don’t have that much time, you’ll have to study for larger amounts of time in fewer days.

, Biology can be difficult to study because there are so many definitions and topics covered. If your teacher gave you a review packet, use this as a guide on what to study. You can also start by listing the chapter titles that were covered. Some topics you are likely to see on your exam include:DNA and RNA replication
Protein synthesis
Punnett Squares and genetic inheritance patterns
Scientific theories of origin and evolution of species
Levels of organization for organisms
General structure, function, and biology of cells
Stages of the cell cycle

, Using the calendar that has blocked-out study time on it, assign topics to these chunks of time. Focus on the concepts you know will appear on the test and the ones that you had difficulty in. Leave the two days before the test for review.Don’t forget to schedule down time. Studying takes a lot of effort and energy. Breaks are essential so you don’t burn out. Schedule time for exercise and/or fun.
Try to schedule your study time for when you have the most energy. If you’re a morning person, get up earlier and study. If you’re not a morning person, don’t force yourself to get up earlier to study. Same goes for being a night owl.
Remember, if you only have a few days, you’ll have to cover more topics in a day and you might not have time to get to everything.

, Some topics may take you less time to study, while others will take you more. Make sure you set aside extra time for concepts that you know you have struggled with. Giving yourself more time will allow you to really conquer that topic.


If a topic ends up taking less time, move on to the next topic. Don’t stop studying early just because something didn’t take as long. You might end up needing that time later for a topic that you didn’t think would take as long to study as it did.

, It’s easy to skip a day and say you’ll catch up tomorrow. But when tomorrow comes, you’re not going to want to do the extra work. Your study schedule will only work if you stick to it. Try setting an alarm on your phone to remind you that it’s time to study.Plan to do something fun or give yourself a small reward when you’ve finished your study block for the day.

, You have been learning new words and definitions all year. These words are going to show up on your final. To make sure you understand what every question is asking, you need to know what every word means. While studying, make flashcards for all of the words that you are unsure of and then use them!Hand-writing the flashcards is better for learning, but if you are short on time, there are websites where you can make digital flashcards.Carry flashcards with you everywhere you go and study them if you have downtime.

, It is difficult to understand the details of biology if you don’t have a broad understanding of the topic. Studying protein synthesis is a lot easier if you have a broad understanding of DNA as the genetic code that provides the blueprints for the proteins.Gain a strong foundation in the broad topics before trying to learn the nitty gritty details.

, Many concepts in biology are easier to understand and remember if you draw a picture. Review the diagrams present in your textbook and use them as a guide to draw your own. Read the captions of the diagrams to get a clear idea of what the image is representing.The process of transcription and translation is complicated, but it is easier to understand if you sketch the whole process. Draw as much as you can from memory and then check your sketch against the diagrams in the text. Clearly label everything on your drawings.
Draw the DNA and all of the proteins involved in the process. Sketch the different sites on the ribosome involved in growing the protein with the various amino acids.

, Most teachers will give you a review or study guide for the final exam and it will have all of the topics you need to know. Use this guide as a reference for your studying. If there are questions, answer them. If it’s just a list of topics, go through it and check off the ones you really know. Highlight the topics you know you need to study more.


Review guides can seem overwhelming at first because they are pretty long. Break it down into smaller pieces to make it more manageable.
Use the review guide to help you make your study schedule.

, If you have notes that you took during class, look them over. Reread the notes that you took multiple times. Take note of anything your teacher may have said would absolutely be on the test. Redraw any important diagrams until you’re confident you can draw them from memory.

, Ask your teacher if they have a copy of an old final that you can use to study from. You can even use your tests from earlier in the year to study from. Cover up the answers and take the exams again for practice.


It helps to know what types of questions you will have: multiple choice, short answer, essay, true/false? Ask your teacher about the format of the test as well.

, There are countless resources available to you online that you can take advantage of. Look up questions related to topics that you find particularly difficult. You can also look up study guides and other resources to help you study.

, Making a study schedule will give you a clear plan of how to manage your time. You don’t have to feel overwhelmed and rushed during finals week. Covering a little bit of material over a few days or weeks is a lot easier than cramming a lot of material into your brain in one night.Make your plan and stick with it to be successful.

, The internet can be a huge unnecessary distraction when you are trying to study. You might want to temporarily suspend your accounts for a designated amount of time. It will take away the temptation to check and end up wasting time that could be used for studying.Let your friends and family know you will be taking an internet break to study for finals. They will understand.

, Most research indicates that you need at least 5 hours of sleep to maintain the information that you have studied, so skipping sleep to study more isn’t likely to be helpful. Sleep actually helps you synthesize information and improves retention. Close the books and get a full night’s sleep. You’ll be more alert and better able to study and take your finals., Skipping meals and exercise to study will just make you grumpy. Add meals and exercise to your study schedule so you know you have time for them. Taking the time to prepare and eat a decent meal will give your brain the energy it needs to fuel your study sessions. Exercise can also help decrease your stress levels.Use meal and exercise time as a time to socialize as well. You don’t have to do away with social time altogether, just pair it with other activities until your finals are over.

",How to Make a Sterile Bacterial Smear,"


Leaving objects on the lab bench can get in the way or be a safety hazard. Paper left on the bench can catch fire if a Bunsen Burner is knocked over.;
,

Use a liquid disinfectant meant for hard surfaces, containing bleach or ethanol.

,,

This allows the disinfectant more time to kill microbes and prevents re-contamination from a towel or wash cloth.

,


Long hair can not only impede your work, but can also become dangerous around an open flame.

,


Do not wear safety glasses because they do not cover your eyes completely and keep you safe from splashing.

,


Use soap and wash halfway up your forearm. This reduces the chance of contaminating your culture with bacterium from your skin.

,


If you are allergic to latex, use vinyl or nitrile gloves to prevent a reaction.
Gloves that are too tight are at risk of tearing and exposing you to the microbe.
Wear the gloves pulled up over your sleeves to prevent them from dragging in cultures or slides.

,


Use powder cleaner (like Comet) and wash the slides in a sink with warm water to remove anything remaining from previous uses.

,,


This is Ethanol Sterilization.
Make sure to let the ethanol burn off completely before setting the slide down or returning the forceps to the ethanol, or risk setting a fire.

,


This is Aseptic Technique.
Hold the tip and stem of the inoculation loop in the flame of the Bunsen Burner for at least 10 seconds, allowing the metal to turn a bright orange.
Allow the loop to cool before using, or risk killing the bacteria in your culture, aerosolizing the bacteria, or burning hands/equipment.

,

This heats the air in and around the opening of the test tube, causing it and any bacteria in the air to rise and prevent contamination of the culture.

,


This kills any bacteria remaining on the inoculation loop and makes it sterile and ready for the next culture or storage.

,,


Rinse the slide into the sink and down the drain if using safe bacteria.
Clean with water and powder cleaner (like Comet).

,


Always carry all test tubes in a test tube rack to reduce the chance of dropping and breaking them, contaminating the lab.

,

Once again use liquid disinfectant and disposable sponges to clean the work space. Allow to air dry.

,

Remove your latex gloves properly. Avoid touching the outside of the glove with your bare hand.
Pull your right glove off by grabbing the outside of the glove near your wrist and pulling the glove inside out to your fingertips and off.






Hold your right glove in your gloved left hand and insert two fingers on your right hand into the inside of the left-hand glove near your wrist, avoiding touching the outside of the glove.











Pull the left glove inside out and off of your hand, leaving your right glove inside of it.






Throw both gloves away in the biohazard bin, being careful to only touch the inside of the gloves.

List the characteristics of your specimens.,
Look for principles of exclusion.,
Determine the most general characteristics.,
Formulate a series of differentiating steps.,
Divide your specimens into two groups.,
Subdivide each of the first two groups into two more groups.,
Continue subdividing your groups.,
Draw it out as a chart, if you want.,
Test out your dichotomous key.,
Troubleshoot, if necessary.",How to Make a Dichotomous Key," Start by considering the specimens you are trying to identify and make a dichotomous key for. Note characteristics that define the things you are looking at, and start listing them out.For instance, if you are trying to create a dichotomous key for a series of animals, you might see that some have feathers, some swim, some walk on legs, etc.
If you are trying to differentiate a set of big cats you are looking at in photos, you might note that some are brown, some are black, some have stripes, some have spots, some have long tails, some have short tails, and so on.;
, A dichotomous key works by the process of elimination, so you want to note characteristics that can be used to differentiate the things you are examining. For example, if some of the specimens you are looking at have feathers but others have fur, then “feathers” is a good distinguishing characteristics.However, if they are are all either animals or birds, then “warm-blooded” would not be a good distinguishing factor, since it would be common to all of them, and not allow you to break the specimens down into smaller groups.

, You want to create a dichotomous key based on increasingly specific differentiations, so you’ll have to order the characteristics of your specimens from general to specific. This will help divide your specimens ever-smaller groups. For instance:You may find that some of the cats you are analyzing have dark fur, and some have light fur. You may also see that all of them have short hair. Finally, you see that some of them have long tails, but some of them have no tails at all.
You would start your key with a question/statement about fur color. You wouldn’t need to ask a question about fur length, since all of the examples have short fur. You would follow up with a question about tail length, since tails are not common to all of the cats, and therefore are a less general characteristic.

, It’s up to you whether you want to use questions or statements, though you may find questions more intuitive. In either case, each question or statement should only break the specimens you are looking at into two groups.”The cat has solid-colored fur” or “The cat has patterned fur” are statements that can be used to break specimens down into two groups.
”Does the cat have solid-colored fur?” is a question that breaks the specimens down into the same two groups. If the answer is “Yes,” then the cat belongs in the solid-colored fur group. If the answer is “No,” then the cat belongs in the patterned-fur group.

, This will be the first differentiation. It should be based on the most general aspect of your specimens, so review the list of physical characteristics you developed. You can refer to the first two groups as A and B.For example, if you not that all of your specimens have either feathers or scales, then these could be your groups A and B. You can begin your key with the question “Does the animal have feathers?”

, Group A and group B will each be broken down into more specific groups (C and D), based on the next differentiating characteristic. For instance, you might notice that some of the animals in group A swim, and others don’t. This differentiation can form level C/D for group A.
Likewise, you might see that some of the animals in group B have legs, and others don’t. This differentiation can form level C/D for group B.

, Keep formulating more questions or statements of ever-increasing specificity based on the physical characteristics you identified. Come up with characteristics that can break your specimens down as needed into groups E/F, G/H, etc. Eventually, you will reach the point until you have questions that only ask you to differentiate two specimens, and your key will be complete.Some specimens will be differentiated before the end, as you work through your contrasting characteristics. For instance, you might find yourself looking at some birds, and some reptiles. You will break them down into these groups, then sub-divide the birds.
Two of the birds swim, but one of them does not. The single land bird will be identified as such, but you will have to further differentiate the swimming birds.
In this case, you notice that one of the swimming birds is ocean-going, and one is not. This characteristic can allow you to identify them more precisely (e.g., as a gull and a duck).

, A dichotomous key can be text-based, simply a series of questions. However, it can help to visualize the material in some way. For instance, you can create a “tree diagram” where each successive level of differentiation forms another branch of the tree.You could also try organizing your key in the style of a flow chart. For instance, have a box that asks a question like “Does the cat have dark fur?” Then, have a “Yes” arrow leading one way, and a “No” arrow leading another way. The ends of the arrows can lead to new boxes where you ask the next questions.

, Once you have all of your information down and organized in your key, run through the key with a specimen in mind to see if it works. For example, say you have a dichotomous key that helps identify various animals. Take a specimen and work through the key’s questions until it leads you to an identification through the process of elimination:


Q: ”Does the animal have feathers?” A: “No” (it has scales, so it is a reptile).
Q: “Does the reptile have legs?” A: “No” (it is a snake, either a cobra or a python, given your specimens).
Q: “Does the snake have a hood?” A: “No” (so it is not a cobra).
Your specimen is identified as a python.

, You might find that your key isn’t working correctly, and need to adjust it. For instance, you may not have ordered your questions in an increasingly more specific way, and might need to reorganize them. Likewise, your key might not break your specimens down in the most logical way, so try reframing your questions.


For instance, ""Does the cat have solid-colored fur or stripes?” is not a useful question for a dichotomous key. This question might differentiate solid-colored and striped cats from cats with spotted fur. However, since solid-colored and striped fur are themselves very different, this is not a useful category to work with.
Instead, you might first have a question that asks about solid-colored vs. patterned fur, then follow up with another level of questions like “Does the cat have black fur?” and “Does the cat have stripes?”

, Salt helps conduct electricity better through water. (However this may produce amounts of chlorine gas due to the chloride anomaly. This will not produce significant volumes of the gas unless massive current is applied.)








, Poke two thin electrical wires, approximately 1-2 feet/30-60cm long, through the cardboard about 2 inches/5cm apart so that one end of the wire is approximately 2-3 inches/5-7cm submerged in the water.








, Bubbles will soon begin to form on the submerged ends of the wires, hydrogen gas on negative wire and oxygen on the positive wire.








, You will require, in addition to the previously stated items, a smaller container (a syringe is best) and something with which to suspend the smaller container upside down (tape works adequately).








, without removing the glass from the water; or, bringing the opening above the water level of the big glass, flip the smaller glass so that the opening faces toward the bottom of the larger glass. (If using a syringe, simply put the opening into the glass and pull the plunger, filling the syringe with water, and skip to Step 9).








, If done correctly, the smaller glass should protrude from the water's surface, but it will be filled with water (it is being suspended by pressure).

Put your calcium carbonate in the kiln.,
Let your quicklime cool.,
Store your quicklime.",How to Make Quicklime," Safety is extremely important when making or dealing with quicklime. Quicklime is extremely dangerous and is reactive to moisture. When making or handling quicklime, you must wear safety material. Specific dangers include eye hazards and skin hazards. Contact with eyes or skin can cause burning and possibly permanent damage. In order to avoid hurting yourself make sure to wear:


Chemical goggles and/or safety glasses.
A face shield.
Protective gloves and clothing. Make sure all skin is covered.;
, In addition to skin and eye burning dangers, quicklime also offers an inhalation hazard to those making it or exposed to it. In order to avoid this, you need to make sure you have proper ventilation and other safety equipment when making or working with quicklime.


At the very least, use a dusk mask.
It is recommended that cooking quicklime be done outside or in a facility with very good ventilation., Your first step is going to be finding the raw material for quicklime. These raw materials can be purchased at garden stores, hardware stores, or construction material suppliers. The main source of lime is rock that contains calcium carbonate. In picking a source of lime, consider:


Dolomite
Chalk
Limestone.
Avoiding calcium sulfate (such as gypsum). Cooking gypsum could create hazardous and toxic fumes., After you’ve determined what raw source of calcium carbonate you’ll be using, you need to get the right amount of rock to make your quicklime. Because whatever rock you’ll be using as a material to make quicklime will not contain 100% calcium carbonate, you’ll need to acquire more rock than you’ll need for the amount of quicklime you want to make.


You will need 1.8 units of raw calcium carbonate for every 1 unit of quicklime you want to make.
If you are buying pre-bagged calcium carbonate mix or any sort of rock mixture, make sure to pay attention and consider the directions and ingredient makeup specified on the bag or box.
Do not substitute a rock or rock mixture that is not dolomite, chalk, or limestone without consulting a specialist., One of the biggest pieces of equipment you’ll need in making quicklime is a stove or kiln. Your stove or kiln should be up to the task of cooking the amount of quicklime you intend to make.


Your kiln needs to be able to maintain high temperatures (over 1000 degrees Celsius) for a up to an hour.
Your kiln must be big enough for you to make the desired amount of quicklime.
Try to make your quicklime outside. However, if you must make it inside, you should have proper ventilation where your kiln is located. This could be a vent or windows that create a cross draft., At all costs, you want to avoid calcium sulfate rocks or rock mixtures. If you heat calcium sulfate, it will decompose to form calcium oxide and sulfur trioxide, which is a poisonous gas. This gas can cause serious injury to you, your family, and your pets., Your first step in cooking quicklime will be to heat your kiln to the proper temperature. This is important because calcium carbonate needs to be heated to a certain temperature in order for it to begin thermal decomposition. Make sure:

To heat your kiln to 1000 to 1100 Celsius.
Your kiln remains steady at this temperature before continuing.
Your calcium carbonate rock mixture is not immediately next to the kiln as it is heating.
To remove any water or other liquids that may be in the immediate vicinity of the kiln., After you’ve heated up your kiln, the next step is to put your calcium carbonate mixture into an appropriate container and put it in the kiln. Here you will begin the process of turning your rock mixture into quicklime.

Heat your calcium carbonate directly on the flame until it becomes red hot.
Do this for about 2-3 minutes.
The rock will decompose on heating to create calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide.
After it is apparent that the rock has been cooked and decomposed, turn the heat off., After you’ve melted your calcium carbonate mixture and produced quicklime, you need to let it cool before doing anything with it. Ultimately, hot quicklime, especially when mixed with water, can create a serious hazard for you, your family, and your pets.

, After you’ve let your quicklime cool, you need to prepare to store it. Storing it properly is extremely important as quicklime is a potentially dangerous substance. There are a number of things you should consider when storing quicklime.


Store it in a dry heavy-plastic or metal container.
Seal your container well.
Keep your container out of reach of pets or small children.
Keep your quicklime dry. Quicklime reacts violently when mixed with water. As a result, you need to keep your quicklime dry and in a location where it won’t be exposed to leaks or floods."

Remove the spectator ions by canceling out identical ions on each side of the equation.",How to Write a Net Ionic Equation," The first step in writing a net ionic equation is identifying the ionic compounds of the reaction. Ionic compounds are those that will ionize in an aqueous solution and have a charge.Molecular compounds are compounds that never have a charge. They are made between two non-metals and are sometimes referred to as covalent compounds.Ionic compounds can be between metals and nonmetals, metals and polyatomic ions, or multiple polyatomic ions.
If you are unsure of a compound, look up the elements of the compound on the periodic table.;
, Not all ionic compounds are soluble in an aqueous solution and therefore, will not dissociate into individual ions. You must identify the solubility of each compound before proceeding with the rest of the equation. Below is a brief summary of the rules of solubility. Seek out a solubility chart for more details and exceptions to these rules.Follow these rules in the order stated below:
All Na+, K+, and NH4+ salts are soluble.
All NO3-, C2H3O2-, ClO3-, and ClO4- salts are soluble.
All Ag+, Pb2+, and Hg22+ salts are insoluble.
All Cl-, Br-, and I- salts are soluble.
All CO32-, O2-, S2-, OH-, PO43-, CrO42-, Cr2O72-, and SO32- salts are insoluble (with some exceptions).
All SO42- salts are soluble (with some exceptions).

, Cations are the positive ions in a compound and are generally the metals. Anions are the negative, non-metal ions in the compound. Some non-metals are capable of forming cations, but metals will always form cations.For example, in NaCl, Na is the positively charged cation because it is a metal while Cl is the negatively charged anion because it is a non-metal.

, Polyatomic ions are charged molecules that are bound so tightly together that they do not dissociate during chemical reactions.It is important to recognize polyatomic ions as they have a specific charge and do not break down into their individual components. Polyatomic ions can be both positively and negatively charged.


If you are in a standard chemistry course, you will likely be expected to memorize some of the most common polyatomic ions.
Some common polyatomic ions include CO32-, NO3-, NO2-, SO42-, SO32-, ClO4-, and ClO3-.There are many more and can be found in tables in your chemistry book or online., Before writing a net ionic equation, you must first make sure your starting equation is completely balanced. To balance an equation, you add coefficients in front of compounds until there is an equal number of atoms for each element on both sides of the equation.


Write the number of atoms that comprise each compound on either side of the equation.
Add a coefficient in front of elements that are not oxygen and hydrogen to balance each side.
Balance the hydrogen atoms.
Balance the oxygen atoms.
Re-count the number of atoms on each side of the equation to make sure they are equal.
For example, Cr + NiCl2 --> CrCl3 + Ni becomes 2Cr + 3NiCl2 --> 2CrCl3 + 3Ni.

, Oftentimes, you will be able to identify keywords in a problem that will tell you the state of matter for each compound. There are some rules to help you determine the state of an element or compound.If no state is provided for an element, use the state found on the periodic table.
If a compound is said to be a solution, you can write it as aqueous, or (aq).
If there is water in the equation, determine whether or not the ionic compound will dissolve using a solubility table.If it has high solubility, the compound will be aqueous (aq), if it has low solubility, it will be solid (s).
If there is not water, the ionic compound is a solid (s).
If the problem mentions an acid or a base, they will be aqueous (aq).
For example, 2Cr + 3NiCl2 --> 2CrCl3 + 3Ni. Cr and Ni in their elemental forms are solids. NiCl2 and CrCl3 are soluble ionic compounds, therefore, they are aqueous. Rewritten, this equation becomes: 2Cr(s) + 3NiCl2(aq) --> 2CrCl3(aq) + 3Ni(s).

, When a species or compound dissociates, it separates into its positive (cation) and negative (anion) components. These will be the components that get balanced at the end for the net ionic equation.


Solids, liquids, gases, molecular compounds, low solubility ionic compounds, polyatomic ions, and weak acids will not dissociate.
High solubility ionic compounds (use solubility table) and strong acids will ionize 100% (HCl(aq), HBr(aq), HI(aq), H2SO4(aq), HClO4(aq), and HNO3(aq)).Keep in mind, although polyatomic ions do not dissociate further, if they are a component of an ionic compound they will dissociate from that compound.

, Remember that metals will be the positive cation, while non-metals will be the negative anion. Using the periodic table you can determine which element will have which charge. You must also balance the charges of each ion within the compound.


In our example, NiCl2 dissociates into Ni2+ and Cl- while CrCl3 dissociates into Cr3+ and Cl-.
Ni has 2+ charge because Cl has a minus charge, but there are 2 atoms of it. Therefore, it must balance the 2 negative Cl ions. Cr has a 3+ charge because it must balance the 3 negative Cl ions.
Remember that polyatomic ions have their own specific charge., Anything that will dissociate or ionize (strong acids) will simply separate into its two distinct ions. The state of matter will remain (aq), but you must ensure the equation remains balanced.


Solids, liquids, gasses, weak acids, and low solubility ionic compounds will not change state or separate into ions. Simply leave them as they are.
Molecular substances will simply disperse in solution, so their state will change to (aq). Three exceptions that do not become (aq) are: CH4(g), C3H8(g), and C8H18(l).
Continuing our example, the total ionic equation looks like this: 2Cr(s) + 3Ni2+(aq) + 6Cl-(aq) --> 2Cr3+(aq) + 6Cl-(aq) + 3Ni(s). When Cl is not in a compound, it is not diatomic; therefore, we multiplied the coefficient by the number of atoms in the compound to get 6 Cl ions on both sides of the equation.

, You can cancel only if they are 100% identical on both sides (charges, subscripts, etc.). Re-write the action without any of the canceled species.


Finishing the example, there are 6Cl- spectator ions on each side that can be canceled out. The final net ionic equation is 2Cr(s) + 3Ni2+(aq) --> 2Cr3+(aq) + 3Ni(s).
To do a check to see if your answer works, the total charge on the reactant side should equal the total charge on the product side in the net ionic equation.

Identify the number of electrons present in the element.,
Know about electron shells and energy levels.,
Learn the rules for electron filling.,
Use the diagonal configuration chart to write electron configurations.,
Recognize what the last orbital of each configuration will be.,
Understand the noble gas electron configuration.,
Identify the noble gas in the period before your element.,
Substitute the noble gas for the same number of electrons the noble gas has.",How to Write a Noble Gas Configuration for Atoms of an Element," The atomic number of an element tells you the number of protons it has. Because elements in their neutral state have the same number of protons and electrons, you can also use the atomic number as the number of electrons the element has. The atomic number, which can be found on the periodic table, is the number written directly above the symbol for the element.


For example, the symbol for sodium is Na. The atomic number for Na is 11.;
, The first electron shell has only the s energy level, the second electron shell has both an s and p energy level. The third electron shell has an s, p, and d energy level. The fourth electron shell has an s, p, d, and f energy level. There are more than four electron shells, but for a standard chemistry course you will generally only use the first four.Each s energy level can hold a maximum of 2 electrons.
Each p energy level can hold a maximum of 6 electrons.
Each d energy level can hold a maximum of 10 electrons.
Each f energy level can hold a maximum of 14 electrons.

, According to the Aufbau principle, you must add electrons to the lowest energy levels before an electron can be added to a higher energy level. Each energy level may have multiple suborbitals, but each suborbital can hold a maximum of two electrons at any given time. The s energy level has one suborbital, p has 3 suborbitals, d has 5 suborbitals, and f has 7 suborbitals.The d energy level has a slightly higher energy than the s energy level of the lower electron shell, so the higher s energy level will fill before the lower d energy level. For writing an electron configuration this means it will look like this: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d10.

, The easiest way to remember how electrons fill is to use the configuration chart. This is where you write out each shell and the energy levels within it. Draw diagonal lines from the top right through to the bottom left of each line. The configuration chart looks like this:1s
2s 2p
3s 3p 3d
4s 4p 4d 4f
5s 5p 5d 5f
6s 6p 6d
7s 7p
For example: The electron configuration of sodium (11 electrons) is 1s2s222p63s1.

, By looking at the periodic table, you can determine what the last subshell and energy level of the electron configuration will be. First determine which block the element falls in (s, p, d, or f). Then count which row the element is in. Finally, count which column the element is in.For example: Sodium is in the s block, so the last orbital of its electron configuration will be s. It is in the third row and first column, therefore the last orbital is 3s1. This is a good way to double-check your final answer.
The rule is a little bit different for the d orbital. The first row of d-block elements starts in the fourth row, but you must subtract one because of the Aufbau principle. For example, vanadium ends with 3d3.
Another way to double check your work is to add all of the superscripts together. They should equal the number of electrons in the element. If you have too few or too many electrons, you will need to look over your work and try again.

, The noble gas electron configuration is a type of shortcut to writing out the full electron configuration of an element. The noble gas shorthand is used to summarize the electron configuration of an element while providing the most relevant information about the valence electrons of that element.The noble gas is substituted to represent all of the electrons that aren’t valence electrons.
The noble gases are helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon and are found in the last column of the periodic table.

, The period of an element is the horizontal row that the element is located in. If the element is in the fourth row of the periodic table, it is in period four. The noble gas you will use will be located in period three. Below is a list of the noble gases and their periods:1: Helium
2: Neon
3: Argon
4: Krypton
5: Xenon
6: Radon
For example: Sodium is in period three. We will use neon for the noble gas configuration because it is in period 2.

, There are a few ways to do this next step. You can physically write out the electron configuration for the noble gas and then replace that same configuration in your element of interest. An alternative is to remove the same number of electrons the noble gas has from the element you are writing the configuration for.For example: Sodium has 11 electrons and neon has 10 electrons.
The full electron configuration for sodium is 1s2s222p63s1 and neon is 1s2s222p6. As you can see, sodium has a 3s1 that neon does not have, therefore, the noble gas configuration for sodium would be 3s1.
Alternatively, you can count the superscripts of the energy levels until you get to ten. Remove these energy levels and leave what remains. When using neon to write the electron configuration for sodium, you will have one electron leftover: 3s1.

Study the role of amino acids by themselves.",How to Study the Chemistry of Amino Acids in the Human Body," Amino acids are chemical compounds that have important biological function in the tissues of all living organisms including humans and animals. They are usually present naturally as building blocks of special type of macromolecules that are called proteins.This type of macromolecules is abundant in nature and is found in many food products including meat products and other food sources. There are 20 known amino acids in the body that combined comprise the structure of all proteins in the body.;
, The body of humans is able to synthesize part of those amino acids as part of its complex metabolic function that include among many other functions the synthesis of certain type of these amino acids that for this reason are called nonessential amino acids. The other part of the 20 amino acids is not synthesized in the body due to the lack of special mechanisms for their synthesis such as the presence of appropriate enzymes for their proper synthesis.

, These amino acids are usually obtained as food that is rich in proteins product. This source of amino acids is not available to the body tissue on an immediate fashion and must first be digested in the intestine into its amino acids components that are then absorbed into the blood using special transport systems across the epithelial cells that cover the lining of the intestinal mucosa.

, Amino acids are usually metabolized in the body through several mechanisms that each leads to different product in the body. First, amino acids enter a translational process which occurs at the cellular ribosome and which is mediated by a genetic code from DNA bases that are located on DNA template that is specific for the genetic coding of that particular protein. This process is very organized and accurate and uses amino acids in the body that are both essential and nonessential in order to construct the primary structure of the protein.

, A wrong sequence of DNA bases can essentially produce a defective structure of the synthesized protein that has incorrect sequence of amino acids in its primary structure. This can usually occur in certain genetic diseases in specific tissue of the body. Also it can occur due to a mutational effect on the DNA structure as is manifested by certain types of cancer.

, Proteins can serve in the body different functions. One important function is as enzymes. This type of protein has specific sequence of its amino acids and specific tertiary structure that allows it to perform catalytic function of reactions in the body. Again, amino acids here play an important role since this catalytic ability of the enzyme is mainly due to few amino acids that are located in a small cleft or hall that is located within the structure of the enzyme. These amino acids work jointly to perform certain reaction that otherwise would not take place in an environment outside the hall of the enzyme.

, The other metabolic pathway that amino acids enter in the body and which is well studied and is well known in the chemical literature is the degradation of amino acids into various metabolic products that usually serve intermediates for the Krebs cycle in order to generate ATP molecules. This process involves in most amino acids the removal of the amino group from the basic structure of the amino acid. This process is called delamination and is typical for the metabolism of these important molecules in the body.


This process usually takes place in liver cells that are called hepatocytes. This is the typical site of amino acids metabolism as well as other important molecules such as fatty acids. This continuous process of consuming the amino acids by the delamination reaction can lead to the replenishment of the sources of this important molecule in the body. For this reason a continuous supply of these amino acids is mandatory for a proper and normal metabolism in the body. The amino group of delaminated amino acids is converted into urea by a specific biochemical process that is characteristic of the ammonia molecule.

, These serve as precursor intermediates for other important molecules in the body such as neurotransmitters and hormones. Examples include the synthesis of the thyroid hormone from the amino acid tyrosine. Also an important neurotransmitter in the nervous system and which is called dopamine is obtained metabolically from one type of amino acids by an enzymatically dependent biochemical process.


Two other important neurotransmitters which are mediators of the autonomic nervous system are synthesized from amino acids also by enzymatically catalyzed biochemical processes. These two neurotransmitters are epinephrine and norepinephrine and are mediators of the function of the autonomic nervous system. They have function that is related to the expression of stressful situation by inducing physiological symptoms such as increased heart rate and increased sweating and and many other symptoms that are characteristic of this stressful situation.

, In addition, individual amino acids can have by themselves important physiological function such as the simple molecule of glycine which despite its primitive chemical structure is an important neurotransmitter in the nervous system.


There are also atypical amino acids in the body and which usually are not incorporated into the primary structure of proteins. An example is the neurotransmitter GABA or gamma-amino-butyric –acid. This molecule has sedative effect on the nervous system by inhibiting electric transmission between neurons.

Practice with some examples.",How to Write a Chemical Equation," In naming compounds, Greek prefixes are used to indicate the number of atoms present for each element. Covalent compounds have the first element written out completely while the second element is named with the suffix “ide”. For example diphosphorus trisulfide has a chemical formula of P2S3.Below are the prefixes for 1-10:


1: Mono-
2: Di-
3: Tri-
4: Tetra-
5: Penta-
6: Hexa-
7: Hepta-
8: Octa-
9: Nona-
10: Deca-;
, When a compound has been written out, you must identify the elements and know their chemical symbols. The first element written is “first name” of the compound. Use the periodic table to find the chemical symbol for the element.For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The first element is nitrogen and the chemical symbol for nitrogen is N.

, To identify the number of atoms present for each element, you simply need to look at the prefix of the element. Memorizing the Greek prefixes will help you to be able to write chemical formulas quickly without looking anything up.For example: Dinitrogen has a the prefix “di-“ which means 2; therefore, there are two atoms of nitrogen present.
Write dinitrogen as N2.

, The second element is the “last name” of the compound and will follow the first element. For covalent compounds, the element name will have a suffix of “-ide” instead of the normal ending of the element.For example: Dinitrogen hexafluoride. The second element is fluorine. Simply replace the “ide” ending with the actual element name. The chemical symbol for fluorine is F.

, As you did with the first element, identify the number of atoms present in the second element by reading the prefix. Using this prefix, write the number of atoms as a subscript to the right of the chemical symbol.For example: Hexafluoride has a prefix of “hexa-“ which means 6; therefore, there are 6 atoms of fluorine present.
Write hexafluoride as F6.
The final chemical formula for dinitrogen hexafluoride is N2F6.

, When first learning chemistry, there is a lot of memorization involved. It is kind of like learning a new language. The more examples you practice with, the easier it will be to decipher chemical formulas in the future and learn the language of chemistry.


Sulfur dioxide: SO2

Carbon tetrabromide: CBr4

Diphosphorous pentoxide: P2O5


, All chemicals have what you can call a first and last name. The first name is the cation (positive ion) while the last name is the anion (negative ion). Cations are written as the element name while anions are the element name ending with the suffix “ide”.The chemical symbol for each element can be found on the periodic table.
Unlike covalent compounds, Greek prefixes are not used to indicate the number of atoms of each element. You have to balance the charges of the elements to determine the atoms.
For example: Lithium oxide is Li2O.

, Sometimes the cation or anion is a polyatomic ion. These are molecules that have two or more atoms with ionic groups. There’s no good trick to remembering these, you just need to memorize them.There are only 3 cation polyatomic ions and they are ammonium (NH4+), hydronium (H3+), and mercury(I) (Hg22+). They all have a +1 charge.
The rest of the polyatomic ions have negative charges ranging from -1 to -4. Some common ones are carbonate (CO32-), sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), and chromate (CrO42-).

, The valence charge can be determined by looking at the position of the element on the periodic table. There are a few rules to keep in mind that help you identify the charges:All group 1 elements at +1.
All group 2 elements are +2.
Transition elements will have Roman numerals to indicate their charge.
Silver is 1+, zinc is 2+, and aluminum is 3+.
Group 17 elements are 1-.
Group 16 elements are 2-.
Group 15 elements are 3-.
Remember, when working with polyatomic ions, just use the charge of the ion.

, Once you have identified the charge of each element (or polyatomic ion), you will use these charges to determine the number of atoms present of each element. You want the charge of the compound to equal zero so you will add atoms to balance the charges.For example: Lithium Oxide. Lithium is a group 1 element and has a +1 charge. Oxygen is a group 16 element and has a 2- charge. In order to balance the 2- charge of the oxygen, you need 2 atoms of lithium; therefore, the chemical formula of lithium oxide is Li2O.

, The best way to learn formula writing is to practice with lots of examples. Use examples in your chemistry book or look for practice sets online. Do as many as you can until you feel comfortable writing chemical formulas.


Calcium Nitride: Symbol for calcium is Ca and symbol of nitrogen is N. Ca is a group 2 element and has a charge of +2. Nitrogen is a group 15 element and has a charge of 3-. To balance this, you need 3 atoms of calcium (6+) and 2 atoms of nitrogen (6-): Ca3N2.
Mercury (II) Phosphate: Symbol for Mercury is Hg and phosphate is the polyatomic ion PO4. Mercury has a 2+ charge as indicated by the Roman numeral II next to it. Phosphate has a 3- charge. In order to balance them, you will need 3 atoms of mercury (6+) and 2 molecules of phosphate (6-): Hg3(PO4)2.

, In a basic double replacement equation you will have two cations and two anions. The general equation takes the form of AB + CD --> AD + CB, where A and C are cations and B and D are anions. You also want to determine the charges of each ion.For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> ?
The cations are Ag+1 and Na+1. The anions are NO31- and Cl1-.

, Once you have identified all of the ions and their charges, rearrange them so that the first cation is now paired with the second anion, and the second cation is now paired with the first anion. Remember the equation: AB + CD --> AD + CB.Remember to balance the charges when forming new compounds.
For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> ?
Ag+1 now pairs with Cl1- to form AgCl.
Na+1 now pairs with NO31- to form NaNO3.

, After writing the products that will form in the equation, you can write the whole equation with both products and reactants. Keep the reactants on the left side of the equation and write the new products on the right side with a plus sign between them.For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> ?
AgNO3 + NaCl --> AgCl + NaNO3


, Once you have written the equation and have all of the products and reactants you need to make sure everything is balanced. An equation is balanced only when you have the same number of atoms of every element present on both sides.For example: AgNO3 + NaCl --> AgCl + NaNO3

Count the number of atoms on each side: 1 Ag left, 1 Ag right; 1 N left, 1 N right; 3 O left, 3 O right; 1 Na left, 1 Na right; 1 Cl left, 1 Cl right
This equation is balanced because there are equal numbers of atoms on both the left and right side of the equation.

, The only way to get better at writing chemical equations is to actually do it. Work your way through these examples to make sure you really understand the process.


NiCl2 + (NH4)2S --> ?
Cations: Ni2+ and NH4+

Anions: Cl1- and S2-

Recombine ions to make new products: NiS + NH4Cl
Write the equation: NiCl2 + (NH4)2S --> NiS + NH4Cl
Balance the equation: NiCl2 + (NH4)2S --> NiS + 2NH4Cl

If you have questions, make sure you bring them up with the instructor before class., Laboratory reports have a particular written style. Unlike creative essays or papers for humanities classes, a report for chemistry is not supposed to have your own personal stamp on it. The essential writing elements are:Write in complete sentences.
Use passive voice -- “Water was poured” rather than “I poured water.”
Stay in the third person -- “Scientists claim X” rather than “I discovered scientists claim X.”
Be careful of verb tenses. Most of your report should use present tense verbs, unless you are explaining what you did in the experiment, or what has been written in the past about it. For example, “One problem in conducting this experiment is X” rather than “One problem in conducting this experiment was/will be X.”

, What do you think this experiment will do? What will you learn? Hypothesizing, or making an informed guess about what the result of the experiment will be, is one of the key elements in any scientific experiment. Keep in mind that it’s only an idea about what might happen, and you often come up with a different result.”At 50 degrees Celsius, when XO is combined with YO, XY and O2 will form.”

, Though there are elements that will appear in all lab reports, each instructor might have different expectations. Be certain that you know, for example, how your teacher or professor wants citations and/or endnotes, whether he or she will require a list of materials, and exactly how a final lab report should be formatted.

, Make sure you follow your instructor's preferred order. If he or she didn't express a preference, begin with the title of the experiment you are going to conduct. Any lab report will need to include your name and the name of your lab partner(s) and their email addresses. Also provide the date that you did the experiment, the name of the teacher or professor, and the class name, number, and section number (if applicable).Experiment 7: Identification of the Results of X + Y

, This will be the part where you sum up your work. You will tell the reader what you did and why, and then the results. Since it’s at the beginning, however, you will need to wait to write it until the end.

, This will give your reader the basics of the experiment you will be conducting.Explain what you are testing and how you will do so. Discuss any previous research on the topic. Include a hypothesis in your introduction. What do you believe you will discover? This is the essence of the hypothesis, and an integral part of any scientific report. Why do you believe that your experiment will turn out in a particular way? Any Introduction will answer the following questions:


Why did you choose to do this experiment?
What was the purpose of the experiment?
What do we know beforehand (previous knowledge or research around the experiment)?

, You can typically find this in the lab manual for the class. It is the chemical reaction that you are going to be conducting, laid out with the reactants and products labeled and their structure. You will also need to indicate the temperature of the experiment and the solvent.At 50 degrees celsius, XO(l) + YO(l) XY(l) +O2(g)

, This is the part where you will conduct the experiment and write down every step. Do not just copy the lab manual -- tell the reader what happened in your particular experiment. Document everything as you are going through the process.Liquid XO and YO were heated to the appropriate temperature using a burner. Temperature was tested with a thermometer. The two liquids were poured into a third heated tube. A gas and a liquid were formed from the combination of XO and YO.”

, At the end of the Experimental Section, you need to let the reader know exactly what emerged from your experiment. Be sure to use the proper format. The appropriate order is:Name and amount (in grams) of the final product
Melting point of the final product with the known literature value
Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS) data
H NMR data
Infared Spectroscopy (IR) data

, This is where you analyze your results and whether your experiment went as expected. If not, why not? How did the experiment match (or not) your hypothesis? Were there problems in doing the experiment that might have affected the results?

, In a short and concise section, sum up what you learned from the experiment and whether it went as you thought. Unlike the Results and Discussion Section, the Conclusion is more focused on the broad ideas brought up in your introduction than the specifics of your particular experiment., Be sure to include the lab manual. Using the citation style chosen by your instructor, write down all of the books or websites that you used to prepare and learn about the experiment. This would also typically include your textbook., The abstract (no more than 200 words) should give the reader the basics about your experiment and its results. It should be self-contained, meaning that a person should be able to read the abstract and get a summary of your entire work without having to read any other section. Even though you’re writing the abstract at the end, it will end up going at the beginning of the report."

Get your dry ice as close to the time of use as possible.,
Handle dry ice carefully.,
Transport dry ice in a well ventilated vehicle.,
Store dry ice with proper air ventilation.,
Prevent food from spoiling during a power failure.,
Place dry ice on an appropriate surface.,
Dispose of dry ice by letting it return to gaseous form.",How to Use Dry Ice1," This is important due to the fact that dry ice turns from a solid into a gas at a rate of five to ten pounds per 24 hours in a normal insulated container. Buying it too far in advance could mean you won't you get a chance to use it before it disappears., You can use oven mitts, insulated gloves, or thick towels to handle dry ice, otherwise, it will burn your hands. Dry ice registers at negative 109 degrees F (negative 79 degrees C). The burn dry ice creates is similar to frostbite., Dry ice is carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide is hazardous to your health in large or concentrated quantities. If too much dry ice gas accumulates in a small space, you can suffer from carbon dioxide poisoning. Keep the windows in your vehicle open when transporting dry ice.You can put a sleeping bag, or other similar insulating materials, around the insulated container you plan on transporting your dry ice
If transported inside your vehicle (excluding the trunk) for periods longer than ten minutes, you should open your window to ventilate any concentrations of carbon dioxide., It should not be stored in a small space where the gas can build up and become dangerous. Keep dry ice where the air can flow. Styrofoam and newspaper are suitable insulators for preserving your dry ice.Use caution in low areas; carbon dioxide in gas form is heavier than air and settles close to the ground. Proper ventilation is the best way to prevent a build up of CO2 in low spots.

, A broken freezer full of food, or a freezer that's been shut off from power failure, can be saved with the cooling power of dry ice.However, you may not want to store your dry ice in a conventional, functioning freezer. The dry ice may be a colder temperature than your freezer thermostat can handle.

, Counter tops are not ideal, as the surface may crack from the extreme cold of the dry ice. If you are using dry ice in a freezer or refrigerator because the unit does not work, a small amount of dry ice is all that is needed to provide cooling and will not cause harmful effects.Wrap your dry ice in newspaper to protect it from dissipating too quickly due to air flow., Leave it out at room temperature and do not dispose of it in the garbage, sewer, sink or tub. Washing dry ice into your plumbing can do damage to your pipes and you should be certain you don't leave it to evaporate someplace children or animals might touch it.Some places you might allow your dry ice to evaporate include:


In your sink.
In your shower or bathtub.
Outside, out of reach of animals and children.

Gather your materials.,
Prepare the receptacle.,
Prevent water damage.,
Measure your proportions.,
Guide the path of your fog effect.,
Change your water.",How to Use Dry Ice2," Your dry ice will create fog in normal temperatures, but to make strong fog effects, you'll need to be prepared. Dry ice can be purchased at most local grocery stores and convenience stores. To get the thickest fog and really wow all onlookers, you'll need:


Dry ice
Fan
Hot water
Water receptacle (4 to 8 gallon; durable plastic or metal preferred), Dry ice combined with hot tap water can create a powerful, thickly flowing fog effect. Cool water, or water that has cooled from the addition of dry ice, will cause thinner, wispier fog. Fill your water receptacle with as hot of water as you can get.


You don't have to heat your water to the point of boiling, but the hotter the water, the stronger your fog will be.

, The reaction of the dry ice turning back into carbon dioxide, called sublimation, can cause the water in your receptacle to bubble intensely and may cause some of the water to splash out. Place a tarp beneath your water receptacle, or place it where water that has escaped your receptacle won't do damage.


The air that carries your fog will also carry moisture and can leave floors slipper. You should take proper measures to ensure no one slips in these areas., Having the right ratio of dry ice to water will improve your fog effect. For a sustained 15 minutes of thick fog, add about 5 to 10 pounds of dry ice to approximately 4 to 8 gallons of hot water.The best ratio for fog creation is about one half gallon of hot water per pound of dry ice., This can be done easily with a small fan. Dry ice has a tendency to seek the lowest point because it is heavier than air, so if you are on uneven ground or if your water receptacle is in a low spot, a fan on a low setting can help disperse it more widely., As the dry ice melts, it will release carbonation into the water which can negatively impact fog production. Keeping your water agitated and changing it frequently will improve your fog effect.

Acquire your flash-freeze tools.,
Rinse the berries thoroughly.,
Crush your dry ice and transfer your berries.,
Toss your fruit salad with the dry ice.,
Place the bowl in a safe place.",How to Use Dry Ice3," Freezing berries and other delicate fruit can take up a lot of freezer space while freezing and may leave you with freezer burned food.This simple and quick trick will have bushels of your berries frozen in no time. You'll need:


Dry ice
Hammer
Insulated gloves
Large bowl
Stainless steel spoon

, Make sure that any dirt, bacteria, or any trace contaminants are fully removed from your produce before freezing. After you have finished this, you should allow the fruit to dry for a brief period on a towel., You can move your berries to your bowl once these have dried to prepare to mix with the dry ice. Take your dry ice, while still in its packaging, and use a hammer to break the ice into small pieces.If there is concern that, while breaking your ice, it might chip or fly off irregularly, to protect your eyes and face, it is recommended you wear a face shield and goggles.

, You will need your insulated gloves to do this. Now that your ice is broken into manageable pieces, you can unwrap the packaging of the dry ice with your gloved hands, and mix the dry ice into the bowl. Gently stir the berries and ice with your stainless steel spoon until the ice is distributed throughout the berries.

, You don't want your bowl in a small, unventilated container, as this can cause a build up of carbon dioxide that might damage your container. Frozen berries can be stored in a plastic baggie and stored, in some cases, for up to a year or more.


You might consider storing your berries, while freezing, in: a large cooler (Styrofoam works well), or your sink. Be careful if you leave your berries and dry ice in the open. Children or small animals could get hurt playing with or trying to eat dry ice."

Wear splash goggles.,
Wear tight protective clothing.,
Wear an apron.,
Wear close-toed shoes.,
Wear gloves.,
Do not leave anything hanging.,
Keep emergency equipment on hand.,
Have an exit plan.,
Use a room with ventilation.,
Remove clutter.,
Keep chemicals in a safe, segregated location.,
Do not substitute chemicals.,
Use properly stored materials.,
Carefully read the MSDS.,
Heat chemicals carefully.,
Keep all equipment secured.,
Wash after handling chemicals.",How to Work Safely With Chemicals," Splash goggles cover your eyes entirely. Other eye wear, including prescription glasses and contacts, will not provide adequate protection. In some cases, additional protection will also be required.


When there is a high likelihood of heavy splashing or implosions, additional protective wear might be necessary for your face. This could include a laboratory bench shield and/or a face shield.;
, Your clothes should cover up most of your body so that if there is a spill chemicals do not get on you. Refrain from wearing skirts and dresses. Don't wear anything that is loose and hangs from your body in such a way that it could hit or fall in chemicals.


Don't wear jewelry. It can be ruined, can knock over lab material and can cause an electric reaction.
Don't wear loose sleeves that hang down low.

, You should cover your daily attire with an extra layer of clothing that is fire resistant and easy to remove. This is necessary to prevent damage from splashing and fires. Typically, aprons will work, but a lab coat can also be used.


If you are using a lab coat, be sure that the buttons on the coat snap open and closed. The coat should be easy to remove the coat quickly in case of contamination and normal buttons can make it difficult to remove the coat quick enough.

, Sandals will expose your feet to damage from splashing chemicals. The top of the shoe should be made of leather or an artificial leather substitute for protection. Do not wear shoes with tops composed of cloth or woven material.


You should also refrain from wearing high heels in the lab.

, Latex, neoprene, and butyl rubber gloves will protect your hands from chemicals, but cloth and leather gloves will not provide sufficient protection. Remove gloves when leaving the laboratory to prevent exposing outside materials to toxic chemicals.


Before using the gloves, check to make sure that there are no cracks or holes in them.
Do not reuse soiled gloves. Chemicals will eventually permeate the gloves and reach to your skin. Toss gloves out in a can designated for disposal of toxic materials.

, Long hair and loose clothing can accidently fall into corrosive material. Jewelry in the laboratory can cause an array of problems and should be removed. It can be ruined by corrosive chemicals, can get in the way while handling material, and can expose the wearer to the possibility of electric shock.

, The laboratory should be equipped with a fire extinguisher in case flammable substances are being used. Do not, however, attempt to use the extinguisher if you are not trained in its use. The location should also have eyewash or shower stations to remove chemicals in case of exposure.If you are not trained to use a fire extinguisher, flee from the location in case of emergency.

, The location should have both a primary and secondary exit, in case one exit is obstructed by fire. Be sure that everyone in the lab knows where to assemble in case of fire. After everyone is removed from the site, someone should take roll call and establish that everyone has been evacuated.


If someone is injured, keep him warm. Do not attempt to remove him from the location, unless he is immediately threatened by fire or chemicals.

, It is important to have ventilation in the room so that toxic fumes don’t accumulate and threaten your health. How much ventilation is necessary depends upon the type of chemicals you are using. Sometimes a single exhaust fan will be sufficient, other times an entire system of hoods and ducts might be necessary.Ask a professional, like a teacher, about how dangerous the fumes from the substance are. Verify that the location is safe enough for the chemicals you are using.

, Unnecessary objects at your work site can get in the way, resulting in accidents. It is particularly imperative that nothing be left on the floor. If you trip on these objects, it could cause a spill and result in considerable damage., Drinks, foods, and cigarettes should never be in the same room as toxic chemicals. Keep chemicals out of direct sunlight and other heat sources. Keep chemicals in a location that is fire resistant.


It is particularly imperative not to smoke in proximity to chemicals, because this could easily create a fire., Chemical reactions are complex and often dangerous. Unless you are extremely knowledge of how chemicals interact with each other, do not substitute one for another. Always follow directions precisely.Be sure that you have a clearly designed plan before you begin working with chemicals.


If you do know for sure that you can substitute one chemical for another chemical that is less dangerous, do so.

, Do not use chemicals if the container has been compromised with cracks or other signs of damage. Also, do not use the chemical if the label has been removed or appears as if it could potentially have been altered in any way. You must be positive that you are using the appropriate chemical.

, Each chemical should be labeled with an MSDS that provides comprehensive instructions. It should include information about proper safety wear, chemical hazards, proper handling procedures, and emergency procedures. Most relevant information should be here. Pay heed to it.


MSDS stands for Material Safety Data Sheet. As the name indicates, it should provide a nearly comprehensive accounting of how to handle a chemical.
The MSDS should include a ceiling limit, which is the maximum amount of the chemical that you can be exposed to in a specified time, usually 15 minutes.
The flash point is the temperature at which an active flame can cause the chemical to combust. The auto-ignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which the chemical can spontaneously explode even without exposure to a flame.

, Whenever possible, use an electric heater or hot plate instead of a gas burner. Check the auto-ignition temperature listed on the MSDS and do not allow the temperature to reach that point. Do not heat chemicals in a closed container.

, Stirrer motors, vessels, separatory funnels and all other laboratory equipment should be firmly secured so that chemicals are not spilt. Do not use any laboratory equipment that appears to be cracked, has frayed wires, or does not seem secure.

, Even if the chemicals were not particularly abrasive and you do not believe that you were exposed, you should still take precautions to remove them. Wash hands thoroughly after working with chemicals. Shower when the opportunity presents itself.

Get a large pot with a lid and an empty drinking cup.,
Slowly pour some salt water into the pot.,
Place the pot, cover upside down on the pot.,
Bring the water to a slow boil.,
Watch the pot as the water condenses.,
Wait a little while before drinking the water.",How to Turn Salt Water Into Drinking Water1," The glass should be big enough to hold a fair amount of fresh water.


Make sure the glass is short enough that you can still put the lid on the pot.
A Pyrex or metal cup is safest, as certain types of glass will explode when exposed to heat. Plastic may melt or deform.
Make sure the pot and lid are suitable for using on a stove.;
, Do not overfill.


Stop well before the water level has reached the mouth of the glass.
This will make sure no salt water splashes into the glass while boiling.
You don't want to get any salt water into the drinking glass, or your newly made fresh water will be contaminated.

, This will allow the water vapor as it condenses to drip into the drinking glass.


Position the pot lid so the highest point or handle is facing down directly above the glass.
Make sure the pot lid is providing a good seal along the edges of the pot.
Without a good seal, a lot of the steam will escape and diminish the supply of fresh water vapor.

, You will want to boil the water slowly over low heat.


A violent full boil can contaminate the drinking water by splashing into the glass.
Too much heat can cause a glass to break.
If the water is boiling quickly and violently, the glass may shift away from the center of the pot and the handle of the pot lid.

, When water boils, it becomes pure vapour, leaving behind anything that was dissolved in it.


As the water becomes vapour, it condenses in the air as steam and on the cover's surface as water droplets.
The droplets then run down to the lowest point (the handle) and drip right into the glass.
This will probably take 20 minutes or more.

, The glass and water will be very hot.


There may be a small amount of salt water left in the pot, so be careful when removing the glass of fresh water not to splash any salt water into your fresh water.
You might find that the glass and fresh water will cool faster if you remove it from the pot.
Be careful as you remove the glass so you don't get burnt. Use an oven mitt or potholder to take it out.

Collect salt water in a bowl or container.,
Place a cup or smaller container in the center.,
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.,
Place a rock or weight in the center of the plastic wrap.,
Place the salt water bowl in directly sunlight.",How to Turn Salt Water Into Drinking Water2," Make sure you don't fill it up all the way. You will need some space at the top of the bowl so that the salt water doesn't splash into your fresh water receptacle.
Make sure your bowl or container is watertight. If it is leaking, your salt water will drain away before it can form steam to condense as fresh water.
Make sure you have plenty of sunlight as this method takes several hours.

, Do this slowly. If you do this quickly, you might get some salt water splash into your cup. This will contaminate your fresh water as you collect it.
Make sure the lip of the glass remains above water.
You might need to weight it down with a rock to prevent it from sliding around.

, Make sure the wrap isn't too loose or too tight. Be sure that the plastic wrap has a tight seal on the rim of the salt water bowl.
If there are any leaks in the plastic wrap, steam or fresh water vapor might escape.
Use a sturdy brand of plastic wrap so it doesn't tear.

, Do this just above the cup or container in the centre of the bowl. This will cause the plastic wrap to dip in the centre, allowing fresh water to drip into your cup.
Make sure your rock or weight isn't too heavy or it will tear the plastic wrap.
Make sure the cup is in the centre of the bowl before continuing.

, This will heat the water and cause condensation to form on the plastic wrap.As condensation forms, fresh water droplets will drip from the plastic wrap into the cup.
This will allow you to slowly collect fresh water.
This method takes several hours so be patient.
After you have enough fresh water in your cup, you can drink it. It is safe and completely desalinated.

Plug up the top of the gas bottle with the leak stoppers.,
Build a bank of sand and bury the hose.,
Make a fire and place the gas bottle directly above the flame.",How to Turn Salt Water Into Drinking Water3," You can use parts of your life raft to construct a system for making fresh water from sea water. This method is most helpful if you are stranded on a beach with no fresh water.
It was developed by stranded pilot during WWII in the Pacific.
This is a helpful method, especially if you do not know how long it will be until you can be rescued.

, Open it and fill it with sea water. Filter the sea water through a cloth so you don't get too much sand or other debris in the water.
Don't fill the bottle up too much. You will want to avoid spilling the water out the top of the bottle.
Carry the water back to an area where you can make a fire.

, Attach the hose to one end of the leak stoppers.This will provide a tube for fresh condensed water vapor to travel out of the bottle of sea water as its heated.
Make sure the hose is free of kinks or clogs.
See that the seal between the hose and leak stoppers is strong. This will help you to avoid any fresh water leaking out of the hose.

, Use the opposite end of the leak stoppers from where you've attached the hose.This will provide a way for water vapour to travel from the bottle as its heated into the hose to transport fresh water.
Make sure the seal is tight to prevent leaks.
If you have any twine or tape, you can reinforce the seal with these items.

, This will keep the hose steady as fresh water travels through it.Keep the end of the hose exposed. This is where fresh water will trickle out.
Don't bury the gas bottle or leak stoppers. You will need to have this exposed to keep watch to make sure there are no leaks.
Make sure the hose is relatively straight and free of kinks as you bury it.
Place a pan underneath the exposed end of the hose. This will collect water the fresh water.

, This will boil the salt water in the bottle. As the water boils, steam will condense in the top of the gas bottle and travel into the hose as fresh water.
As most of the water boils, the condensed steam will travel through the hose and into the pan.
The water collected in the pan will be desalinated and safe to drink.

Check for short-term symptoms.,
Evaluate chronic health effects.,
Watch for acute symptoms.",How to Test for Mercury1," These symptoms are indicative of mercury exposure:


See if an unknown substance made contact with the skin or eyes. Check if the substance caused burns or severe irritation.
Check the body for development of an allergic rash or itching.
Determine if the eyes have been exposed to an unknown vapor. Check for discoloration of the eye lenses.;
, Look for any of the following symptoms:


Check to see if the gums have become spongy or soft, with developing sores. Teeth may become loose, and the amount of saliva produced may increase.
Notice wide mood swings. The person may become frightened, irritable, excited or depressed for no apparent reason. The person may become apathetic, lose self confidence and be upset when criticized. People affected by mercury also may exhibit an inability to concentrate, memory loss and hallucinations.
Look for fine tremors of the hand, tongue or eyelids. Eventually these tremors can progress to trouble balancing and walking.

, These occur during large single overdoses.


Notice upset stomach, chest tightness, coughing and trouble breathing. These symptoms may develop into pneumonia, which can be fatal.
Check to determine if an unknown substance has been swallowed. Swallowing mercury may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and severe kidney damage.

Do a urine test.,
Take a blood test.,
Take a stool sample.,
Retrieve a hair sample.,
Take a DSMA challenge.",How to Test for Mercury2," A urine sample should be taken as soon as possible after suspected exposure. Only elemental and inorganic mercury can be measured with a urine test. Organic mercury does not pass out of the body through urine. The sample should be laboratory tested. A mercury level of 0 to 20 micrograms/L is normal. Levels above 20 micrograms/L must be reported to the appropriate health authorities.

, Mercury only stays in the blood for a few days, so the sample must be taken soon after suspected exposure. Send the sample to a testing laboratory for analysis. A mercury level of 0 to 2 micrograms/dl is normal. Mercury levels above 2.8 micrograms/dl must be reported to the appropriate health authorities.

, Send this sample to a testing laboratory to be analyzed for the presence of mercury. The stool sample has the advantage of revealing organic mercury, which does not appear in urine. The stool sample also will show ongoing exposure to mercury, which may be missed by urine and blood tests due to the flushing of the mercury from the body by those means.

, Testing the hair is an effective test for long-term exposure to organic mercury. It is a complicated and expensive test to run, as the hair has been subjected to unknown outside influences that must be filtered out during the testing process. Only a high-end laboratory is capable of running a hair test.

, A drug called DMSA binds to mercury molecules and is then urinated out of the body carrying the mercury with it. 300mg to 1000mg of DMSA is ingested and urine is collected for analysis before and after the drug. A DMSA challenge must be taken under medical supervision.

Find your atom's atomic number.,
Determine the charge of the atom.,
Memorize the basic list of orbitals.,
Understand electron configuration notation.,
Memorize the order of the orbitals.,
Fill in the orbitals according to the number of electrons in your atom.,
Use the periodic table as a visual shortcut.,
Learn shorthand for writing long electron configurations.",How to Write Electron Configurations for Atoms of Any Element1," Each atom has a specific number of electrons associated with it. Locate your atom's chemical symbol on the periodic table. The atomic number is a positive integer beginning at 1 (for hydrogen) and increasing by 1 for each subsequent atom. The atom's atomic number is the number of protons of the atom - thus, it is also the number of electrons in an atom with zero charge.;
, Uncharged atoms will have exactly the number of electrons as is represented on the periodic table. However, charged atoms will have a higher or lower number of electrons based on the magnitude of their charge. If you're working with a charged atom, add or subtract electrons accordingly: add one electron for each negative charge and subtract one for each positive charge.

For instance, a sodium atom with a +1 charge would have an electron taken away from its basic atomic number of 11. So, the sodium atom would have 10 electrons in total.

, As an atom gains electrons, they fill different orbitals sets according to a specific order. Each set of orbitals, when full, contains an even number of electrons. The orbital sets are:


The s orbital set (any number in the electron configuration followed by an ""s"") contains a single orbital, and by Pauli's Exclusion Principle, a single orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, so each s orbital set can hold 2 electrons.

The p orbital set contains 3 orbitals, and thus can hold a total of 6 electrons.

The d orbital set contains 5 orbitals, so it can hold 10 electrons.

The f orbital set contains 7 orbitals, so it can hold 14 electrons.
Remember the order of the letters with this mnemonic:Sober Physicists Don't Find Giraffes Hiding In Kitchens.
For atoms with even more electrons, the orbitals continue alphabetically past K, skipping letters already used.


, Electron configurations are written so as to clearly display the number of electrons in the atom as well as the number of electrons in each orbital. Each orbital is written in sequence, with the number of electrons in each orbital written in superscript to the right of the orbital name. The final electron configuration is a single string of orbital names and superscripts.

For example, here is a simple electron configuration: 1s2 2s2 2p6. This configuration shows that there are two electrons in the 1s orbital set, two electrons in the 2s orbital set, and six electrons in the 2p orbital set. 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 electrons total. This electron configuration is for an uncharged neon atom (neon's atomic number is 10.)

, Note that orbital sets are numbered by electron shell, but ordered in terms of energy. For instance, a filled 4s2 is lower energy (or less potentially volatile) than a partially-filled or filled 3d10, so the 4s shell is listed first. Once you know the order of orbitals, you can simply fill them according to the number of electrons in the atom. The order for filling orbitals is as follows: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p, 8s.

An electron configuration for an atom with every orbital completely filled would be written: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f14 5d10 6p6 7s2 5f14 6d107p6

Note that the above list, if all the shells were filled, would be the electron configuration for Og (Oganesson), 118, the highest-numbered atom on the periodic table - so this electron configuration contains every currently known electron shell for a neutrally charged atom.

, For instance, if we want to write an electron configuration for an uncharged calcium atom, we'll begin by finding its atomic number on the periodic table. Its atomic number is 20, so we'll write a configuration for an atom with 20 electrons according to the order above.

Fill up orbitals according to the order above until you reach twenty total electrons. The 1s orbital gets two electrons, the 2s gets two, the 2p gets six, the 3s gets two, the 3p gets 6, and the 4s gets 2 (2 + 2 + 6 +2 +6 + 2 = 20.) Thus, the electron configuration for calcium is: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2.

Note: Energy level changes as you go up. For example, when you are about to go up to the 4th energy level, it becomes 4s first, then 3d. After the fourth energy level, you'll move onto the 5th where it follows the order once again. This only happens after the 3rd energy level.

, You may have already noticed that the shape of the periodic table corresponds to the order of orbital sets in electron configurations. For example, atoms in the second column from the left always end in ""s2"", atoms at the far right of the skinny middle portion always end in ""d10,"" etc. Use the periodic table as a visual guide to write configurations - the order that you add electrons to orbitals corresponds to your position in the table. See below:

Specifically, the two leftmost columns represent atoms whose electron configurations end in s orbitals, the right block of the table represents atoms whose configurations end in p orbitals, the middle portion, atoms that end in d orbital, and the bottom portion, atoms that end in f orbitals.
For example, when writing an electron configuration for Chlorine, think: ""This atom is in third row (or ""period"") of the periodic table. It's also in the fifth column of the periodic table's p orbital block. Thus, its electron configuration will end ...3p5

Caution - the d and f orbital regions of the table correspond to energy levels that are different than the period they're located in. For instance, the first row of the d orbital block corresponds to the 3d orbital even though it's in period 4, while the first row of the f orbital corresponds to the 4f orbital even though it's in period 6.

, The atoms along the right edge of the periodic table are called noble gases. These elements are very chemically stable. To shorten the process of writing a long electron configuration, simply write the chemical symbol of the nearest chemical gas with less electrons than your atom in brackets, then continue with the electron configuration for the following orbital sets. See below:

To understand this concept, it's useful to write an example configuration. Let's write a configuration for Zinc (atomic number 30) using noble gas shorthand. Zinc's full electron configuration is: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10. However, notice that 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 is the configuration for Argon, a noble gas. Just replace this portion of Zinc's electron notation with Argon's chemical symbol in brackets (.)
So, Zinc's electron configuration written in shorthand is 4s2 3d10.

However, it does require a rearranged periodic table, because in traditional periodic table, beginning with fourth row, period numbers do not correspond to the electron shells. Find an ADOMAH Periodic Table, a special type of periodic table designed by scientist Valery Tsimmerman. It's easily found via a quick online search.In the ADOMAH Periodic Table, horizontal rows represent groups of elements, such as halogens, inert gases, alkali metals, alkaline earths, etc. Vertical columns correspond to electron shells and so called “cascades” (diagonal lines connecting s,p,d and f blocks) correspond to periods.
Helium is moved next to Hydrogen, since both of them are characterized by the 1s orbital. Blocks of periods (s,p,d and f) are shown on the right side and shell numbers are shown at the base. Elements are presented in rectangular boxes that are numbered from 1 to 120. These numbers are normal atomic numbers that represent total number of electrons in a neutral atom.

, To write electron configuration of an element, locate its symbol in ADOMAH Periodic Table and cross out all elements that have higher atomic numbers. For example, if you need to write electron configuration of Erbium (68), cross out elements 69 through 120.

Notice numbers 1 through 8 at the base of the table. These are electron shell numbers, or column numbers. Ignore columns which contain only crossed out elements. For Erbium remaining columns are 1,2,3,4,5 and 6.

, Looking at the block symbols shown on the right side of the table (s, p, d, and f) and at the column numbers shown at the base and ignoring diagonal lines between the blocks, break up columns into column-blocks and list them in order from the bottom up. Again, ignore column blocks where all elements are crossed out. Write down the column-blocks beginning with the column number followed by the block symbol, like this: 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 3d 4s 4p 4d 4f 5s 5p 6s (in case of Erbium).

Note: The above electron configuration of Er is written in the order of ascending shell numbers. It could also be written in the order of orbital filling. Just follow cascades from top to bottom instead of columns when you write down the column-blocks: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p6 5s2 4d10 5p6 6s2 4f12.

, Count elements that were not crossed out in each block-column, assigning one electron per element, and write down their quantity next to the block symbols for each block-column, like this: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 3d10 4s2 4p6 4d10 4f12 5s2 5p6 6s2. In our example, this is is the electron configuration of Erbium., There are eighteen common exceptions to electron configurations for atoms in the lowest energy state, also called the ground state. They deviate from the general rule only by last two-to-three electron positions. In these cases, the actual electron configuration keeps the electrons in a lower-energy state than in a standard configuration for the atom. The irregular atoms are:


Cr (..., 3d5, 4s1); Cu (..., 3d10, 4s1); Nb (..., 4d4, 5s1); Mo (..., 4d5, 5s1); Ru (..., 4d7, 5s1); Rh (..., 4d8, 5s1); Pd (..., 4d10, 5s0); Ag (..., 4d10, 5s1); La (..., 5d1, 6s2); Ce (..., 4f1, 5d1, 6s2); Gd (..., 4f7, 5d1, 6s2); Au (..., 5d10, 6s1); Ac (..., 6d1, 7s2); Th (..., 6d2, 7s2); Pa (..., 5f2, 6d1, 7s2); U (..., 5f3, 6d1, 7s2); Np (..., 5f4, 6d1, 7s2) and Cm (..., 5f7, 6d1, 7s2).

Identify the conjugate parameters, and which one is intensive and which one is extensive.,
Identify any other factors which have also effect on the progress of the chemical reactions.,
Study the effect of microwave irradiation on chemical reactions.,
Influence the progress of a chemical reaction by using reactions conditions at conditions of high pressure.,
Use alternatives to heat when dealing with organometallic compounds.",How to Use Thermodyamic Factors to Influence the Progress of Organic Chemical Reactions,"


The progress of all organic chemical reactions is very dependent on the conditions under which the specific reaction takes place. In fact the formulation of many thermodynamic functions was based on specifying the controlled thermodynamic parameters under which the reaction takes place. As an example the free energy of Gibbs is a basic thermodynamic function that is specific for chemical reactions under the control of temperature and pressure. This trend of choosing thermodynamic functions for chemical reactions under specific controlled thermodynamic parameters is the basis for functions such as the free energy of Helmholtz and the enthalpy thermodynamic function. Each of these thermodynamic functions is good for chemical reactions under the control of different type of thermodynamic parameters. These parameters are the Temperature and the Entropy in addition to the pressure and the volume.
The temperature and the entropy are two conjugate parameters in which one is intensive parameter and the other is extensive. This same trend is seen also with the parameters the volume and the pressure which are also two conjugate parameters in which one is intensive and the other is extensive.;
, These include for example the presence of ionic liquids in the solution in which the reaction is taking place. Ionic liquids can increase the ionic strength of the solution. This effect is probably best manifested in reactions that develop charged intermediates in which can be stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ionic liquid.

, A microwave oven generates microwave irradiation which can excite the reacting molecules mostly in its rotational energy levels. This excitation by microwave irradiation has proved to be useful in inducing chemical reactions in the organic laboratory.


Although the use of this technique of using microwave irradiation in order to enhance chemical reactions is relatively of recent age the idea of using electromagnetic radiation to induce chemical reactions is a well known procedure in organic chemistry. There is a whole branch of chemistry which is called organic photochemistry which is based on using UV and visible light in order to induce chemical changes in organic compounds and force it to undergo chemical reactions. This area of chemistry is based on excitation of electrons to an excited electronic state in a given compound that in most cases form radical species that is usually very unstable and combines immediately with another carbon species in the solution to form a new compound.

, In this case the chemist uses a well capped reaction flask that is designed for this purpose of working under high pressure conditions and let the reaction to proceed under conditions of reflux. In this case the vapor gas that is produced cannot be condensed nor can it escape from the flask. As a result pressure inside the flask accumulates and forces the reaction to proceed to completion. These reaction conditions are usually used with sluggish reactions that have high energy barrier.

, Usually organic compounds have certain degree of thermodynamic stability. For this reason most organic reactions require heat to trigger the reacting compounds to undergo a chemical reaction. Exceptions to this rule exist but mostly of organometallic type of chemical compounds. Organometallic compounds are usually very unstable compounds thermodynamically because they are air and water sensitive. These organometallic reagents such as Grignard reagent have high content of energy that its reaction is very exothermic and release energy in the form of heat. For this reason reactions that involve organometallic reagents are performed under supercooling conditions of −76 °C (−105 °F).

It’s important to have a firm understanding of chemistry in order to be able to teach it to your students.Some schools only require a basic science certification on top of a bachelor’s in teaching, but if you are serious about teaching chemistry, you need a bachelor’s specific to the subject.;
, Public schools require a license or certification in order to be able to teach. Make sure you have all of the proper paperwork and documentation before you apply to be a teacher.Look up the qualifications specific to the state or country where you will be teaching.
Certifications usually require obtaining a bachelor’s degree, taking a state or PRAXIS exam, letters of recommendation, and proof of teaching experience.Some universities offer certification as part of a chemistry bachelor’s teaching program.

, Many schools require at least a basic teacher preparation program. To be a great teacher, you need to be aware of the standards you must adhere to and the latest research on teaching in the classroom.Seek out professional development opportunities that encourage new and innovative ways to teach.
Teaching is a lot of trial and error. When you try something new, keep using the elements that work, and scrap the ones that don’t.

, Some schools require advanced degrees in a subject in order to teach. This path is optional, but can lead to more advanced positions in teaching chemistry. If you want to teach at the university level, you will need a doctorate.


In most cases, teaching at the high school level does not require an advanced degree, but a master’s degree would make you more qualified.

, To teach any subject, you need to plan out the year and know what you are going to be teaching and when. The big ideas in chemistry are the conservation of matter and energy, the behavior and properties of matter, the particulate nature of matter, and equilibrium and driving forces.Include all of these topics in your planning of a syllabus.
Plan for laboratories as well. Remember, these will usually take up an entire class period.

, When writing your lesson plans, make sure you are teaching material that is appropriate to your grade level. Determine the expected outcomes for your students and look up the teaching standards relevant to your grade.Make sure any demonstrations or hands-on labs are also age appropriate and safe.
For elementary and middle school students, keep the concepts very generalized: talk about the basic properties of an atom, but don’t go into the details of electron shells and arrangement.
At the high school level you can go into more depth and detail, talking about chemical reactions and balancing equations.

, You likely have a classroom of about thirty students. Not every student is going to pay attention all the time. Ask pointed questions to assess their knowledge and encourage discussion during class.


Encourage students to participate by handing out candy or extra credit points for good questions or answers.
Form small groups to work on chemistry problems and have the groups present to the rest of the class.
Make a chemistry-themed quiz show and divide the class into teams.

, Students are more likely to be interested in what you are teaching if you relate the information to something they can understand. Talk about the ways chemistry has changed or effects our daily lives.Chemical reactions allow our bodies to digest food.
The medicine that you take when you are sick is the result of chemistry.
Talk about food science such as making ice cream or why eggs turn white when you cook them.

, If you are teaching chemistry at the college level, you will likely have set office hours available for students to take advantage of. If you are teaching at the high school level, you probably don’t have weekly office hours, but let your students know that you are available for extra help outside of class.


This is particularly important around exam time. If you have time in your schedule, set aside a few hours for one or two days during the week before the test. Let your students know that this is the time for them to get extra help before test day.

, There are many different demonstrations that can safely be used in the classroom to demonstrate concepts that are part of chemistry.Make sure the demonstration that you choose integrates well with the material you are trying to teach.


When choosing a demonstration, know what the demonstration is about and why it will be helpful to your students.If the demonstration doesn’t have a logical point to explain a concept, it is not useful in the classroom.
Some examples of good demonstrations are freezing objects with liquid nitrogen to see how the temperature change affects the material and making ice cream out of heavy cream using ice and salt.

, By practicing before class, you can not only make sure everything works properly, but also figure out what you are going to say and when to say it.Instead of announcing what will occur, ask students to observe what happens for themselves.
It is okay to direct their observations and ask pointed questions as the demo continues.
For example: If you’re making ice cream, ask them what role each component plays in the process. Ask them to observe the process as the liquid cream starts to turn into a more solid ice cream.

, Before you begin, explain what the demonstration is about and ask the students why it is relevant to what they are learning. See if they can make the correct connections. Explain just enough so they know what you are doing, but not necessarily what will happen.Ask students to make predictions about what they think will happen. Write the predictions on the board to discuss when the demo is over.
For example: Making ice cream is a good lesson in temperature changes and thermodynamics. When you combine the ice with the rock salt, the salt lowers the freezing point of water so the ice mixture gets colder than it would with just ice. This allows the cream to freeze into solid ice cream., Once all predictions have been made, start the demonstration. Make sure that everything is visible to all of your students and everyone is focused on the materials in front of you. Ask students to make observations during the experiment as it happens.If the demonstration doesn’t work properly, don’t panic. Ask the students why they think it didn’t work and set it up to try again. If it works the next time, ask students what was different and why it worked.

, Ask the students what observations they made during the experiment. Were the predictions made before the experiment correct? Why or why not?Use this discussion time as an introduction to the material that you are going to teach that day.

, Before beginning any lab, you must make sure your students know all about lab safety and what to do in emergency lab situations. Point out all safety showers, eye wash stations, fire extinguishers, and fire blankets at the beginning of the year. Also, hand out instructions about what to do in an emergency.Review the pertinent lab safety procedures before every experiment to make sure students don’t forget.

, The pre-lab is used to test student’s comprehension and have them make predictions about what will happen in the experiment. Students will have to read through the experimental protocol and answer questions based on the material.This assignment must be turned in before the lab begins.

, Write up a detailed protocol for students and distribute it before the lab. Reading the protocol should be part of the pre-lab assignment. On the day of the lab, briefly talk through the steps of the procedure and answer any questions the students may have.


Knowing the procedure beforehand will help things run smoothly during the actual lab.

, Before the experiment begins, make sure the students know how to use all of the necessary equipment. Demonstrate how to use everything at the beginning of the period and encourage students to ask questions if they have them.


If the equipment is complicated and delicate make sure the students really understand how to use it to avoid damage.

, As students start the experiment, there will be questions about the procedure and the equipment. Encourage students to think about their questions and answer them without your help. If they are truly stumped, guide them to the correct answer.


Answer all questions about equipment to ensure it doesn’t get damaged.

, Keeping a laboratory notebook is an essential part of the scientific method and learning. Before the lab begins, students should write up the procedure in their notebook. During the lab itself they should make notes if their actual procedure deviated from the original written protocol.


Students should write down all observations during the experiment and all of their results.

, The lab report is necessary for students to analyze their data and discuss their findings. In addition, they will interpret their data and come to some conclusions about the concepts being taught.The laboratory report is used to assess your student’s understanding the lab itself and the content it is teaching.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Prepare your blood sample.,
Drip hydrogen peroxide on the liquid.,
Watch for the presence of bubbles.,
Know the limitations.",How to Test Blood to Make Sure It's Real1," In this experiment, you will be testing for the presence of catalase using hydrogen peroxide. Catalase is an enzyme in your cells that converts hydrogen peroxide into pure oxygen and water, causing a foaming action to occur.To use this test, you will need hydrogen peroxide, a microscope slide, a cotton swab, a small eyedropper, gloves, and the blood sample to test.


Standard 3% hydrogen peroxide found at the store works fine.
Always wear gloves when handling any solutions you believe to be biological, such as blood.;
, For this test, you need to place a little bit of the blood sample on the microscope slide. Using the cotton swab, smear a generous amount of the sample across the slide. The exact amount doesn’t matter, but the more blood you test, the greater the reaction will be.


Setup a positive and negative control to make sure the experiment is working.A positive control tells you that your experiment is working while a negative control makes sure that you aren’t getting results that are false positives.
Test a substance you know contains no cells, such as paint. This is your negative control.
Your positive control will be another sample that you know is blood.

, With the eyedropper, take up some of the hydrogen peroxide and drip it onto the blood.Again, the exact amount isn’t important. You will be able to see if the experiment is working right away.


If you don’t have an eyedropper, you can use a cotton swab soaked with hydrogen peroxide and rub it into the sample.
Test the same sample multiple times to make sure you get the same results.

, When a substance that is catalase positive is exposed to hydrogen peroxide, it will bubble rapidly. Because blood contains catalase, if your sample is real blood, it should immediately start to bubble.If the sample doesn’t bubble, it isn’t blood.
If the sample does start to bubble, you still can’t be totally sure it is blood, but this is a good step forward in determining that it is blood.

, Catalase is present in many living organisms such as plants and bacteria. Using hydrogen peroxide to do a catalase test is not very specific because of this. It’s important to recognize that even through a substance tests positive for catalase, that doesn’t mean it is actually blood.You can use the catalase test as a first step. If it tests positive, you can move forward with more specific tests.
This method is also not very good for detecting dilute concentrations or small amounts of blood.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Apply a few drops of rubbing alcohol to the cotton swab.Using the eyedropper, drip a few drops of alcohol onto the swab.,
Rub the unknown substance on the cotton swab.,
Apply a few drops of the phenolphthalein solution to the swab.,
Drip a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to the swab.,
Watch to see if the swab turns pink.,
Know the limitations.",How to Test Blood to Make Sure It's Real2," This test relies on the fact that blood has iron in the form of hemoglobin. When phenolphthalein (colorless) and hydrogen peroxide come into contact with the iron in the blood, the phenolphthalein gets oxidized and turns pink.To perform this test, you will need hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, cotton swabs, phenolphthalein, a small eyedropper, gloves, and the sample to be tested.


Phenolphthalein cannot be obtained in stores and must be purchased online. It is easiest to purchase a “Kastle-Meyer Test Kit” as it will contain all of the necessary resources.The standard strength 3% hydrogen peroxide is sufficient for this test.
The small eyedropper is optional, it just makes it easier to apply the solutions to the cotton swab.
Always wear gloves when working with biological substances like blood.

, Alternatively, fill a small cup with the rubbing alcohol and briefly dip the swab into it.


The swab doesn’t need to be soaked, it just needs to be moist.
The alcohol increases the sensitivity of the test by making the hemoglobin more exposed.

, With the damp cotton swab, rub it against the substance 4-5 times.You want to make sure a sufficient amount of the substance is on the swab.


If your sample is dry or you don’t have much to work with, you can cut up the fabric into smaller pieces and test that directly. Get the piece damp with rubbing alcohol and proceed to the next step.
You only need a very small piece to work with: the size of a fingertip should be sufficient.

, One or two drops is more than enough for each swab.Be sure to add all of the solutions in the correct order or the test will not work properly.


If you are working with the cloth directly, add the phenolphthalein directly onto the cloth.

, Again, one or two drops is more than enough.As soon as you add the hydrogen peroxide you may start to see the color change.


The hydrogen peroxide reacts with the phenolphthalein and any iron present in the substance.
Again, drip the hydrogen peroxide directly onto the small piece of cloth.

, If the sample is blood, the swab should turn pink within 10 seconds. If it doesn’t change or changes after 10 seconds, the test is negative and the sample does not contain blood.Try testing your sample multiple times to see if you get the same result.
Again, make sure you have added all of the reagents to the sample in the correct order. This could be a source of error if you are quite certain you have blood, but the test comes back negative.

, Just like the catalase test, this test has many limitations. It is often called a “presumptive” test because you cannot guarantee that it is blood and you definitely cannot tell if it is human blood.This test is prone to false positives because many vegetables and some metals will also react. Further analysis of the sample is necessary once you have a positive from this test."

Define the process.,
Understand the function of catalysts.,
Understand the chiral structure of catalysts.,
Study the history of the development of catalysts.,
Study modern catalysts.,
Study the use of enzymes as catalysts.",How to Study the Use of Catalysts in Chemistry," Catalysis of chemical reactions refers to a process in which an external chemical agent is used in order to speed up a chemical process which is typically a chemical transformation or a chemical reaction. Catalysts that are known in the chemical literature are of several types. All of them have the same role and purpose which is the acceleration of chemical processes. Chemical catalysts usually enhance the rate of chemical reactions by lowering its energy barrier or activation energy of the chemical reaction.;
, Normally chemical reactions at the laboratory level take time to proceed to completion. Often this can take hours or even days. This is usually not a favorable situation since faster reactions are sometimes required to save time and money. Also, some other desired chemical processes can never proceed in the desired direction. Into this comes the function of using the catalyst, which can facilitate the progress of the reaction that otherwise does not want to proceed any faster. Also some other catalysts not only help reactions to proceed to completion but also can induce selectivity in the products of the reaction by favoring one product over the other.

, Catalysts of this type usually have special chiral structure that can exert its effect by binding to the reacting compounds in a specific orientation that depends on its chirality. This type of catalysts are usually used in asymmetric catalytic processes that are chemical processes that are characterized by the production of certain specific product of a given reaction through the use of chemically selective compounds as catalysts that are usually chiral catalysts.

, Most catalysts that were in use in previous time are insoluble solid catalysts that have conferred to the reaction a heterogeneous character. These types of catalysts were designed after research was done on their surface properties. The search for suitable heterogeneous catalysts for the purpose of catalyzing chemical reactions relied on the science of surface chemistry and solid state physics. Research in surface chemistry and especially adsorption of compounds on surfaces of special solid material was done to evaluate the potential of that compound to behave as a catalyst.


One example of such a catalyst is the catalysis of hydrogen molecule addition to organic double bonds using palladium metals in the solid state. This process is a typical heterogeneous catalytic process. Heterogeneous catalysis proved to be not efficient process enough due to the existence of more than one phase in the reaction medium. For this reason the search for new more catalysts was very active.

, A relatively new type of catalysts that are still used nowadays are the homogeneous catalysts. This group of catalysts is called homogeneous because they are soluble in the reaction medium. Typical group of catalysts of this type is the organometallic reagents that are based on transition metal complexes of organic compounds. This type of catalysts is very useful in performing organic reaction that usually does not proceed without the presence of the catalyst.


Many organic reactions have been catalyzed by this type of reagents. Examples of such processes include the production of methanol from CO and H2 under the catalysis of an organometallic reagent. Also many other industrial processes rely on this type of catalysis. Homogeneous catalysis by organometallic reagents is currently a hot topic in organic and inorganic chemistries.
The idea of chemical catalysis that we see nowadays was taken from the observation of similar catalytic processes that take place inside the living tissue. A natural catalyst in the body is called an enzyme. This type of catalysis in the body is very efficient and important for the proper function of the body. The catalysis of biochemical reactions in the body have completely different mechanism than that observed in the chemistry laboratory. Enzymatic catalysis is a much more efficient process that is very selective and specific in its progress.

, Due to its selective and specificity enzymes are sometimes used by chemists to perform organic reactions that have high enantioselectivity by virtue of the use of the enzyme to catalyze the reaction. Enzymes catalysis cannot be mimicked on a laboratory scale due to the complicated mechanism in which enzymatic catalysis usually proceed. Therefore as alternatives are used to induce selectivity of chemical reactions such as the use of chiral catalysts that can induce selectivity of the product by binding in a selective way to the reacting molecule. This type of chiral catalysis is especially applicable to organic reactions where the products of the reactions are usually more than one product under noncatalytic conditions.

Check if the starting chemical is a mixture.,
See if the starting and target chemicals have any groups in common.,
If the starting chemical is a mixture, look at which parts can be used.,
Draw a spider diagram.,
Learn how the functional groups react.,
Try with an example.,
Remove unnecessary functional groups.,
Add groups if needed.,
Join your groups.,
Use grignard reagent if you need to directly join two carbon chains.",How to Synthesise Organic Compounds," If your starting chemical is something like crude oil, you'll need to use distillation or fractional distillation to separate it into parts.
, For example, they may contain an amine group or a carboxyl group, etc., You may need to crack the starting chemical into smaller parts. In our example, we need to crack the crude oil to obtain benzene and ethene., For the starting chemical, put the chemical in the middle, then draw arrows coming out of it showing all of the reactions it can be used in. For the target chemical, draw arrows going inwards, showing all of the reactions that can make it., More often than not, you'll have to change one functional group into another. For this, there is no shortcut: you have to learn how the different functional groups react., In our example, we need to change the ethene into ethanoyl chloride. How to do this? React it with water to change it into ethanol, then oxidise it to ethanoic acid. Then, react it with thionyl chloride to turn it into ethanoyl chloride. No shortcuts; just learn the reactions., Some functional groups are unnecessary. They need to be removed. Probably the easiest way to do this is to convert them into an alkene group, then react it with hydrogen to get rid of the double bond.

If you need to remove carbon chains, crack it. Cracking can be accomplished with a zeolite catalyst and a slight pressure.

, For carbon chains, one way is to use free radical substitution to add a halogen (chlorine, bromine etc.), then use other reactions to replace it with the group that you need. For aromatic compounds (e.g. benzene) there are specialised reactions (nitration, friedel-crafts acylation etc.) to add groups to the aromatic ring.

In our example, we need to add an OH group and an NH2 group to the benzene ring. If we were starting with cumene, we could oxidise it to phenol and acetone. This is the most common way to add an OH group to a benzene ring. However, we are starting with benzene, not cumene. Fortunately, there's another way: oxidise the benzene directly using nitrous oxide, N2O. After that, simply react the phenol with nitric and sulphuric acid, then reduce it to get the NH2 group on to the compound.

, After you've made the parts of your molecule, you'll need to stick them together.

Acyl chlorides will react with a variety of groups: alcohols, water, ammonia and amines, mainly. This allows you to join two groups via an oxygen or nitrogen atom. In our example, the amine on the aromatic compound reacts with the chlorine in the ethanoyl chloride to give paracetamol and hydrochloric acid.

, A grignard reagent consists of an organic chain, R, bonded to a magnesium atom, bonded to a bromine atom, like this: R - Mg - Br. The will react with a carbonyl, R - C(=O) - R, to form an alcohol, R - C(-OH)(-R) - R. Notice that this compound has an extra organic group. This group has been added by the grignard reagent."

Obtain a balance:


Where: Your best bet is an online laboratory vendor.,
Get some glassware:


Cups are fine, but do NOT use drinking cups.,
Get some basic measuring equipment:


A glass or dial thermometer is a necessity.,
Obtain a few essential chemicals:


Sodium bicarbonate--widely available in the form of baking soda.,
Find a suitable storage area


Shelves are great for organizing equipment.,
Safety considerations:


Make sure the room is well-ventilated, has a phone, and has a fire-extinguisher.",How to Supply a Home Laboratory," Most scales you buy in a store will not be sensitive enough.
Specs: I strongly recommend you get a scale that measures in grams, unless you want to be doing conversions all the time. You'll need resolution to at least one gram, minimum. One decimal place is good, two is ideal, three will probably not be worth the extra money.;
, Once you use the cups for the laboratory, they stay in the laboratory. Period.
At least one graduated pipet or buret will eventually be a necessity. Try to get one for each volume range you will use. These must be bought from a laboratory vendor.
You will need graduated cylinders and volumetric flasks from a laboratory vendor. Get one of each in 50 milliliters (1.7  fl oz) and 100mL sizes, and get another graduated cylinder in 10mL size.

, There are many applications for them, including boiling/freezing point determination, measuring heats (enthalpies) of reactions, measuring specific heat capacity, and other applications involving temperature.

Glass thermometers work well, but may have a range limited to a hundred degrees Celsius. Look for one with a range to one hundred and fifty degrees Celsius. The same goes for analog (non-digital) dial thermometers. For digital dial thermometers, you must be careful to pick one with a resolution of at least one tenth of a degree Celsius and a deviation plus or minus one tenth of a degree Celsius at most. Also try to get a thermometer with the least lag time.


Litmus paper is quite useful. pH meters are ideal, but they can be a pain to maintain. Once used, they must be stored with the probe submerged in acidic solution (vinegar works), and the probe cannot be allowed to run dry. For most things, litmus paper is a quicker and more hassle-free way of measuring pH. pH is relevant in almost every situation.

,
Sodium carbonate--sold as washing soda, closely related to baking soda.
Dilute acetic acid--distilled white vinegar is usually 5% acetic acid by volume. Some labels read ""5% acidity,"" which implies a volume percentage. Five percent by volume means five volumes of acetic acid in one hundred volumes of vinegar (not one hundred volumes of water).
Sodium chloride--table salt. Try to get Kosher salt, which usually has fewer additives. These are not too much of a concern however, because they are usually in trace concentrations.
Dilute ammonia--can be bought by name among cleaning supplies. Colorless ammonia is best. Concentrations of ammonia are usually measured in degrees baume, a rather annoying unit related to specific gravity (Wikipedia ""Ammonia""). Try to find a percent by mass labeled solution if possible.
Concentrated hydrochloric acid--depending on how much you need, hydrochloric acid can be obtained more reliably from a laboratory vendor or less reliably from a harder store under the archaic name ""muriatic acid."" These will vary in concentration from 32% to 40% by mass-to-volume percent. A 40% concentration means there are 40 grams (1.4 oz) of hydrochloric acid in 100 milliliters (3.4  fl oz) of the solution. Be very, very careful handling this solution. Hydrochloric acid is caustic, releases harmful fumes, and will corrode stainless steel easily. Never open the bottle in a cramped unventilated room.
Sodium hydroxide--this is best obtained from a laboratory vendor, but can be obtained, probably with trace additives, in lye or in Drano drain cleaner. Be careful with the solid or a solution of sodium hydroxide. It is also very caustic, dissolves glass over a long period of time, will make you blind if it gets in your eyes (another good reason to wear goggles at all times), and releases a lot of heat when it reacts with water or acids. Do not add the solid to strong acid solutions or you run the risk of slagging your glassware. It's happened before.
Ethanol--Ethanol is usually only a necessity if you intend to do organic reactions. It does have a few minor uses in inorganic chemistry, but it's definitely not a necessity for inorganic.
Graphite--the graphite in ""pencil lead"" is actually quite useful for Electro-chemistry experiments. It comes in a pretty good shape for inert electrodes.
Acetone--available in hardware stores or as 100% acetone nail polish remover. It dissolves a variety of organic compounds and evaporates quickly.

Interpret the reaction statement appropriately.,
Account for stoichiometric ratios.,
Learn about transition state molecules.",How to Study the Kinetics of Chemical Reactions1," Reaction statements describe the stoichiometry of the reaction. They can be used in two ways. Sometimes, the reaction statement simply denotes ratio of chemical species as a result of the reaction. If known, the reaction statement can represent the molecular changes that take place during the reaction, such as intermediate steps.A reaction without known intermediate molecules is known as an elementary reaction.;
, The study of stoichiometry focuses on relative amounts of chemicals as a reaction proceeds. You should be comfortable with this idea. The relative amounts of reactants and products will affect the rate that the reaction continues to a large extent.Acknowledge that reactions can proceed in the reverse direction (product back to reactants) under the right stoichiometric conditions. For example, there is too much product in the environment, so it begins to move back toward the original reactants.

, Transition states are molecules that form in the middle of a reaction. Understand that transition state molecules are highly unstable and usually break down in a fraction of a second. Work through the transition states of any reactions that have a known transition state to learn the mechanism of the reaction."
"
Use substitutes to track molecular interactions.,
Measure relative amounts of substrates.,
Introduce enzymes.",How to Study the Kinetics of Chemical Reactions2," Depending on the molecule, certain atoms or groups of atoms will be removed and substituted with something else. Most commonly, a hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. This allows researchers pinpoint the location of a particular part of the molecule that is of interest.


It is possible that different isotopes (such as deuterium for hydrogen) can change the rate of reaction., One way to tell how fast a reaction is going is to track the amount of reactants and products versus time. The faster the reactants are depleted (or products created), the faster the rate of reaction. The rate of a reaction determines how quickly the kinetic products are formed.These ratios are not necessarily linear. For example, doubling a substrate could cause the reaction to speed up four fold rather than just double.

, Enzymes are molecules that facilitate a reaction. Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of the reaction and allowing it to proceed at a faster rate. An enzyme will not increase the yield of the reaction, nor does the enzyme itself react in any way. Studying how a particular enzyme functions in a reaction can help you understand the mechanism of the reaction. Two common theories about enzyme function are:An enzyme is naturally the perfect shape for a substrate to bind to it.
Enzymes and substrates alter their shape to bind well.

Read the chapter ahead of class.,
Participate in class.,
Participate in labs.,
Do practice problems.",How to Study the Kinetics of Chemical Reactions3," The importance of viewing the material more than once cannot be overstated. Kinetics takes time and patience to understand, not to mention a strong foundation in math and general chemistry. This gives you time to make notes and form questions for anything that you don’t understand.If you are struggling with the mathematical concepts, you may need to refresh your algebra skills. You cannot study kinetics effectively without understanding the equations.

, You should keep in mind that your instructor’s job is to help you learn kinetics. Your job is to actively take notes and make an effort to understand the subject. You need to ask questions when you are struggling with kinetic concepts, and you should try to answer questions posed by your instructor. This will go a long way in helping you to grasp the kinetics of chemical reactions.Some instructors will give practice problems to be worked out on the board. Take this opportunity to work through problems with the class and instructor to help. Make sure that you understand why you are doing each step in the problem.

, Working through kinetic theories is crucial to understanding the subject. That said, seeing kinetic principles in action gives you perspective about how kinetic reactions actually proceed. Take an active role anytime labs or demonstrations are part of the class to gain a deeper understanding of kinetic processes.


One common kinetic demonstration is the iodine clock reaction. This reaction allows for a visual demonstration of kinetic concepts via a solution that changes color based on the reaction taking place.

, Kinetics problems can be a bit tedious. You may be solving for the rate of a reaction as a whole, the rate of consumption or production of a particular chemical species, or some other variable. To understand when and how to apply kinetic concepts, you need to do homework and practice problems after every class."

Identify the species for which you are writing the equation.,

Start your equation with this species on the left.
,

Identify the species that it is oxidised/reduced to.,

Identify if it is reduction or oxidation.,

Look at the conditions in which the reaction takes place.,

Balance the equation.,
Keep practising!",How to Write Half Equations," As an example, let's look at the permanganate ion.
,, In our example, permanganate in reduced to manganese ions. Place this species on the right of the equation., If it is reduction, you need to place electrons on the left of the equation. If oxidation, on the right. Permanganate is reduced so the electrons go on the left., Some reductions or oxidations take place under acidic or alkaline conditions. If acidic, you need to add hydrogen ions to the left. If alkaline, add hydroxide ions to the left. In these cases, you usually need to add water to the right as well. In the example, permanganate is reduced under acidic conditions. If you aren't told the conditions it reacts under, here's a rough guide:

If the initial species needs to lose oxygen to become the final species (as permanganate does to become manganese), it typically uses acidic conditions.
if the initial species needs to gain oxygens to become the final species (such as oxidising vanadium to vanadate), it typically requires alkaline conditions.
Otherwise, it probably doesn't require either acidic or alkaline conditions.

,

Balance any metals.
Balance any non-metals (except hydrogen and oxygen).
Balance oxygen.
Balance hydrogen.
Use the electrons to balance the charges.

, It does get a lot easier with practise, once you've got the hang of it. Try out these ones:

Dichromate (Cr2O7) reduced to chromium ions (Cr) under acidic conditions.
Nitrate (NO3) reduced to nitrogen monoxide (NO) under acidic conditions.
Copper (Cu) oxidised to copper ions (Cu)
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidised to oxygen (O2) under alkaline conditions.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduced to water (H2O) under acidic conditions.
Vanadium ions (V) oxidised to vanadate (VO4) under alkaline conditions.

Learn a little history first, to understand how recent the understandings in this field actually are.,
Study the next attempts made to understand how chemical bonds occur.,
Note that every chemical bond has two orbitals.,
Examine the principal chemical bonds.",How to Study the Nature of the Chemical Bond (Chemistry)," The understanding of the nature of the chemical bond is a relatively recent development that dates back only to several decades. Before the understanding of the chemical bond could be achieved, there was a need for the understanding of the nature of atomic structure, which was not completely understood at that time. By the development of quantum mechanics in general, and the Schroedinger equation in particular, the understanding of the atomic nature began to be more understood.


The complete solution of the Schroedinger equation of the hydrogen atom gave a complete description of its electronic energies and also gave a description of the radial and angular wave functions of this atom. This achievement paved the road to the understanding of the structure of more complicated atoms with more than one electron in its structure.
The solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom uncovered the existence of the electronic spin which is a very fundamental property to the description of the chemical bond. Also the principle of exclusion by Pauli led to the understanding that no more than two electrons with opposite spin could occupy the same orbital at the same time.
The functions of the hydrogen atom, as obtained from the solution of the Schroedinger equation for this atom, were used for a long period of time to describe the orbitals of many electrons atoms by giving the many electrons atom orbital functions that are hydrogen-like wave functions. The solution of the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom gave, as one of its many results, quantum numbers that designate the energy levels of the electronic levels in the atom. This is in addition to describing the various orbitals shape, energy and symmetry by other quantum numbers that are also used for other atoms. These quantum numbers also gave the amount of degeneracy of the orbital levels in the hydrogen atom. For example p orbital in the hydrogen atom is triply degenerate while d orbitals are five degenerate orbitals.;
, The next attempts were based on the quantum mechanical data that were obtained for the hydrogen atom. An orbital is a wave function that is obtained by the solution of the radial part of the Schroedinger equation of the hydrogen atom. This orbital describes the movement of the electrons that reside in it. This orbital can accommodate only two electrons with opposite spins of 1/2 and -1/2.


The attempts to explain the bonding nature in the hydrogen molecule were achieved relatively recently, in the early years of the 19th century. The driving force for the formation of the hydrogen molecule and any chemical bond in general can be obtained using the theory of molecular orbitals, which states that chemical bonds between atoms are driven by the favorable formation of a molecular orbital that is lower in energy than both atomic orbitals of the two separate atoms.

, One of them is bonding with positive overlap between the two overlapping orbitals. The other molecular orbital is anti-bonding with a nodal plane between the overlapping orbitals. The two electrons of the chemical bond occupy the bonding orbital which can explain the extra-stability of the formed molecule. Today it is known that only certain number of electrons in an atom can participate in the bonding process of making chemical bonds. These electrons are located in the outer electronic shell of the atom. The inner electrons do not participate in the bonding process.


These electrons that are located in the outer electronic shell of the atom are called the valence electrons and confer the reactivity characteristics of the atom. The octet rule of a closed valence shell was used qualitatively to rationalize why bonds form.

, There are several types of chemical bonds. These are: the covalent bond and the ionic bond, in addition to the dative bond and hydrogen bonding. The following descriptions explain each in turn:


The covalent bond can be fairly explained with the help of the molecular orbitals theory which states that the driving force for the formation of a chemical bond is the formation of a more stable molecule that has molecular orbital that is energetically lower than the atomic orbitals.
The ionic bond can be easily understood based on the octet rule in which the two atoms are happy with their closed shell electronic configuration. Ionic bonds are typical for atoms with completely different electro-negativity. This is in contrast to covalent bonds in which the participating atoms in the bond have similar electronegativities. Ionic bonds are an example of an electrostatic interaction between a positive and a negative charge. An example of an ionic bond occurs in the molecule of calcium phosphide. An example of a covalent bond occurs in the hydrogen molecule.
Dative bonds are the third type of chemical bonds and are typical of transition metals complexes which occur between a transition metal and ligands that can be neutral with electron lone pair or can bear a negative charge. In this type of bonding the d-orbitals of the metal are involved with sigma donor ligands.
The last type of chemical bonds is hydrogen bonding. It occurs mainly between molecules that bear a hydrogen atom that is bonded to an electronegative atom and an electron donor atom such as oxygen. An example of hydrogen bonding occurs in a solution of pure water. Hydrogen bonding makes the liquid that is involved have a high boiling point. Liquids that do not have hydrogen bonding between their molecules are low boiling liquids such as ethers.

Understand how thermodynamic systems are categorized.,
Study the role of thermodynamics.,
Study light.,
Note that one of the consequences of the fact that the speed of light is variable is the existence of a hypothetical mass that is associated with the photon particle.,
Realize that this is hypothetical.",How to Study the Phenomenon of Light As a Nonequilbirum State of Matter," Thermodynamic systems in nature are divided into two types. One is systems that are at equilibrium state with the environment and the other is systems that are in a state of nonequilibrium with the surroundings. On Earth, nature has a preference for systems that are at an equilibrium state with the surrounding. This is so due to the principle of minimum energy that every object in the universe aspires to have. All systems in the world with few exceptions tend toward minimizing their content of energy.


Examples of such systems are chemical reactions in the laboratory which usually reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium that is favored thermodynamically.;
, Thermodynamics plays here a major factor in determining whether a given system will be at equilibrium or non-equilibrium states. Examples of systems in nature that are in a state of non-equilibrium are the light phenomenon and gas and liquid systems that have gradients in their concentrations and gradients in temperature.


These systems are controlled by the phenomenon of diffusion that drives the system that is under nonequilibrium state into a state of equilibrium. Chemical gases and chemical liquids form part of these systems under nonequilibrium state. Diffusion and heat conduction of chemical systems are two classes of nonequilibrium states that are driven thermodynamically into a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In the case of nonequilibrium, the systems restore their thermodynamic stability after a short time.
Another example of a nonequilibrium process occurs in the biologic process that is known as osmosis. This biologic process can occur for example across the cellular membrane of all cells in the body. The tendency of this process to occur is driven by a thermodynamic force which tends to give the system a state of minimum energy. Also another biologic process which is also a nonequilibrium state is the active transport of ions across the cellular membrane of neurons and muscle cells in the body. In this case a state of thermodynamic nonequilibrium is maintained across the cellular membrane by the effect of ion channels and enzymes that catalyze the process of active transport. By virtue of its being in a nonequilibrium state this process is thermodynamically not favored so that it requires expenditure of energy in order to be maintained. The processes of osmosis and active transport across the cellular membranes are typical of living systems that are usually in a state of nonequilibrium with the environment. This state of nonequilibrium is only broken when the individual dies so that all systems of the body stop working. At this stage the molecules inside the body begin to analyzed by the bacteria into small molecules that can be used by the microorganisms for their nutritional processes.

, Light is another system that is existent in a state of nonequilibrium with the environment. Its continuous motion in a high speed as much as the light speed c is a cause of thermodynamic instability for this system that violates the the rules of nature that says: all systems in the world tend to release their energy content in favor of reaching a state of minimum energy and reach a state of thermodynamic stability. This process is never reached with light according to the theory of relativity, which assumes that light travels all the time at the same speed of c. This assumption was shown previously to be not correct; light is in essence a system that tends toward equilibrium state by slowing down its velocity.


The nature of this unique entity has yet to be explored in details after the finding that it does not have a constant velocity but rather a variable velocity that depends on the force the acts on it. One postulate about this entity is that it can have a certain form of life that is analogous to other systems that are under a state of nonequilibrium, such as living humans and animals.
The so far known information about this entity is that it can have wave as well as particle properties.

, This can be shown to be the case by solving the force equations for a photon system by substituting F =mdv/dt and equate it to F1(c/v) or Mdv/dt=F1(c/v). By solving this equation, one can get a value for the mass of the photon.


One of the results of applying this equation to photon systems is the obtaining of complex valued wavelength according to the traditional equation of photon energy that is expressed in term of the force F.

, It still remains to verify the existence of the hypothetical mass that is associated with the photon experimentally.

Identify a binary compound.,
Look up the two elements on a periodic table.,
Find the charge of each ion.,
Balance the charges.,
Write your answer as a chemical formula.,
Simplify if possible.",How to Write Ionic Compounds1," The simplest type of ionic compound is made from exactly two elements, one metal and one non-metal. Their name is always written as two element names, plus the -ide suffix attached to the second name.Examples of simple binary ionic compounds include potassium oxide and sodium phosphide.

If the ""-ide"" suffix doesn't follow a single element name, see instructions for polyatomic ions. For example, ""oxide"" is a simple oxygen ion, but ""hydroxide"" and ""peroxide"" are polyatomic.
;
, The first word of the name refers to the metal ion (the positively charged cation).You can find this element on the left side of the periodic table. The second word, ending in -ide, refers to a non-metal ion (the negatively charged anion). Find this on the right side of the periodic table .

For example, potassium oxide is a combination of potassium (chemical symbol K, atomic number 19) and oxygen (O, atomic number 8). Notice that the -ide ending is not part of the element name. You're just looking for an element with the same beginning (in this case ox-).


, In these simple compounds, it is easy to predict the charge of each ion. Each element in a particular column of the periodic table always forms an ion with the same charge:The Group 1 elements Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs gain a charge of 1+ (written simply as +).

The Group 2 elements Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba gain a charge of 2+.

The Group 13 element Al gains a charge of 3+.

The Group 15 elements N and P gain a charge of 3-.

The Group 16 elements O and S gain a charge of 2-.

The Group 17 elements F, Cl, Br, and I gain a charge of 1- (written as -).


, Electrical forces hold together ionic compounds, pulling the positive and negative ions together. Taken as a whole, the ionic compound is electrically neutral, meaning it has a total charge of zero. (If it had a different charge, it would pull in another atom.) Find the number of atoms of each element that combine to ""cancel out"" each other's charge and make a neutral compound.For example, potassium oxide is made up of potassium ions K+{\displaystyle K^{+}} and oxygen ions O2−{\displaystyle O^{2-}}. This means that two potassium ions (total charge 2+) balance out the charge of one oxygen ion (charge 2-).

Here's a shortcut: the first ion's charge (ignoring + or -) tells you the number of atoms of the second ion, and vice versa. For example, aluminum fluoride is made of Al3+{\displaystyle Al^{3+}} and F−{\displaystyle F^{-}} ions. The charge of Al3+{\displaystyle Al^{3+}} is three, so there are three F−{\displaystyle F^{-}} atoms. The charge of F−{\displaystyle F^{-}} is one, so there is one Al3+{\displaystyle Al^{3+}} atom.


, Write the two chemical symbols in the same order they appear in the compound's name (metal, then non-metal). After each chemical symbol, write the number of atoms as subscript (like this{\displaystyle _{like\ this}}). If there is exactly one atom of an element, you do not need a number. There is no need to write the charges.

For example, potassium oxide has two potassium atoms and one oxygen atom. The chemical formula is K2O{\displaystyle K_{2}O}.

Aluminum fluoride has one aluminum atom and three fluorine atoms. The chemical formula is AlF3{\displaystyle AlF_{3}}.


, Ionic compound formulas are always written with the minimum number of atoms required. If you could balance out the charges with fewer atoms, rewrite the formula. This is the same process as reducing fractions.

For example, barium sulfide is made of Ba2+{\displaystyle Ba^{2+}} and S2−{\displaystyle S^{2-}} ions. Using the shortcut above, the barium ion's charge (2) is equal to the number of sulfur ions, and the sulfur ion's charge (2) is equal to the number of barium ions. This gives us the formula Ba2S2{\displaystyle Ba_{2}S_{2}}. However, you don't need this many atoms to balance the charges. Write the two numbers as a fraction and simplify: 2 barium atoms2 sulfur atoms=11{\displaystyle {\frac {2\ barium\ atoms}{2\ sulfur\ atoms}}={\frac {1}{1}}}, so the correct formula is BaS{\displaystyle BaS}.

Find the Roman numeral in the compound name.,
Find the charge of the cation.,
Find the charge of the anion.,
Balance the charges.,
Write the chemical formula.",How to Write Ionic Compounds2," Most elements in the ""d-block"" of the periodic table (groups 3 through 12) are considered transition metals.Unlike other elements, they can form more than one type of ion. When a transition metal is part of an ionic compound, a Roman numeral is included to specify which ion is involved.For example, copper sometimes forms an ion with a charge of +1, and sometimes with a charge of +2. Copper (I) chloride and copper (II) chloride are two different ionic compounds. The Roman numeral tells you which copper ion is part of the compound.


, The first word of the compound name represents the metal ion, or cation. This is always positively charged. Just add the Roman numeral as a positive charge to the element name:

For example, copper (II) chloride includes the cation Cu2+{\displaystyle Cu^{2+}}, since II is the Roman numeral for 2.


, The second word of the compound name represent the anion. This is the negatively charged ions that form from non-metallic elements. Each element of this type only forms one ion. To find the charge of that ion, look it up in a textbook or chemistry website, or memorize the group rules above.

For example, chloride is the name for a chlorine ion. Chlorine, like similar group 17 elements, forms ions with a charge of negative one. This is written as Cl−{\displaystyle Cl^{-}}.


, This process is the same as for any ionic compound. The total positive charge from the cations always balances out the total negative charge from the anions. The net charge of the ionic compound is always zero.

To balance out the 2+ charge from a Cu2+{\displaystyle Cu^{2+}} ion, you need two Cl−{\displaystyle Cl^{-}} ions (two ions x -1 charge per ion = -2). This makes an ionic compound with a net charge of +2 -2 = 0.


, As always, the number of atoms is written as a subscript after the element name. You do not need to write the charges in the final formula:

Copper (II) chloride has one copper atom and two chlorine atoms. The formula is CuCl2{\displaystyle CuCl_{2}}.


"
"
Understand polyatomic ions.,
Look up the chemical formula for the polyatomic ion.,
Find the charge of the other ion.,
Balance the charges of the two ions.,
Write the formula.",How to Write Ionic Compounds3," Sometimes, more than one element can combine to form an ion, which can then bond with a different ion to form a compound. For example, OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is a polyatomic ion made from oxygen and hydrogen ions.Each polyatomic ion has its own special name. OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is called ""hydroxide.""


OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} is not an ionic compound, because it does not have a net charge of zero. It is a single ion, which can combine with ions of the opposite charge.

Some elements can form polyatomic ions by themselves. For example, ""peroxide"" is the O22−{\displaystyle O_{2}^{2-}} ion. It contains two oxygen atoms, but has a total charge of -2. (This is different than oxide, the ""standard"" oxygen ion, which has one atom with a charge of -2.)


, The second word in the ionic compound's name refers to the polyatomic ion. Look up this word (not the full compound name) to find the formula for this polyatomic ion. You can also memorize a few common polyatomic ions:Cyanide: CN−{\displaystyle CN^{-}} (One carbon, one nitrogen, total charge of -1)

Hydroxide: OH−{\displaystyle OH^{-}}.

Nitrate: NO3−{\displaystyle NO_{3}^{-}} (One nitrogen, three oxygen, total charge of -1)

Nitrite: NO2−{\displaystyle NO_{2}^{-}}

Peroxide: O22−{\displaystyle O_{2}^{2-}}

Sulfate: SO42−{\displaystyle SO_{4}^{2-}}

Sulfite: SO32−{\displaystyle SO_{3}^{2-}}


, The other ion in the compound is usually a simpler, one-atom ion. You can find its charge the same way you would in any problem.

For example, magnesium hydroxide contains a magnesium cation. Magnesium is a group 2 element that forms the ion Mg2+{\displaystyle Mg^{2+}}.


, All ionic compounds have a total net charge of zero. Find the minimum number of positive and negative ions that balance each other's charges perfectly. Remember that the polyatomic ion is a single ion, and cannot be divided into parts.

For example, to balance OH−1{\displaystyle OH^{-1}} and Mg2+{\displaystyle Mg^{2+}} , compare the charges. It takes two -1 charges to balance out one 2+ charge. This means there are two hydroxide ions and one magnesium ion.


, To show that there are multiply polyatomic ions, enclose that section of the formula in parentheses. Write the subscript showing the number of atoms after the close parenthesis.

For example, magnesium hydroxide has the chemical formula Mg(OH)2{\displaystyle Mg(OH)_{2}}.

You do not need to include the charges of the ions.

Learn the definition.,
Learn about its role in quantum mechanics.,
Consider that the solution of the Schroedinger equation for a harmonic oscillator is not straightforward such as its classical analogue.,
Note that this method of treating the bond between two atoms as a harmonic oscillator is a fairly good approximation that gives good theoretical results that are comparable to experimental results.,
Learn about the vibrational energy levels of a molecule.,
Learn about its uses.",How to Study the Harmonic Oscillator Phenomenon in Chemistry," Harmonic oscillations refer to a physical phenomenon in which an object of mass m is doing a periodic motion under the effect of a restoring force which tends to force the object to its original state of equilibrium. This phenomenon was originally formulated for classical mechanical systems such as the periodic motion of a pendulum.


This harmonic motion in classical mechanics is depicted mathematically using the following equation:

F=-kx where F is the force that is acting on the mass m and x is its displacement from its equilibrium state and k is a constant. The minus sign comes here to designate the fact that it is a restoring force to an equilibrium state.

;
, The classical mechanical phenomenon of the harmonic oscillator has similar representation in the theory of quantum mechanics. In the theory of quantum mechanics it finds use in the description of vibrational movement of bonds between atoms. The quantum mechanical description of a harmonic oscillator is much more difficult and complicated than its classical analogue.


The harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics is solved using the time independent Schroedinger equation which uses a potential in the form of V=1/2 kxx. This potential energy value for a harmonic oscillator is the classical value and is used in the Schroedinger equation to find the corresponding quantum mechanical value.

, The solution of this problem can be done in one of two ways:


One is to use the commutation relation of operators in order to find the eigen values of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator. For this purpose one uses special form of quantum mechanical operators that are called raising and lowering operators. These are convenient forms of operators that help much in the solution process of the problem.
The other method that is used to solve the problem of the harmonic oscillator is to solve a fairly complicated differential equation that involves a potential form that is difficult to handle mathematically. The differential equation for this system is not straight forward to solve and one must first find an asymptotic solution to the problem for large values of the displacement R. After that one uses a power series method in order to find a general solution of the problem.
The result in both of the suggested methods is that the energy eigen values that are obtained are:

E=h*(ni)(n+1/2). From this equation one gets an interesting result which is the ground state energy for a harmonic oscillator is not zero. This result is in accordance with principle of uncertainty.



, The vibrations of bonds between atoms are used to find the normal modes of a molecule. This is done in order to decide if the molecule will absorb light in the infra-red region of the spectrum or not. It is also used to decide if the molecule will absorb light in the Raman region of the spectrum. The wave functions of a harmonic oscillator have a complicated mathematical form that can be either odd or even. Within the vibrational levels of a diatomic molecule and other molecules there are rotational energy levels spread between each pair of adjacent vibrational levels.


Rotational energy levels of the diatomic molecule have higher wavelengths than that in the vibrational region of the energy levels of a molecule. Rotational spectrum is useful for giving information about bond distance and about rotational transitions in the molecule.

, They are located in the infra-red region of the light spectrum. The vibrational levels spectrum is important in giving information whether the molecule absorb light in the infra-red region and show IR spectrum or not. Also, the vibrational spectrum is important in certain types of lasers, such as the CO2 laser which is a typical laser that is based on transitions between vibrational levels.


The vibrational energy levels of a molecule are located between electronic energy levels. Between two typical electronic energy levels there are several vibrational energy levels. The electronic energy levels are spaced more energetically than both the vibrational and the rotational energy levels.
The electronic energy levels are more significant that both vibrational and rotational energy levels due to the existence of electronic transitions in these energy levels which is important for the formation and breaking of chemical bonds.

, The harmonic oscillator on the atomic level finds use in solid state chemistry in which the atomic vibrations in the solid are treated as harmonic oscillators. Approximating the movement of atoms in a solid material using the harmonic oscillator approximation is a good approximation that can give information about the solid itself. Finally, in certain types of liquids which are called quantum liquids the atoms of such a material are sometimes treated as harmonic oscillators such as the molecules of the superfluid helium.

Identify primary explosives.,
Understand secondary explosives.,
Differentiate between high and low explosives.,
Learn about nuclear explosives.",How to Study the Chemistry of Explosives1," Primary explosives are broadly defined as explosives that will detonate without an explosion to start the reaction. This basically means that primary explosives are the most easily detonated class. This class of explosives is highly sensitive to temperature changes, electrical current, or changes in force or pressure acting on the compound. They are used for making things like fireworks and blasting caps.For example, nitroglycerine can be set off just by shaking or dropping a bottle of it. This makes it very dangerous to handle.
Blasting caps are explosive devices that are utilized to set off another explosive device.;
, Secondary explosives consist of compounds that are much more stable than primary explosives. This means that they will not be ignited easily if jarred, heated, or shocked. Instead, secondary explosives are detonated using a primary explosive (e.g. a blasting cap) to start the reaction.Dynamite is an example of a secondary explosive.
Another tier of explosives, tertiary explosives, require the detonation of a primary explosive, followed by a secondary explosive to ignite. These are typically used in industries like mining and have the benefit of being very stable and safe to transport (e.g. ammonium nitrate/fuel oil mixture, ANFO).

, High and low refer to the velocity of the combustion. Low explosives burn only the surface layer of compound, though they burn very quickly (gunpowder is a low explosive). When dealing with compounds classified as high explosives, the entire mass will detonate practically simultaneously (within a few milliseconds). Low explosives are ideal for use as propellants, while high explosives are used in construction, mining, and for military purposes.There may be other uses for either type of explosive.
Another differentiation between high and low explosives is the need for pressure. Low explosives will only explode when the combustion reaction is contained and builds pressure. High explosives will explode regardless of their container (or lack of).

, While many low explosive and high explosive chemicals have weaved their way in and out of human history being refined and repurposed, the twentieth century gave birth a new class of explosive device. Nuclear explosions are created when the nucleus of an atom is split by high speed particles. The fragments of that atom then hit the nucleus of other atoms creating a chain reaction that releases a tremendous amount of atomic energy. This technology has been used to generate electricity and create the deadliest class of weapons known to mankind."
"
Learn about the process of combustion.,
Demonstrate the effect of expanding gasses.,
Conceptualize activation barriers.",How to Study the Chemistry of Explosives2," Combustion is a chemical process by which hydrocarbons and oxygen react to release energy and form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). This is commonly known as “burning.” For example, when you light a piece of wood on fire, the hydrocarbon chains in the wood are reacting with oxygen (or oxidizing) at a rapid rate. The reaction is exothermic (gives off energy), and energy is released in the form of heat and light (the flame). This process is the same process that low explosives undergo to detonate.For example, think about what happens when you ignite gunpowder. The spark provides the energy needed to start the reaction, and then the carbon is oxidized. The rapid formation of gas (CO2 and H2O) propels the bullet from the gun.

, Low explosives create an explosion rapidly converting a solid or liquid to a gas via combustion. Generally, gases expand (increase their volume) more than a liquid or solid. Since they are contained and the volume cannot be increased, the pressure inside the container builds. When the container can no longer hold the pressure, all of the gas comes rushing out at once, creating an explosion.You can safely observe the effect of expanding and contracting gases with a balloon.
Most explosives use molecules that form gas when they break down. TNT, for example produces large amounts of nitrogen gas when the intermolecular bonds are broken.
Electron withdrawing molecules (usually nitrogen or oxygen) are often bonded to each other in unstable ways. This makes the explosive material prone to breaking those bonds in favor of forming a gas (O2 or N2 for example)., Put simply, an activation barrier is the amount of energy that must be put into a chemical system before that system will react. Primary explosives have a low activation barrier (you can set some of them off with an accidental bump). Secondary explosives have a high activation barrier (it requires an explosion to even start the reaction). Low explosives also tend to have a low activation barrier (susceptibility to heat) while high explosives can have a low activation barrier in some cases (think nitroglycerine) and a high activation barrier in other cases (think C-4).Compounds with high activation barriers can be mixed with other compounds to reduce the activation barrier. For example, thermite must reach approximately 2,000 °F (1,090 °C) to ignite, but military grade thermite (TH3) contains additives that lowers the ignition temperature."
"
Imagine an explosion that required no chemical reaction.,
Think about the effect of the container.,
Contemplate other factors that would affect mechanical explosions.",How to Study the Chemistry of Explosives3," A mechanical explosion takes place without the need for a chemical reaction. In this case, the pressure inside of a container builds due to the physical properties its fluid (liquid or gas) contents and the environment that the container is exposed to. When the pressure exceeds what the container can hold, the container is broken and the fluid inside expands rapidly, causing an explosion.A tire blowing out is an example of a mechanical explosion.

, In the case of mechanical explosion, the strength of the container will play a significant role in the strength of the explosion. Typically, the more pressure that the container can hold, the larger the explosion will be when it fails. Also, the condition of the container will affect how easily it will fail. A damaged container will fail faster than one in good condition. Other properties of the container can change how quickly the pressure will build in a given situation.For example, a container that conducts heat readily will allow a fluid to expand faster than one that insulates the fluid.
Keeping with the example of a blown tire, a worn out tire is much more likely to have a blowout than a new tire.

, Aside from the container’s properties, the properties of the fluid itself will affect whether or not an explosion happens. First off, the amount of fluid present in the container is an important factor. Another important factor is the temperature of the fluid inside, and how much energy it takes to increase that temperature.If the fluid only fills 50% of the container, it has plenty of room to expand. In contrast, a container that is 90% full leaves little room for expansion.
Pressure is directly related to temperature. The as the temperature of a fluid increases (and the volume remains the same) the pressure will also increase.

Conceptualize the chemical formula of water.,
Think about how water molecules fit together.,
Learn the bent structure of a single water molecule.,
Read about polar solvents.,
Brush up on acid-base chemistry.",How to Study the Chemistry of Water1," Knowing what the chemical formula H2O actually means is important. It means that you need two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom to come together to make a water molecule. It also means that if you break apart a water molecule, you will get two hydrogens and one oxygen.Splitting water is often done with electricity in a process known as electrolysis.
Plants also split water to carry out photosynthesis.;
, The oxygen and hydrogens of a single water molecule are covalently bonded. That is to say that they share electrons. However, water molecules also experience intermolecular forces. The most important intermolecular force for water is the hydrogen bond. These bonds allow the hydrogens of one molecule to interact with the oxygen of another.Research suggests that one water molecule is likely to form hydrogen bonds with two others.

, Every chemical has a particular geometric shape. Water is no exception here. Each water molecule has what is referred to as a bent structure. The two hydrogens are forced closer than 180 degrees to each other because the oxygen has extra electrons that alter the shape.These unbonded electrons are known as “lone pair electrons.”

, Since oxygen holds electrons more effectively than hydrogen, they are not shared evenly. This creates a negative end (at the oxygen) and a positive end (at the hydrogens) on the water molecule. Molecules with a positive and negative pole are known as a polar molecules and they interact well with other polar molecules. This is why water is a great solvent for alcohol (a polar liquid), but a poor solvent for vegetable oil (a nonpolar liquid). , Water is amphoteric. This means that it can be either an acid or a base and will act differently depending on the environment. In acid environments, water displays basic properties (accepts protons). In a basic environment, water will act as an acid (donates protons)."
"
Know that water can be found in three states naturally.,
Consider the expansion of ice.,
Familiarize yourself with basic fluid properties.,
Don't underestimate the importance of water to life as we know it.",How to Study the Chemistry of Water2," Water is the only known compound that can be found as a solid, liquid, and gas under the earth’s natural conditions. This allows for the circulation of water around our planet via the water cycle. Liquid water can evaporate and rise, water vapor can condense and fall back to earth, and water accumulates as ice in the coldest parts of our planet (the polar ice caps)., Most liquids become denser (their volume shrinks) when they freeze into a solid form. Water is an exception. When water freezes, it expands. This allows frozen water (ice) to float on top of liquid water.This is also why a bottle of water (or other drink primarily made of water) will often burst if left in the freezer.

, As a solid, water has a fixed crystal shape. Most of the time, though, we think of water in its liquid form. Fluids (liquids and gases) have no defined shape and will conform to fit the shape of their vessel. The main difference between the shape of a liquid and a gas is that gases expand to fill the entire container and liquids are held closer together by intermolecular forces., Roughly seventy percent of the earth is covered in water. Water makes up more than half of the human body, and some organisms are as much as ninety percent water. There is no known organism that can survive without water."
"
Demonstrate the polarity of water.,
Evaporate water from a dish.,
Condense water on a surface.,
Expand water by freezing it.",How to Study the Chemistry of Water3," Since water molecules have a positive and negative end, they are considered polar. You can show this polarity by moving a magnet (or other source of electromagnetic field) toward the water running out of a faucet. The water will bend in response to the magnet because the charged ends of the water will repel against the magnetic field or bend toward it., Fill a cup or dish nearly full with water. Mark the water level so that you remember how much water you start with. Place the water in front of a sunny window and leave it there for several hours. Come back periodically and check the water level. Mark the new level each time.You will notice the water getting lower and lower. This is because some of the water gets warm enough to leave in the form of water vapor. This is known as evaporation.

, Put hot water into a cup and cover the cup with a lid. Place an ice cube on the lid. As the hot water evaporates, the vapor will come in contact with the cold lid and condense. This will allow small water droplets to form on the lid.A clear or transparent lid will allow you to see the droplets best.

, Fill a plastic bottle with water. Cover the bottle with aluminum foil and place it carefully in the freezer. When the water has frozen, take the bottle out and observe the results.You will notice that the water expanded up and out of the bottle, freezing onto the foil as well.
Avoid using a cap. This could cause the water to burst the bottle when freezing.

Understand where potassium ions are located.,
Locate potassium on the periodic table.,
Study the potassium compounds.,
Learn which reactions potassium can be used in.,
Study the effects of potassium as a soft metal.",How to Study the Element Potassium," Potassium ions are found predominantly inside the cell, while very low concentrations of it are found outside the cell. This is in contrast to sodium which is found predominantly outside the cell, while a very low concentration of sodium is found inside the cell. The driving force for this high energy process is driven by enzymes that are called ATPase.


Potassium channel blockers are used clinically in order to induce a state of continuous neurons firing and continuous muscle contraction.;
, Potassium is located below sodium in the periodic table. It is more reactive than sodium. Potassium has a similar outer electronic configuration as sodium. It has the electronic configuration of argon with an additional 4s orbital electron. 4s electron being more diffuse and energetically higher than the 3s orbital electron of sodium. The additional 4s electron in potassium makes it extremely electro positive.


It gives this electron easily and exothermically to any electron acceptor such as Lewis acids.
Potassium like all alkali metals crystallizes in a body centered cubic crystal. It has a low melting point.

, Potassium has many important compounds such as KO2 which is used in breathing machines. Another compound of potassium is KNO3. It is a strong oxidizing compound that is used in gunpowder and pyrotechnics. This is also in addition to its use as a fertilizer. KClO3 is another compound of potassium that is used in the matches industry.


One of the many compounds of potassium is KCl. This compound is used in pharmaceuticals as a substitute to eating salt (NaCl) in patients with hypertension. Sodium is known to induce hypertension so KCl gives the taste of eating salt without triggering hypertension.

, Potassium can be used in all the reactions of sodium, except that all its reactions are more exothermic. It can be used in ammonia solutions to generate solvated electrons. These solvated electrons are excellent reducers. They can be used in the Birch reduction of benzene. It can also be used to reduce triple bonds to double bonds. The reduction of triple bonds with solvated electrons differs from the reduction with molecular hydrogen in that the solvated electrons generate trans alkenes while the hydrogen reduction gives cis-alkene.


Potassium reacts vigorously with water to give potassium oxide and hydrogen according to the following equation:

K + H2O-> K2O + H2


Due to the large size of potassium ions, it is not easily solvated in organic solvents. Therefore methods have been developed to solvate potassium ions. These methods include crown ether's with varying number of oxygen atoms. These crown ether's are capable of dissolving potassium ions as well as other alkali metal ions.
Potassium as well as other alkali metals reacts with alkyl halides to generate alkyl potassium. The difference between the starting material and the product being an electrophile was converted into a nucleophile ( the alkyl potassium).

, As a soft metal, potassium has the electronic configuration of argon with an additional electron in the 4s orbital. The ionization energy of the 4s electron of potassium is lower than that of the 3s electron of sodium. This is so due to the higher energy of the 4s electron. Its melting point is 63.7 °C (146.7 °F) which is lower than that of sodium. Its density is also lower than that of sodium.


Its boiling point is 759 °C (1,398 °F) which is lower than that of sodium. Its density is lower than that of sodium.

Use visualization techniques to remember elements.,
Make up acronyms or acrostics to remember chunks of the periodic table.,
Employ brute force repetition.",How to Study the Elements of the Periodic Table1," Your brain is designed to remember visuals more effectively than written or spoken words. Use this to your advantage by creating mental visualizations to go with each element. Then, you can create a storyline that likes each picture together in the order that you need to remember them. This is the most effective memorization technique.For example, you might drop your bottle of hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen), causing you to yell in a squeaky voice (helium makes your voice squeaky), right as it lands on a pack of batteries (lithium ion batteries to be exact).;
, This is less effective than visual imagery, but can work better than brute force repetition. While acrostics are much easier to create for the elements, acronyms can be done, too. This will provide a que for several elements in one word or phrase.An acrostic for nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and neon might be something like No Openings For Ned. The first one or two letters of each word represent an element (N, O, F, Ne).
An acronym for the same four elements would be No fee (pronounced noff-nee).
A similar approach to acronyms and acrostics is to make a song that includes the names of the elements. This can be a little more effective, but is also more time consuming.

, This method is least effective overall, and requires an intense amount of study time. It is best if the study time is broken up into smaller sessions. You will need to memorize small chunks of the table at one time and constantly review them while moving on to other chunks.If you choose this way, notecards are your best friend. For example, you could make a set of notecards for every element on the periodic table. Likewise, you could make a set of notecards that lists every family or group (column) and include the elements within each group on the card. To get the most out of the table, you could make several sets of notecards, such as the two mentioned, that organize the information in different ways.

Know the direction of increasing atomic mass.,
Think about outer shell electrons.,
Consider how tightly an atom holds its electrons.,
Understand metallic and nonmetallic properties.,
Read the information in each block.",How to Study the Elements of the Periodic Table2," Atomic mass (the amount of matter in your atom) increases as you go to the right across a row, or down a column. The periodic table is ordered in such a way that each element has one proton more than the element before it, and the mass is the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom. Electrons are negligible when calculating mass because they possess so little in comparison to the larger particles., The inner shells of an atom’s electrons are full and stable. For the most part, they contribute little to the way the atom reacts. The largest factor in how an atom reacts is the makeup of its outer shell electrons. The periodic table naturally groups together elements with similar outer shells (Transition metals, halogens, etc.)., For a number of reasons, an electron closer to the nucleus of an atom will generally be held tighter than an electron further out. Because of this, electronegativity (ability to accept and keep electrons) increases as you go to the the right of a row and the top of a column. The noble gases (the column furthest to the right) are typically inert and do not accept or donate electrons.For example fluorine is will more effectively gain electrons than bromine, even though they are both halogens.

, The periodic table also groups elements into metals, non-metals, and metallic categories. Metals are usually shiny solids at room temperature, conduct well, and are malleable. Non-metals are usually dull in appearance, may be solid, gas, or liquid at room temperature, conduct poorly, and are not malleable. Metalloids share properties of metals and non-metals.There are also different groups of metals (alkali metals, transition metals, etc.).

, Each block of the periodic table contains the atomic symbol if one of the elements. There is also a lot of information about the element in that block including things like mass number and average atomic weight. Learn to Read the Periodic Table well, and you will be on your way to understanding the elements it contains.

Take practice tests.,
Reward yourself for knowing your notecards.,
Use online games.",How to Study the Elements of the Periodic Table3," Quiz yourself relentlessly on the periodic table. Practice tests are among the most effective study habits because they force your brain to recall the information that you have committed to memory. You can search for practice tests online, or print off versions of the periodic table that need some parts filled in.You can also write your own practice test questions or make your own tables. This takes more time, but you will be thinking even more about the periodic table by formulating the test. Just be sure to ask questions that you don’t know, too!

, You can play fun games with yourself by rewarding yourself each time you get a notecard correct. It does not have to be a big reward to be fun. Even just a piece of candy for each correct answer can break up the boredom of studying. You can also give yourself bigger rewards for getting bigger chunks of information correct.

, There are several educational games online. Go to Google and type in “periodic table games and activities” and you will find an array of free games that help you learn the periodic table. Choose one you like and start playing.

Make and keep a study schedule.,
Know what kind of learning style you have.,
Spread out your studying.,
Spend time studying in a group.,
Get enough sleep every night.,
Use unique scents to activate your memory.",How to Study the Elements of the Periodic Table4," A solid study schedule is a good way to make sure that you are spreading out your study time. It will help you remain disciplined in your studies and keep you motivated on days that you are less than excited to look at the periodic table again. While there’s no set rule on how much time it will take you to learn about the elements on the table, you should expect to set aside about two hours of study time for every hour of class time dedicated to the periodic table., There are many different ways to expose yourself to new material, and most people prefer one or two over the others. In the classroom, the instructor often dictates how material will be presented. However, during your study time, you should strive to present yourself with material in the way that you learn it best. The different learning types are:Visual - You prefer to include pictures, images, videos, etc.
Auditory - You like hearing information and/or integrating music and sounds.
Linguistic - You learn information when it is in the form of language (written or spoken).
Kinesthetic - You are a “hands on” learner. Movement and physical touch help you retain information.
Mathematical - You rely on systems of logic to learn.
Interpersonal - Most of your learning occurs in a group setting.
Intrapersonal - Learning alone suits you best.

, Research shows that cramming does not work. You will retain much more information with the same amount of study time if you spread it out over the course of days or weeks. Divide the periodic table into easy to conquer goals and learn it slowly over time. You should also take a study break every forty-five minutes or so to let your brain rest.Be sure that you go back and review material that you have already learned from time to time. If you keep moving on to new material without reviewing the old, you are likely to forget some important details.
This can be a great way to use your notecards. Keep them handy, and when you find yourself with a few minutes to kill in a waiting room or between classes, pull them out and put that time to use.

, Even if you prefer to study alone, you can benefit from a little bit of group study. This is where you will see different points of view on the same material and expand your understanding of the periodic table. Other students may notice trends that you weren’t familiar with, or they might have unique ways of learning the elements. Be sure that you contribute your ideas and knowledge to the group as well.Another way that you can utilize social learning is to teach someone else about the periodic table. As you teach them, you will become more familiar and comfortable with the table yourself.
If you are struggling with learning the periodic table, you can also consider finding a private tutor.
Sometimes the class will move on and you will simply be given the assignment to learn certain parts of the periodic table.

, The periodic table is full of vast amounts of information on chemical elements, groups, and recurring trends that are found in similar elements. This can be a lot of information to commit to memory, and information is best organized and retained in your brain during sleep. Staying rested by getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night will do wonders for your study results., Your brain’s memory system is closely tied to your olfactory sense (sense of smell). You can use this to your advantage by studying in the presence of a unique (ideally inoffensive) smell. If you then take an exam in the presence of the same smell, it will spur your brain to pull of the information from your study sessions.A good example would be to eat peppermints while you are studying the periodic table, and then eat the same peppermints during the exam. Be careful to only use this for one subject at a time, if you eat peppermints all day then it won’t form an association specifically to the periodic table.

Think about the structure of an atom.,
Know that electrons reside in different levels.,
Remember that electrons have different orbital patterns.",How to Study the Chemical Theory of Valence Bonds1," Atoms are made up of protons (positively charged particles), neutrons (particles with no charge), and electrons (negatively charged particles). Protons and neutrons make up the mass of the atom and rest at the center of the atom. Electrons are so small that their mass is negligible, and they orbit around the center of the atom., Electrons do not orbit the nucleus randomly. Instead, they remain in orbitals that reside at specific distances from the nucleus (this distance varies by atom). Orbitals closer to the nucleus are considered low orbitals and those further away are high orbitals. The more energy an electron has, the higher orbital state it will occupy.Electrons are most stable in the lowest possible energy state.

, When conceptualizing the electron cloud (the space in which electrons can be found), many people naturally envision a sphere around the nucleus. While some orbitals are spherical (s orbitals), others are shaped like dumbbells with the nucleus in the center (p orbitals). These different shapes are important to the concept of valence bonds, and must be taken into account when you analyze the bonds between two atoms.There are also d orbitals and f orbitals that have more complex geometry.

Research the use of ammonia in farming.,
Familiarize yourself with named reactions of ammonia.,
Consider how ammonia affects fermentation.",How to Study the Chemical Reactions of Ammonia1," Nitrogen is essential to the growth of plants. You can mix ammonia in the soil to be metabolized by bacteria present in the soil. The resulting compounds are nitrite (NO2) and nitrate (NO3). These compounds can be readily used by the plants for growth.To learn more about the amount of ammonia in your soil, extract the nitrogen compounds from the soil in a lab test. Put your sample in an oven (~850 degrees Celsius) and add plenty of oxygen. The oxygen at this temperature, nitrogen compounds will combust, resulting in gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx). The gasses can be collected for analysis, and the amount of nitrogen in your soil sample can be determined by how many NOx gases are present.;
, Ammonia has many uses, and some of the more specific reactions are named. The synthesis of nitric acid is referred to as the Ostwald process, and involves combining ammonia with excess oxygen under conditions that yield nitrogen dioxide. The NO2 is then bubbled through water, which absorbs the gas and converts it to nitric acid. The Solvay process bubbles carbon dioxide through a solution of saltwater and ammonia to make sodium carbonate (soda ash). The list goes on, and these specific reactions got their own names because they met a certain need using the ammonia compound., During the fermentation of wine, ammonia exists in the form of the ammonium ion (NH4+). This compound is utilized by yeast for to produce amino acids and other cellular materials. Without the nitrogen, the yeast would not be able to reproduce and convert the sugar in the grapes to ethanol."
"
Picture single bonds.,
Imagine a bond outside the internuclear axis.,
Superimpose the orbitals.",How to Study the Chemical Theory of Valence Bonds2," Single bonds, or sigma (𝝈) bonds, are the result of two s orbitals overlapping. Electrons are shared in the overlap region, and this region can be found between the two nuclei. For this reason, the area is referred to as the internuclear axis.Sigma bonds overlap head-on. This means they have the most effective overlap, and thus form the strongest bond.

, While sigma bonds all reside between the nuclei of two atoms, p orbitals form a different kind of bond. Because of the shape of a p orbital, it forms what is known as a pi (𝝅) bond. The pi bond exists above and below the nuclei of the atoms, and therefore, is outside of the internuclear axis.P orbitals do not overlap as well as s orbitals, so pi bonds are easier to break (weaker) than sigma bonds.
Above and below the nuclei is the accepted orientation for the first pi bond. However, it is possible to have another pi bond that is perpendicular to the first. This bond would be considered to reside on either side of the nuclei.

, To visualize these different bonds, you have to superimpose the orbital of one atom on the orbital of the other. To visualize pi bonds, imagine two dumbbells being pushed together. The tops and bottoms would touch, but the centers would not. Sigma bonds can be compared to two balls being forced together. They meet head on and the bond resides in the internuclear axis, which could be compared to the space between the centers of the two balls."
"
Consider the charge of electrons.,
Factor in lone pairs.,
Hybridize orbitals.",How to Study the Chemical Theory of Valence Bonds3," Electrons are attracted to the nucleus at the center of the atom because it is positive and they are negative. That also means that electrons are repelled by each other. An atom is at its lowest energy state (most stable) when the electrons are as far from each other as possible. This makes the geometry of electron orbitals very important to the valence bond model.Common types of geometry for atomic orbitals are linear, bent, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, and octahedral.

, Lone pair electrons are valence electrons in an atom that do not bond with another atom. Since they are not bonding with other atoms and being pulled outward by other nuclei, the lone pairs orbit closer to the center of the atom. This exerts slightly more repulsive force on the other electrons, and alters the shape of the atom or molecule.For example, water could be expected to be linear (H-O-H), but the oxygen has lone pair electrons that interact with the shape of the molecule. This pushes the hydrogens closer together than they would be otherwise, and gives the molecule a bent geometry.

, In some cases, an atom’s bonding is not accurately predicted by the s and p orbitals it possesses. When this happens, valence bond theory suggests that the orbitals of the atom have been hybridized. In short, that’s a way of saying that some s and p orbitals merged together to form orbitals that share characteristics of both. This phenomenon helps to predict the shape and bonding activity of some atoms.For example, carbon is sp3 hybridized (1 s and 3 p orbitals merged). This allows the orbitals to spread out optimally and reduce electron-electron repulsion. It also allows the carbon atom to form four bonds.

Come to class prepared.,
Pay attention to the class.,
Work hard in lab.,
Study regularly.",How to Study the Chemical Theory of Valence Bonds4," If you are just starting your first chemistry class, be warned that they are not for the faint of heart. You should read the chapter ahead of time and take notes on what you read. This will help you identify any questions you have about the valence bond theory in advance., Chemistry students are rarely successful at memorizing everything needed to do well with the valence bond theory. Instead, engage in the class and practice thinking in a scientific way. You should also take notes in the class so that you remember the important points that are covered pertaining to the valence electrons and bonding., Lab classes are a critical part of understanding chemistry. They provide a hands on application for many of the concepts that you will see in the text book. It is important to come to lab prepared, and to follow all safety precautions. This is where you can see some of the chemical reactions predicted by valence bond theory in action., Cramming the night before a chemistry exam is rarely successful, and always miserable. Instead, set aside an hour or two after every class to review the material covered in the class and refresh yourself on older material. This will help you stay focused and confident in your chemistry class.

Know how ammonia acts in water.,
Understand the stability of the ammonia molecule.,
Consider ammonia under basic or acidic conditions.,
Study the reactions of ammonia with halogens.,
Remember redox reactions.",How to Study the Chemical Reactions of Ammonia2," In water, ammonia acts as a proton acceptor, or Lewis base. This means that it readily takes a hydrogen molecule from the water to form NH3+. This forms OH molecules, and raises the pH of the solution.The high solubility of ammonia can be shown experimentally by turning a tube of gaseous ammonia upside-down in water. As the ammonia dissolves into the water, the water level will rise in the tube., Ammonia is stable under most conditions. It can tolerate being exposed to light or heat. Though ammonia is caustic, it will not corrode mild or stainless steel or glass, but it will damage galvanized steel, copper, zinc, and some other metals.Ammonia can form explosive compounds with some metals. Silver and mercury should not be exposed to ammonia for this reason.

, Ammonia readily reacts with acids to form salts. This includes strong acids, weak acids, and Lewis acids (proton donors). Because of its ability to react with acids, ammonia does not allow strongly acidic solutions. It does, however, dissolve some bases to create strongly basic solutions.Ammonium sulfate can be readily made in a lab. Mix sulfuric acid and ammonia together, boil gently, and pour into an evaporating dish. As the water evaporates, ammonium sulfate crystals will precipitate onto the evaporating dish.Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive. Wear goggles, gloves, and protective clothing. Do not inhale sulfuric acid or ammonia fumes.

, Ammonia reacts to halogens very violently.This results in a type of reaction called ammonolysis. In these reactions, at least one of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by another type of atom. Though ammonolysis is very common between ammonia and halogens, it isn’t limited to halogens. Other compounds can replace a hydrogen as well.You can observe a safe version of this by soaking a cotton wad in ammonia and a second cotton wad in hydrogen chloride. Put the wads in opposite ends of a glass tube, and for a ring of white powder to appear. This powder is ammonium chloride., Oxidation-reduction (or redox) reactions also occur with ammonia. Most notably, ammonia will burn in the presence of oxygen gas to produce H2O and N2 (nitrogen gas). Ammonia can also be used to reduce the oxidation of hot metals, such as cupric oxide, to a non (or less) oxidized state.To demonstrate ammonia’s potential for redox reactions, you can ignite a ammonium dichromate(VI) and watch the reaction. Be careful to do this in a fume hood, on a heat proof surface."

Understand that a catalyst is needed to speed the reaction.,
Consider the effects of heat on the synthesis reaction.,
Contemplate how pressure will change the reaction.,
Study the extraction technique for ammonia produced.",How to Study the Chemical Reactions of Ammonia3," Consider the chemical equation of ammonia, NH3. You can tell from this equation that one nitrogen molecule must bond to three hydrogen molecules to form the compound. This process is started by introducing a ratio of three hydrogen to one nitrogen into a chemical reactor that contains a catalyst., You should first know that the catalyst does not directly react with the reactants. Think of it as a way to speed up the reaction that would happen anyway. In the formation of ammonia, the catalyst is an iron compound that contains potassium hydroxide. You should note that using the catalyst will only speed up the rate of the reaction, and will not increase the overall percentage of ammonia that is formed in the end., Understand that temperature is a double-edged sword in ammonia production. You can lower temperatures to get the best conversion of N and H into NH3. The downside is that by lowering temperatures, you also slow down the reaction. Most ammonia manufacturers use a temperature between 400 - 450 degrees celsius.Le Chatelier’s Principle governs how heat will affect the shift of N and H to NH3.

, You can also alter the conversion of N and H to NH3 with changes in pressure. If you use a higher pressure, you will bring the molecules closer together and promote the reaction that forms ammonia. Creating extremely high pressures is expensive (you have to buy the equipment to generate the pressure and contain it), so a middle ground is often sought to produce ammonia in a cost effective way. Most manufacturers use a moderately high pressure of around 200 atmospheres., Once you have successfully produced ammonia, it will be amongst other gasses (specifically nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas) at a high temperature and pressure. Luckily, you can liquify ammonia more readily than nitrogen or hydrogen. You should cool the gasses to around -30 degrees Fahrenheit to allow the ammonia to precipitate out as a liquid. The remaining gases are recycled through the reaction chamber to make more ammonia."

Locate the transition metals on the periodic table.,
Define transition metals.,
Memorize that transition metals have variable oxidation states.,
Know that transition metals can paramagnetic or diamagnetic.,
Learn the alloys that transition metals can form.,
Identify transition metal compounds based on their color.",How to Study the Chemical Properties of Transition Metals1," The transition metals are a set of 38 elements located in groups three through twelve (sometimes written as Group IIA and Group IIB) on the periodic table. These metals are further subdivided into three groups based on the row of the periodic table they are located.The most commonly studied transition metals are the first row transition metals. They begin on the left side with scandium and end on the right side with zinc.;
, A transition metal is any metal that forms one or more stable ions with an incompletely filled d orbital.The d orbital is part of the third energy level of the electron distribution in an atom. There are five d orbitals with each one capable of holding two electrons for a total of ten electrons in the d orbital.Based on this definition, the zinc group (zinc, cadmium, and mercury) technically doesn’t count as transition metals because they possess a filled d-level. Ask your teacher or professor more about this group of elements because they are often still considered transition metals.
In addition, scandium is sometimes excluded because it has no d-electrons.

, The oxidation state of an atom shows how many electrons have been removed (positive oxidation state) or added (negative oxidation state) to the atom.Unlike other elements, such as those in the s-block, which can only form oxidation states of +1 or +2, transition metals can form multiple oxidation states. This is because these elements have low ionization potentials which tends to give them a number of unique chemical properties:They tend to form alloy complexes with themselves and other elements.
They tend to be similarly sized atoms because the electrons are in similar environments.
They form colored compounds.
They are useful as catalysts for reactions.
They are less reactive than the alkali metals.

, A paramagnetic atom is attracted by a magnetic field while a diamagnetic atom is not attracted by the magnetic field. Transition elements that have one or more unpaired electrons in the d-suborbital will be paramagnetic. Elements that have paired d-suborbital electrons are diamagnetic.Remember, when electrons are filling orbitals they will fill one electron per suborbital before they go back and fill in the rest of the suborbital with the second electron.

, An alloy is a compound that forms when a metal and at least one other metallic or non-metallic element mix together. Some common transition metal alloys are steel (iron and carbon), stainless steel (chromium, iron, sometimes nickel), brass (copper and zinc), and nitinol (titanium and nickel).There are many more compounds that transition metals form, but the ones listed above are some of the most common.

, Because transition metals generally have color, you can identify many of the compounds they form based on that color. Transition metals will form compounds that have various colors including blue, green, red, orange, yellow, pink, brown, and purple. The following is a list of some compounds and their associated colors:Purple: Titanium(III) chloride, manganese compounds (potassium manganate(VII))
Blue: copper compounds (copper sulphate)
Green: nickel chloride, iron(II) compounds
Orange-brown: Iron(III) compounds (iron(III) chloride)
Pink: cobalt sulphate
Yellow: chromate (CrO42-)

Learn about the role of magnesium.,
Locate magnesium in the periodic table.,
Learn how magnesium behaves.,
Study the compounds of magnesium.,
Learn about the uses of magnesium.",How to Study the Chemistry and Physiological Roles of Magnesium Inside the Body," Magnesium is similar to sodium and potassium in toxicity towards human tissue in that the pure metal is toxic to cells, while the ions are not harmful, they also function as cofactor for several key enzymes in the body. This behaviour of magnesium is similar to that of calcium ions which are also required by the body mainly for bone tissue formation. A cofactor is a metal ion that helps the specific enzyme in its function in catalyzing the biochemical reactions.;
, Magnesium is located below beryllium in the periodic table and next to sodium in the right side. Its electronic configuration is similar to sodium with an additional electron that is located in an 3s orbital. Its configuration is 3s2. This configuration can easily loose two electrons from the 3s orbital to obtain the neon atom electronic configuration. This can explain the formation and the stability of the magnesium +2 ion. The magnesium ion has an electronic configuration that of a noble gas which is inert for reactions under normal conditions.

, The chemical behaviour of the magnesium column of metals is similar to that of the alkali metals. Magnesium ion has an ionic diameter which is approximately similar to that of lithium ion. Therefore the chemistry of both of these ions is similar.


This similarity is seen for example in the solubility parameters of LiF and MgF2 which are both hardly soluble in water. Both lithium and magnesium form nitrides with nitrogen.
Magnesium is considered to be inert. The nitrogen molecule is a stable compound with a triple bond. Therefore it is considered to be inert. However, Li and Mg do react with nitrogen molecules to give nitrides.

, Compounds of magnesium are known and have been prepared also. Magnesium hydroxide is a base which is used to neutralize acids. Magnesium hydride or MgH2 is a reducing agent and hydride donor. This compound generates hydrogen molecule when reacted with water.


Magnesium sulfate or MgSO4 is a compound that find uses in organic chemistry as a drying agent due to its hygroscopic nature. It can absorb water if present in the solution. In addition MgSO4 has application in the pharmaceutical industry. It is used there as a laxative.

, Magnesium finds extensive use in organic chemistry. It main use in organic chemistry is in the well known Grignard reaction which is a reaction to generate C-C or carbon-carbon bonds. Alkyl halides add in an oxidative fashion to magnesium metal to generate alkyl magnesium halide. The net result of this addition is the conversion of an electrophile to a nucleophile.


Alkyl Gringard has been used extensively in organic reactions. Some of its use is the reaction of alkyl Gringard with epoxides to generate the alcohol. Another use is the addition of alkyl Gringard to ketones to generate the alcohols also.

Learn what amines are.,
Understand how amines react.,
Learn about the different function possibilities.,
Learn the ketone reaction process.,
Learn about the use of amines in chemical warfare.,
Learn about the high level of reactivity.,
Understand the deprotonated effects.,
Learn about amines in the body.",How to Study the Chemical Reactivity of Organic Amines," Amines are organic hydrocarbons that are attached to nitrogen in a single bond manner. Amines are very reactive group of compounds. This is so due to the existence of the electron lone pair on the nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom in amines is relatively of low electro-negativity if we compare it with oxygen.


Therefore, the electron pull power of the nitrogen to share it is not so strong as in alcohols. This allows for the lone pair on nitrogen to be manifested in many chemical reactions. Primary amines are very reactive and they can be synthesized by the reaction of phthalimide with an alkyl halide followed by hydrolysis to form phthalic acid and the primary amine.;
, They usually react with an electrophile a two step manner. Namely, the formed amine from the first reaction with the electrophile continues to react further with another electrophile. This means that one does not expect a single reaction but a multiple reaction of the same amine.

, Due to the presence of the free electron lone pair on amines it can function as either a base or as a nucleophile. Both reactions are possible and compete with each other depending on the conditions of the reaction under question. Amines are not as reactive as C-Cl bond due to the polarization effect of the sigma bond in C-Cl bond which does not occur in C-N single bonds. The main reactivity of the C-N single bond stems from the existence of the electron lone pair on the nitrogen atom.

, Primary and secondary amines react with ketones to form shiff bases or C-N double bonds. This is potentially possible in diabetic patients with ketoacidosis where ketone bodies that are formed in these patients from the oxidation of fatty acids react with amines on DNA bases causing an alteration in the structure of the DNA by causing mutagenesis or cancer in affected individuals.

, Due to their extra reactivity, nitrogen containing compounds are used in chemical warfare. An example is the nitrogen mustard 2-chloro-ethylamine which reacts instantly intramolecularly to form a cyclic intermediate which can react with any potential nucleophile in the body. Nitrogen mustards have also been used in the treatment of cancer such as the compound cyclophosphamide.

, Amine groups are not a good leaving group in chemical reactions due to the high reactivity of the nitrogen species that can be expelled in these reactions. It can be made a good leaving group by reacting the amine with nitrous acid or HNO2. This reaction converts the amine to the diazonium salt which can easily be displaced by any potential nucleophile expelling a molecule of nitrogen.


This process can be used, for example, for the conversion of ethylamine to ethanol by the reaction of the formed diazonium salt with KOH. Amines can also be oxidized to nitro compounds with an appropriate oxidizing agent. Cyclic amines also exist and are prevalent. They have an extensive organic chemistry called nitrogen containing heterocyclic chemistry.

, Primary amines can be deprotonated at the nitrogen to form an extremely reactive species which can be used in the lab as a strong base. As an example, it is used in the deprotonation of ketones at the alpha position. An example of such a base is LDA or lithium diisopropylamide. This base can be commercially available from Aldrich for example. In the lab it can be prepared by the action of BuLi on diisopropylamine.


One might ask how we can generate this stronger base (BuLi)? It can be prepared from BuCl by the action of of lithium metal. BuCl itself can be prepared from the commercially available butane by the action of a halogen and UV light.

, Amines are also present in the body in DNA bases and as other neurotransmitters such as the catecholamines dopamine and epinephrine and norepinephrine. These three compounds are types of aromatic amines which have vital roles in maintaining homeostasis in the body .


Ammonia is also a nitrogenous compound which is also produced in the body from the deamination process of amino acids in the liver. Ammonia in then converted to the more benign compound urea which is also a nitrogenous compound which is excreted in the urine.

Locate the elements that are nonmetals.,
Differentiate the major metal groupings.,
Imagine something between a metal and nonmetal.",How to Study the Chemical and Physical Properties of Atoms in the Periodic Table1," On the periodic table, the majority of atoms are classified as metals. Other atoms are classified as nonmetals. You will find these groupings beneficial as you explore the properties of different atoms.Nonmetals can be found primarily in the upper right corner of the periodic table, while the rest of the table consists primarily of metals. Hydrogen is an exception to this rule, as it acts like a nonmetal under standard conditions, but it is found in the upper right corner of the table.
Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, and noble gases (the elements in the far right column) are commonly known nonmetals.
Halogens (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, etc.) fall into the nonmetal category.;
, Metals are grouped into subcategories. Elements within these subcategories are alike in more specific ways than just identifying both as metals. The common categories are alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, post-transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides.Alkali metals are very reactive and readily ionize to a 1+ state.
Alkaline earth metals are slightly less reactive, but readily ionize to a 2+ state.
Transition and post transition metals are more stable and have many different ionization states.
Lanthanides and actinides are larger, less stable molecules that readily react. Some of them decompose, making them radioactive.

, Such elements do exist, and they are known as metalloids. On the periodic table, metalloids show up between post-transition metals and nonmetals. There are eight metalloids:Boron
Silicon
Germanium
Arsenic
Antimony
Tellurium
Polonium
Astatine

Memorizing the structure and properties of all 20 amino acids is an essential aspect of biochemistry. Know their single and triple letter abbreviations to quickly recognize them while studying.Learn the amino acids in five groups of four.
Memorize essential properties such as charge and polarity.
Draw their structures over and over until you have them committed to memory.;
, Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids. Recognizing the various levels of protein structures and being able to draw the important ones (alpha helices and beta sheets) are fundamental concepts in biochemistry. There are four levels of protein structure:Primary structure is the linear arrangement of amino acids.
Secondary structure makes up the sections of proteins that fold into alpha helices and beta sheets.
Tertiary structure is the three-dimensional structure resulting from the interactions between amino acids. It is the physiological shape of the protein. The tertiary structure of many proteins is still unknown.
Quaternary structure results from multiple separate proteins interacting together to form one larger, single protein.

, The pH of a solution is a measure of acidity. This is related to the amount of hydrogen and hydroxide ions present in the solution. An acidic solution has more hydrogen ions present in the solution and fewer hydroxide ions. The opposite is true for basic solutions: more hydroxide ions, fewer hydrogen ions.Acids are hydrogen ion (H+) donors.
Bases are hydrogen ion (H+) acceptors.

, The Ka of a solution is its dissociation constant or how readily the acid gives up its hydrogen ions. It is defined by the equation Ka = /. The Ka of most solutions can be located in a table in your textbook or online. The pKa is defined as the negative log of the Ka.Strong acids have very small pKas.

, The Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation is used to prepare buffers for solutions in the laboratory.The equation states that pH = pKa + log /. The pKa of a solution is equal to the pH of the solution when the concentrations of the acid and the base are the same.A buffer is a solution that resists changes in pH when small amounts of acidic or basic solutions are added to it. They are important for keeping solutions at a stable pH., An ionic bond forms between atoms when one or more electrons is removed from one atom and donated to the other atom. The resulting positive and negatively charged ions then attract each other. Covalent bonds form when two atoms share pairs of electrons.Other forces such as hydrogen bonds (attractive forces between hydrogen atoms and highly electronegative molecules) are also important.The type of bond formed between atoms determines some of the properties that molecule will have.

, Enzymes are an important class of proteins in the body that are used to catalyze (increase the speed of) biochemical reactions. Almost every biochemical reaction in the body is catalyzed by a specific type of enzyme; therefore, the investigation of the mechanism of enzymatic function is a major subject in biochemistry. It is investigated mostly from the kinetic point of view.Enzyme inhibition is used pharmacologically to treat many types of diseases that affect the body.

, There are a number of essential metabolic pathways you will have to memorize when taking biochemistry: glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the citric acid cycle (Krebs Cycle), the electron transport chain, and photosynthesis, to name a few.Read the associated text in your book and study the figure detailing the process of the pathway.
It’s likely that you will need to be able to draw the entire cycle on a test.

, If you try to study all of the pathways at once, you will confuse them and won’t have a strong foundation for any of them. Focus on learning one pathway and review that pathway for a few days before you move onto the next one.


Once you have learned one, don’t let it fade away. Redraw it often to make sure you keep it fresh in your mind.

, When you first start learning, start with the basic pathway. Some pathways are a cycle that continue (the citric acid cycle) while other pathways are a linear process (glycolysis).Start learning by memorizing the shape of the pathway, where the pathway starts, what gets broken down, and what gets synthesized.


For each cycle, you will have starting molecules such as NADH, ADP, or glucose, and end products such as ATP and glycogen. Memorize these general pieces first.

, Now get more specific with the pathway. Metabolites are intermediate molecules that get formed during the process, but then get used up as the reaction continues. There are also cofactors that are required for or help to increase the rate of the reaction.Avoid memorizing for the sake of memorizing. Learn how each intermediate transforms into the next so that you have an actual understanding of the process instead of just rote memorization., The final step to memorizing the pathway is adding in the enzymes necessary to carry out the reaction. Learning the pathway in pieces like this will make it less overwhelming to start with. Once you learn all the names of the enzymes, you will have the whole pathway finished.You should now be able to easily write out every protein, metabolite, and molecule involved in the metabolic pathway.

, This type of information needs to be reviewed and redrawn on a weekly basis or else you will forget it. Take time each day to review a different pathway. By the end of the week you will have reviewed them all and then you can start all over the next week.


When test time comes around, you won’t have to worry about learning all of the metabolic pathways because you will have already have them memorized.

, Reading the textbook for any course you take is essential for studying the subject. Before class, read and review the material that will be covered that day.Take notes on what you read and you will be better prepared for class.


Be sure to read for comprehension. At the end of each section, summarize the material in your notes.
Try answering some of the questions at the end of the chapter to check your understanding of the concepts.

, The figures of your textbook are very detailed and help to visualize what the text is telling you. Oftentimes, it is much easier to understand a concept by looking at a picture of it than just reading words.


Redraw important figures in your notes to go back and study later.

, There are many complicated processes in biochemistry. Develop and use a color coding system for your notes. Maybe write your notes based on difficulty with one color representing really complicated concepts and another color, concepts you easily remember and understand.


Use a system that works for you. Don’t just copy your friend’s notes and hope it makes you better at studying.
Avoid over-doing it. Using too many different colors will turn your notes into a rainbow, but will not be as useful., While you are reading the textbook, write down questions on statements or concepts that are confusing. Ask questions during lecture as well. Don’t be afraid to raise your hand. If you have a question, it’s likely that other people in the class have the same question.


Seek out your teacher to ask questions that may not have been answered during class time.

Look at the order of the table.,
Visualize valence electrons.,
Consider the size of the atom.,
Learn the trends of the periodic table.",How to Study the Chemical and Physical Properties of Atoms in the Periodic Table2," When you look at the periodic table, you will notice that the elements are all numbered. This numbering is far from random. Actually, it is known as the atomic number for that particular element and is equal to the number of protons the element has in it’s nucleus.For atoms (not ions), the atomic number also represents the number of electrons in the atom. The number of protons and electrons in an atom are equal.
On some periodic tables, you will notice a second number that is in a smaller font. This is the average atomic mass for that element.

, Valence electrons are the electrons in the outermost shell of an atom’s electron cloud. The valence electrons are the single largest factor in how the atom will react chemically. The most stable configuration for an atom is to have the electrons in it’s outer shell filled, therefore it will bond with other atoms by giving or taking electrons to achieve a full outer shell. In most cases, the outer shell needs to contain eight electrons to be full (depending on the size of the atom this can vary).For example, fluorine has nine electrons. The first two fill the innermost orbital, the remaining seven are valence electrons. This means fluorine needs only one more electron to fill its valence shell. Thus, fluorine readily reacts with atoms that can give up an electron (particularly metals).
An example of the opposite is lithium. Lithium has three electrons. The first two fill the innermost shell and the last one is a valence electron. Since lithium would need to gain seven electrons to fill its valence shell, it is easier (more energetically favorable) for it to shed the one valence electron it has instead. So, lithium readily reacts with elements that will accept an electron (like halogens).

, Though the valence electrons are the best predictor of chemical properties in a given atom, the size of the atom also matters. Larger atoms have more electrons between the nucleus and valence electrons, which means that they are held to the atom more loosely than on smaller atoms. This accounts for why two atoms with the same number of valence electrons (for example, fluorine and chlorine) have similar, but not identical, chemical properties., Knowing periodic trends can help you to recognize the likely chemical properties of an element based on its location in the periodic table. It is important, however, to remember that three groups (noble gases, lanthanides, and actinides) do not follow these trends due to their unique chemistry. Some periodic trends are:Atomic mass increases from left to right and from top to bottom.
Atomic radius decreases from left to right and increases from top to bottom.
Electronegativity increases from left to right and decreases from top to bottom.
Ionization energy increases from left to right and decreases from top to bottom.
Electron affinity increases from left to right and decreases from top to bottom.
Metallic character decreases from left to right and increases from top to bottom.

Identify nonmetallic properties.,
Know the physical properties of metals.,
Note noble gasses.,
Consider metalloids.",How to Study the Chemical and Physical Properties of Atoms in the Periodic Table3," Nonmetals exist in three physical states at room temperature (solid, liquid, and gas), but are primarily gases at room temperature. Nonmetals are usually dull and brittle when they are solid, and they typically melt and boil at lower temperatures than metals. Nonmetals are also poor conductors of heat and electricity.The only nonmetal that is a liquid at room temperature is bromine.
Carbon has the highest melting point of all elements.

, Metals are shiny and malleable. They also conduct heat and electricity well. Metals are mostly solid at room temperature, though mercury is a liquid. Metals generally have high melting and boiling points compared to nonmetals., The elements that make up the far right column are known as the noble gases. They are chemically inert and are all found in the gas phase at room temperature. These gases are used for things like filling balloons and lighting signs.

, Just like metalloids possess chemical properties of both metals and nonmetals, they possess physical properties of both. They are semi-conductors. They can be malleable or brittle. They can also be shiny or dull."

Study the purpose of enzymes.,
Study homogeneous catalysis.,
Examine the differences between lithium and magnesium groups and transition metal groups.,
Understand the utility of organotransition-metals chemistry.,
Learn about the two different ways to use organometallic reagents.",How to Study Organometallic Chemistry," In a nutshell, it's a branch of organic chemistry that is relatively new, dating back to only few decades. This area of chemistry lies at the interface between organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry of the metals in all its types. The need for the development of this area of chemistry stemmed from the fact that many organic reactions are unable to proceed under normal conditions of reactions in the organic laboratory.;
, These compounds are useful as catalysts for these organic reactions that otherwise would not proceed to completion. Analogous terminology to this phenomenon are the chemical reactions that occur in the body of humans and animals which proceed mostly under the catalysis of special type of proteins in the body that are called enzymes.

, Enzymes usually work by lowering the value of the free energy of Gibbs for the reactions that they catalyze. Organometallic compounds are very useful reagents that are able to catalyze organic reactions through a specific cycle of reactions that involve the central metal that is usually a transition metal. This cycle usually involve well known steps such as oxidative addition to the metal and a process of migratory insertion and ends with reductive elimination to give the final product. These processes have been extensively from the kinetic point of view by labeling procedures using isotopes of hydrogen such as deuterium and other isotopes.

, This catalysis by organometallic compounds is a very useful and practical topic in chemistry due to its potential applications to industrial processes for the synthesis of important compounds such as the synthesis of organic polymers. Metals chemistry is very unique in comparison to other atoms in the periodic table. This is so due to the use by the transition metals of extra 5-d orbitals in its bonding with the other elements.

, The organometallic chemistry that involves the lithium and magnesium groups is completely different than that involved in the chemistry of the transition metals. The organic chemistry that is involved with lithium and magnesium groups is an ionic chemistry that gives the organic functional group a nucleophilic character in its reactions. This is so due to the large difference in electronegativity between the metal and the organic functional group.


A well known example of an organometallic compound of this type is the Gringard reagent which is an organomagnesium reagent that is used extensively in the organic laboratory as an alkylating agent. Gringard reagents are usually prepared from alkyl bromides by the process of oxidative addition on neutral magnesium metal.
Other similar types of reagent that uses different metal is the Reformatsky reagent. This reagent is an organozinc compound that is also a nucleophile in its chemical behavior that is used as an alkylating reagent. Organozinc compounds are prepared in a similar fashion to Gringard reagents from alkylbromides by the process of oxidative addition on the zinc metal.
Other metals which share similar chemistry to magnesium and zinc are cadmium organochemistry and lithium chemistry. Organolithium compounds are more basic than Gringard regents due to their being thermodynamically less stable.
Gringard reagents are much more stable thermodynamically than organolithium compounds. Therefore they are more nucleophilic and more selective also. Organometallic reagents usually are very sensitive compounds to the environment that they are located in. They are very sensitive to water and oxygen. Therefore usually reactions that involve organometallic compounds are performed under inert atmosphere that require special laboratory techniques such as working in a glove box for example.

, It is a very important type of chemistry due to its potential application in catalyzing organic reactions. This topic in chemistry is called homogeneous catalysis by organometallic reagents. Some authorities belong this area of chemistry to inorganic chemistry but others include it in the area of organic chemistry and call it applications of transition metals in organic synthesis.


Many industrial processes have been designed that use special type of organometallic reagents for the process of catalyzing organic reactions such as the Ziegler natta process which is an important industrial process in chemistry. Palladium group has a well known chemistry that its organometallic compounds are used in the catalytic process of organic reactions. The oxidative addition process to a given metal must be to a coordinatively unsaturated metal that is usually saturated electronically.

, The reagents that are used to catalyze organic reactions are usually used in one of two ways. These are: stoichiometric and catalytic amounts of the organometallic reagent. The manner of choice of one of these two possibilities will depend on whether the reagent is consumed in the reaction or it is regenerated.

Study the concept of energetic molecules alongside the science of polymer chemistry.,
Start by examining hydrocarbons.,
Study the synthetic procedure used to obtain highly energetic molecules.,
Understand how thermodynamics plays a key role.,
Study strained cyclic compounds alongside the role of kinetics.,
Explore the polymers based on energetic molecules.,
Study what energetic molecules are used for.",How to Study the Chemistry of Energetic Molecules," The subject of energetic chemical molecules is important for several reasons, and in particular, because molecules that contain much energy are desired for the production of heat. Examples of such molecules are the group of petrochemical compounds that are called hydrocarbons. This group of molecules has high content of potential energy that can be obtained through a combustion process of these compounds in the presence of an oxidizer that is usually molecules of oxygen that are present in the free air.;
, Hydrocarbons are highly energetic due to their content of many saturated C-H bonds in its molecular structure. This fact made the petrochemical industry to expand to unlimited horizons. Hydrocarbons are only one type of compounds with high energy content. There are in the chemical literature many other types of compounds that have comparable and even more energy content that typical organic hydrocarbons. The problem here is the availability of these compounds on commercial basis in sufficient quantities. Hydrocarbons are abundant in nature and are much more available source of chemical energy than other synthetic highly energetic compounds.

, The other less conventional sources of highly energetic molecules is the synthetic procedure in the chemistry laboratory. Synthetic compounds that contain highly energetic bonds are of limited use due to their availability only in small amounts. Energetic molecules are usually thermodynamically unstable and they tend to release their energy in order to be in a state of thermodynamic stability. The driving force for the generation of the high energy molecule is kinetically driven. In chemistry one talks about kinetic versus thermodynamic control of chemical reactions.

, Thermodynamic products of chemical reactions that have more than one possible pathway are usually more favorable products energetically. Kinetic products are usually thermodynamically not stable and they can disintegrate into more stable products thermodynamically easily. This is the case with energetic molecules. They are kinetically stable but are thermodynamically unstable compounds. Therefore, any perturbation to their structure can lead them to decompose and release their energy in the form of heat or in the form of an explosion.

, Examples of energetic molecules that are encountered in organic compounds are the strained cyclic compounds that are fused together. By virtue of the strain in the molecule, it possesses extra energy that it tends to release in order to become stable thermodynamically. Again, kinetics plays a major role here. Kinetic products are usually obtained in a fast reaction that is usually not selective. This type of product is unpredictable in its chemical behavior since it can decay and decompose to more stable compounds suddenly without any possibility to predict when this will happen.


Examples of these phenomena occur with ethers that contain peroxides on its structure. This type of compound relies now on its kinetic stability due to the potential of the compound to explode and release its energy.
Peroxides are high energy bonds due to the unstable O-O bond that is highly energetic and it is a type of bond that is kept intact due to kinetic reasons.

, Polymers are organic compounds that contain repetitive carbon units which are endless in its number. The synthesis of polymers is a whole branch of industrial chemistry and will not be discussed here. Polymer based energetic molecules are types of polymers that contain endless number of C-H bonds in its structure. In addition, it contains also endless number of oxidizing agent such as oxygen. The combustion of this material produces high amount of energy in the form of heat and CO2 gas. This is a basic description of a hypothetical form of carbon based polymer. Example of such a polymer that would function this way is a polymer that contains repetitive peroxide form in its structure that are attached to a carbon skeleton such as cyclohexyl ring or benzene ring in the form of phenol.

, Energetic molecules find uses mainly in the military industry for the production of explosive materials. Also, energetic molecules can be used to generate heat but due to its unstable structure they are dangerous to handle for household purposes and for other common uses that we do on a regular basis.

Learn the properties of anionic and cationic detergents.,
Know the properties of nonionic detergents.",How to Study the Chemistry of Detergents," A surfactant is a special chemical that reduces the surface tension of water. You have probably seen water form beads on a window or table. This happens because of the surface tension of the water. If you add a surfactant, the water will spread and wet more of the surface.Surfactants can be classified by their ionic properties or electrical charge: anionic (negative charge), cationic (positive charge), nonionic (no charge), and amphoteric (either positive or negative charge).
Soap is anionic surfactant while detergents are made up of one or more surfactants of various charges.;
, Detergents are made up of fatty acids and sodium or potassium salts. Triglycerides are compounds derived from animal or plant fats and oils composed of three fatty acids and glycerine.Fatty acids are weak acids composed of a hydrocarbon chain attached to a carboxylic acid group (one hydrogen, two oxygens, and one carbon).

, An alkali salt is a soluble, basic (pH > 7.0) portion of an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium. Alkali salts are able to react with and neutralize acids due to their basic chemistry. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are the two most common salts used to make soaps and detergents.The alkali salt attaches to the carboxylic acid group to form carboxylate. The entire molecule of carboxylate and fatty acid is soap.
These chemicals are very caustic and can cause severe injury if handled improperly.
Sodium hydroxide is used to make harder soaps, while potassium hydroxide is used to make softer, liquid soaps.

, In chemistry hydrophobic compounds are ones that “run away” from water. They are not water soluble. Hydrophilic are “water loving” compounds and are soluble in water. Soap is unique in that it has a hydrophobic end (fatty acid chain) and a hydrophilic end (carboxylate).The hydrophobic end is capable of binding stains such as grease and oil that are also hydrophobic, while the hydrophilic end is attracted to water and allows the stain to be washed away.Detergents work better when washing with hard water (water with mineral salts) because they have multiple surfactants.

, To make a detergent, you need fat and sodium hydroxide. Fats can be obtained from animals in the form of tallow and/or plants such as coconut or palm oil. Sodium hydroxide is also known as lye and is an essential component for making soap.Sodium hydroxide, or lye, is extremely caustic and must be handled properly. Wearing gloves, goggles, and long sleeves is essential while making detergents.

, Because lye is a caustic substance, you want to use caution when working with it to avoid injury. When making a detergent, never make it near children or pets. Work in a well-ventilated area with open windows and doors. Because lye is a strong base, you always want to add it to the water. Adding water directly to the lye super heats the water and can cause explosions.Work near a water source to quickly clean up any spills.
If you get any lye in your eyes, you must wash them for at least 15 minutes to make sure all of the chemical is washed out.

, The first step of detergent-making is called saponification. The fat and oils contain fatty acid chains and triglycerides necessary for the detergent. When mixed with the sodium hydroxide and heated, the glycerine molecules are removed and the sodium hydroxide combines with the carboxylic acid of the fatty acid.The resulting soap is a long chain of carboxylic acid., The detergent is not very soluble in salt water, while glycerine is highly soluble. Most of the glycerine is removed because it is valuable, although a little is left in the soap to make it smoother. When the salt is added the mixture separates into two layers: crude soap and brine/glycerine.The soap rises to the top of the solution while the brine/glycerine sinks to the bottom.
This process is usually repeated multiple times to remove as much glycerine as possible.

, At this stage, the soap is not nearly as caustic as pure lye, but it is still too high to use. The base can be neutralized using a weak acid such as citric or phosphoric acid. The acid removes the remaining sodium hydroxide and makes the detergent safe for use.After neutralization, the soap is dried and then ready for use.

, The most important concept related to the chemistry of detergents is the fact that they have both a hydrophobic end and a hydrophilic end. To remember which part does what, remember that a phobia is a fear of something. Since hydro, refers to water, hydrophobic means “water-fearing.”If you can remember what hydrophobic is, you just have to keep in mind that hydrophilic is the opposite and means “water-loving.”

, Anionic detergents have a negative charge on the hydrophilic end while cationic detergents have a positive charge on the hydrophilic end. They are considered more harsh because they modify protein structures.Cationic detergents are also capable of killing microbes and work very well to neutralize residual anionic detergents molecules.Anionic detergents are commonly used for scrubbing floors.Cationic detergents are commonly used to wash clothes and in shampoo.

, Nonionic detergents are a subgroup of detergents that have no electrical charge. Because of this lack of charge, they do not react with hard water ions making them less useful for washing clothes. They tend to foam less than ionic detergents as well.They are generally used as dish-washing liquids.

Understand what happens when equilibrium occurs.,
Learn the characteristics of the state of equilibrium.,
Understand the importance of the solvent for reaching equilibrium.,
Study the effect of a transition state.,
Study weak acids.,
Be aware of what happens with catalyzed chemical reactions (as opposed to uncatalyzed).",How to Study States of Equilibria in Organic Reactions," Chemical reactions that reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium are typical of uncatalyzed reactions in which their energy profile shows net enthalpy change of the reaction that is close to zero. This means that the reaction neither releases heat nor absorbs heat. This type of reaction is not driven by thermodynamic force so that it reaches a state of equilibrium. Normally other thermodynamic functions are affected by this state of equilibrium.


For example, chemical reactions that reach states of equilibrium usually have zero value of the free energy of Gibbs for the whole reaction. Usually chemical reactions that are in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium have net zero change in the free energy of Gibbs for the whole reaction. Also chemical reactions that are in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium can have net zero change in the total entropy of the reaction.;
, Chemical reactions that are in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium are usually characterized by equilibrium constants that its value measures the extent of reaction development in the flask. High value of the equilibrium constant usually means more formation of the products of the reaction. While low value of this equilibrium constant usually means low progress of the chemical reaction in the forward direction. Other than these thermodynamic functions which have direct effect on the progress of a given reaction to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium include the solvent effect.

, The solvent in which the reaction takes place is very important for deciding whether the reaction will reach a state of equilibrium or not. This is best exemplified by the effect of solvents on the extent of dissociation of Bronsted acids and Bronsted bases.


An example is the dissociation of carboxylic acid. In this case, two ions are generated from one neutral molecule. The salvation effect of the solvent is crucial here for the reaction to reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium or not. The more solvated the ions of the reaction products are the less likely is that the reaction reaches a state of equilibrium. Better salvation of ions by the solvent means less energy content of that ion and the more it is stable energetically. This is usually manifested as downhill energy profile for this type of reactions. If the energy profile shows no net stabilization upon solvation of the ions this means that the salvation process is not efficiently done or it is not accompanied by release of heat.
Solvation effect of solvents is one important factor in deciding whether the reaction will reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium or not. This effect of salvation is essentially equivalent to energy balance between reactants and products of the reaction.

, Chemical reactions that reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium can have one transition state without the development of reactive intermediates such as occurs with simple acids dissociation or it can have more complicated energy profile that can involve several reactive intermediates in the reaction. This occurs for example in the dissociation process of phosphoric acid. In this case, the reaction proceeds in several steps that are characterized by complicated energy profile.


These contain two or three reactive intermediates in the reaction. The so-called strong acids such as hydrochloric acid are so called due to the complete dissociation of the neutral acid into its ions. This process of complete dissociation of the acid is largely mediated by the solvation effect that water exerts on the ions of the acid. The salvation effect in this case is so efficient that heat is released as a result of the acid dissociation.

, Weak acids are called so due to the incomplete dissociation of the acid into its ions. This is again largely dependent on the extent of salvation that the ions have by the solvent. Reaching a state of thermodynamic equilibrium means that the energy content of the formed ions is not lower than the neutral acid.

, Catalyzed chemical reactions usually proceed to completion without the development of equilibrium state. This is best exemplified by the metabolic reactions that occur inside the body. Usually this type of reactions goes only in one direction and the energy profile for such reactions is downhill. Also, catalysts that are used in the chemical laboratories to perform reactions between chemicals usually contribute to the completion of the reactions without the development of equilibrium states.


Reactions which occur in living systems are characterized by their one way progress toward formation of reaction products without the development of equilibrium state. This phenomenon is not observed in the usual practice of chemical reactions in the chemical laboratory. The progress of chemical reactions only in one direction is a favorable and wanted process in all chemical reactions that are performed in the chemical laboratory. However, the thermodynamics of these reactions does not always allow for this process to occur.

Understand the background to electrical conductance.,
Note that in the solid state, the material is much more organized than the material in the gas or liquid forms.,
Learn about the valence orbitals and bands.,
Learn the difference between a normal conductor and semi-conductor.,
Study the insulator type of material.",How to Study Electric Conductance in Solids," Usually electric conductance is the result of the motion of electrons in a material such as in metal wires.


Solid state materials are different in their structure than materials that exist in other phases of matter such as liquids and gases.
In both liquids and gases, the structure of the material is determined based on the orbitals of the molecule that are in the valence electronic shell of the individual molecule.
In the gas and liquid phases the most important electrons in a given molecule are those that occupy the valence electronic shell.
In both of these phases, this is determined based on the electronic structure of the individual molecule.;
, The entropy of a gas or a liquid is much higher than the entropy of the solid state. As is well known, the entropy increases with increasing the disorder of the material. Solid material can have two basic structures. These are: crystalline and amorphous structures of the atoms.


In the amorphous state of a solid material, the organization of the atoms is much less than that of the crystalline state. Therefore, also the entropy of an amorphous material is higher than that of a crystalline state for the difference in order between them.

, In gases and liquids, the valence electrons that are located in few numbers of orbitals (called HOMO and LUMO) are the dominant of the chemical properties of the compound. In this case, individual molecules govern the chemical behavior of the compound. In the solid state, the picture is completely different by virtue of the difference in the state of the material involved. The valence orbitals that are typical for a gas or a liquid forms which are organized individually are changed to whole bands which each contain all orbitals of the same energy level. Thus the HOMO orbital of a compound in the gas or liquid phase is changed into a whole band that is called the valence band. Analogously, the LUMO orbital of a compound in the gas or liquid forms is changed in solids into a band that is called the conductance band.


The valence bands of a solid material will analogously to the behavior of the HOMO and LUMO of compounds in the gas or liquid forms govern the chemical and physical properties of the compound. Mostly the level of fullness of the valence band with electrons and the value of the energy gap between the valence and the conductance bands will determine the type of conduction in this solid material.
A partly filled valence band with an energy gap between the valence and the conductance bands that is not very high will dictate this material to be a normal conductor such as occurs in metals that we encounter every day. In this case, the electronic conduction will initially increase with increasing temperature but later the conductance will be diminished with increasing the temperature further due to the increased collision between the electrons.

, In the case that the valence band is completely full with electrons, and the energy gap between the valence and conductance bands is low, the type of electronic conductance in this case will be of a semiconductor type. The difference between the conduction in a normal conductor and a semiconductor is that in a semi conductor, the conductance increases proportionally with increasing the temperature while in a normal conductor the extent of conduction will initially increase with temperature but increasing the temperature further leads to a decrease in the electronic conduction.


Semiconductors can be produced from incompletely filled valence bands of many materials by the process of doping. This process involves the addition of certain foreign atoms to a given material so that it converts into a complete semiconductor.
Incompletely filled valence bands can be converted to a full band with electrons by adding atoms to the solid material that have one or two additional electrons in their valence shell than the original material.
Also, material that has extra electrons in its conductance band can be converted into a semiconductor by doping with atoms that have one or two less electrons in their valence electronic shell.

, This is often found and is the type of material is characterized by an energy gap between the valence and the conduction bands that is too high to allow for electronic promotions from the valence band to the conduction band. This type of material finds use in the case that insulation from electricity is desired such as electric buttons which are mostly made of plastic material due to its good insulating power.

Know the format of the exam.,
Learn the physical chemistry topics that will be covered.,
Be familiar with all of the organic chemistry topics that will be tested.,
Know the relevant topics for inorganic chemistry.",How to Study Chemistry for IIT JEE2," The chemistry portion of the IIT JEE covers physical, organic, and inorganic chemistry. It is multiple choice (30 questions) where each question will have four possible answers and only one will be correct. For every correct answer you get +4 marks, but for every incorrect answer, you get -1 mark. Unanswered questions are marked as zero (no points added or deducted). The exam can be taken either on paper or on a computer.Because there is a penalty for guessing, make sure you are confident with your answer before marking it.

, Topics within physical chemistry that you will be tested on include: atomic structure, chemical bonding, equilibrium, electrochemistry, chemical kinetics, solid state, states of matter, solutions, redox reactions, surface chemistry, stoichiometry, and thermochemistry.The physical chemistry portion of the exam accounts for about 30-40% of the whole exam and is considered the most important section.

, The essential topics covered for organic chemistry are: purification and analysis of organic compounds, general organic chemistry, hydrocarbons, isomerism, alkyl halides and aryl halides, alcohols, phenols, and ethers, carbonyl compounds, amines and nitrogen-containing compounds, biomolecules, and environmental chemistry.Like the physical chemistry portion, the organic chemistry section is about 30-40% of the exam.
The majority of the questions will be related to general organic chemistry (9%) and alcohol, phenols, and ethers (7%).

, For inorganic chemistry, you need to know about the properties of S, P, D, and F block elements, coordination compounds, polymers, general principles and processes of isolation of elements, and hydrogen.This portion of the exam is about 25-30% of the questions.

Be able to convert between units.,
Know how to write chemical equations.,
Understand stoichiometry.,
Memorize the organic chemistry functional groups.,
Ask yourself which bonds are formed and broken.,
Recognize isomerism of a molecule.,
Understand the periodic table.",How to Study Chemistry for IIT JEE3," A very important basic concept in chemistry is knowing which units to use and how to convert between different units. Know the standard units for temperature (Kelvin), mass (kilogram), length (meter), amount of substance (mole), time (second), and electric current (ampere).If you are given a temperature in degrees Celsius, you need to be able to convert to Kelvin: °C + 273 = °K.
Converting between metric units is also a necessary skill.

, Being able to write a proper chemical equation requires you not only to know the naming conventions, but also how to determine products given reactants. Writing chemical formulas is an essential skill for the JEE.Practice with many different types of examples to really master the concept.

, Stoichiometry is a concept that deals with determining the number of products and reactants in an equation. The mole is an essential component to stoichiometry and reaction. Balancing equations, limiting reagents, and percent yield are the three main aspects of stoichiometry.Balancing an equation makes sure that the laws of conservation are conserved.
In any reaction, there will be one reagent that is used up faster than the others. This is the limiting reagent and is important for chemical calculations.
No reaction is 100% efficient. The percent yield is the amount of product actually made compared to the theoretical yield.

, While there are aspects of chemistry where memorization won’t help, knowing the functional groups is not one of them. Being able to recognize a functional group instantly is crucial to your success on this exam.Make flashcards or practice writing them out every day.

, Memorizing organic chemistry reactions will not help you master this chemistry exam. A better way to approach these questions is to ask yourself which specific bonds are broken, and which specific bonds are formed.Knowing what happens makes it easier to determine how or why the reaction progressed.

, Isomerism means that each molecule is composed of the same elements, but they are arranged differently within the molecule. There are two types of isomerism: structural and stereo.Structural isomerism is when the molecular formula is identical but the structural formulas are different between molecules.
Stereoisomerism is when the molecules have identical structural formulas but different spatial arrangements.

, Know the sections of the periodic table that corresponds to S, P, D, and F elements. Have a working knowledge of the various trends in the physical properties and chemical properties of elements, along the periods and down the groups: transition metals, lanthanides, alkali metals, nonmetals, noble gases, etc.Focus your efforts on the co-ordination compounds and d-block elements.

Dispose of dry ice properly.",How to Store Dry Ice," Though you can slow down the sublimation process, you can't stop it. Therefore, purchase dry ice as close to when you want to use it as possible. You'll lose 5 to 10 pounds of dry ice in a day, even when the dry ice is stored well., Dry ice can burn your skin because of the extreme temperature. Insulated gloves will protect your hands from frostbite when handling dry ice. You should try to handle it as little as possible.In addition, wearing long sleeves can protect your arms while you are using dry ice., A thick styrofoam cooler is sufficient to keep dry ice for an extended period of time. You can also use a standard cooler, such as one you use to hold cold drinks., Fill up the rest of the container with crumpled paper. This process will help slow down the sublimation, as it lessens how much dead space is in the container., The more you open the container, the more warm air you let in. Warm air increases the sublimation process, meaning your dry ice evaporates more quickly., If it's cold outside, set the cooler outside. If it's warm, keep the cooler in a cool place inside. Basically, you want to keep the temperature outside of the cooler as cool as possible, as it lowers the sublimation rate of the ice., If you have a light burn that only causes redness, the burn should heal on its own. However, if dry ice causes your skin to blister or if your skin starts peeling, you need to go to the doctor., Because dry ice releases carbon dioxide, it can be hazardous to humans in a closed-off area. Make sure plenty of fresh air is getting into the room where the dry ice is being stored. Otherwise, it can cause asphyxiation in humans and animals.Remember, a closed car is an unventilated  area, especially if the air is not on. Don't leave dry ice in a parked, closed car. When transporting it, open the windows, or make sure you set the air conditioner to bring in fresh air. In addition, place it away from you when you're driving., Dry ice sublimates instead of melts, meaning it releases carbon dioxide. As carbon dioxide changes to gas, it needs room to escape. If you use an airtight container, the gas cannot escape. In extreme cases, the gas can expand too much, causing an explosion., A freezer is airtight, and it can cause the dry ice to explode.Also, if you try to put dry ice in a regular freezer or refrigerator, you could destroy the system, as the thermostats are not made to handle those kinds of temperatures., If you plan on breaking up a block of dry ice, you should wear safety goggles and a face shield to protect your eyes. Otherwise, shards of ice can fly into your eyes and cause burns., Carbon dioxide tends to sink in rooms, as it is heavier than the air you breathe. Therefore, it will collect in low areas. Don't intentionally stick your head in those areas., Dry ice can damage many surfaces due to its extreme temperatures. For instance, you can crack tile or other counter top surfaces by placing dry ice on it., The best way to get rid of unused dry ice is to let the unused portion continue to sublimate. Make sure the area is well ventilated while the dry ice continues to disappear.Don't put dry ice down a sink or in a toilet, as you may destroy them. Similarly, don't put dry ice in a trash can or leave it where it can accidentally be picked up or touched by someone who doesn't know it's dry ice, as it can burn them."

Learn some rules for chemical reactions.,
Explore the factors that help in performing this task.,
Note that humans are in a state of thermodynamic stability and equilibrium with the surrounding to be able to live.,
Apply this principle of thermodynamic stability and minimum energy state to chemical systems.,
Factor in kinetics.,
Learn about delay boiling and delay solidification.",How to Study Kinetic Versus Thermodynamic Control in Chemical Reactions," Begin with a speculation if there is any exception in these reactions for living systems. Chemical reactions are governed like any other system in the world by the rule that says that any system at a specified state will take the path with minimum energy to get to another specified state. This principle is basic to all objects including living systems such as humans. There is no exception to this rule even in processes maintaining and sustaining the life, when all thermodynamics parameters are carefully defined.

Living systems might reach to a state of lesser energy when they die. All living systems are guided by laws of thermodynamics that govern the behaviour of lifeless objects. Living systems have chemical reactions within their bodies, known as biochemical reactions, that requires intake of energy counted (with the abuse of the words) in the form of calories. One might speculate that the driving force for maintaining this state of thermodynamic stability with the environment could be termed as the instinct to survive.;
, They include signals that receive to brain such as hunger and thirst. These signals gives warning to eat and drink in order to maintain state of equilibrium with the surrounding. Also, other factors contribute to this trend and include the special function of autonomic nervous system in higher types of life in the case of imminent threat to the life of the individual. In this case, those signals force the organisms to behave in a way to reduce the risk, and maintain state of equilibrium with the environment. Also ability to express needs vocally is another way that works in the direction of sustaining state of biochemistry., Thus, living systems have mechanisms that help them to maintain the thermodynamic rules of remaining in a state of minimum energy., Certain reactions reach in a state of equilibrium between compounds participating in the reaction and the products which are expected as the outcome of the reaction. To clarify, for instance, only ten per cent of the intake materials will give the desired product. It is due to the fact that in the given thermodynamic condition the product disassociate back to the input compounds. In such conditions either the product should be removed as fast as possible before disintegration to disturb the balance (concentration) of materials in favour of more productive reaction or new thermodynamic conditions should be imposed to overcome the kinetic (dp/dt) of the reaction towards production rather than decomposition. The parameters include change of pressure and temperature or the volume of the reaction., Another concept comes into play here which is called kinetics. One concept from this theory is the activation energy of a chemical reaction. That is, having two stable states with one in lower energy there might be a barrier between them that should be overcome by the reaction to move from the higher state to the lower state. As an example hydrogen molecules and nitrogen molecules can exist stable next to each other, but to react and form ammonia they need to overcome a barrier. A lightening in the sky helps to create heat and overcomes the barrier and creates H3N. Raining immediately converts it to NH4OH washes it down to earth decreases the concentration of H3N in the atmosphere and helps more nitrogen and hydrogen reaction in the next lightening. At the same time, the same phenomenon happens to nitrogen and oxygen to create nitric acids to be neutralised by ammonia and, meanwhile, land becomes fertilised by natural ammonia nitrate products.



  Overcoming the Kinetic Barrier

A reaction can be thermodynamically favourable and yet does not proceed. This is basically due to a kinetic factor which is manifested by a high energy barrier for this specific reaction. Therefore, a reaction which is thermodynamically favourable can be kinetically disfavoured due to the presence of high energy barrier. A thermodynamic product of a given chemical reaction is always the more selective and energetically favoured compound. The energy profile for such a reaction is downhill. Also, thermodynamic products are usually obtained in the process which is slower and more selective due to its being energetically driven. To sum up, factors affecting a reaction are

Pressure, temperature, concentration/volume, and catalysts.
The other type of products which are also observed in some chemical reaction is called the kinetic product. This type of product in a certain chemical reaction is usually in excited or meta-stable state and tend to decompose instantly with the help of any perturbation such as shock or heat. Also, unstable compounds that are considered in a state of kinetic stability include hydrogen peroxide. This is a water molecule taken an extra oxygen and exist in metastable state. As it releases its extra oxygen easily to go to a stable state it can be used as a powerful oxidant in applications such as the color neutralizing and sanitation.

, Put a bottle of beer standing in a freezer for an hour. Then gently bring it out. Put it on a table and smoothly open its cap. Beer is in liquid phase. Tap it with the tip of your nail or drop a grain of salt in it. Suddenly all the bottle turns into a slush. Though the bottle in terms of thermodynamic variables was in freezing condition it needed a kinetic spur such as a turbulence or seed for crystallisation to transforms in a militaristic (martensitic) way to new solid phase. (Be careful not to leave the bottle too long in freezer; otherwise, it blows.)"

Note that an organic reaction occurs in one of two ways.,
Observe organic reactions using a special spectroscopic technique.,
Understand that reactions that proceed in a step-like manner are usually not specific.,
Do kinetic measurements of a reaction rate to determine the rate of a reaction.,
Apply the study of molecular dynamics of chemical reactions to any investigation of the mechanisms behind reactions.,
Be aware that organic compounds usually have thermodynamic stability that is remarkable when compared to compounds of other atoms such as carbon.,
Learn about the two main common intermediates encountered in many organic reactions.,
Study examples.,
Understand the utility of theoretical modeling of chemical transformations.",How to Study Reactive Intermediates,"


The first way is through a concerted reaction that takes place in a single step, with only one transition state.
The second way is through a non-concerted reaction, which results in intermediate structures consisting of highly reaction carbon species. This is the dominant sort of chemical reaction.;
, For example, through the use of mass spectroscopy (MS). The follow-up of fragmentation patterns displayed by chemical compounds in the gas phase using MS can show the viewer the existence of these reactive species by including their molecular mass as part of the spectrum.

, They will not result in a single product. On the other hand, reactions that occur within one step tend to be more specific, owing to their concerted nature.


An example of the one-step reaction is the SN2 reaction in organic chemistry that proceeds in a single step. This is stereospecific and results in a single product.
An example of the step-like manner of a reaction are SN1 reactions with intermediates. These are not stereospecific and produce more than one possible product. The end product is usually a mixture of enantiomers, a starting compound.

, The determination of the rate of the reaction, whether first order or second order, can provide valuable information about the dependence of the rate of the reaction on the concentration of the reactants.

, This area is formally part of physical chemistry, whereas physical organic chemistry can be considered as a branch of physical chemistry (as applied to organic compounds).

, The fragmentation of the organic molecule by the effect of thermal energy or light can cause the molecule to dissociate into fragments. These fragments are highly unstable carbon species that are electronically deficient; they combine with any possible compound that is present within their neighborhood.


This process is driven by the energetically favorable product.

, These are:


The electron deficient carbocation species; and
The negatively charged carbon ion called carbanion.


By virtue of their charge, these species are unstable thermodynamically and have an inclination to bind with other chemical species in order to satisfy their electronically unstable structure.

,


Intermediates are seen, for an example, in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions of benzene and its derivatives. These intermediates tend to restore the aromatic structure of the compound which is much more stable than the reactive intermediates. Reactions that have complicated mechanisms are also characterized by the presence of chemical intermediates in their reaction pathway. For an example, the formation of pyrole from an amine and a diketonic compound can be considered one.
Aromatic compounds are unusually stable from the thermodynamic point of view. In order for an aromatic compound to undergo a chemical transformation there must be an active destabilization of its stable structure. For this reason, aromatic compounds do not undergo concerted reactions and have reactive intermediates that characterize the mechanism of all aromatic compounds.

, This modeling can be very useful in determining whether a reaction pathway will be favorable or is likely to have intermediate structures. This is mostly seen based on the energy balance of the participants in the reaction as well as the matching of the symmetry of their frontier molecular orbitals. The best approach of research in this area as well as in other areas of chemistry is to start a research that involves two aspects; the first is the experimental research and the second is the computational research which can corroborate the experimental data.

Using a fractional (or fractionating) column inserted between the boiling flask and the condensing unit is recommended for separating alcohol and water.The simple distillation system requires the two liquids have a large difference in boiling points.
The simple distillation system uses less heat, and is easier to set up, but provides less accuracy in separating alcohol from water.
Another word for the closed distillation system is a still, which is derived from the word distillation.;
, The boiling point of water is 100 Celsius, and the boiling point of alcohol is 78 Celsius. Thus, alcohol evaporates into steam quicker than water.Use a heat source whose temperature can be quickly raised or lowered, such as a heating mantle.
You can also use a standard propane or electric heating source.

, The fractionating column is a straight glass cylinder lined with metal rings, or glass or plastic beads. These rings or beads help trap the less volatile gases at the lower levels of the column.As the vapor rises from the distilling liquid, only the most volatile liquid rises to the top.
In a mixture of alcohol and water, alcohol would make its way to the top ring.
Insert a thermometer to gauge the temperature of the gases inside the system.

, As the vapor makes its way into the condensing column, it will be in a cooler setting. Being in this cooler place, it will revert into liquid, i.e., condense.As the vapor condenses to liquid, it will become heavier. The liquid alcohol will then drop into the collection vessel.
The condensing column may be lined with cooling water to speed the process.

Assess the different grain sizes of salt and sugar.,
Acquire a sieve that is sized in between these grain sizes.,
Get shaking.",How to Separate Salt and Sugar1," At first glance, table salt and granulated sugar look very similar, including in size. The minute differences in the average grain sizes of the two, however, does provide an option for attempting separation.


Regular table salt has an average grain size of 100 microns, or 0.01 mm.Note that other types of household salt, such as kosher or pickling salt, will have widely divergent average grain sizes.
Regular granulated sugar has an average grain size of 500 microns (0.5 mm), or five times larger than table salt.Again, other sugars, like powdered or brown sugar, will have very different average sizes.;
, Laboratory-style sieves (or strainers) are sized according to the spaces between the mesh. You want to find one that is large enough to let the salt through, but small enough to stop the sugar.


Since salt is 100 microns across and sugar is 500, a 250 micron (0.25 mm) sieve would make a good in-between choice., This method is a simple as it seems. Add small amounts of the salt-sugar mixture at a time to the sieve (with a bowl underneath), and shake, shimmy, and rattle it to slowly but surely send much of the salt through the mesh openings and into the bowl.Because this method relies on the difference in average grain sizes, it is never going to be entirely successful, There will be some smaller sugar grains that slip through and some larger salt grains that stay put, not to mention those that might stick together — at least until the point when you’re tired of sifting.
Despite its limitations, however, sieving is a legitimate scientific means of separation.Just don’t expect to use the separated sugar in your coffee, unless you like a salty kick!

Start with a liquid that is 5%-15% alcohol.,
Place the alcoholic liquid into a container.,
Remove the frozen material from the container.",How to Separate Alcohol and Water2," You'll need a container that can be safely frozen and thawed, and a place (either a freezer or outdoor temperatures) that are below 0 degrees Celsius. This method relies upon the different freezing temperatures of alcohol and water, much as heat distillation relies upon different boiling temperatures.This is an ancient technique of separating alcohol from water, practiced since the 7th century.
Freeze distillation is sometimes known as the Mongolian still.

, As water expands when it freezes, make sure that your container is large enough to hold the expanded liquid without bursting. The water content of the liquid will expand, but the amount of alcoholic beverage will be much less, due to the extraction of the water.The freezing point of water is 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit) while the freezing point of alcohol is −114° Celsius (−173° Fahrenheit.) In other words, alcohol will never freeze under ordinary conditions.
Siphon the liquid from the frozen substance once a day. The longer you leave your container in the freezer (or outside), the higher the alcoholic content of your remaining liquid.
For larger amounts, use larger containers. Be sure to use food grade plastic containers, as lower quality plastics may contaminate your beverage.

, The frozen material will be mostly water, while the alcohol, which has a higher freezing temperature, will be left behind.The remaining liquid will be higher in alcoholic content, though not pure alcohol.
It will also have a stronger flavor. For that reason, this is a popular distillation technique with hard apple cider (or apple jack), ale, or beer.
The name apple jack comes from the freeze distillation process, which has historically been known as jacking."

Add salt to isopropyl alcohol to process by azeotropic distillation.,
Gather your materials.,
Fill the mixing container about 1/4 full of table salt.,
Add the alcohol to the mixing jar and shake well.,
Allow gravity to separate the contents of the mixture.,
Use the baster to extract the distilled alcohol from the top of the mixing jar.",How to Separate Alcohol and Water3," This distillation process separates the water from the alcohol by dehydration. Dehydrated isopropyl can be used as fuel, as a removal for fleas and ticks from pets, as an antiseptic for pets or humans, or as a deicer for windshields. Dehydrated isopropyl is an essential part of creating biodiesel fuel.
This process is known as extractive distillation.

, To separate water from isopropyl alcohol, you'll need the original isopropyl alcohol mix (50% to 70% isopropyl alcohol mix) and a container to hold this liquid when finished, a wide-mouth glass jar for mixing (1/2 gallon), 1 pound of non-iodized table salt, and a baster with reduced-size nozzle.


Make sure all your materials are clean, including the jars and your baster.
Isopropyl alcohol is commonly sold over-the-counter in pharmacies in 16-oz containers (or, 1 pint). You'll need 2 pints for a 1/2 gallon sized mixing jar.

, Make sure you're not using iodized salt or it will contaminate the distillation process. This should be roughly the contents of one standard container of table salt.Use any brand of salt you choose, as long as it's not iodized.
You may use any amount of alcohol and salt you like, as long as it follows the ratio of four parts liquid to one part salt.

, Your mixing jar should be about 3/4 full with the isopropyl alcohol and salt mixture. If it's any fuller than that, it may not have room for the expansion that will occur when salt mixes with alcohol.Make sure your lid is well fastened before shaking.
Watch to make sure salt is well combined with liquid before ceasing to shake.

, It will take 15-30 minutes for the salt to settle to the bottom of the jar. The liquid rising to the top will be higher in alcohol. This is the dehydrated isopropyl alcohol.Don't allow the two layers to remix.
When you open the jar, do so very carefully to prevent excess shaking. Excess shaking will disturb the salty contents at the bottom of the jar and require you to repeat the distillation process.

, Have your receiving container nearby, already labeled as ""distilled isopropyl alcohol.""The baster can be used very gently to remove one small bit at a time from the mixing container.
Be careful not to shake, pour or tilt the mixing jar as you remove the distilled alcohol.

Count the number of reactants.,
Verify that there is only one end product.,
Practice with some examples.",How to Recognize the Type of a Reaction1," A combination/synthesis reaction is aptly named because it is a reaction where two or more products combine together to form one new product. Remember that the reactants of an equation are always on the left side of the arrow.Many reactions have just two reactants, but you can have combination reactions with more than two reactants.;
, As the name of the reaction indicates, the reactants must combine to form a new product. All products are found on the right side of the arrow. Very occasionally, there will be more than one product on the right side; however, most equations will only have one product.A synthesis reaction is the reverse of a decomposition reaction.
An example of a reaction resulting in two products: CO2 + H2O --> C6H12O6 + O2


, Examples are a great way to train yourself to recognize specific chemical reactions. The more examples you look at, the more likely you are to remember each type of reaction.Example 1: Cu + SO4 --> CuSO4

Example 2: CaO + CO2 --> CaCO3

Consider a simpler, safer alternative for a science experiment.,
Add ethanol to your salt and sugar mixture.,
Mix the solution with a spoon or a stir stick to dissolve the sugar.,
Pour the alcohol solution through a very fine strainer, and into the new container.,
Wait for the alcohol to evaporate, or create a steam bath.,
Place the sugar and ethanol mixture in the open bowl on top of the steam bath.,
Continue the process until all the alcohol has evaporated.",How to Separate Salt and Sugar2," If you are teaching or learning about separating materials and/or making solutions, think about using salt and sand as your mixed materials instead of salt and sugar. It is a bit easier, much safer, and equally interesting.


Separating salt and sand involves adding warm water to the combination in order to dissolve the salt, straining out the sand by pouring the water mix through a fine sieve, then carefully boiling the water to leave the salt behind. It does not involve flammable liquids or potentially dangerous fumes.The safety issue is likely the main reason why it is hard to find lesson plans or legitimate scientific advice about how to separate salt and sugar. If you insist upon doing so, however, take every precaution. Do not try it at home unless you are well-versed in chemistry and have observed all safety measures.
First and foremost, always have a working fire extinguisher nearby.

, The larger the amount of salt and sugar, the more ethanol you will need to use. There must be enough alcohol that the sugar dissolves without being oversaturated.If at all possible, consider using only a small amount of salt and sugar, or doing your separation in batches if you have a large amount. Ethanol is flammable and using too much will increase your fire risk.

, Once the mixture settles, the salt should be sitting at the bottom of the beaker.


Granulated sugar is an organic substance that is soluble in alcohol and other organic solvents (such as acetone, for example). Table salt, however, is far less soluble in alcohol than it is in water, because the former’s lesser polarity provides less attraction to salt’s sodium and chlorine ions., Your strainer should have gathered all the salt particles. Let the strainer dry and then pour the salt into a separate container.


Remember that table salt has an average grain size of 100 microns, so you will need a strainer with smaller mesh openings than that.You may want to instead use a coffee filter placed inside the sieve.

, To make a steam bath, place a small saucepan filled one quarter full with water on your heating element. Make sure you can set a glass bowl directly on top of the saucepan, so that the bottom of the bowl does not contact the water in the saucepan.


A steam bath is similar to a double boiler used in cooking., Turn on a fan or a hood and wear a mask to avoid breathing in the alcohol fumes.Only after placing the alcohol solution in the top bowl, heat up the water to a low boil on medium heat. The steam bath is designed to gently heat the solution because of the alcohol’s volatility. Other methods can cause a spark and light the alcohol.
Do not let the alcohol solution come in contact with the heating element or any open flame.
Stay away from the steam forming at the top of your open container of sugar and alcohol while it distills.

, The sugar will be left in the open dish. Pour the sugar into a separate container.Exercise caution until and even beyond the conclusion of the experiment. Any remaining alcohol residue could be ignited by the still-hot heating element.

Count the number of reactants.,
Verify that there are two or more end products.,
Practice with some examples.",How to Recognize the Type of a Reaction2," A decomposition reaction is one where a reactant degrades or decomposes into its constituent parts. This type of reaction yields more products than reactants. Almost all basic decomposition reactions will have one reactant.The reactant is on the left side of the arrow.

, The reactant decomposes into multiple products. To recognize this type of reaction, just see if the equation resembles the general formula C --> A + B. Remember, the products are on the right side of the arrow.This reaction is the opposite of a combination reaction.

, Being able to recognize equations comes with practice. The more equations you look at, the easier it will be for you to immediately realize the reaction is decomposition.Example 1: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2

Example 2: KClO3 --> KCl + O2


"
"
Recognize the general formula for single replacement.,
Compare the reactant and product sides.,
Practice with some examples.",How to Recognize the Type of a Reaction3," A single replacement reaction occurs when one element replaces another element within a compound. It generally takes the form of AX + Y --> YX + A or A + XY --> XA + Y. One reactant is always a single element and the other reactant is always a compound.In a single replacement reaction either the anion (negatively charged ion) or the cation (positively charged ion) is replaced.
For example: Cu + AgNO3 --> Ag + Cu(NO3)2. In this example the copper (Cu) replaces the silver (Ag).

, When looking at the equation, you can easily tell if a single replacement has occurred if one of the elements has switched places into the new compound. Using the general formula as guidance, you can identify the reaction.For example: ZnS + O2 --> ZnO + S

, Being able to quickly recognize a single replacement reaction takes time and practice. By looking at many different types of examples, you will improve your ability to identify this reaction without looking it up.Example 1: Fe + CuSO4 → FeSO4 + Cu. Iron replaces the copper element in the compound.
Example 2: Fe + HCl --> FeCl3 + H2. Iron replaces the hydrogen.
Example 3: CaO + Al --> Al2O3 + Ca. Aluminum replaces the calcium.

"
"
Learn the general formula for a double replacement reaction.,
Compare the product and reactant sides.,
Practice with some examples.",How to Recognize the Type of a Reaction4," These reactions are similar to single replacement reactions except that both components react and there are two replacements. The general formula is AB + XY --> AY + XB. The cations and anions from both compounds recombine to form two new compounds.


These reactions are usually between acids and bases or metallic aqueous compounds.
For example: KOH + H2SO4 --> K2SO4 + H2O.

, When looking at an equation you can tell it is a double replacement reaction because the outside elements will recombine to make a new compound and the inside elements will recombine to make a new compound. The inside elements will switch position because the cation is always written first.For example: FeS + HCl --> FeCl2 + H2S.
The outside elements, Fe and Cl, combine to form FeCl2.
The inside elements, S and H, switch positions and combine to from H2S.

, Looking at many examples of a double replacement reaction will help you recognize them when you see them on a quiz or test. The more examples you look at, the better you will be at identifying them.Example 1: NaCl + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + AgCl
Example 2: H2SO4 + 2NaOH→ Na2SO4 + 2H2O

"
"
Learn the components of a combustion reaction.,
Verify that O2 is one of the reactants.,
Check that the products yield CO2 and H2O.,
Practice with some examples.",How to Recognize the Type of a Reaction5," On a most basic level, a combustion reaction is one where oxygen gas (O2) reacts with anything to form carbon dioxide and water. Generally, the oxygen gas reacts with a compound of carbon and hydrogen. The combustion products are always CO2 and H2O.The generic equation for a combustion reaction is: CxHy + O2 --> CO2 + H2O.

, The first step to identifying a combustion reaction is making sure that oxygen gas is one of the reactants. If there is no O2 present, then the reaction is not combustion.For example: C2H5SH + O2 --> CO2 + H2O + SO2.
O2 is reacting with a carbon-hydrogen compound so this reaction is probably a combustion reaction.

, When a combustion reaction occurs, the products will almost always contain CO2 and H2O. If both carbon dioxide and water are not products of the reaction than combustion is not occurring.For example: C2H5SH + O2 --> CO2 + H2O + SO2.
Because CO2 and H2O are both products, this reaction is an example of combustion.

, The more problems that you do, the easier it will be for you to recognize a combustion reaction when you come across it. With some practice, you’ll be able to instantly identify a combustion reaction when you see one.Example 1: CH4 + 2O2 --> CO2 + 2H2O
Example 2: C2H5OH + 3O2 --> 2CO2 + 3H2O

"
"
Feel for heat in exothermic reactions.,
Look for the formation of precipitate.,
Add heat for endothermic reactions.,
Watch for light and feel for heat from combustion reactions.",How to Recognize the Type of a Reaction6," Many synthesis and replacement (single and double) reactions are exothermic, meaning they release heat. Reactions that release a lot of heat, such as the thermite reaction, can be explosive.The thermite reaction is a single-replacement reaction between iron (III) oxide and aluminum.

, Again, in many synthesis and replacement (single and double) reactions a precipitate will form at the bottom of the tube. A precipitate is any solid material that is insoluble in water.Sodium chloride is the white powder formed when molten sodium burns in chlorine gas.

, Most decomposition reactions are endothermic meaning you need to add heat for the reaction to occur. If heat must be added, you may be observing a decomposition reaction.An example of a decomposition reaction is mercury (II) oxide decomposing into mercury metal and oxygen gas in the presence of heat.

, Combustion reactions tend to explode, forming large amounts of light and heat energy. Oftentimes, this energy is released as fire. Combustion reactions are always exothermic, meaning they release heat.Some examples of combustion reactions are: hydrogen with oxygen, phosphorous with oxygen, and magnesium with oxygen.

Understand that most elements will be listed with decimals.,
Use the atomic weight to find the number of neutrons in a single atom.",How to Read the Periodic Table," The table is structured from left to right in order of increasing atomic number. The atomic number is the number of protons in a single atom.


Not every row or column is complete. Although there may be breaks in the center, reading the table will continue from left to right. For instance, Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1 and it is in the top left. Helium has an atomic number of 2 and it is in the top right.
Elements 57 through 102 are usually pictured as a subset at the bottom right of the table. These are the “rare earth elements.”

, There are 18 columns.


Use the term “reading down a group” to read from top to bottom.
Numbering will usually be above the columns; however, it may appear below other groupings, such as metal.
The numbering used on the periodic table will differ greatly. They can be Roman (IA), Arabic (1A), or numbers 1 through 18.
Hydrogen may be placed in the halogen family and the alkali metal family, or both.

, There are 7 periods. Use the phrase “reading across a period” to read from left to right.


The periods are usually numbered 1 through 7 on the left hand side of the table.
Each period is bigger than the last. This is associated with increasing energy levels of atoms on the periodic table.

, The colors will vary greatly.


Metals are shaded one color. However, hydrogen is usually shaded and grouped with the non-metals. Metals have luster, are usually solid at room temperature, conduct heat and electricity and they are malleable and ductile.
Non-metals are shaded together. They are the elements C-6 to Rn-86, including H-1 (Hydrogen). They do not have luster, conduct heat or electricity and are not malleable. They are usually gasses at room temperature and can be solid, gas or liquid.
Semi-metals/metalloids are usually shaded purple or green, as a combination of the other 2 colors. The line is a diagonal, stretching from elements B-5 to At-85. They have some properties of metals and some of non-metals. , These are alkali metals (1A), alkaline earth metals (2A), halogens (7A), noble gases (8A) and Carbons (4A).


The numbering can be Roman, Arabic or standard numbers.

, It is a 1 to 2-letter combination that is used as a standard across different languages.


The symbol can be derived from the Latin name of the element or the widely accepted common name.
In many cases, the symbol follows the English name closely, such as Helium, which is “He.” However, it is not a rule to base a chemistry lesson upon. For example, Iron is “Fe.” For this reason, the symbol/name combination is usually memorized for quick reference. , This will appear just below the symbol. It will change depending upon what language the periodic table is written in.

, As stated before, it moves from top left to bottom right. Knowing the atomic number is the fastest way to locate more information about the element.

,,, Atoms have equal numbers of electrons and protons.


Keep in mind that there is an exception to this rule. If the atom loses or gains electrons, it is an electrically charged ion.
If there is a plus next to the element’s symbol, it indicates it is positively charged. With a minus symbol, it is negatively charged.
If there is no plus or minus symbol, and your chemistry problem does not consider ions, the protons and electrons are likely equal.

, This is the number below the common name of the element.


Although it may appear as though the atomic weight increases in number from top left to bottom right, this is not true in all cases.

, The atomic weight is the total of the particles in the nucleus; however, it is a weighted average of different isotopes.

, Round the atomic weight to the nearest whole number, called the mass number. Then, subtract the number of protons from the mass number to get the number of neutrons. For example, iron’s atomic weight is 55.847, so its mass number is 56. It has 26 protons. 56 (mass number) minus 26 (protons) is 30. There are usually 30 neutrons in a single atom of iron.
Changing the number of neutron in an atom creates isotopes, which are heavier or lighter versions of the atom.

Understand how a chemical reaction reaches completion.",How to Study Chemical Reactions and Their Thermodynamic Parameters," A chemical reaction involves bond breaking and bond formation. In order to understand a chemical reaction, one needs to understand the meaning of a chemical bond. As an example we take the hydrogen molecule. This molecule is stable enough to exist and has one sigma bond between its hydrogen atoms.


The chemical bond is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that was discovered in 1927 by two scientists. They were called Heitler and London. Prior to their discovery the nature of the chemical bond was ambiguous. The explanation of the existence of the chemical bond was not possible. Heitler and London put a mathematical formula that explained the existence of the chemical bond through molecular orbitals in the hydrogen molecule.;
, These are the covalent bond and the ionic bond and the dative bond. The ionic bond is an electrostatic phenomenon in which a positively charged atom reacts with a negatively charged atom to form a neutral compound. An important condition to the ionic bond to exist is that the difference in electronegativity between the atoms involved in the bond must be significant. This condition is a prerequisite for the formation of ionic bond.


An example of an ionic bond is the bond in NaCl, the eating salt. The ionic bond is stronger than the covalent and the dative bonds. The covalent bond is formed between two atoms through contribution of one electron each atom to the bond.
The covalent bond comprises two electrons are located in a bonding orbital that is shared between the nuclei of both atoms. Thus forming an entity that is more stable than either atoms alone. The bonding orbital is called the molecular bonding orbital. The dative bond is found only in complexes of organometallic compounds.

, In a chemical reaction we change the identity of the compound that we have such as its structure and its physical properties such as its boiling point. An example of a chemical reaction is the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen molecules. In this reaction we start with two completely different compounds in the gas phase and ends up with water which is a liquid.


There are spontaneous reactions as well as non-spontaneous reactions. Spontaneous reactions have negative values of the free energy of Gibbs which its mathematical symbol is G. Non-spontaneous reactions have positive values of the free energy of Gibbs. A chemical reaction with zero value of the free energy of Gibbs means that the reaction is in equilibrium which means that the reaction is not complete.
In addition to the free energy of Gibbs, a chemical reaction has normally an energy barrier which it must overcome for the reaction to take place.
A reaction with low energy barrier means it does not require much energy in order to proceed in the forward direction, while a reaction with high energy barrier means it requires a large amount of input of energy in the reaction in order to proceed in the forward direction.

, Unstable compounds such as peroxides react normally with low energy barrier while stable compounds such as carbon monoxide or CO react with high energy barrier.

, In addition to the characteristic functions of activation energy and free energy of Gibbs which are typical for chemical reactions, there is another important thermodynamic function which is called the enthalpy or the energy of the molecule. Each chemical reaction has an enthalpy of reaction associated with it. The enthalpy of a compound means the amount of energy this compound has in its bonds.


The reaction enthalpy is defined as the enthalpy difference between the reactants and the products. If this difference is positive we talk about an endothermic reaction or a reaction in which consumes energy i its process. On the other hand, if the reaction enthalpy is negative, one talks then about a reaction which releases energy.

, An important principle of chemical reactions is called the Hammond principle. It states that chemical reactions with high energy barriers are normally endothermic, while chemical reactions with low energy barriers are normally exothermic or release energy upon reaction.

, Another characteristic of chemical reactions is the thermodynamic function of entropy. Chemical reactions favor disorder over order. One talks then about chemical reactions which are entropically favored or disfavored depending on if there is an increase in order upon reaction or there is a decrease in order.


Reactions are favored entropically if there is an increase in disorder upon reaction. An example is the dissociation of NaCl to its ions. In this case the disorder is increased. An example of a decrease in disorder is the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen molecules.

, This is also accompanied by an increase in disorder or a decrease in disorder depending on which phase we are talking about. A transition from liquid to solid is accompanied by a decrease in disorder and thus is entropically disfavored. A transformation from liquid to gas is entropically favored due to the increase in entropy or disorder.

, Finally a chemical reaction can be followed to completion through several ways. One is thin layer chromatography or TLC in organic reactions and UV-VIS spectrum in the case of organometallic compounds. Crystallography is often used to identify the structure of inorganic compounds.

Take notes while reading.",How to Study Atomic Structure," An electron is a negatively charged particle. It is the smallest of the main three particles that comprise an atom. Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom which is made up of both protons and neutrons. The electrons are arranged in orbital shells in special configurations around the nucleus.The mass of an electron is extremely small: 5.48597 x 10-4 atomic mass units (a.m.u.).Because electrons have such minimal mass, the mass of an atom is determined by the masses of the protons and neutrons.;
, A proton is a positively charged particle with a much larger mass than an electron. The proton resides in the nucleus of the atom and the number of protons an atom has defines what element it is. The number of protons is also the atomic number of an atom and determines its chemical behavior. A normal atom has an equal number of protons and electrons.The mass of a proton is 1.0072766 a.m.u.Protons are themselves composed of smaller particles called quarks. There are two “up” quarks and one “down” quark per proton.
You can remember that a proton is positive because both words start with “p”.

, A neutron is a particle with no charge that has a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Neutrons are also present in the nucleus of the atom. The number of neutrons present in the nucleus determines the isotope of an element.The mass of a neutron is 1.0086654 a.m.u.
Like the proton, the neutron is composed of quarks, but it has one “up” quark and two “down” quarks.
You can remember that a neutron has no charge because the beginning of the word is similar to neutral.

, The nucleus of the atom contains almost all of its mass because it is composed of protons and neutrons. You might think that the nucleus would not be able to hold together with so many positively charged molecules repelling each other. The “strong force” overcomes this electrical force to hold everything together.The arrangement of the protons and neutrons within the nucleus is unknown., Also called orbitals or energy levels, electron shells are the current predicted model for how electrons circle the nucleus of an atom. Each electron shell has a maximum number of electrons that can reside in it. The first shell can only have two electrons, while the next two shells have a maximum of eight electrons. The third shell is capable of holding up to 18 electrons if necessary.You will never see more than 32 electrons in any of the outer shells.
An electron shell “feels” full if it has eight electrons in it.
The innermost energy level (closest to the nucleus) is K. The rest of the energy levels are labeled L, M, N, O, P, Q, with Q being the farthest away from the nucleus.

, Suborbitals describe the way the electrons actually orbit within the energy level. They are labeled with the letters s, p, d, f, g, and h. The letter denotes the shape of the suborbital: s is spherical, p is shaped like a figure eight, and the configurations get more complicated with d, f, g, and h.Each energy level has its own suborbitals. For example, an electron in the first energy level in the s suborbital would be said to reside in 1s1. An electron in the second energy level in the s orbital would be in 2s1.

, When an atom gains or loses an electron, it will lose or gain a negative charge. Many atoms do not have a “full” outer electron shell, meaning they have fewer than eight electrons. Because atoms want to fill that outer electron shell, they will give away or take electrons from other atoms causing ions to form.Sodium chloride (table salt) is formed when an atom of sodium gives an electron to chlorine making the sodium a positive ion and the chlorine a negative ion. The oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other to form salt., Flashcards are always a helpful tool for studying. Making flashcards about the various components of atomic structure such as protons, neutrons, and electrons can help you learn the material quickly. You can bring your flashcards with you wherever you go and if you have some free time, you can flip through them.Make flashcards to learn the energy levels of atoms and the different forms of elements like isotopes and ions.

, Studying with a buddy or in a group can really help with your learning about any subject. Studying with a friend who has a strong comprehension of atomic structure can help you master the material. Studying in a group can be even better because you can all learn from each other.Someone may really understand one concept while someone else may have mastered another. By teaching these concepts to each other, the whole group will learn the material better.

, Your textbook is not the only resource available to you for studying atomic structure. You can also search online for more information to help with your understanding. In addition, the library may have more resources that describe atomic structure in a different way that may make it easier for you to learn.


The internet has a lot of interactive tutorials that can make learning about atoms and their structure more fun., When you are reading and learning about atomic structure, you should take good notes. Draw pictures and color code the material in a way that makes sense to you. Not everyone learns the same way, so if you find something that works for you, continue to use it.


Review your notes frequently and you will have the material mastered by test time."

Rotate the burette so the water rinses the entire burette.,
Tip the burette back to vertical and open the stopcock valve.,
Let about 3 mL of liquid run out the bottom.,
Close the stopcock and repeat the whole rinse at least two more times.,
Repeat this rinse cycle with the titrant solution.,
Rinse with distilled water after use.,
Check for droplets on the side.,
Cover the burette top with a paper cap.,
Store in a glass locker away from dust.",How to Purge a Burette for a Titration," Using distilled water is important to keeping your experiment free of impurities and contamination. Fill the burette from the top and try to run the water down the sides when filling to dislodge any particles.Make sure the stopcock is closed (in the horizontal position) before filling the burette.;
, You want the water to come in contact with as much of the burette side wall as possible without spilling it out of the top.This is the main rinse for the top of the burette. Be sure to swirl the water around the tube thoroughly for each rinse.

, Keeping the burette horizontal, slowly rotate the burette so that the water can rinse the entire inside of the burette.If you see water droplets collecting on the sides of the burette, you may need to more thoroughly clean the burette with glassware detergent.

, Once you have the burette back into a vertical position, open the stopcock valve by moving it into the vertical position. Make sure the burette is being held over a sink or waste container as the liquid will drain out of the bottom., With the valve open, watch the water level drop until about 3 milliliters (0.1  fl oz) has gone through the tip. This cleans the tip of the burette.Pour the remaining liquid out through the top of the burette.

, Again, making sure the stopcock is closed, fill the burette with about 5 mL of distilled water. Tilt the burette horizontally and rotate to coat the inside with the water. Back to vertical, let about 3 mL of water out through the bottom tip and then flip the burette to pour out the remaining volume from the top.You want to rinse the burette at least three times with distilled water before use.

, The titrant solution is the solution you will be titrating in the experiment. Using the same method, you want to rinse the burette with this solution so that your results will not be altered by the presence of water in the tube.Rinse the burette 2-3 times with the titrant before beginning your experiment.
The titrant rinses are very important to get all of the distilled water out of the burette.
Wear gloves with the titrant to avoid contact with harmful chemicals.

, Following the end of an experiment, rinse the burette with distilled water at least twice. Fill the burette with 5-10 mLs of water, make sure it coats the tube, and then run the water through the bottom of the tube by opening the stopcock valve.If you were titrating a solution that was highly concentrated, rinse the burette with lots of tap water before moving on to distilled water.

, If you see droplets of water stuck to the side of the burette, the burette is still dirty and needs to be cleaned with more than water. Use a detergent specific for glassware; soak the burette in the detergent and rinse thoroughly.Following cleaning with a detergent, be sure to rinse many times and check for droplet formation on the side. If the burette has been well cleaned, no droplets should form.
Let the glassware air dry. Do not dry with towels as they will leave dust behind and contaminate the burette.

, Once the burette is dry and ready to be put away, it is a good idea to put a paper cap on the top. The cap prevents dust from getting into the burette if it is going to be sitting for a long time.You can make the caps by forming a tube out of paper and then twisting one end.

, All glassware used in the lab should be stored in a glass locker or case. If you have a burette cabinet, make sure the burettes are placed in the correct direction with the stopcock valve placed towards the wall and the burette securely in the hole.Improper placement of burettes can lead to them falling out and breaking when you open the door.

,, A solid will precipitate out of the solution. Remember, sulfuric acid is very corrosive and can cause serious chemical burns if allowed to come into contact with your skin. Use extreme caution when handling this chemical.

, The water-in tube attaches to the bottom spigot of the condenser and water-out tube attaches to the top spigot of the condenser.

, Set the heat to 2 initially and the stir to 6-7. You may need to adjust the heat to keep the solution refluxing, but not boiling violently. You know the solution is refluxing when liquid droplets form at the tip of the condenser where the condenser is attached to the round bottom flask.

, Cool the solution at room temperature for 2-3 minutes.

, Reattach the condenser to the round bottom flask, and resume heating under gentle reflux until all of the solid has dissolved. It is very important for this experiment to succeed that ALL of the solids dissolve during this period.

Cut a large stock TLC plate from the box into rectangles.,
Mark the TLC plate.,
Prepare your chromatography solvent.,
Prepare your solutions.,
Take a small amount of solution.,
Lightly press the tip of the pipette to the intersection of one of the dashed lines and the horizontal line you made previously on the silica side.This will cause the solution in the pipette to be sucked onto the silica, resulting in a small circle of solvent and compound.,
Dry the TLC plate.,
Develop the plate.,
Remove the plate.,
Dry the plate.,
Visualize the plate.,
Calculate the retardation factor (Rf).",How to Perform Thin Layer Chromatography," You will probably need a glass cutter unless the plates are already pre-scored. There are two sides to the TLC plate. A silica side and a glass side. The glass side is just smooth reflective glass, and the silica side is a powdery white substance that will flake off if you disturb it. So be careful when handling these plates so as to not ruin the silica gel. Touching the silica with your fingers should be avoided!


Measure the dimensions for your 1.5 x 4 cm plates, or larger if you thing you need more space, but this size is usually sufficient. Then lightly score the glass side, not the silica side, with the your blade or glass cutter. It should look like the picture above, with obvious cuts in the glass. Now carefully pick up the plate and break it by bending it with your hands away from you. Glass will easily break along a smooth edge if scored. Be very careful, but you must use enough force to break the glass. This may take some practice if you have never done it before.;
, Draw a line in pencil about 0.5 cm from the bottom straight across.If you are doing a simple reaction, as in most undergraduate labs, draw three evenly spaced vertical dashes on the horizontal line. Label these lines as starting material (SM), co-spot (C), and reaction (R). This will be explained more in later steps.


Only use pencil to write on the TLC. If you use pen or marker it will ruin your TLC plate because these media contain dyes which are organic compounds that will develop along with your compounds of interest. Graphite will not move with the solvent. Write very gently, otherwise you will scrape off the silica.

, A classic solvent system is ethyl acetate and hexane because they mix easily and the polarity of the solvent is easily adjusted. A good place to start is with 20% ethyl acetate in hexane, which is the same as a 1:4 solution of ethyl acetate to hexane. You can easily measure out 1 mL of ethyl acetate and 4 mL of hexane in a graduated cylinder, or other liquid-measuring tool, and then combine them to give the desired solution. In an enclosed jar, place some 1:4 ethyl acetate:hexane so that the bottom of the jar is just barely covered. Close the lid on the jar, or else the solvent will quickly evaporate and you will have to add more.

, Take the starting material for your reaction and dilute it in a small vial with ethyl acetate. TLC is very sensitive and even a 1% solution of your compound is plenty. You really only need a very dilute solution for this procedure. In fact, if your solution is too concentrated, your spots will streak and you will get no useful information from your TLC plate. If your reaction is also a nice solution you can spot from it directly, but if your reaction mixture is more complex you may have to remove a small amount and dilute it in a suitable solvent (such as ethyl acetate) to make a solution.The best solutions to spot are clear, but they don't have to be. The color of the solution does not matter. In the picture above, the solution is clear and colorless because this compound is not colored, but oftentimes the solutions have color to it.

, Submerge the tip of a glass pipette into one of the reaction solutions you just made, and the pipette it will suck up a small amount. This is called capillary action and many people are surprised that this works. See the above picture for proof that this actually works. Simply stick the end of the pipette into the liquid, and some of it will come into the pipette. You do not need very much solution for spotting on the plate, so the tip of a pipette is plenty.

, It is very important to spot lightly. If you press too hard, you will deposit too much material, making big spots which will overlap, causing the TLC to be difficult to read. This step will take practice, so you may want to try this several times, trying to get as small of spots as possible before continuing onto the next step.


Spot the starting material on the first and second dashes, and the reaction solution on the second and third dashes. The first dash is your starting material reference (SM), the middle spot is a co-spot (C), and the third spot is the reaction reference (R). This type of spotting makes the developed plate very easy to read. The the above picture for visual clarification.

, Simply set the plate down and wait a minute or so for the solvent to evaporate off the plate. You cannot run the plate if there is still solvent. You will be able to see a wet spot on the plate if there is solvent. You need not wait long for such volatile solvents as ethyl acetate and hexane. A minute is more than enough time for these solvents to evaporate.

, Using tweezers, gently place the TLC plate into the solvent jar, with the spotted end of the plate at the bottom close to the solvent. Submerge the bottom edge of the plate into the solvent, allowing the solvent to run up the plate, carrying the compounds along with it. Cover the jar with the lid. This will prevent solvent from evaporating and make the development stage much faster. This is the stage where separation occurs. So be patient and wait 2-3 minutes for the solvent to reach the top of the plate before you remove it. Waiting longer usually provides better results, so long as you don't let the solvent flow past the upper edge.

, Once the solvent comes close to reaching the upper edge of the plate, use tweezers to carefully remove it from the chamber. Quickly mark in pencil the highest place the solvent reached. This is called the solvent front and is important to take note of for later calculations. Do not touch the silica with your fingers as you could smudge the spots or deposit compounds from your hands onto the plate, making your plate useless.

, Again, wait for the solvent to evaporate off the plate. This should only take a minute or less if you are using a volatile solvent such as ethyl acetate hexane, but it is important to not have solvent on your plate.

, Place the plate under an ultraviolet light. You should notice several spots at different locations, corresponding to different compounds. The presence or absence of spots corresponds to the progress of a reaction, so information about a reaction can be easily  determined in this way. Use a pencil to outline the spots so you can continue to analyze the plate after you remove it from the UV source. Look at the above picture and notice the different spots at different heights.

, This is simply the ratio of how far the spots have moved to how far the solvent has moved. Use a ruler to measure the distance to the solvent front and to the middle of the spots. Divide the distance the spots moved by the distance the solvent moved. This will give you a number between 0 and 1. By calculating the Rf of known compounds, you can identify them on a TLC plate. Different compounds will almost always have different Rf values, making them easy to distinguish.

In this instance, you will be increasing the amount of water in the solution, thus diluting the acid. The first step is to have your water ready to receive the acid.Do not pour the water into the acid. Fill a separate container.;
, Once you have water ready for dilution, you can slowly pour the citric acid into the water. If you have a large volume of citric acid, pour a little and then stir the solution before pouring more. This will help disperse the heat that is generated when diluting the acid.Never pour water into acid. The heat will not be well dispersed and it can result in concentrated acid vaporizing or splashing onto you.
Wear gloves and goggles when diluting acid.

, The pH of the dilute acid solution will be higher than that of the concentrated acid solution. It should be noted that the pH of your dilute solution will never raise above 7.0 because that is the pH of the water. The closer you can bring the pH to 7.0 (neutral), the safer it will be to neutralize the acid with a base., Bases are substances with a high pH. Like acids, bases are corrosive. However, when acids and bases contact each other, they neutralize each other and the resulting mixture is less corrosive. You can use a strong base like NaOH (sodium hydroxide) to neutralize citric acid. If you do not have access to NaOH, something like sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) will also neutralize citric acid well., Dilute your base the same way that you diluted the citric acid. Get a container of water and slowly mix in the base. Again, the closer you bring the pH to 7.0, the safer the reaction will be when you use it to neutralize the citric acid solution.Note that 7.0 is as low as you can get when diluting a base in water. This is because the pH of the water 7.0 and thus adding more water will not make the pH go lower.
Wear gloves and goggles when diluting bases.

, To neutralize the citric acid solution, pour it slowly into the basic solution. Be prepared for the reaction to fizz and get hot. The reaction is also likely to emit fumes. Avoid getting any acid or base on your skin, and do not inhale any fumes produced. Just continue adding the acid slowly and stirring when needed.Use a glass stir rod to stir the reaction.
Wear gloves and goggles when reacting acids and bases.

, You can use pH paper to test the pH of your solution. A low pH (<7.0) means that the solution is still acidic. A high pH (>7.0) means that the solution is basic. A pH of 7.0 indicates a neutral solution., If you are looking to neutralize acids like citric acid, you should know what are. Acids are compounds that easily give up a proton (hydrogen ion). As such, they are called proton donors. Bases are compounds that readily accept extra protons and are called proton acceptors. Acids and bases neutralize each other because a base can accept the acid’s extra protons, which usually results in the formation of water, salt, and sometimes a gas such as CO2 (depending on which acids and bases you react, the products will be different)., Many acid and base reactions are done in water. This is an important fact since water can act as either an acid or a base. That is, the H2O molecule can donate a proton and become a hydroxide ion (OH-) or it can accept an extra proton and become a hydronium ion (H3O+). The ability to function as an acid and a base is referred to as amphoterism., Because acids and bases form ions, they will also form salts when they react. Strong acids and bases dissociate completely in water and usually form only salt and water when mixed. Weak acids and bases only dissociate partially. That means that there may be other byproducts, such as carbon dioxide gas, when they are reacted.An example of a strong acid and strong base mixing is NaOH (sodium hydroxide) and HCl (hydrochloric acid). When they mix, the salt NaCl is formed along with water. No other byproducts are formed.
A common example of a weak acid and base reaction is the one that occurs between citric acid and baking soda. The reaction forms salt, water, and carbon dioxide.

Consider replacing or adjusting your hydrometer.",How to Read a Hydrometer," Hydrometers measure the density of liquid, but liquids expand and contract with temperature changes. In order to get an accurate answer, you need to test liquids at the temperature your hydrometer was designed for. This temperature should be listed on the hydrometer label, or on instructions in the same package.

Most homebrew hydrometers are calibrated at 59–60°F (15–15.6°C ), and most laboratory hydrometers are calibrated at 68°F (20.0°C).Hydrometers can lose accuracy over time. If you're using an old tool, you may want to test it first.
;
, If this is more than a degree or two off from the hydrometer's intended temperature, write down the result. Your measurement will be off, but you can correct it using the temperature chart at the end of this article.

If testing homebrewed wort, do not contaminate it with a non-sanitized thermometer. Use an adhesive strip thermometer that sticks to the side of the container, or measure a sample instead of the main batch.


, Choose a transparent jar or cup large enough that the hydrometer can float without hitting the sides or bottom of the container. Transfer a sample of the liquid into this container.

When brewing, test the wort after visible signs of fermentation have ended, but before pitching the yeast. Transfer the sample using a sanitized siphon, wine thief, or baster.If precision is extremely important, rinse the container with a small amount of the liquid before adding the full sample.


, Make sure the hydrometer is dry, then lower it into the liquid just below the point at which it would float naturally. Be sure the hydrometer bulb does not touch the sides or bottom of the jar when it settles.
, This will dislodge air bubbles clinging to the tool, which would disrupt the measurement. Wait for the hydrometer and the liquid to stop moving, and for bubbles to dissipate.
, The surface of the fluid may cling to the hydrometer and the container walls, forming a curve called a meniscus. Look for the scale mark on the hydrometer level with the lowest point on the fluid's surface. Do not use the mark where the fluid touches the hydrometer., The most common scale on hydrometers is ""specific gravity."" This is the ratio of the liquid's density to the density of water. Pure water should give a reading of 1.000. A higher reading means the liquid is denser (heavier) than water, and a lower reading means it is lighter.

The specific gravity of wort (called original gravity or OG by brewers) varies greatly. The more sugar in a wort, the higher the OG, and the higher alcohol content in the final beer. Most beers OGs fall in the 1.030 to 1.070 range, but they can be significantly higher., Your hydrometer may use one of these scales instead, or you may need to convert your measurement to follow a certain recipe. Here's how to measure density using these three units:

The Plato scale measures the percentage of sucrose in a wort, so 10 degrees on the Plato scale means 10% of the wort is sucrose by weight. Multiply the Plato measurement by 0.004 and add 1 for a specific gravity estimate that's close enough for home brewing purposes.For example, a 10 degrees Plato wort has a specific gravity of 10 x .004 + 1 = 1.040. (The further you get from this number, the less accurate the conversion is.)

The Balling and Brix scales are close enough to the Plato scale that you can use the units interchangeably for home brewing. Commercial breweries use more exact conversion formulas, and conduct their own tests to calibrate the Brix scale based on various factors., At the end of the entire brewing process, test additional samples daily with the hydrometer. If the reading is the same two days in a row, no more sugars are being converted into alcohol, meaning fermentation is complete. The final reading at this point is the ""final gravity"" or ""FG."" The target FG depends on what kind of brew you are making, and in some cases on additional ingredients that affect the hydrometer reading.

With a few exceptions, most beers have an FG around 1.007 to 1.015.Home brewers rarely get the exact FG predicted by their recipe, especially on their first few attempts. It's more important that the beer tastes good, but keep records and keep studying the process to get a more consistent result.


, The difference between the original gravity and final gravity tells you how much sugar was converted to alcohol. The formula 132.715 x (OG - FG) is a useful way to convert this into alcohol by volume (ABV). Note that this is only an estimate, and is most accurate for beers with a final gravity around 1.010.For example, if your OG was 1.041 and your FG is 1.011, the ABV is roughly 132.715 x (1.041 - 1.011) = 3.98%.


, To test whether the hydrometer is accurate, use distilled water or reverse osmosis water. If you use tap water or untreated bottled water in your brewing, you can test with that instead. The mineral content will alter the results, but this will tell you how to adjust your readings for brews made with that specific water.
, The hydrometer's calibrated temperature should be marked on the hydrometer label or the package instructions.
, Place the hydrometer in the water, spin gently to shake off air bubbles, and wait for it to settle. The hydrometer will read 1.000 for pure water if it is perfectly calibrated.

A hydrometer that uses the Plato or Balling scale will read 0.00º.See the instructions above for a more detailed guide on how to use the hydrometer.


, If you get a result other than 1.000, the hydrometer is off (or your water contains minerals). Write down the amount you need to add or subtract to future readings to correct this error.For example, if your hydrometer reads 0.999 in pure water, add 0.001 to all measurements.

To take another example, if your hydrometer reads 1.003 in tap water, subtract 0.003 from all measurements of liquid brewed with that specific tap water. Test the hydrometer again if you change water sources.


, If your hydrometer is significantly off, it's often best to order a new one. The old one may lose even more accuracy over time, but it is possible for the frugal brewer to correct it:If the measurement is too low, attach tape, nail polish, or any other material to increase the weight until the measurement is correct.

If the measurement is too high, file the edge to remove material. Seal the rough area with nail polish to protect against glass dust or sharp edges.

Many professors have study guides available and open additional office hours for student help when needed.;
, Do not be embarrassed if chemistry is hard for you. It’s a difficult subject for almost everyone.


By working in groups, some members will find areas easier than others, and can help share their methods of learning with the group. Divide and conquer.

, Reading a chemistry book is not always the most interesting book on the shelf. But take the time to read the assigned sections, and highlight the parts that just don’t seem to make sense. Try to make a list of questions or concepts that you are having trouble understanding.


Go back to those parts later and take a fresh look. If they still seem confusing, talk with your study group, your professor, or a teaching assistant.

, Even if the material you read seems overwhelming, you may know more than you think you do. Try to answer the questions at the end of the chapter.


Most textbooks will provide additional information that explains the correct answers to help you figure out what you missed in the reading.

, Textbooks use visual aids to get the major teaching points across to the readers.


Look at the visuals, and pay attention to the captions attached. This may help to clear some of the confusion.

, Taking notes and watching everything the teacher writes on boards or overheads is hard to do, especially in a difficult subject like chemistry.

, Most schools legitimately provide access to previous test questions to help students prepare for major tests.


Avoid just memorizing the answers. Chemistry is a subject you have to understand in order to answer that same question if it was worded differently.

, Pay attention to any online resources or links provided by the chemistry department of your own school.

, To pass your chemistry class, you will need to have a good understanding of the building blocks that make up everything that has substance, or mass.


Understanding the most basic of all things, the atom, is where chemistry begins. Everything in the class will be an extension, built on that basic information. Be sure you take the time to understand the material presented on atoms.

, An atom is considered the smallest building block of everything that has mass, including things we can’t always see, like gases. But even the tiny atom has even smaller parts that make up its structure.An atom is made of 3 parts. Those parts are neutrons, protons, and electrons. The center of the atom is called the nucleus. The nucleus is made up of neutrons and protons. Electrons are the particles that float around the exterior part of the atom, like planets circling the sun.The size of an atom is incredibly small, but to give some perspective, think about the largest sports arena you know about, maybe the Houston Astrodome. If you consider the Astrodome to be the atom, then the nucleus of that atom is about the size of a pea somewhere around the 50 yard line., An element is considered to be a substance in nature that cannot be broken down to any other element, or to any simpler form. Elements are made of atoms.The atoms in that element are consistently the same. This means that every element has a known, and unique, number of neutrons and protons in its atomic structure., The neutrons, found in the nucleus, are neutral in charge. Protons have a positive charge. The atomic number of an element is exactly the same as the number of protons contained in the nucleus.You don’t have to calculate anything to know the number of protons in the nucleus of an element. That number is printed at the top of every squared box, for every element, in the periodic table.

, You can use the numbers provided on the periodic table to figure this out. The atomic number for any element is exactly the same as the number of protons found in the nucleus.


The atomic mass unit is printed for every element inside the square at the bottom, just under the name of the element.
Remember, the only two things that are in the nucleus of an atom are protons and neutrons. The periodic table tells you the number of protons, and it tells you the atomic mass number.
From that point, the math is simple. Subtract the number of protons from the atomic mass number, and that gives you the number of neutrons in the nucleus of every atom for that element., Remember that opposites attract. Electrons are positively charged particles that fly around the nucleus of an atom like planets circling the sun. The number of negatively charged electrons that are pulled towards the nucleus, depends on the number of positively charged protons located in the nucleus.


Since an atom has no overall charge, all the positive and negative charges contained in the atom must balance. Therefore, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons., If you are having trouble with the properties of elements, spend some time reviewing any available material on the periodic table. Most importantly, look closely at one.


Understanding the periodic table is critical to passing the first part of your chemistry class.
The periodic table is made up of only elements. Each element has a symbol consisting of either one or two letters. That symbol always identifies that element. Na for example, always means sodium. The complete name of the element appears just below the symbol.The number above the symbol is the atomic number. The atomic number is the same as the number of protons found in the nucleus.The number at the bottom is the atomic mass. Remember, the number of protons combined with the number of neutrons found in the nucleus equals the atomic mass number., The periodic table is full of information, down to the colors chosen for each column, and the way the elements are laid out from left to right, and top to bottom.

, In a chemistry class, you will be expected to know how to predict what will happen when elements are combined. On paper, this is called balancing chemical equations.The format for a chemical equation consists of reactants on the left side of the equation, then an arrow in the direction of the products of the equation, then the products. The parts on one side of the equation have to balance the parts on the other.For example, Reactant 1 + Reactant 2 → Product 1 + Product 2
Here is an example using the symbols for Tin, which is Sn, in its oxidized form, which is SnO2, combined with hydrogen gas, which is written as H2. SnO2 + H2 → Sn + H2O.
But this equation is not balanced since the quantity of reactants must equal the quantity of products. The left side has one more oxygen atom than the right side.Use basic math to balance the equation by indicating 2 hydrogen units on the left side of the equation, and 2 water molecules on the right. The final balanced equation looks like this: SnO2 + 2 H2 → Sn + 2 H2O ., If you are having trouble balancing chemical equations, think about the equation as part of a recipe, but one that needs adjusting on both sides, so you can make more of less of your recipe.


The equation gives you the ingredients, on the left side of the equation, but does not tell you how much to use of each ingredient. The equation also tells you what the products will include, but again does not tell you the quantity of the products. You have to figure that out.
Using the previous example, SnO2 + H2 → Sn + H2O, consider why this equation, or recipe formula, won’t work. The Sn parts are equal on both sides, and the H2 parts are equal on both sides. But the left side has 2 oxygen parts, and the right side has only 1 oxygen.
Change the right side of the equation to indicate the product will contain 2 H2O parts. The 2 in front of the H2O means all the quantities in that grouping are now doubled. So now the oxygen balances, but adding the 2 means there is more hydrogen on the right side of the equation than on the left. Go back to the left and change the H2 ingredient to be twice that, by putting a 2 in front of the H2.
Now you have adjusted the ingredients on both sides of the equation. What goes into the recipe and what comes out, are equal, or balanced.

, In your chemistry class, you will learn to add symbols to your balanced equations that represent the physical state of the elements. These symbols will include (s) for solids, (g) for gases, and (l) for liquids., Chemical reactions start with the basic elements, or already combined elements, called reactants. Combining two or more reactants together results in a single product, or several products.


To pass chemistry, you will need to know how to solve equations that involve chemical reactants, products, and the introduction of some other influence that alters either the reactants, products, or both., Chemical reactions can occur as result of many influences, in addition to just simply combining ingredients.


Common types of chemical reactions you can expect to learn about include synthesis, analysis, substitution, double displacement, acid-base, oxidation-reduction, combustion, isomerization, and hydrolysis.The types of reactions presented in your chemistry class may vary, depending on the goals of each class. High school chemistry may not provide the same level of detail as that of chemistry taken at a college or university.

, You will need to grasp the differences in each type of reaction covered in your class. Use resources made available to you by your teacher or professor to understand the different types of reactions covered in your class. Don’t be afraid to ask questions.


Understanding the changes that happen with different types of chemical reactions can be confusing. Understanding what happens during specific chemical reactions can be a challenging section of your chemistry class.

, Try not to make it harder than it already is by getting caught up in the terminology. The types of chemical reactions you will learn about simply involve doing something to change something.


For example, you already know what happens when you combine 2 hydrogen atoms with 1 oxygen atom, you get water. So if you put that water you just made into a pot, and put it on the stove using heat, something changes. You created a chemical reaction. If you put that water into the freezer, same thing. You introduced a change that altered the original reactant, water in this case.
Go over each type of reaction one by one until you understand it, then move on to the next type. Focus on the energy source that drives the reaction, and the primary changes that result.
If you are having trouble in this area, make a list of what is confusing to you, and go over it with your professor, your study group, or someone that knows chemistry well.

, In chemistry, very detailed calculations are sometimes needed, but other times, just basic math skills are adequate. It is important to understand the proper sequence for completing computations in an equation.Memorize a helpful phrase. The phrase, “Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally” tells you what applications to perform first. The first letter of each word indicates the order to be used. Anything in Parentheses is done first, then Exponentiation, Multiplication or Division, the lastly Addition or Subtraction.
Complete the calculation 3 + 2 x 6 = ___, by ordering your steps according to the phrase. The answer to the equation is 15.

, While rounding numbers is not unique to chemistry, the answers to some of the complex math equations result in numbers that are too long to write. Pay close attention to any directions provided in rounding your answers.Know where to round up or down. If the digit next in the series is a 4 or less, then round down, and if it is a 5 or greater round up. For example, consider the number 6.66666666666666. You are asked to round your answer to the second decimal place. The answer is 6.67., In chemistry, some numbers are referred to as absolute value, and not their real mathematical value. Absolute value is the distance from the number to zero.


In other words, you no longer consider positive or negatives, just the distance to zero. For example, the absolute value of -20, is 20., Here are a few examples.


Measures of matter are expressed in moles (mol).
Temperature is expressed in degrees Fahrenheit (°F), Kelvin (°K), or Celsius (°C).
Mass is expressed in grams (g), kilograms (kg), or milligrams (mg).
Liquid measures are expressed in liters (L), or milliliters (mls).

, Part of passing your chemistry class will involve making conversions from one accepted scale to another. This may include changing from one temperature measurement to another, changing pounds to kilograms, and ounces to liters.


You may be asked to provide answers in units other than what was in the original question. For example, you may be given a temperature equation to solve in Celsius, and asked to give the final answer in Kelvin.
Kelvin is the international standard for temperature measurements often used in chemical reactions. Practice changing from degrees Celsius to degrees Kelvin or Fahrenheit.

, As you are exposed to various conversions in your class, take the time to learn how to convert from one to the other, and back again.

, Sharpen your basic math skills in the areas of percentages, ratios, and proportions.

, To pass chemistry, you will need to be comfortable calculating ratios, proportions, percentages, and then back again. If this is difficult for you, practice using other common units of measure, like those found on food labels.


Look at the nutrition label on any food product. You will see calories per serving, per cent of RDAs, total fat, calories from fat, total carbs, and a breakdown of the different types of carbs. Practice by calculating different ratios and proportions using different categories for the bottom number.
For example, calculate the amount of monounsaturated fat per the total amount of fat. Change this to a percent. Calculate how many calories are in the entire container by using the numbers provided for calories per serving and servings per container. Calculate how much sodium is contained in ½ of the full container.
By practicing conversions like this, regardless of the units used, you will be much more comfortable exchanging these units of measure for chemistry measures, such as moles per liter, or grams per ml, etc.

, This is the number that represents the number of molecules, atoms, or particles, found in one mole. Avogrado’s number is 6.022x10 23.For example, 0.450 moles of Fe contains how many atoms? The answer is 0.450 x 6.022x10 23., If you have trouble understanding how to apply Avogadro’s number, think in terms of carrots instead of atoms, molecules, or particles. How many carrots are in a dozen? Well you know that a dozen contains 12 of something, so there are 12 carrots in one dozen.


Now answer the question, how many carrots are in a mole? Instead of multiplying by 12, you multiple using Avogadro’s number. So there are 6.022 x 1023 carrots in one mole.
Avogadro’s number is used to convert anything of substance, an atom, molecule, particle, or carrot, to how many of that thing is contained in one mole.
If you know the number of moles of something, then the final value for the number of molecules, atoms, or particles present, is that number times Avogrado’s number.Understanding how to convert particles to moles is an important part of passing chemistry. Molar conversions are a part of calculating ratios and proportions. This means the quantity of something in moles as a part of something else.

, Consider the number of moles of something contained in a liquid environment. This example is an important one to understand, since we are now talking about Molarity, or the proportion of something expressed as moles per liter.


Molarity is commonly used in chemistry to express the quantity of something in a liquid environment, or the amount of a solute contained in a liquid solution. Molarity is calculated by dividing the moles of solute by the liters of solution. Molarity is expressed as moles per liter.Calculate density. Density is also a commonly used measure in chemistry. Density is the measure of mass per unit volume of a chemical substance. The most common expression for density is given in grams per milliliter, or grams per cubic centimeter, which are the same thing., This means that final answers for equations will be considered wrong unless you have broken them down to their simplest form.This does not apply to molecular formulas since that type of description tells you the exact proportions of chemical elements that make up the molecule., You don’t change a molecular formula to its simplest, or empirical, form because the molecular formula tells you exactly what makes up the molecule.


A molecular formula is written in language that uses the abbreviation of the element(s), and how many atoms of each element, make up the molecule.
For example, the molecular formula for water is H2O. This means every water molecule contains 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. The molecular formula for acetaminophen is C8H9NO2. Every chemical compound is represented by its molecular formula.

, You will likely come across this term. It is a description of the way chemistry is expressed using mathematical formulas. Using chemistry math, or stoichiometry, values of elements and chemical compounds are often represented in terms of moles, molar percent, moles per liter, or moles per kg.As a common math procedure, you will need to convert grams to moles. The atomic mass unit of an element, in grams, is equal to one mole of that substance. For example, calcium has a mass of 40 atomic mass units. Therefore, 40 grams of calcium equals one mole of calcium., If the math equations and conversions are not coming easily for you, talk to your teacher or professor. Ask for more problems that you can work on your own, until the concepts involved, and all the factors of conversion, make sense to you.

, Lewis diagrams are sometimes called electron-dot diagrams. These are simple diagrams that use dots to represent the paired and unpaired electrons in the outer shell of an atom.Lewis structures are useful in drawing simple diagrams that identify bonds, such as covalent bonds, that are shared between elements in an atom or molecule., Lewis diagrams operate on the octet rule, which states that atoms are stable when it has access to eight electrons in the outer shell. Hydrogen is the exception, and is considered stable with two electrons in the outer shell., The symbol for an element, surrounded by an arrangement of dots, is a Lewis diagram. Think of the diagram as a still frame of a movie. Instead of the electrons swirling around the outside of the element, they are represented as a fixed moment in time.The diagram shows the stable arrangement of electrons, where they bond to the next element, and information about the strength of the bonds, like if the bonds are shared or doubled.
Think about the octet rule, and picture the symbol for an element, perhaps C for carbon. Now place or picture 2 dots at each compass position, meaning 2 dots north of the C, east, west, and south. Now picture an H, representing a hydrogen atom on the other side of each of the 2 dots. This completed Lewis diagram means that the single carbon atom in the center is surrounded by 4 hydrogen atoms. The electrons are bonded in a covalent manner, meaning the carbon and hydrogen atoms share one of their electrons to bond to each other.The molecular formula for this example is CH4, and is the formula for methane gas.

, The Lewis diagrams are a simplistic visual representation of what is understood about chemical bonds.


Talk to your professor, or members of your study group if the concepts about chemical bonding and Lewis diagrams are not clear.

, Chemistry has its own rules for nomenclature. The types of reactions that happen to chemical compounds, the loss or gain of electrons in their outer shell, and the stability or instability of compounds are part of the chemistry nomenclature.

, Most beginning chemistry classes have a section devoted just to nomenclature. In some schools, failure to pass the nomenclature part of the class, means failing the class.


If possible, work on nomenclature before you actually begin the class. Many workbooks are available for purchase or through online access.

, Understanding what superscript and subscript numbers mean will be critical to passing your chemistry class.The superscript numbers follow a pattern found in the periodic table, and indicate the overall charge of the element or chemical compound. Review the periodic table to see elements in vertical rows that share the same superscript numbers.
Subscript numbers are used to identify the quantity of each identified element that is part of the chemical compound. As previously discussed, the subscript of 2 in the molecule H2O tells you that there are 2 hydrogen atoms as a part of that molecule.

, Part of the nomenclature used in chemistry involves specific rules on naming the products from specific types of reactions.One of those reactions is the oxidative-reduction reaction. This reaction involves the process of either gaining or losing electrons.
An easy way to remember the process is to remember the phrase “LEO the lion says GER”. This stands for Lose Electrons in Oxidation, and Gain Electrons in Reduction., Scientists use subscripts to identify the final molecular formula of a compound, which also indicates a stable compound with a neutral charge.


To make a neutral charge, the positively charged ion, called a cation, must be balanced by an equal charge from a negative ion, called an anion. The charges are identified as superscripts.For example, the magnesium ion carries a +2 cation charge, and the nitrogen ion has a -3 anion charge. The +2 and -3 would be indicated as superscripts. To properly combine the two elements to arrive at a neutral charge, 3 magnesium atoms are used for every 2 nitrogen items.The nomenclature that identifies this uses subscripts, and is written as Mg3N2., The elements on the periodic table that fall in the first column of elements are considered alkalis, and form +1 cation charges. For example Na+ and Li+.The alkaline earth metals found in the second column form 2+ cations, such as Mg2+ and Ba2+.Elements in the seventh column are called halogens, and form -1 anions, such as Cl- and I-., To help you pass your chemistry class, be as familiar as possible with the nomenclature attached to groups of elements. This type of superscript does not change.In other words, magnesium is always represented as Mg, and always carries a cation charge of +2., The detailed information about the different types of chemical reactions, the sharing of electrons, changing the charge of an element or compound, and knowing what the different types of reactions do, can be very confusing.


Break down areas that are difficult into describable terms. For example, be able to verbalize that you do not understand oxidation reactions, or how to combine elements with positive and negative charges. By verbalizing the areas you are having difficulty understanding, you may also find some reassurance in realizing there is much you have learned and do understand.

, Keep a list of areas that are difficult, and ask your professor or teacher for help. This provides you with an opportunity to understand the difficult topics before the class moves on to the next section, and you get even more confused.

, Understand that the written forms of indicating charges, the number of atoms in a molecule, and the bonds formed to hold molecules together, are all part of the language of chemistry. All this is a written way of representing what happens in the chemical reactions that can’t actually be seen.


It would be so much easier to understand if everything was visible, right in front of you. But in addition to comprehending all the chemistry that is happening, you also have to understand the language used to record and represent everything to do with chemistry.
If understanding chemistry is difficult for you, realize that you are not alone, but don’t let it beat you. Talk with your professor, your study group, a teaching assistant, or someone that is really good at chemistry. You can learn all this, but it may help if it can be explained in a way that makes sense to you.

Buy a neutralizing agent.,
Measure your neutralizing agent.,
Bleach your fabric.,
Rinse the fabric.,
Soak bleached fabric in neutralizer.,
Wash and rinse.",How to Neutralize Bleach1," There are several cost-effective choices for neutralizing chlorine bleach (commonly sold under the brand name Clorox), which is the kind used in washing and for decorating or changing the color of fabric products. It also contains sodium hydroxide (lye) to stabilize the hypochlorite. The lye is difficult to rinse out completely and will slowly destroy cotton. To fully neutralize the lingering effects of chlorine bleach the hypochlorite and the lye must be neutralized, too. If you’re using bleach for decorative effects on cotton, denim, or other natural fabrics, you can try one of these options:


Bisulfite/metabisulfite is very inexpensive. It is sold under the brand name Anti-Chlor, and you only need to use a small amount to neutralize bleach. You can usually find bisulfite at dye suppliers or you can get Camden Tablets (which have the same ingredient) from a wine brewing supply company.Thiosulfate, which is called Bleach Stop, can typically be found at a local photography supply store, as it is commonly used in developing photographs. This is a more expensive option than bisulfite, and it’s not as strong so you’ll need to use more.Hydrogen peroxide is the most easily obtainable of the three neutralizers; you can find it at drugstores and grocery stores. This is an inexpensive choice, and it works well for people with asthma, who may be sensitive to the other compounds, which contain sulfur. Opt for the 3% solution.;
, The amount of neutralizing agent required will depend on which one you’ve chosen.


Anti-Chlor: use 1 teaspoon per quart of water.Bleach Stop: 1 ounce by weight (30 grams) per gallon of water.Hydrogen peroxide: 1 part hydrogen peroxide to 10 parts water.Vitamin C/Absorbic acid: Absorbic acid neutralizes both the hypochlorite and the lye. You will find it in most food stores or pharmacies under its common name, vitamin C. Yes, get the cheapest vitamin C you can find and grind the tablets up into powder to dissolve in your rinse water. You may not know the exact quantity of ascorbic acid to use, because you almost certainly won't know exactly how much sodium hypochlorite and sodium hydroxide you are neutralizing. Just use plenty and rinse the excess out along with the products of the neutralizing chemical reaction. If some remains, it will certainly smell better than any of the sulphites or thiosulphate.

, Following the directions on the bottle, use the bleach to achieve the desired effect/shade on your fabric.

, Before you use your neutralizer, you want to rinse the fabric well with warm water to remove all of the bleach.Fill your bucket or stationary tub with rinse water ‘‘before’’ you begin bleaching.This way, you can be sure to get the bleach off your fabric as soon as necessary so you don’t remove more than the desired amount of color.

, Soak your fabric in the neutralizing agent mixed with the appropriate amount of warm water. Depending on the size of the fabric item(s) you may want to use a bucket or a stationary tub. It may or may not be cost-effective for you to do your neutralizing in the washing machine.


Whatever neutralizing agent you use, the quantity needed depends upon the quantity of bleach remaining in the material that has been bleached, not the amount of water.
Fabric should soak in the neutralizer for about 10 minutes.

, Wash your neutralized fabric in warm water with laundry detergent and rinse well.

Determine what neutralizing agent you need.,
Bleach your wood.,
Rinse the wood.,
Mix your neutralizer.,
Apply your neutralizing agent.",How to Neutralize Bleach2," Different types of wood bleaching processes require different types of bleach, and different types of bleach, in turn, call for different types of agents to neutralize their action.


If you’ve used alkali peroxide—which is popular for lightening the color of wood—you will want to neutralize with white vinegar.This is an inexpensive neutralizer that you can find at your local grocery store.
When bleaching with oxalic acid, which is good for removing stains such as iron, you want to use baking soda as a neutralizer.Like white vinegar, baking soda is cheap and can be easily found at the grocery store.
Chlorine bleach used on wood only needs to be rinsed several times with distilled water., Use your chosen bleach to remove the stain from your piece of wood, or to lighten its color, allowing the bleach to sit for the recommended amount of time.

, Once you have achieved your cleaning or color lightening goal, rinse the wood several times using distilled water before you move on to any neutralizing methods.


This will be sufficient for neutralizing the effects of chlorine bleach.

, If you are using vinegar to neutralize peroxide bleach, mix one part vinegar to two parts water. To neutralize oxalic acid, mix two tablespoons of baking soda with a half pint of hot water., Use a sponge or a rag to apply the neutralizing agent to your wood in any place that the bleach has touched and allow it to dry.

Pour hydrogen peroxide in a glass.,
Add vinegar.,
Submerge the material.",How to Remove Copper on the Surface of Materials1," Hydrogen peroxide will help to oxidize the copper. Unfortunately, it can degrade pretty quickly, making your solution weaker. Start off with about 30 mL of hydrogen peroxide in a beaker.You can add more hydrogen peroxide to keep the reaction going longer. This will be necessary if you have a lot of material (more than the size of a penny).
You should use a solution of 35% hydrogen peroxide or stronger.;
, Add twice as much vinegar as you did hydrogen peroxide. The vinegar will help to make the solution more acidic. This will act on the copper ions that are formed by the hydrogen peroxide oxidation.For example, if you add 30 mL of hydrogen peroxide, you will need 60 mL of vinegar.

, When you submerge the material, you will start to see bubbling. This is an indication that the reaction is going. As the reaction proceeds, you will start to notice the solution turn blue.Note that this reaction takes a long time, and it is not particularly effective. If you have a large object or a thick layer of copper, another method should be used. Just to remove the copper from a penny it could take hours or days.
Remove the object when you are finished and pour the solution into a labeled bottle. The solution should be turned over to a professional waste contractor.

Memorize the periodic table.,
Remember to add the word ion.,
Use element names for positive ions.,
Add the -ide suffix for negative ions.",How to Name Ions1," In order to remember the names of ions, you will need to remember the names of the elements that form them. Commit the periodic table to memory, and you will have a much easier time naming ions.


It's fine to consult the periodic table if you can't remember the name for an element.;
, In order to distinguish an ion from an atom, you must use the word ion at the end of the name., The simplest ions to name are positively charged monoatomic ions with single oxidation states. These simply take the same name as the element that forms them.For example, the name for the element Na is sodium, so the name for Na+ is sodium ion.
Positively charged ions are also known as cations.

, Monoatomic ions with a negative charge and a single oxidation state are named using the stem form of the element name, with the addition of the suffix -ide.For example, the name for the element O2 is oxygen, so the name for O2- is oxide ion. The name for the element F is fluorine, so the name for F- is flouride ion.
Negatively charged ion are also known as anions.

Put the material in a glass beaker.,
Add the nitric acid to the beaker.,
Pour in water.",How to Remove Copper on the Surface of Materials2," Add your copper coated material to a glass beaker. If it is too large to fit in a beaker, use a glass tub or tray. Place the glass container outside or underneath a fume hood before proceeding.Plastics and many metals will be dissolved using this method. Only place items that are made from gold, platinum, iron, nickel, aluminum, chromium, or cobalt in the beaker.

, Pour concentrated nitric acid in the beaker. You should pour enough to cover the surface of the material that you are cleaning. You will see a dark gas form above the surface of the liquid. This is nitrogen dioxide gas.Nitric acid is a strong acid. Wear gloves and goggles. Do not get the acid on your skin or in your eyes. Do not inhale fumes from the acid, and do not ingest it.
Nitrogen dioxide is toxic. This must be done in a fume hood or other well ventilated area. Do not inhale the nitrogen dioxide.
If you do get the acid on your skin or eyes, wash with water for 15 minutes.

, When the reaction has completed, pour water into the beaker or flask. This will dilute the copper ions and create a light blue color. It will also dilute any excess acid and allow you to retrieve the remaining material.You should use tongs to remove the material. Do not put your hand in the solution!
The reaction is complete when no more gas is being formed.

Select a grinding tool.,
Grind the copper from the surface.,
Smooth the material underneath.,
Polish any metal underneath.",How to Remove Copper on the Surface of Materials3," Depending on the size of the object you plan to grind, you might use a grinding wheel, a sander, or even a sand blaster. A sander is best suited for minimal abrasion to break through a thin layer of copper. A grinding wheel will be more aggressive and help you cut through a thicker layer of copper, but the sandblaster will be ideal for removing copper from a larger object.


You should also consider the material underneath the copper. If you are dealing with a soft metal or plastic, a grinding wheel might do more damage than a sander or sand blaster.

, Grinding removes the copper layer mechanically instead of chemically. This means that you will likely have to press pretty hard with a sander or grinding wheel. You should also be wearing goggles and a respirator.Inhaling metal shavings can be dangerous.
Metal shavings can cut your eyes if they get in them.

, Once you have removed the copper layer, you will notice grooves and marks left on the material underneath. This happens because once you break through the copper layer, you begin to grind the surface of the material. Smooth out the surface of the material by sanding those grooves down with a finer sandpaper, and wiping the surface clean.For example, you might use a 180 grit sandpaper to get out the initial scratches, and the move to a 300 grit sandpaper to smooth things out even more (a higher grit produces finer scratches).

, If you are removing copper from the surface of another metal, you might need to polish that metal afterward. Most metals have specific polishes that you can buy commercially, such as aluminum polish or chrome polish. Apply the polish according to the manufacturer’s instructions to make your metal shine and protect it from the environment.

Know which ions can have more than one oxidation state.,
Use the roman numeral system.,
Be familiar with the old system.",How to Name Ions2," The oxidation state of an ion simply means how many electrons it gains or loses. Most transition metals, which are grouped together in the periodic table of elements, have more than one oxidation state.The oxidation state of an ion is equal to its charge, which is the number of electrons the ion has.
Scandium and zinc are the only two transition metals that do not have more than one oxidation state.

, The most common way to indicate the oxidation state of an ion is to use roman numeral in parentheses to indicate the charge.Continue to use the element name as you would for any positive ion. For example, Fe2+ is called iron (II) ion.
Transition metals do not carry negative charges, so you will not have to worry about adding the -ide suffix., While the roman numeral system is more common today, you may encounter the older naming system, especially on labels. This system adds the suffix -ous to the ion with the lower positive charge, and the suffix -ic to the ion with the higher positive charge.The suffixes -ous and -ic are relative, which means they do not correspond directly to numbers. For example, iron (II) ion would be called ferrous ion using the old system, and iron (III) ion would be called ferric ion, because iron (II) has a lower positive charge than iron (III). Similarly, copper (I) ion would be called cuprous ion and copper (II) ion would be called cupric ion because copper (I) has a lower positive charge than copper (II).
This system does not work well for ions that can have more than two possible charges, which is why the roman numeral system is preferred.

Understand what a polyatomic ion is.,
Memorize the names of common polyatomic ions.,
Learn the pattern for negatively charged polyatomic atoms.",How to Name Ions3," Polyatomic ions are simply ions that contain more than one type of element. These are distinct from ionic compounds, which are formed when positively charged ions bond with negatively charged ions.As with ions, there is a system for naming ionic compounds.

, The naming system for polyatomic ions is quite complex, so you may want to start by memorizing the ones that you will need to recall most often.Common polyatomic ions include bicarbonate ion (HCO3-), hydrogen sulfate ion or bisulfate ion (HSO4-), acetate ion (CH3CO2-), perchlorate ion (ClO4-), nitrate ion (NO3-), chlorate ion (ClO3-), nitrite ion (NO2-), chlorite ion (ClO2-), permanganate ion (MnO4-), hypochlorite ion (ClO-), cyanide ion (CN-), hydroxide ion (OH-), carbonate ion (CO32-), peroxide ion (O22-), sulfate ion (SO42-), chromate ion (CrO42-), sulfite ion (SO32-), dichromate ion (Cr2O72-), thiosulfate ion (S2O32-), hydrogen phosphate ion (HPO42-), phosphate ion (PO43-), arsenate ion (AsO43-), and borate ion (BO33-)
The ammonium ion (NH4+), is the only positively charged polyatomic ion (or polyatomic cation)., Although complex, there is a pattern to the naming system for negatively charged polyatomic ions (or polyatomic anions). Once you understand the pattern, you will be able to name any ion.Use the -ite suffix to indicate a low oxidation state. For example, the NO2- ion is the nitrite ion.
Use the -ate suffix to indicate a high oxidation state. For example, the NO3- ion is the nitrate ion.
Use the hypo- prefix to indicate the very lowest oxidation state. For example, the ClO- ion is the hypochlorite ion.
Use the per- prefix (as in hyper-) to indicate the very highest oxidation state. For example, the ClO4- ion is the perchlorate ion.
Exceptions to the pattern include hydroxide (OH-), cyanide (CN-), and peroxide (O22-) ions, which have the -ide ending because they were once thought to be monatomic ions.

Calibrate the probe and meter following the manufacturer specifications.,
Collect a sample of the water in a clean container.,
Adjust the meter to match the sample temperature.,
Put the probe into the sample.,
Read the pH measurement of the sample.",How to Measure the pH of Water1," You may need to calibrate the meter by testing it in a substance with a known pH rating. You can then adjust the meter accordingly. If you will be testing water away from a lab, you may want to perform this calibration several hours before you take the meter to the field.Rinse the probe with clean water before using it. Dry it off with a clean tissue.;
,


The water sample must be deep enough to cover the tip of the electrode.
Let the sample sit for a moment so the temperature can stabilize
Measure the temperature of the sample using a thermometer.

, The probe's sensitivity is affected by the temperature of the water, and so the reading of the meter cannot be accurate if you do not input the temperature data., Wait for the meter to come to equilibrium. The meter has reached equilibrium when the measurement becomes steady.

, Your pH meter should provide a reading on the scale of 0-14. If the water is pure it should read close to 7. Record your findings.

Know what makes a compound ionic.,
Build the name.,
Recognize transition metals.",How to Name Chemical Compounds1," Ionic compounds contain a metal and a nonmetal. Refer to the periodic table of elements to see what categories the elements in the compound belong to.;
, For a two element ionic compound, the naming is simple. The first part of the name is the name of the metal element. The second part is the name of the nonmetal element, with the suffix “-ide.”


Example: Al2O3. Al2 = Aluminium; O3 = Oxygen. So the name would be “aluminium oxide.”

, Metals in the D and F blocks of the periodic table are known as transition metals. Their charge is written with a Roman numeral when writing out the compound name. This is because they can have more than one charge and make more than one compound.


Example: FeCl2 and FeCl3. Fe = Iron; Cl2 = Chloride -2; Cl3 = Chloride -3. The names would be iron(II) chloride and iron(III) chloride.

Compare the end of the test strip with the color chart that came with the paper.",How to Measure the pH of Water2," To obtain an accurate reading of a solution, you can use pH paper. This is not to be confused with the common litmus paper. Both can be used to test for acids and bases, but they differ in important ways.pH strips contain a series of indicator bars that will all change color after exposure to a solution. The strength of the acids and bases on each bar differs. After they change, the color pattern of the bars can be matched to the examples that come with the kit.
Litmus paper are strips of paper that contain an acid or a base (alkaline). The most common of these are red (which contains an acid that reacts with bases) and blue (which contains a base that reacts with acids). The red strips turn blue if the substance is alkaline, and the blue strips turn red if they contact an acid. Litmus papers can be used to provide a quick and easy test, but the cheapest of them do not always provide accurate readings on the strength of the solution.

, The water sample must be deep enough to cover the test strip.

, Just a few seconds of exposure will suffice. The different indicator bars on the paper will begin changing color within a few moments.

, The color(s) on the chart should match the color(s) of your test strip. The chart should correlate color patterns to pH levels.

Learn about how acids and bases are defined.,
Understand the pH scale.,
Get to know why we test the pH of water.",How to Measure the pH of Water3," Acidity and alkalinity (the term used to describe bases) are both defined by the hydrogen ions they lose or accept. An acid is a substance that loses (or, some say, donates) hydrogen ions. A base is a substance that accepts additional hydrogen ions.

, The pH number is used to rate the level of acidity or alkalinity of water soluble substances. Water normally contains an equal amount of hydroxide ions (OH-) and hydronium ions (H30+). When an acidic or alkaline substance is added to water, they change the proportion of hydroxide and hydronium ions.It is typically said to be on a scale of 0 to 14 (though substances can actually be fall beyond that range). Neutral substances rate close to 7, acidic ones below 7, and alkaline substances are above 7.
The pH scale is a logarithmic scale, meaning that differences of a single integer actually represent a tenfold difference in acidity or alkalinity. For instance, a substance that has a pH of 2 is actually ten times more acidic than one with a pH of 3 and 100 times more acidic than a substance with a pH of 4. The scale functions similarly for alkaline substances, with one integer representing a tenfold difference in alkalinity.

, Pure water should have a pH of 7, though common tap water has a pH between 6 and 5.5. Highly acidic water (water with a low pH) is more likely to dissolve toxic chemicals. These can contaminate the water and make it unsafe for human consumption.It is often considered best to test pH on site. If you collect a water sample for study in a lab, carbon dioxide in the air can dissolve into the water. The dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the ions in the water to increase acidity in basic or neutral solutions. To prevent carbon dioxide contamination, you must test water within 2 hours of collection."

Recognize that salts containing Group 1A elements are soluble.,
Know that salts containing nitrates, chlorates, and acetates are soluble.,
Understand that all ammonium salts are soluble.,
Know that most hydroxide compounds are insoluble.,
Recognize that salts containing Group 17 nonmetals are generally soluble.,
Know that most carbonates, chromates, and phosphates are insoluble.,
Understand that most sulfate salts are soluble.,
Recognize that most sulfides are insoluble in water.",How to Memorize the Solubility Rules for Common Ionic Compounds in Water1," The periodic table is organized into rows and columns called periods and groups, respectively. The first column of the table contains the Group 1A elements. They are the alkali metals and include Li, Na, K, Cs, and Rb.For example: KCl and LiOH are soluble in water.;
, When a nitrate, NO3-, chlorate, ClO3-, or acetate, CH3COO-, form a salt, they are soluble in water.For example: KNO3, NaClO3, and CH3COONa are all soluble., The ammonium ion, NH4+, makes salt compounds that completely dissociate in the presence of water. There are no exceptions to this rule.For example: NH4OH is soluble even though it contains a hydroxide.

, Some hydroxide salts are slightly soluble: hydroxides formed with Group 2 elements (Ca, Sr, and Ba). The exception to this rule is that hydroxide salts formed with Group 1 elements are soluble because Group 1A elements are always soluble.For example: Fe(OH)3, Al(OH)3, and Co(OH)2 are insoluble, but LiOH and NaOH are soluble.

, Group 17 nonmetals include chlorine (Cl-), bromine (Br-), and iodine (I-). Exceptions to this rule include silver, lead, and mercury. Compounds consisting of these nonmetals and ions are not soluble.For example: AgCl and Hg2Cl2 are both insoluble.
Note that PbCl2, PbBr2, and PbI2 are soluble in HOT water., The chemical formulas for each of these are as follows: CO3 (carbonates), CrO4 (chromates), and PO4 (phosphates). Exceptions to this rule include the Group 1A metals and NH4+ compounds which are soluble.


For example: Compounds like CaCO3, PbCrO4, and Ag3PO4 are all insoluble while compounds like Na3PO4 and (NH4)2CO3 are soluble.

, Most of the salt compounds containing SO4 are soluble in water. Exceptions to this rule include the following ions Ca+2, Ba+2, Pb+2, Ag+, Sr+2, and Hg+2. Sulfate salts containing these ions are insoluble.For example: Na2SO4 is completely soluble, but CaSO4 and BaSO4 are not soluble., As with many of the other rules, there are exceptions including barium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and ammonium. Only sulfide compounds made with these elements are soluble in water.For example: CdS, FeS, and ZnS are all insoluble."

Understand what a polyatomic compound is.,
Memorize the most common ion groups.,
Build compound names based off the list.",How to Name Chemical Compounds2," These compounds are built off of groups of atoms that are bonded together, and the entire group has a positive or negative charge. You can do three basic things to polyatomic compounds:


Add a hydrogen to the beginning of the compound. The word “hydrogen” is added to the beginning of the compound name. This reduces the negative charge by one. For example, “carbonate” CO32- becomes “hydrogen carbonate” HCO3-.






Remove an oxygen from the compound. The charge stays the same and the ending of the compound changes from “-ate” to “–ite”. For example: NO3 to NO2 goes from “nitrate” to “nitrite.”






Replace the central atom with another from the same periodic group. For example, sulfate SO42- can become Selenate SeO42-.







, These are the basis for forming most polyatomic compounds. Listed in order of increasing negative charge, they are:


Hydroxide ion: OH-

Nitrate ion: NO3-

Hydrogen carbonate ion: HCO3-

Permanganate ion: MnO4-

Carbonate ion: CO32-

Chromate ion: CrO42-

Dichromate ion: Cr2O72-

Sulfate ion: SO42-

Sulphite ion: SO32-

Thiosulfate ion: S2O3<2-
Phosphate ion: PO43-

Ammonium ion: NH4+


, Associate whatever element(s) is attached to the group ion and name accordingly. If the element comes in front of the ion group, the name of the element is simply added to the beginning of the compound name.

Example: KMnO4. You should recognize the MnO4- ion as permanganate. K is potassium, so the compound is named potassium permanganate.






Example: NaOH. You should recognize the OH- ion as hydroxide. Na is sodium, so the compound is named sodium hydroxide.







"
"
Understand a covalent compound.,
Learn the prefixes.,
Name the compounds.",How to Name Chemical Compounds3," Covalent compounds are formed by two or more nonmetal elements. The name for the compound is based off how many atoms are present. The prefix attached is the Latin term for the number of molecules.

, Memorize the prefixes for up to 10 atoms:


1 atom – “Mono-“
2 atoms – “Di-“
3 atoms – “Tri-“
4 atoms – “Tetra-“
5 atoms – “Penta-“
6 atoms – “Hexa-“
7 atoms – “Hepta-“
8 atoms – “Octa-“
9 atoms – “Nona-“
10 atoms – “Deca-“

, Using the correct prefixes, name the new compound. You attach prefixes to any part of the compound that has multiple atoms.

Example: CO would be carbon monoxide and CO2 would be carbon dioxide.






Example: N2S3 would be Dinitrogen trisulfide.






In most cases, the “mono-“ prefix can be omitted, because it is implied when it is not present. It is still used for carbon monoxide due to the term being in use since early chemistry.







"
"
Name the first element in the compound.,
Write the Greek prefix for the number of the second atom.,
Name the second atom and end it with ""-ide."",
Add a Greek prefix at the beginning if there is more than one of the first atom.,
Put it all together.,
Know that certain compounds are exceptions to normal naming rules.",How to Name Covalent Compounds2," Molecular formulas are read from left to right, just like English words. Generally, the first atom (the one on the left of the molecular formula) is also the least-abundant atom in the compound, though there are exceptions. Write the name of this atom first.


For example, in the molecular formula CF4, Carbon (C) comes first, so we write it first: ""Carbon""

If you only know the atoms in the molecule and you don't know the molecular formula, don't worry. In covalent compounds, the element that comes first in this list gets written first in the molecular formula:B, Si, C, Sb, As, P, N, H, Te, Se, S, I, Br, Cl, O, F




Note that there is one exception: when oxygen is paired with a halogen (a Period 7 element like F, Cl, etc.), the halogen comes first., Next, look at the second atom in the molecule. Determine how many times it appears in the molecule. This is the number written in subscript next to it in the molecular formula. If there is no number next to the second atom, it appears once. Find the appropriate Greek prefix from the table above and write it next.


In our sample element, CF4, fluorine is the second element and it appears four times. We'll write the Greek prefix for four, tetra, next, like this: ""Carbon tetra-""


, Now, simply write the name of the second atom as if it were an anion (negatively-charged ion). In other words, just stick ""-ide"" on the end. For example, oxygen becomes ""oxide,"" chlorine becomes ""chloride,"" and so on.In our sample element, CF4, fluorine is the second element, so we'll write it at the end. Be sure to add the -ide ending, like this: ""Carbon tetrafluoride"".
Notice that the Greek prefix and the second atom form a single word together. They are never written as two separate words.

, Determine how many times the first atom appears in the molecule. If you have the molecular formula, this will be the number written in subscript after the first atom. Again, if there is no number, the first atom appears once. If the atom does appear more than once, write its Greek prefix at the beginning of the name.


In our sample element, CF4, carbon appears once, so we don't have to do anything. We wouldn't write ""mono"" at the beginning. You only use ""mono"" for the second atom — never the first.

, Congratulations — you're done. Your compound's name is written in this form:


followed by We already know our compound's name: Carbon tetrafluoride.

, The rules above will serve you well for nearly all normal binary covalent molecules. However, a few select molecules get special names that are almost always used when they're discussed in scientific settings. There isn't really any way to predict these — you just have to learn them. A few examples include:H2O is not Hydrogen dioxide. It's ""water.""

NH3 is not Nitrogen trihydride. It's ""ammonia.""

CH4 is not Carbon tetrahydride. It's ""methane.""

Check whether the acid contains an oxygen.,
If there is not an oxygen, use the ""hydro- (name) -ic acid"" formula.,
If there is an oxygen, first name the oxygen anion.,
Figure out how many anions are in the same series as yours.,
Use the name of the oxygen anion to find the name of the acid.,
Acid name exceptions.",How to Name Covalent Compounds3," Acids are compounds that donate protons to chemical reactions. Often, acids start with one or more H atoms, though there are some exceptions.The first step to naming an acid is easy: first, quickly see whether there is any oxygen (O) in it.


For example, let's say that we're working with the acid HCl. This obviously does not have any oxygen in it.

, Naming acids without any oxygen is easy. First, write ""hydro-,"" then the name of the non-hydrogen atom, then ""-ic."" You will usually have to drop a letter or two off the name of the atom to get the word to ""flow"" properly — this is usually pretty intuitive. Finish with the word ""acid.""


For example, HCl becomes ""hydrochloric acid.""

Other examples include HF (hydrofluoric acid) and HI (hydroiodic acid).

, Acids that contain oxygen are a little trickier to name. It's usually easiest to start by naming the oxygen anion (the part of the molecule that has a negative charge with the oxygen in it). Usually, this is the part that's not the hydrogens. Use the steps below to name oxygen anions:, Anions are in the same series when you can add or subtract oxygens and keep the overall charge the same by changing the oxidation state of the cation (the positively-charged part of the anion). A good guide to oxidation states is available here.If there are two anions in the same series, the one with fewer oxygens ends with -ite and the one with more oxygens ends with -ate. For instance, SO32- and SO42- are both possible depending on whether S has an oxidation state of 4+ or 6+. The first is sulfite and the second is sulfate based on their number of oxygens.
If there are more than two anions in the same series, use the prefix ""hypo"" for the one with least oxygen and the prefix ""per-"" for the one with the most oxygen. For example, chlorine can form ClO-, ClO2-, ClO3-, and ClO4-. These are named hypochlorite, chlorite, chlorate, and perchlorate respectively.

, Now that you've named the oxygen anion, finding the name of the acid itself isn't difficult. Use the following naming rules:


If the anion ends in -ate, the acid ends with -ric or -ic.



Example: HClO2 is chlorous acid (from ""chlorite,"" the name of the oxygen anion).




If the anion ends in -ite, the acid ends with -ous.



Example: HClO3 is chloric acid (from ""chlorate,"" the name of the oxygen anion).




Add hypo- or per- to the beginning if the anion had these prefixes.



Example: HClO4 is perchlorous acid (from ""perchlorate,"" the name of the oxygen anion).





, As with normal covalent compounds, certain acids get special names that don't conform to the normal naming rules. There's no easy way to learn these, but they're easy to memorize as you start to come across them. Below are a few examples:


HCN is ""hydrocyanic acid."" Here, there's no oxygen, but you still get the name from the CN anion — not the name of either atom.
CH3COOH is ""acetic acid."" Technically, this compound is named with naming rules from organic chemistry, but these don't come into play with basic covalent compounds.

Use the mnemonic NAG SAG.,
Write PMS to represent the first exception.,
Remember Castro Bear to represent the second exception.",How to Memorize the Solubility Rules for Common Ionic Compounds in Water2," NAG SAG is an easy way to remember the soluble compounds and the exceptions to solubility. Write out NAG SAG as an acrostic and memorize what each letter stands for.Although this mnemonic doesn’t include all of the solubility rules, it does cover a lot of them. All of the letters represent soluble molecules.


N: Nitrates (NO3-)
A: Acetates (CH3COO-)
G: Group 1 alkali metals (Li+, Na+, etc)
S: Sulfates (SO4-2)
A: Ammonium ions (NH4+)
G: Group 17 nonmetals (F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, etc.)

, P stands for Pb+2 (lead). M stands for Mercury (Hg2+2). S stands for Silver (Ag+). These three ions are never soluble with the sulfate group or group 17 non-metals.When writing out the mnemonic, put a star next to PMS and a similar star next to the S and G of SAG to remember these are exceptions.

, Castro Bear may sound silly, but it stands for the three ions Calcium (Ca+2, Strontium (Sr+2), and Barium (Ba+2). These three ions are never soluble with sulfates.When writing the mnemonic, put a cross next to Castro Bear and another cross next to the S in SAG to remember that these ions are exceptions to the sulfate solubility.

Know why the rules exist.,
Keep a list of prefixes on-hand.,
Practice.",How to Name a Hydrocarbon Chain Using the IUPAC Method1," The IUPAC rules were created to phase out old names (such as ""toluene"") and replace them with a system that would be consistent, as well as providing information about the placement of substituents (the atoms or molecules attached to a hydrocarbon chain).

, These prefixes will help you name your hydrocarbons. They're based on the number of carbons in the parent chain (not altogether). For instance, CH3-CH3 would be ethane. Your professor probably won't expect you to know prefixes above 10; take note if he or she does expect it.

You can download the software from https://sourceforge.net/projects/avogadro/files/latest/download.;
, After downloading, click and open the program. It might take a minute or two to load, but do not worry or get frustrated and give it time.

, For these instructions we'll start with something simple, a carbon dioxide molecule., In this program, you are allowed to pick the what you want to see on the model. For example, if you want each element to be labeled in the molecule, select the ""Label"" option in the left hand side menu titled ""Display Types"". Or, if you wanted the dipole moment to be displayed, select the ""Dipole"" option in the same menu. However, always make sure that the ""Ball and Stick"" option is always selected so that your elements show up on the software.

, The ""Adjust Hydrogens"" option adds hydrogens to any molecule added, and so it is not needed when making a Carbon dioxide molecule. Also, it is better to always de-select this option because adding the hydrogens yourself gives you more control over the position and their order in the molecule as opposed to the software adding it by default.

, This drop-down menu is the one we will be using to add any elements we need throughout this process. Once you have selected carbon, click anywhere in the black drawing area for the element to show up.

, Then click on the black drawing area and drag towards the carbon until both elements are connected and have a bond connecting them. Repeat this step for the second oxygen atom.

, A CO2 molecule has a double bond, and to change the bonds, just click on the Bond Order drop down menu and choose ""Double"". Then just click and drag between the elements that have the double bond between them. In the CO2 case, click and drag from the oxygen to the carbon and the bonds will change from single to double.

, This features conforms your molecule into the best molecular shape based on chemical properties of your model according to VSEPR theory. Once you select that feature, the model will take the preferred and standard chemical structure, which is a linear.

, To view important information about the molecule, from the ""View"" drop down menu, select ""Properties"" and then select ""Molecule Properties..."" This will give you weight of the molecule, dipole moment, and other important information that you would otherwise need to calculate to find.


, This option will be more helpful with more complicated molecules where more elements are involved. From the same menu as Step 10, select ""Properties"" and then select ""Angle Properties"" which will give you all the angles in degrees and give you the vertex. This, however, will only be accurate if you made sure that you have optimized the geometry after finishing building the molecule.

, You have now built a very simple molecule. However, with this software, chemistry homework will be easy when you have all the information you need at your fingertips. The most important thing to remember is to make sure that the geometry of your model is optimized to ensure that all the properties are accurate. As you get more advanced, you can manipulate the molecules to add forces, have dipole moments, find the Van Der Waal interactions, and other cool chemical processes."

Gather the materials.,
Prepare the first solution.,
Add 60 mL of distilled water to the container with the crushed tablets, and stir for 30 seconds.,
Filter the solution using a coffee filter.,
Add 25 mL of the iodine tincture to the solution.,
Add water to the solution until the total volume is 500 milliliters (16.9  fl oz).,
Prepare the second solution.,
Add 350 mL of distilled water to the container, mixing it with the cornstarch.,
Add 150 mL of the hydrogen peroxide to the cornstarch solution.,
Begin the reaction!,
Have fun with the experiment!",How to Perform the Iodine Clock Reaction," You will essentially need:


10 volume hydrogen peroxide
1000 mg vitamin C tablets
5% Iodine tincture
Distilled water
Cornstarch
Containers (preferably clear)
Coffee filters;
, Crush two of the vitamin C tablets with the back of a spoon until they are nearly powdery. Once that's done, put the powder into a container.

, Don't worry if the powder doesn't completely dissolve — this is expected to happen.

, It is necessary to get rid of the undissolved particles so that it doesn't interfere with the experiment. Once the filtration is complete, return the liquid to its original container.

, You will notice that the iodine becomes colorless — this is because the elemental iodine from the tincture breaks up into ions, forming a colorless solution. (If your solution does not turn clear, it means that you didn't put enough vitamin C, and you will need to remake the solution.)

, Your first solution is finished!

, Add a small amount of cornstarch to another container (around a teaspoon; the exact measurement isn't important).

, Microwave the solution until it boils to dissolve as much cornstarch as possible. The solution may look cloudy, and you can filter it to get rid of the undissolved particles. However, this is optional, and is only done to demonstrate the experiment more clearly.

, Your second solution is now complete.

, To see the iodine clock reaction in action, mix an equal amount of the first solution and the second solution into a container (you do not need to use all of the solution). Within a minute or two, the liquid should suddenly turn into a dark color. The reaction is quite complex, but what is essentially happening is that the vitamin C is consumed, reverting the iodide ions to iodine molecules, which then react with the starch to form a bluish-black hue.

, Try doing the reaction with different amounts, containers etc. Make some observations: Does the reaction occur faster at higher temperatures? Does the amount of solution used affect the reaction time? Will the mixture change color at the same time if you separated them into two containers?

, You can draw out all the symbols, or you can use a skeleton structure. Find out which one your instructor wants you to use, and stick with it.

, The parent chain is the longest continuous carbon chain in the molecule. Number it starting by the nearest substituent group. Each substituent will be noted by its numerical location on the chain.

, Substituents should be named alphabetically (excluding prefixes such as di, tri or tetra), not in numerical order.

Figure out what sort of cyclic hydrocarbon you have.,
Know the difference in naming a cyclic hydrocarbon.",How to Name a Hydrocarbon Chain Using the IUPAC Method5," Cyclic hydrocarbons work like non-cyclic hydrocarbons as far as naming - those containing no multiple bonds are cycloalkanes, those with double bonds are cycloalkenes, and those with triple bonds are cycloalkynes. For instance, a 6-carbon ring with no multiple bonding is cyclohexane.

, There are a few notable differences between naming cyclic and non-cyclic hydrocarbons:


Because all the carbons in a cyclic hydrocarbon ring are equal, you don't need to use a number if your cyclic hydrocarbon only has one constituent.
If the alkyl group attached to the cyclic hydrocarbon is larger or more complex than the ring, then the cyclic hydrocarbon may become a substituent instead of the parent chain.
If two substituents are on the ring, they're numbered in alphabetical order. The first (alphabetically) substituent is 1; the next is numbered going counterclockwise or clockwise - whichever results in a lower number for the second substituent.
If more than two substituents are on the ring, the first one alphabetically is said to be attached to the first carbon. The others are numbered counterclockwise or clockwise - whichever results in the lowest numbers.
Like non-cyclic hydrocarbons, the final molecule is named in alphabetical order, excluding prefixes like di-, tri- and tetra-.

, It's possible to name your benzene molecule as you would any other cyclic hydrocarbon, starting alphabetically with the first substituent and assigning numbers going around. However, there are some special designations for substituent positions on benzene molecules:


Ortho, or o-: The two substituents are located at 1 and 2.
Meta, or m-: The two substituents are located at 1 and 3.
Para, or p-: The two substituents are located at 1 and 4.

, That means you'll be using words to associate with each element. They often come in strings or rhymes. Lilly's NAna Kills RuBbish CreatureS FRanticly is an example of a mnemonic device to help remember the alkali metals.


Ignore the easy ones. You're probably pretty confident that hydrogen is ""H."" Concentrate on the ones that are giving you grief. Here's an example: Darmstadtium is ""Ds,"" right? If you want a mnemonic for that one, try ""DARN! STATS for my game were all lost on my Nintendo 'DS' because the power went out!"".

, Many people with ridiculously good memories use pictures to associate. Why does everybody know that A is for Apple? Our brains associate words with pictures automatically. Assign each element with a picture -- anything that makes sense to you.


Give the items in your house an element. Label them. Let's say your chair is hydrogen. Label it with a hydrogen bomb, picturing it blowing up. Give your TV a mouth -- it's oxygen and it's breathing. When you go to take your test, close your eyes and walk through your house, recalling all your associations.

Select your site carefully.,
Wear a welding mask for complete protection, but wear sunglasses at the very least.,
Wear sturdy gloves and cover your body.,
Obtain finely powdered iron oxide (rust), aluminum powder, and a thin strip of magnesium.,
Mix the aluminum and iron oxide powder together in a 27:80 ratio by weight.,
Pour the mixture into a strong container, such as a cast iron container or clay flower pot.,
Insert the magnesium strip.

,
Light the magnesium strip and it will burn out in a few seconds.",How to Make Thermite," Make sure there is nothing that can burn within four meter radius of the reaction. Check that metals with low melting points, such as lead, tin, cadmium, or zinc, aren't near your four meter radius.;
, In addition to being extremely hot, thermite emits UV radiation that can damage your eyes if not dealt with properly.

, As a precaution, fully clothe your body and make sure you're wearing thick gloves.

, The iron oxide and aluminum will react to form thermite, while the magnesium will serve as the ignition material.


You can find aluminum powder in a paint store, an Etch-a-Sketch, or you can buy it on the internet.
If you don't want to use magnesium strips to ignite the materials, you can also use a combination of potassium permanganate and glycerin, both of which can be obtained in retail stores and online.

, There will be a lot more iron oxide than aluminum.


For example, if you have 10 grams of iron oxide and 10 grams of aluminum, take 8 grams of iron oxide and 2.7 grams of aluminum powder and mix them together until fully incorporated.

, Note that if you ignite the thermite, it will melt through the cast iron.

,, If you're using potassium permanganate and glycerin, put a fairly good size pile of potassium permanganate on the thermite, then drip glycerin onto the potassium permanganate. That is not very reliable so it's best to use a magnesium strip.

An instant cold pack made with ammonium nitrate. You'll need 40 grams.
A container of sodium-free salt, which is potassium chloride. You'll need 37 grams.
If you don't already have one, pick up a small food scale so you can measure out exactly how much of each ingredient you need.
You'll also need a coffee filter to filter the solution you make.;
, Use a graduated cylinder or measuring cup to get the exact amount.

, Pour it into the cup with the water and stir gently every few minutes until it looks completely dissolved. It shouldn't take long.

, Affix a coffee filter over the cup and filter the solution into a small saucepan. This will take care of any undissolved ammonium nitrate that might remain.

, Heat it slowly, over low heat, stirring occasionally until the potassium chloride is completely dissolved. Do not let the solution come to a boil.

, Use another coffee filter to get rid of any remaining solids. You can filter it into a plastic or glass container, as long as it's freezer-safe.

, As it chills, nitrate crystals will begin to form. You can check on the solution every few minutes to see how it's progressing. When it seems as though no more crystals will form, the process is complete.

, After the nitrate crystals form, you'll be left with liquid ammonium chloride. Pour it off and discard so that only the crystals remain in the container. Allow them to dry completely before grinding them down and using your potassium nitrate in science experiments or for other purposes.

Collect a sample.,
Mix manganese sulfate with the water.,
Add alkili-iodide-azide to the sample.,
Fix with sulfuric acid.,
Titrate 201 mL of sample.,
Introduce starch solution.,
Continue to titrate.,
Understand the results.",How to Measure the Dissolved Oxygen Level of Water1," Take a 300 mL sample of water. This can be from a tap, a stream, a pond, or any other water source. Collect the sample in a flask with a stoppered top., Use a calibrated pipet to pipet two milliliters of manganese sulfate into the sample. Put the tip of the pipet just beneath the surface of the water before releasing the contents. Stopper your bottle and mix the manganese sulfate by inverting the bottle several times slowly.If you drop the contents into the water they will come in contact with the air and this will introduce oxygen into the sample and alter results.
If any air bubbles occur then the sample is contaminated and you will need to start over.

, Next, add two milliliters of alkili-iodide-azide to the sample using a calibrated pipet. The tip of the pipet should be just below the surface of the water before ejecting the contents. Stopper the bottle and mix the alkili-iodide-azide by inverting the bottle slowly several times.If oxygen is present you will observe the formation of floc. This is an orange-ish solid that will settle in the bottom of the flask.

, Use a pipet to measure two milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid. Drop the sulfuric acid into the solution. Do not place the tip of the pipet into the water. Mix the acid by inverting the flask several times. The floc should redissolve.Wear gloves and goggles for safety when working with sulfuring acid. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Do not ingest. Do not inhale.

, Measure exactly 201 mL of sample into a new flask. Place this sample beneath a graduated pipet filled with sodium thiosulfate. Add sodium thiosulfate until the sample turns a pale yellow color.Write down the initial amount of sodium thiosulfate in the pipet.
Stir the solution continually as you titrate.

, A starch solution will react with the iodine present in the sample to form a blue color. You only need to add two milliliters of starch solution. Stir or swirl the solution well.Starch solution can be made by mixing water with corn or potato starch, or you can buy one premade.

, Once the sample turns blue, continue titrating with sodium thiosulfate. Add the titrant slowly, as one drop will make a difference at the end of the titration. You should stop titrating when the blue color is gone from the sample.Hold the sample up against a white background in order to look for blue color.

, When the titration is complete, write down the amount of sodium thiosulfate left in the pipet. Subtract this amount from the initial amount of sodium thiosulfate to find how many mL of sodium thiosulfate you used to titrate the sample. The amount of sodium thiosulfate in mL is equal to the dissolved oxygen content in mg/L.For example, if you used 8 mL of sodium thiosulfate, that would correspond the a dissolved oxygen content of 8 mg/L.

Wait for the reaction.,
Leave the nodes in until no more bubbles are being created.,
Examine your result.,
Extract the NaOH.,
Store the NaOH.,
Transport it with care.",How to Make Sodium Hydroxide Chemically," For this, you will need a large flashlight battery (the type used for searchlights), a glass (NOT plastic) cup,  about half a metre (roughly 20 inches) of copper wire, 1 tablespoon of salt, a piece of cardboard or stiff paper and tape.;
, Set the glass on a flat and stable surface. Put in the tablespoon of salt and 300 milliliters (10  fl oz) of water into the glass and stir until the salt is completely dissolved.

, This is the first of the semi-dangerous steps, use caution. Poke two wires through the cardboard or stiff paper then affix it to the top of the glass with 1.5cm (.6in) in the water-salt mixture. The paper should cover as little of the glass as possible to allow ventilation. Attach one of the wires to the positive and one of the wires to the negative, be sure to not cross unexposed sections of the wire and do not touch both wires yourself.

, You will notice bubbles appearing on the two nodes (wire tips) in the water. The one attached to the positive wire is oxygen with hydrogen on the negative. Hydrogen is flammable and oxygen is part of the fire triangle but in this small of a concentration, there is no risk of deflagration. As the bubbles grow and leave, more and more NaOH is formed.

, Remove the electrical assembly and remove the wires from the battery.

, NaOH is soluble in water, its dissolution is what is called an aqueous solution, meaning that the NaOH and water molecules are bonded. The mixture you have is less than 15% NaOH, meaning that what you have is heavily diluted.

, The best way to remove NaOH from water is boiling. Water boils at 100°C (212°F), while NaOH boils at 1.388°C (2.530°F), so boiling is a logical solution.


Put the solution into a stainless steel, platinum or titanium evaporating dish (NO aluminium, it will melt) and boil the water underneath a fume hood. Do NOT do this in a kitchen, outdoors or in a non-chemically designed ventilation area. As the water boils off, NaOH is left behind.
NaOH Time. This is extremely dangerous. You now have an upwards of 65% NaOH solution. You can severely burn yourself. NaOH is an extremely basic solution that will cause severe chemical burns if allowed to contact your skin. Use chemical gloves (these are not regular kitchen gloves) while handling.

, To get NaOH from your prep area to your lab, the utmost safety is key. Purchase a new chemical container rated for NaOH (rating systems vary per country) and using a chemically approved funnel while wearing your gloves AND underneath the fume hood, slowly pour the cold NaOH into the container. Discard any extra to the lab-provided waste container.

, This is the most risky step as not only is the safety of your lab and you at risk, but everyone between your start and destination. Using a trolley is recommended as it is more stable, walk slowly and crawl around corners. Safety is key. Place the NaOH container into a larger, waterproof and chemically rated container that is visibly marked with at least:


'HIGHLY BASIC'
'HIGHLY CORROSIVE'
'NaOH'
'LYE'
'CAUSTIC'
Or however is required by your nation or laboratory entitative government.

Calibrate the meter.,
Measure a sample of water.,
Analyze the measurement.",How to Measure the Dissolved Oxygen Level of Water2," Manually adjust the meter to read zero by turning the screw in the middle of the meter. Next, connect the probe and turn the meter on for fifteen minutes for optimum performance. Adjust the redline with the control knob to align with the 31 degrees celsius line and set the central line to zero.All meters are calibrated differently. See the manufacturer’s instructions for variations that are specific to your meter.
Meters are calibrated in Celsius not Fahrenheit.

, Place the probe into a sample of water that you wish to measure. Allow the meter to stabilize. Write down your reading., Understand that running water will have a higher dissolved oxygen content than still water. Higher altitudes mean less dissolved oxygen. Consider these things when you look at your measurement to be sure that the measurement makes sense given the sample you are taking."
"
Choose your reagent.,
Introduce the reagent to your sample.,
Record the measurement.",How to Measure the Dissolved Oxygen Level of Water3," There are two reagents used to do colorimetric analysis of dissolved oxygen. One is indigo carmine and the other is rhodazine D. If you expect low levels of dissolved oxygen, rhodazine D is a good choice. Use indigo carmine for higher levels of dissolved oxygen., Once you have chosen a reagent, introduce it to a sample of water. Drop the reagent into the sample of water and watch for a color change. The deeper the color, the more dissolved oxygen present.Indigo carmine will produce a deep blue color.
Rhodazine D will produce a deep pink color.

, If you are using rhodazine D, record the dissolved oxygen range promptly at thirty seconds after adding the reagent. The same holds true for measuring small ranges of dissolved oxygen with indigo carmine. If you are measuring a sample with higher levels of dissolved oxygen, wait two minutes and record the result."

Pour vinegar in a pan.,
Add baking soda to the pan.,
Stir the reaction.",How to Make Sodium Acetate1," Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid. The solution is primarily water, with anywhere between 3% and 7% acetic acid. The acetic acid is a necessary ingredient in forming sodium acetate. Pour 500 mL (roughly 2 cups) of vinegar into a pan.Always wear safety goggles and gloves when handling acids and bases like vinegar and baking soda.;
, Baking soda is the common name for sodium bicarbonate. This ingredient will provide the sodium needed to form sodium acetate. Slowly sprinkle about 35 grams (7 teaspoons) of baking soda for each 500 mL (2 cups) of vinegar., As you sprinkle the baking soda into the vinegar, you will see the solution start to bubble. This is due to the formation of carbon dioxide gas during the reaction. Use a stir rod or a spoon to keep the reaction stirred, and prevent it from bubbling out of the container.The reaction of vinegar with baking soda is as follows: NaHCO3 + CH3COOH ---> CH3COONa + CO2 + H2O

Wrap the aluminum wire around the silver.,
Place the piece of aluminum-wrapped silver in the nitric acid.,
Heat the acid until the silver starts to bubble.,
Wait until the silver completely dissolves.,
Let the solution stand until it completely evaporates.",How to Make Silver Nitrate," The chemicals necessary for this process are highly toxic and can lead to injury if not handled properly. Eye protection, gloves, and a lab coat are necessary to remain safe. Long pants and closed-toe shoes, preferably without mesh, should be worn to protect against floor spills.Eye protection should completely cover your eyes and the sides of your eyes to protect from splashes.
Latex or nitrile gloves should be worn to protect your hands.
Wear a lab coat or a second layer of clothing that can easily be removed if you spill any solutions on yourself.;
, When making silver nitrate, the gases released are extremely toxic and can be deadly if inhaled directly. It’s best to work in a chemical fume hood, but if you don’t have access to a fume hood, work outside in a well-ventilated area. If working in your garage, open the door and all windows.


Turn on some fans as well to make sure the air circulates.
Never bend over the reaction and inhale the fumes.

, It’s always good to let someone know that you will be doing something potentially dangerous before beginning. Your friend can check on you to make sure you’re okay and, in case something goes wrong, your friend will know what you were working with.

, To make silver nitrate you will need a fume hood or outdoor workspace, concentrated nitric acid (70%), a clean glass container, a piece of pure silver, aluminum wire, and a hot plate. The amount of nitric acid and silver needed is dependent upon how much silver nitrate you are trying to make. The fumes released during this process are extremely toxic, so a properly ventilated workspace is essential.Nitric acid has to be purchased from a chemical lab supply store.
If you have to dilute the nitric acid, always add ACID to WATER while gently stirring, never the other way around. Adding water to acid can lead to explosions and injury.Pure silver can be purchased online, at a precious metals dealer, or a local coin shop or show., The glass container needs to be clean so the silver nitrate will be free of impurities. Add enough of the nitric acid so that the piece of silver you have will be almost completely submerged.


Carefully pour the nitric acid into the container, taking care not to spill anything.
Always wear protective gloves, eyewear, and a lab coat when handling nitric acid.

, Aluminum will not react with the nitric acid and will allow you to have a little more control over the reaction. Wrap the aluminum around the silver and leave enough of a tail so you can easily remove the silver from the solution if it starts to boil too much., Before placing the silver in the nitric acid, make sure you are outside or working in a fume hood. Once everything has been prepared, simply submerge the silver in the nitric acid. At this point, you should see a few bubbles being made as the reaction begins. The reaction will continue slowly because it the solution is cool., Again, this reaction will create toxic gases, so please do not perform this indoors. Do not lean over the solution and breathe in the gases. Work in a properly ventilated fume hood, outside, or wear a gas mask. Place the container on the hot plate and heat the solution until you see the silver really start to bubble.The solution will turn opaque during this process and you will not be able to see everything that is happening.
Turn the heat down as the reaction continues to avoid letting the solution boil over.

, This process can take a few hours depending on how large your piece of silver is. You might also need to add more heat to keep the reaction going.


Keep an eye on the container as it continues. You can use the aluminum wire to lift the silver piece out of the solution and check the progress of the silver as it dissolves.
When the silver fully dissolve, remove the container from the heat.

, The final step requires patience because it will take a few days. As the solution cools, the silver nitrate will precipitate out of the solution and you will be able to see it at the bottom of the container. After a few days, the remaining solution will evaporate and you will be left with the silver nitrate crystals.The crystals formed are pure silver nitrate and should be stored in an air-tight container away from light.

Oxidize the solution.",How to Make Iron Oxide1," An iron (III) salt such as ferric chloride will be easy to add to solution.It is often used for etching copper, so you can buy it online, at a chemical supply store, and sometimes even an electronics store such as RadioShack Also, a fine rust powder would work well. You can collect rust and grind it to a fine powder, if you choose to go that route., Add water to the iron (III) oxide source in a beaker (or other container). The aqueous environment (in water) is ideal for the iron (III) and iron (II) molecules to react with each other and with oxygen. It will suspend your iron (III) molecules in solution and make it easy to combine with the iron (II) and oxygen molecules. You do not need to cover the container, but this can help keep out contaminants. , Since iron (II) in its pure form is rare under atmospheric conditions, you will likely need to use an iron (II) salt. Iron sulphate, iron (II) chloride, and iron (II) phosphate are relatively common options. Iron sulphate is used in gardening and can be found at most garden supply stores., Whatever your choice of iron (II) salt, you will need to dissolve it in water. Do this as a separate beaker (or other container) from the iron (III) solution to ensure that the iron (III) has not saturated the water. This will allow the most iron (II) to dissolve into the water. Again, a lid will help keep out contaminants, but is not necessary., Combine the iron (III) solution and the iron (II) solution into the same container. This will allow bring the iron (III) ions and the iron (II) ions into contact with each other. They will also contact oxygen in the water and the atmosphere, which is needed to produce magnetite., While the reaction will proceed by mixing the two solutions together, it will proceed very slowly. You can speed up the reaction by adding an oxidizing solution, such as ammonia. Hydrogen peroxide is also a good oxidizing agent.The addition of an oxidizing agent will allow the reaction to proceed much faster. Times will vary based on the ratios of reactants and oxidizer, but you will likely see some change in just a few seconds.
Storing your iron oxide in a dry place is recommended.

Transfer the solution to a boiling pan.,
Bring the solution to a boil.,
Watch the surface of the solution.,
Allow the solution to cool.,
Scrape the crystals off.",How to Make Sodium Acetate2," Any pan that is stove-safe will suffice. Transfer only the liquid solution. Do not pour solid baking soda into the boiling pan.


You will only have solid baking soda if you added too much baking soda. The excess baking soda will remain in a solid (but wet) form.

, Put the boiling pan on the stove and bring the solution to a slow boil. Avoid boiling vigorously, as this will make it hard to monitor the surface of the solution, and could lead to over-boiling. You can also use a bunsen burner or hotplate to boil the solution., Be sure that the solution is at a light enough boil that you can monitor the surface of the solution. If it is boiling too vigorously for you to watch the surface, turn the heat down. Allow the solution to slow boil until you see a white solid start to form in the solution or on the surface. When you see this, remove from heat immediately and swirl the solution until the solid redissolves.

, As the solution cools, the sodium acetate dissolved in the hot water will precipitate out. It may take up to half an hour before you notice the formation of white sodium acetate crystals. Once the crystals form, you can pour off any excess water.If the crystals do not form, the solution may be resting in a supersaturated state. This means that there is excess sodium acetate dissolved in the water for its current temperature. Drop a small piece of metal (even aluminum foil should work) into the solution to start the crystallization.If you are building hot ice sculptures, you will want to pour the solution a little at a time into your mold or design. This should catalyze the sodium acetate to precipitate out of solution, and form a solid sculpture.

, The crystals will form on the surface of the dish. For the best yield, scrape them off with a razor. Collect the crystals in an airtight container (a ziplock bag is sufficient).If you plan to make a hand warmer, put the crystals in an airtight plastic bag. You can melt the crystals by dropping the bag into boiling water. Leave it in liquid form until you need a hand warmer, then drop a crystal or piece of metal in to catalyze the change back to a warm solid.

"
"
Pour the solution into an evaporating dish.,
Allow the contaminants to evaporate.,
Collect the crystals.",How to Make Sodium Acetate3," An evaporating dish will allow the water and carbon dioxide to slowly evaporate from the crystals. This method will take much longer than boiling off excess water and carbon dioxide, but can be done. Do not transfer any solid baking soda particles into the evaporating dish.


A wide/long, shallow dish works best. The water will take much longer to evaporate from a deep dish.

, The evaporation process will take days under standard conditions (room temperature, normal atmospheric pressure, etc.). If you wish to speed up the evaporation, you can place the dish under a heat lamp. As the water evaporates, white sodium acetate crystals will precipitate out of the solution and cling to the dish.

, Once the water evaporates, the sodium acetate crystals will be stuck to the evaporating dish. Use a razor to scrape the crystals from the dish. Store the crystals in an airtight container such as a ziplock bag."

Turn on the power.,
Allow to sit.,
Filter the solution.,
Dry the resulting rust.",How to Make Iron Oxide2," Aside from some salts, most iron compounds tend to be in the iron (III) state. This includes things like railroad ties, nails, steel wool, paperclips, etc. Choose your source based on the amount of iron you need, how fast you need it, and what is available to you. For example, steel wool is cheap and oxidizes quickly, but railroad ties contain a larger mass of iron., You want to be sure that you have enough water in the container to cover the iron piece at all times. Keep in mind that the process of electrolysis may heat the water. This can increase the rate at which the water evaporates., You will need to use a battery or other direct current power source to power the reaction. The power source should have a lead connected to the negative side and a lead to the positive side. Choose the size of your power source based on how much rust you are trying to create and how fast you want it. Larger power supplies will generally create rust faster., The leads should not touch each other. Instead, they should be submerged in opposite sides of your water tank. This will make the water solution part of the circuit and force electricity to flow through the water., While iron will typically rust under atmospheric conditions without any help, submerging it in water increases the rate of oxidation. Submerging iron in water that is being electrolyzed will increase the rate of oxidation even more since the electrolysis produces hydrogen gas (H2) and diatomic oxygen (O2). Diatomic oxygen is a great oxidizer and readily reacts with the iron to form rust., Now that your tank is setup, you can turn on the power. This will start the current flowing through the solution and oxidizing the metal. Be careful not to touch the leads, or touch them together. Also, do not put your hands in the water unless you turn the power off.


If you are using a power source without a switch (like a battery), either put the leads in last, or do not hook the leads to the battery until you are ready for power.

, While the reaction is relatively fast compared to natural oxidation, it isn’t instant. You will need to leave the reaction for several hours at least to yield rust. You will probably need to leave it for a day or two to get a decent amount., When your rust forms, it will be in the tank of water. The first step to getting it in a dry and usable form is to filter out some of the water. You can stretch cheesecloth or some other fabric over a jar or sink and pour the solution through. Allow it to sit for an hour or so to drain as much water as possible., To finish drying your rust, you will need to bake it. Set your oven at 400 °F (204 °C) and bake the rust for one to three hours. Be sure to use an old pan, the rust will stain it."

Choose an iron source to oxidize.,
Choose an oxidizing agent.,
Expose the iron source to the oxidizer.,
Allow the reaction to proceed.,
Collect and dry the resulting rust.",How to Make Iron Oxide3," The more exposed surface area your source has, the better. For example, steel wool has a lot of surface area relative to its size, while a railroad tie has much less. Your oxidizer can only act on the surface of your iron., Bleach is a great oxidizing agent. Another good choice is hydrogen peroxide. A weaker oxidizing agent is salt water. The oxidizer you choose will determine how fast the iron is oxidized. The stronger your oxidizing agent, the faster your iron will oxidize., You can submerge the iron source in the oxidizing solution. Another option is to spray the oxidizer on the iron at regular time intervals (every hour or so). Depending on how fast you want the reaction to proceed and how comfortable you are using strong oxidizers, you can dilute the oxidizer in water (this will weaken it and slow the reaction)., Depending on your choice of oxidizer and exposure, this can take several hours or several days. You should certainly start to see rust forming within a week. If not, check to make sure you are using iron and that it is not coated with a protective layer such as wax., You may have to scrape the rust off the surface of your iron piece to collect it. If you submerged the piece, you can filter the rust from the solution. If your rust is wet, dry it in an oven at 400 °F (204 °C) for one to three hours."

Find a piece of plain steel wool.,
Place the steel wool on a fireproof surface.,
Use a 9-V battery to ignite the steel wool.,
Observe the black rust that is formed.",How to Make Iron Oxide4," If the wool has any rust inhibitors or soaps on it, it will interfere with your results. You should also look for a steel wool with thin fibers. This will make it easier for the fibers to ignite and burn., You will not be able to hold the steel wool in your hand. It will be on fire! You also do not want to burn anything down. Glass plates or tin lids are great choices., Touching a 9-V battery to the steel wool will connect the positive and negative leads of the battery. This closes the circuit and allows electricity to flow. The steel wool will ignite because more current is flowing through than it can handle, so it heats up until it reaches an ignition point., Black rust is formed as a result of oxidation in an oxygen deprived environment. Since the steel wool is oxidized so rapidly in this reaction there is little time for enough oxygen to access the iron to form iron (III) oxide (red rust)."

Fill a balloon.,
Submerge the balloon completely in a clear container.,
Measure the amount of displaced water.,
Weigh the gas filled balloon.,
Find the mass of the empty balloon.,
Do the calculations.",How to Measure Density of Gases1," A balloon is designed to be inflated by gas, which makes it the perfect vessel for you to store a fixed amount of gas. You can fill the balloon with air using a pump, or you can choose another type of gas such as helium or nitrogen. Once the balloon is filled, tie off the end so that no gas escapes., Next, submerge the balloon in a container of water. The balloon will cause the water level to rise. Mark the new height of the water and remove the balloon., Use a measuring instrument (e.g. cup or beaker) to measure the amount of water needed to fill the container to the mark (without the balloon in the water). Pour slowly. If you pour too much, you will have to start over. The volume of the balloon is equal to the volume of the water you add. Record this value for later use as V.You can save time by submerging the balloon into a large beaker or other pre-measured container. Then you can skip adding any water and simply subtract the volume of the water from the volume of the water and balloon.


, You can weigh the balloon using a sensitive scale. Electric scales are usually the best for this application. Record the weight of the gas filled balloon for later use as mGB.If you are filling the balloon with a gas that is lighter than air, you will need to weigh the take before and after you fill the balloon to determine the amount of gas used.


, Poke a hole in the balloon. This will allow the gas to escape. Weigh the balloon again and record the weight of the empty balloon as mB., Now that you have enough data, you can calculate the density of the gas inside the balloon. Subtract the weight of the empty balloon, mB, from the weight of the full balloon, mGB. This will give you the mass of the gas alone, mG. Divide the mass of the gas, mG, by the volume, V, of the gas to find the density of the gas, DG.mGB - mB = mG
For example, if the full balloon had a mass of 1 kg and the empty balloon had a mass of 0.5 kg, the mass of the gas (mG) would be found by: 1 kg - 0.5 kg = 0.5 kg.



mG / V = DG
For example, if the balloon displaced 1 L of water, the density could be found by dividing the mass by that volume: 500 g / 1 L = 500g/L

Grab a CO2 fire extinguisher and a pillowcase.,
Protect your hands, eyes, and limbs.,
Wrap the pillowcase tightly around the hose.,
Give the extinguisher a blast.,
Remove the pillowcase.,
Transfer to a safe storage container.,
Alternatively, use a CO2 tank.",How to Make Dry Ice1," You only need three things to make dry ice at home: a CO2 fire extinguisher, a fabric pillowcase that you don't mind getting dirty, and a wide open outdoor area where children or pets are unlikely to surprise you.


You specifically need a CO2 fire extinguisher for this method, not an ordinary home extinguisher. Most home extinguishers use fine powders of a chemical like sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, which won't supply the CO2 needed to produce dry ice.CO2 fire extinguishers are usually used for laboratories, kitchens, and around mechanical equipment.They usually have a black plastic horn on the nozzle and have no pressure gauge.
You can find CO2 extinguishers at some hardware stores and online specialty retailers.;
, Dry ice is so cold that it can easily cause frostbite or ""burns"" if it comes into contact with bare skin. Though using a fire extinguisher doesn't require a Hazmat suit, you'll want to take precaution to protect your body from any dry ice that may conceivably drop or get sprayed onto you. Put on the following before you start:


Thick, sturdy work gloves (you may wear tight gloves underneath for extra protection)
Lab goggles or protective eyewear
Long sleeves and pants
Close-toed shoes
Long-sleeved jacket or lab coat (optional)

, Put the horn of the extinguisher's nozzle inside the pillowcase. Gather the pillowcase material and wrap it tight around the hose behind the horn. You don't want any gas to be able to escape except through the tight fabric of the pillowcase.


Use duct tape to make a tight seal if you're worried about the pillowcase flying off. The amount of pressure in the extinguisher shouldn't make it hard to hold on, but extra precaution never hurts.

, When you're ready, squeeze the handle and watch the gas shoot into the pillowcase. Keep this up for 2-3 seconds. You may not think you see ice being produced, but it should quickly start to gather up at the bottom. Release the handle after a few seconds. Carbon dioxide vapor will seep out of the pillowcase — this is normal and safe as long as you're in a well-ventilated area as recommended.


If you can't get the extinguisher to fire, check for the safety pin, which must be removed to allow you to squeeze the handle.

, Carefully take the horn out of the pillowcase. Keep the fabric tight against the horn to wipe off any ice sticking to it. You should find a small pile of dry ice at the bottom of the pillowcase — it will be a crumbly white material resembling styrofoam.


Try to keep the bag upright and don't handle the dry ice more than you need to. If you're wearing sturdy safety gloves, you can touch small pieces of the ice for a few seconds at a time, but don't hold on to them for much longer, as they can even hurt fingers through gloves if given enough time.

, Scrape the dry ice from the pillowcase into a more practical container, like a bowl, a sturdy plastic bag, or a thermos. Keep the dry ice in a single pile and keep the chunks as big as possible to make it last as long as possible. Do not seal the container. If you put an airtight lid on, the pressure of the CO2 gas will build up, causing the lid to pop off or the container to explode. If you use a lid, do not press it or screw it all the way on.


Not all materials are safe for storing dry ice. See below for suggestions:

Do not use fine china, ceramic, or glass containers. The intense cold of the dry ice can cause these materials to to contract and break.

Do not use nice or fancy metal containers. Dry ice can cause the metal to mar and warp.

Do use sturdy plastic containers (especially coolers and ice chests) to store dry ice.

Do use thermoses to store dry ice (but do not seal the thermos.)

, If you can't get your hands on a CO2 fire extinguisher, you can replicate this dry ice-making method with a commercial tank of pressurized CO2, which are sold at welding supply stores and online. The process is virtually the same — simply attach a horn or nozzle to the tank, wrap a pillowcase around it, blast out gas for a few seconds, and collect the dry ice chunks from the bottom of the pillowcase. The required safety precautions for this method are the same as well.


Before your purchase your tank, make sure that it has something called a dip tube, which is also sold separately. These tanks will draw liquid carbon dioxide from the bottom of the tank, which is what you want for making dry ice. On the other hand, tanks without a dip tube will draw gas carbon dioxide from the top of the tank, which won't make dry ice.Often, dip tube-equipped tanks are marked with two white stripes, while tanks without dip tubes have a black finish.If you plan on making dry ice often, you may want to invest in a dry ice maker attachment, which is essentially a horn nozzle with a fabric bag over the end that can be fastened and removed."

Chop up some red cabbage.,
Add boiling water to your cabbage.,
Turn on the blender.,
Pour the mix through a strainer.,
Add isopropyl alcohol to your indicator solution.,
Pour the solution into a pan or bowl.,
Soak your paper in the indicator solution.,
Allow your paper to air dry on a towel.,
Cut the paper into strips.,
Use the strips to test the pH of different solutions.,
Store the strips in cool dry place.",How to Make Homemade pH Paper Test Strips1," You’ll need to chop about ¼ of a head of red cabbage and put it in a blender. You will extract chemicals from the cabbage to coat your pH paper. These chemicals are known as anthocyanins and are found in plants such as cabbage, roses, and berries. Anthocyanins are purple under neutral conditions (pH 7.0) but they change color when exposed to an acid (pH < 7.0) or a base (pH>7.0).The same procedure can be followed using berries, roses, and other anthocyanin containing plants.
This does not work for green cabbage. The same anthocyanins are not present in green cabbage.;
, You can boil the water on a stovetop or in the microwave, but either way you’ll need about 500 mL of water. Pour the boiling water directly into the blender with the cabbage. This will help draw the needed chemicals out of the cabbage., You need to blend the water and cabbage for best results. Keep the mixture blending until the water is dark purple. This color change indicates that you have successfully drawn the needed chemicals (anthocyanins) from the cabbage and dissolved them in the hot water. You should allow the contents of the blender to cool for at least ten minutes before proceeding., You want to remove any pieces of cabbage from the indicator solution (colored water). Filter paper will work in place of a strainer, but may take more time. Once you have strained the indicator solution, you can throw away the cabbage pieces., Adding about 50 mL of isopropyl alcohol will protect your solution from bacterial growth. The alcohol may start to alter the color of your solution. If this happens, add vinegar until the solution goes back to dark purple., You want a container with a wide enough opening to dip your paper. You should choose a container that is stain resistant, as you are pouring dyes into it. Ceramic and glass are good options., Make sure to push the paper all the way to the bottom. You want to cover all corners and edges of the paper. It is a good idea to use gloves for this step., Find a location that is free of acidic or basic vapors. The paper should be allowed to dry completely before proceeding. Ideally, you will leave it overnight., This will allow you to test several different samples. You can cut the strips any size you would like, but generally the length and width of your index finger is fine. This will allow you to dip the strip into a sample without getting your fingers into the sample., You can test household solutions such as orange juice, water, and milk. You can also mix up solutions for testing, e.g. mixing water and baking soda. This will give you a wide range of samples to test., You should use an airtight container to store the strips until you use them. This will protect them from environmental contamination such as acidic or basic gases. It is also ideal not to leave them in direct sunlight, as this could result in bleaching over time."

Understand the Ideal Gas Law.,
Assume standard temperature and pressure.,
Find the molar mass of the gas.,
Calculate the density of the gas.",How to Measure Density of Gases2," You should know that the Ideal Gas Law is a theoretical tool that governs the behavior of gases under specific conditions. You can summarize it in the equation PV=nRT. This simply means that pressure (P) multiplied by volume (V) is equal to the number of moles (n) times the Ideal Gas Constant (R) times the temperature (T) for an ideal gas. , Standard temperature and pressure, or STP, is defined as 273 K (32 °F) ( 0 °C) and 1 standard atmosphere (1.0 bar). Assuming STP allows you to calculate the volume of one mole of any gas to be 22.414 liters. Knowing this volume will be imperative to finding the density of your gas., Since you are using STP and assuming one mole of gas, the finding the molar mass will be easy. Add the molar mass of all of the individual atoms that make up you gas to find the molar mass of the gas. The atomic masses can be found on the periodic table.For example, finding the molar mass of H2O gas would mean adding the masses of two hydrogens and one oxygen. The resulting molar mass would be 18 g/mol (1 g/mol + 1 g/mol + 16 g/mol).


, Though the volume and moles of gas are fixed in these calculations, the molar mass is different for every gas. That means that the density will be different for each gas as well. To find a given gas density, divide the molar mass of the gas by the molar volume (22.4 L / mol in this case).For example, if you were looking for the density of water vapor, you would divide 18 g/mol by 22.4 L/mol to yield 0.804 g/L. That is: 18 g/mol / 22.4 L/mol = 0.804 g/L.


"
"
Know the fractional breakdown of the gas mixture.,
Find the mass of one mole.,
Divide by the volume.",How to Measure Density of Gases3," If you have mixed two or more gases, you will need to know how much of each gas is present. This is done on a percent basis. That allows you to know the ratios of the mixture regardless of how much gas is present overall.For example, if you had a mixture of 75% CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 25% H2O (water), those ratios would not change whether you have 1 L or 1,000 L of gas.


, By knowing the ratio of your gases, you can find the molar mass of your mixture. You will have to find the molar mass of each gas, and multiply it by its percent composition in the mixture. Then, add all of the products together to find the molar mass of the gas mixture.For example, you would find the molar mass of CO2 (44 g/mol) and multiply it by 0.75. Next you would find the molar mass of H2O (18 g/mol) and multiply it by 0.25. When you add these products together, 33 g/mol + 4.5 g/mol, you yield the molar mass of your mixture. In this case, the molar mass is 37.5 g/mol.


, Once the molar mass has been established for your mixture, finding the density of the gas is a simple calculation. Divide the molar mass by the standard volume (22.4 L/mol). Remember that you are assuming STP and one mole of gas.For example, the density of a mixture of 75% carbon dioxide and 25% water would be 37.5g/mol/22.4L/mol=1.67g/L{\displaystyle 37.5g/mol/22.4L/mol=1.67g/L}.

Combine with water to make fog-like gas.,
Use dry ice to carbonate liquids.,
Use dry ice to keep food and beverages frozen.,
Use dry ice to store loose food.,
Use dry ice to shrink solid materials.,
Use dry ice to kill yard pests.",How to Make Dry Ice2," One of the most common uses of dry ice is to create artificial smoke or fog. This is as simple as mixing dry ice and water — splashing a bit of water onto the ice creates a hissing noise and produces lots of carbon dioxide gas. This is handy for dances, rock concerts, haunted houses, and other places where you might want to create an eerie, mysterious atmosphere.


As always, make sure that you make carbon dioxide gas only outdoors and in well-ventilated areas. Though unlikely, producing lots of carbon dioxide gas in an area with poor ventilation can eventually force the oxygen out, making it impossible to breathe.
If you use a container with a small vent hole, you can produce a geyser-like contraption where fog shoots out in a narrow jet. This can even be powerful enough to power a small motor or turn a pinwheel.

, Another frequent use of carbon dioxide is to make carbonated beverages (fizzy drinks like soda, beer, champagne, sparkling water, and so on.) Putting dry ice in water causes it to release carbon dioxide into the water which eventually gathers in the small bubbles that are the mark of any carbonated drink. Though most commercial and home-brew beverage-making operations actually use CO2 gas (rather than solid CO2 in the form of dry ice, the latter will still have something of an effect.Do not drink your beverage while there is dry ice in it. Wait for the dry ice to bubble away completely before drinking. Swallowing dry ice can cause major internal damage — internal tissues are more vulnerable to frostbite than skin.
Some people don't like the taste of dry ice-carbonated beverages. You may want to sample the process with a small amount of your liquid before trying it with the main batch.

, Dry ice is much, much colder than regular ice, so it can obviously keep food and drinks much, much colder. However, the danger with dry ice is that the food or drink may become too cold — put a bottle of champagne on top of dry ice, for instance, and it may shatter or partially freeze, so only use dry ice for foods that are best served frozen (like ice cream, popsicles, etc.)


To use dry ice in an ice chest, add your cold foods to the ice chest first, then place the dry ice on top and loosely shut the lid (as always, take care not to seal it completely.) Cold air sinks, so this arrangement keeps the chest frozen most efficiently. If there is any leftover space, fill it with wadded-up newspaper (extra air will make dry ice sublimate (turn into gas) faster.
Dry ice also works well for keeping normal ice frozen in a cooler.
Typically, you will want about 10 to 20 pounds of dry ice for every 24-hour period you need to keep your food items frozen (depending upon the size of the ice chest.)

, Surprisingly, dry ice can be used to keep foods like grains, beans, lentils, and pastas fresh. To do this, first place the dry ice at the bottom of a cooler. Make sure there isn't any frost on the dry ice, as this can introduce moisture and get your food wet. Pour your food products over the dry ice. Let this sit with the lid loosely on (but not sealed) for about five to six hours — the ice needs to completely sublimate (turn into gas) until there is no solid left. When this is done, seal the lid.


As the ice sublimates, it forms CO2 gas, which is heavier than air. As more gas forms, it forces the air out of the container. Without any air in the container, it is very difficult for bacteria or pests to survive, which greatly extends the food's life.
For this method, you will want to use about 1/4 pounds of dry ice per five-gallon container., As mentioned above, dry ice is so cold that it will actually cause materials like metal and ceramic to shrink slightly when it touches them. In certain situations, this property can actually be used to your advantage. See below for two examples:Fixing car dents: If you have a small ""ding"" on your car's exterior that looks like the metal has been pushed inward, dry ice may be able to help. Use heavy gloves to press a block or sheet of dried ice against the dent. If you can, press it against the inside of the dent as well. Hold the ice in place until frost forms a few inches around the dent, then remove the ice and let the material warm again. Repeat as needed.

Removing floor tiles: This trick is great for removing one or two ceramic tiles from your floor. Place a flat sheet of dry ice centered on the floor tile so that it touches its entire surface. Wait until the entire tile is frosted over. If the tile does not pop out by itself, use a few taps from a hammer and screwdriver to loosen the adhesive along the edges.

, Because carbon dioxide is heavier than air, it will displace air out of any container (we saw this in the food-preserving method above.) It's possible to use this principle to kill moles, gophers, and other pests that are tearing up your yard. To do this, push 1-2 inch sized pieces of dry ice into each hole and cover the top of the hole with dirt. Do this for as many holes as possible — ideally, all of them. The dry ice will sublimate and form CO2 gas, forcing out the oxygen and suffocating the pests."

Obtain dry litmus powder.,
Dissolve the litmus into water.,
Submerge your paper in the litmus solution.,
Allow your paper to dry.,
Use the litmus paper to test for acidity.",How to Make Homemade pH Paper Test Strips2," Litmus is a compound that is derived from lichens, fungi that form symbiotic relationships with alga and/or cyanobacteria capable of photosynthesis. You can purchase litmus online or at a chemical supply store.

It is possible to make your own litmus powder if you are a competent chemist. However, the process is quite involved and includes adding several compounds such as lime and potash to ground lichens and allowing weeks for fermentation., Make sure to stir the solution and heat if the powder is not dissolving well. The litmus powder needs to dissolve completely into the water. The resulting solution should be a violet-blue color., Get all sides and corners of the paper wet with the solution. This will give you the most surface area on the test strip and provide the most accurate results. You do not need to leave the paper to “soak” as long as you ensure that it is coated thoroughly., You should dry the paper in the open air, but be sure that you are not exposing it to acidic or basic vapors. These vapors could contaminate the strips and make the inaccurate. You should also be sure to store them in a dry, dark place to prevent contamination and bleaching., Blue litmus papers turn red in the presence of an acid. Keep in mind that they will not indicate how strong the acid is, or whether a solution is basic. No change means that the solution is either basic or neutral, but not acidic.You can make red litmus paper (that turns blue when exposed to a base) by adding acid to the indicator solution before soaking your paper."

Gather the equipment.,
Configure the equipment.,
Fire up the accelerator.,
Understand the science!,
Wait.,
Treat the mixture with nitric acid.,
Filter off the mercury and thallium nitrates.",How to Make Gold from Mercury," To turn mercury into gold, you will need the following:

Mercury (duh....). Get as much as you can, because it's not very efficient.
A neutron source. Ideally you need a particle accelerator (or a nuclear reactor).
A neutron moderator. Water (yes, the stuff out of a tap) works pretty well.
Neutron shielding, reflecting and collimating equipment
Nitric acid;
, The neutrons from the source need to pass through the collimator (a thing that makes them go in straight lines) and the moderator (something that slows them down so that they react better) and finally into the mercury. Set up the neutron reflectors around the mercury (so that any escaping neutrons are reflected back) and then surround the whole thing with shielding., Ideally, you want to hit the mercury with a short, very intense burst of neutron radiation., Here's what's happening:

Ordinary mercury contains seven isotopes: Hg-196, Hg-198, Hg-199, Hg-200, Hg-201, Hg-202 and Hg-204.
When it absorbs a neutron, Hg-196 becomes Hg-197. Hg-197 decays into gold.
As a by-product, Hg-202 and Hg-204 become Hg-203 and Hg-205, which decay into thallium.
Other isotopes change into each other and remain mercury.

, After the neutron burst, the reaction that produces gold has a half-life of 64.14 hours. If you wait this long, half of the Hg-197 will have become gold., After the reaction, the mixture should largely contain mercury, with some thallium isotopes, and gold. Nitric acid will dissolve mercury and thallium, but not gold., You should be left with gold.

And now for the bad news: Hg-196, the isotope converted to gold, comprises 0.15% of natural mercury. Assuming perfect conversion to Hg-197, then after one half-life (half of the Hg-197 decays), a kilogram of mercury will give you... 0.73 grams of gold. That's right, you get less than three-quarters of a gram of gold per kilo of mercury.

Fill a round bottom flask with ice.,
Heat the iodine in a beaker.,
Scrape the iodine off of the round bottom flask.",How to Make Iodine from Sulfuric Acid and an Alkali Metal Iodide," Put a solid iodide salt (e.g. sodium iodide or potassium iodide) into a glass container. Add water and stir with a glass stirring rod. Continue adding water and stirring the solution until all of the salt has been dissolved. Heating to approximately 120 ºF (~50 ºC) will help the dissolution process tremendously.


Adding heat will speed up the dissolution process.;
, Place the glass container in an ice bath. Allow the solution to sit in the ice bath for five to ten minutes and cool. The solution needs to be cool and in an ice bath before adding the sulfuric acid, as this addition will generate a lot of heat.

, Allow the solution to remain in the ice bath. Add sulfuric acid by pouring small amounts into the solution at a time. At first, the solution will become pasty. Keep adding sulfuric acid until the solution has become a black liquid.Sulfuric acid is extremely dangerous and corrosive. Always wear eye protection and gloves when working with it.
You will begin to see color changes as soon as the sulfuric acid comes in contact with the solution and iodine begins forming.
The fumes produced by this step are highly toxic. It should be done in a fume hood., Once you’ve finished the reaction, you will need to pour the solution into ice water. The original ice bath works well for this purpose. Allow the new solution to sit for five to ten minutes, or until the iodine has settled at the bottom.

, When the iodine has settled at the bottom, you can pour off the excess liquid. Be careful not to dump the solid iodine out as well. Once the brown liquid has been poured off (or decanted), you will be left with wet iodine.

, The wet iodine slurry will still contain excess sulfuric acid. To rinse away this acid, pour more water onto the slurry and stir. Allow the slurry to settle, and again pour away the excess liquid. Repeat this at least three times.

, You need to remove the water from the iodine slurry to yield a more pure form of iodine powder. Pour the slurry through a paper filter into a new beaker. The filter will allow the water to pass through, and it will hold back the solid iodine.


The solid on the filter paper is the iodine. The liquid can now be discarded.
Using vacuum filtration will dry the iodine even more effectively.

, Make sure that the flask you choose is big enough to rest on top of an available beaker without falling inside. The flask of ice will allow the iodine gas to cool rapidly to a solid.

, Place the iodine in a beaker. Put the round bottom flask full of ice on top of the beaker. Heat the beaker on a hot plate to turn the iodine to a gas.


The whole process is extremely messy and the large amount of iodine vapor will stain everything. Do not do this indoors.
Iodine gas is toxic, so this should be performed outside or inside a fume hood.
The iodine will form a purple gas and solidify into a purple solid.

, When the iodine vapors come in contact with the cold round bottom flask, they will cool rapidly. This will cause the iodine to solidify and stick to the flask itself. Once this happens, you can simply scrape your iodine off of the flask to collect it.


Heating and purifying the iodine is not necessary. It is an optional step to obtain a more pure version of the chemical.

Set yourself up for success by taking the cutting at the right time.,
Stick to the mantra that less is more.,
Prepare a separate container for the rooting hormone each time you use it.",How to Make Homemade Hormone Rooting Powder or Tonic1," There are four types of stem cuttings based on the growth stage of the plant: Herbaceous, softwood, semi-hardwood and hardwood.It is important to know what the plant is, as this is part of determining whether or not the cutting will even root.As such, you need to know what time of year is the best time for taking cuttings from the plant in question. Do some research into the plant to find out its specific best times for taking the cuttings. Provided you have taken the cutting at the right stage in its growth, the rooting process is more likely to be successful than not, especially when adding a rooting hormone and using an appropriate growing medium.


Note that woody ornamental plants, herbs and some flower species tend to root more easily than cuttings from trees., Rooting hormone is helpful but should never be overdone. Whichever rooting hormone you choose to use, be it commercial or a homemade variety, use it sparingly. Too much can cause problems such as burning the cutting, stifling growth, creating a growing medium for fungus or bacteria or discouraging root growth in some way.

, To prevent the transference of possible disease to later cuttings, don't dip each cutting into the large container of your homemade rooting hormone.Always tip or pour it into a small container for each batch of cuttings, then discard once used. Or, only make sufficient for that day's cuttings.

,
Pour the boiled water over the willow clippings in the other pot or container.,
Strain the willow mixture into clean glass bottles.,
Use the tonic.",How to Make Homemade Hormone Rooting Powder or Tonic4," The willow branches should be small, and the same size or less as a pencil. Young branches have the most indolebutyric acid in them, the hormone that encourages rooting.You'll need 2 cups of the small branches.


Alternatively, use the bark from older willow trees. In this case, you will need 3 cups because the hormone amount is much less in older trees. Bark from either the trunk or branches is fine.
Avoid using branches found on the ground because they are dead and the hormone will no longer be active.

, If using branches, cut into pieces about 3 to 6 inches (7.5cm to 15cm) in length. If using bark, cut into pieces about 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10cm).

, Add the clippings.

,, Set aside to brew. Leave for at least 12 hours, preferably 24 hours.

, Remove all willow clippings. Put the lids on, label and date the bottles. The rooting hormone tonic is now ready for use. Store in the refrigerator for up to two months.

, To use it, pour some tonic into a small container that will hold the cuttings comfortably. Add the cuttings to the container, wounded end facing into the solution. Leave for a few hours to let the tonic work its magic. The cuttings are then ready to plant in the appropriate medium (see below for help).

Keep the cutting moist and mist often to avoid drying out.",How to Make Homemade Hormone Rooting Powder or Tonic5," Some gardeners claim that honey contains enzymes that may stimulate root growth in plants.However, its most useful virtue is as a sanitizing agent which may provide sufficient cleanliness to give the cutting a healthy growing start to allow it to grow its own roots without needing anything else.Honey contains both antibacterial and anti-fungal properties.,


Remembering the mantra that less is more, take care to not overdo the honey, as the sugars in honey may have a counterproductive effect if too much is used.

, Plant as appropriate in the appropriate medium of choice (see below for help).

, Allow it to dissolve before using. You can stir it to help it dissolved, but it won't take long to dissolve itself, without having to intervene.

, Leave the cutting(s) there for a few hours to soak up the aspirin solution.

, The aspirin may encourage rooting in the same way that it helps to keep cut flowers revived for longer.

"
"
Know what to look for in a rooting medium for the cutting.,
Select a suitable rooting medium for the cutting.",How to Make Homemade Hormone Rooting Powder or Tonic7," As well as the rooting hormone, the medium used to place the cutting into is an important part of determining the success of the rooting. The rooting medium should have the following features:It is low in fertility.
It holds water well without being soggy and drains well. It stops the cutting and roots from drying out.
It supports the cutting sufficiently but is flexible enough to provide space for the growing roots.
It is free of non-beneficial bacteria, fungus or disease-causing organisms.
It is free of insects and weed seeds.

, Standard rooting materials include coarse sand, perlite, vermiculite (but take care as it can become too compacted or soggy), sand or perlite mixed with peat moss, etc.However, it is important to find out what the particular plant you're trying to root from cuttings does best in, as some mediums will work better than others. For example, some plants will prefer a more acidic medium, while others a more alkaline one.


Water is not ideal as a rooting medium for many plants, unless they're succulent plants like mint, ivy, philodendrons and coleus."

Sulfuric acid is highly corrosive. Be careful not to spill or splash it.
If you get sulfuric acid on your skin, immediately flush your skin with soap and cool water for at least 15 minutes, and seek medical attention.
If you splash sulfuric acid in your eyes, flush your eyes for at least 30 minutes with cool water and seek medical attention. WEAR GOGGLES to prevent this from happening!
If you spill acid on a surface, cover the spill with baking soda. Wait for the bubbling to stop. Then carefully wipe up all affected surfaces with a sponge or paper towels, and wash all of the material collected down the sink with plenty of water.;
, You will need a glass beaker or jar to perform the experiment in, and a glass measuring cup with milliliter gradations, or a glass eyedropper. You may also need a glass stir stick or spatula for retrieving excess copper pieces from the solution, and a scale to weight the copper.


Do not use metal or plastic measuring spoons, as they will react with the acid.

, This experiment will put off hydrogen (h2) gas, which is extremely combustible, and should only be done outdoors or under a laboratory vent hood, away from any open flames or ignition sources. You should also set up your experiment on an acid resistant surface, preferably one that is glass, or specifically chemical resistant.If you don't have a chemical-resistant surface to work on, you should at least put a sheet of thick cardboard under your work area. The sulfuric acid will dissolve the cardboard, but slowly enough that you can neutralize the spill with baking soda before it eats clear through.

, For this you will need 30% hydrogen peroxide, and concentrated (98%) sulfuric acid. Both of these can be purchased at a scientific supply company, although the hydrogen peroxide can also be ordered from major online retailers. You will also need a few inches of copper wire, or some chunks of copper pipe, available at any hardware store., Place 10ml 30% hydrogen peroxide in a beaker. Then add 3ml concentrated sulfuric acid. This is called ""Piranha solution"" and will heat up quickly, so be extremely careful.Never attempt to cover a beaker or vessel containing Piranha solution; it can explode.

, Carefully place about 3g of copper wire or metal chunks into the solution.


Do not use pennies for this experiment, as they contain a lot of metals besides copper and may cause unexpected reactions., Bubbles will begin to form around the copper, and the clear liquid in the jar will begin to turn blue.

Mix acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide.,
Heat the solution.,
Add copper to the solution.,
Monitor the reaction.",How to Make Copper Acetate1," The household version of acetic acid is vinegar. It is a dilute form of acetic acid that shows up in many home chemistry experiments. Mix it with hydrogen peroxide, which is usually kept in homes to clean cuts and scrapes (in the brown plastic bottle). You should use a 50/50 mixture.For example, if you use one cup of vinegar, use one cup of hydrogen peroxide.
It is best to use plain white vinegar.
Wear gloves and goggles when dealing with acids and oxidizers. You don’t want them on your skin or in your eyes.;
, Though the solution does not have to be boiling for the reaction to occur, bringing it to a boil takes out the guess work. Put the solution on the stove and let it come to a slight boil. Once at a boil, it is ready to react with copper to form copper acetate., Use copper wire or a penny to supply copper for the reaction. Lower the copper into the solution being careful not to splash yourself or touch the hot solution. You should be wearing gloves and goggles in case the solution does splash.If you are using a penny, know that you should only use pennies minted in or before 1982. After that, pennies have been made from copper plated zinc and only contain about 2.5% copper (down from 88-95% copper up to 1982)., Watch for the solution to change color. A blue color indicates that copper acetate has been made. This should happen in a matter of minutes.If the solution does not turn blue, copper acetate was not formed. In this case, check you reagents. Make sure the vinegar and peroxide are in correct proportions and that the chemicals are not expired. Also, verify that your copper source is truly copper and not just another metal plated with copper.

Define a percent by weight/volume solution.,
Identify the volume of solution you want to make.,
Calculate the number of grams needed to make the solution.,
Weigh out the mass of the compound.,
Dilute the compound in the necessary amount of solvents.",How to Make Chemical Solutions1," A percent solution simply means parts per hundred. In terms of making a chemical solution this means that you will have 1 gram of compound for every 100 milliliters of liquid or 1 mL/100mL if you are working with an already liquid compound.For example by weight: A 10% solution by weight simply means that you have 10 grams of compound dissolved in 100 mL of solution.
For example by volume: A 23% solution by volume simply means that you have 23 mL of liquid compound in every 100 mL of solution.;
, In order to determine the mass of the compound needed, you must first determine the final volume of the solution you want to make. The volume will be determined by how much solution you need for your task, how frequently you will need it, and the stability of the solution over time.


Make only the amount you need if the solution must be made fresh every time it is used.
If the solution is stable long-term, you can make a larger volume to store and use later.
For example: Make a 5% solution of NaCl in 500 mL of water.

, To calculate the number of grams needed to make your percent solution, you will multiply using the formula: # grams = (percent desired)(desired volume/100 mLs). The percent desired will be expressed in grams and the desired volume must be expressed in milliliters.For example: Make a 5% solution of NaCl in 500 mL of water.
# grams = (5g)(500mL/100mL) = 25 grams
If the NaCl was already dissolved in liquid form, you would add 25 mL of NaCl instead of grams of powder and subtract that volume from the final volume: 25 mL of NaCl into 475 mL of water.

, Once you have calculated the desired mass, you need to weigh it out. Using a calibrated balance, place a weighing dish and zero it out. Weigh out the necessary amount of compound in grams and set it aside.


Always clean the balance of any powder before continuing to make the solution.
For example: Weigh out 25 g of NaCl.

, Unless otherwise stated, you will probably be diluting the compound in water. Using a graduated cylinder (a measuring device used specifically for volume), measure out the desired amount of liquid. Mix with powdered compound until dissolved.Clearly label the container with both the chemical and the concentration.
For example: Mix 500 mL of water and 25 g of NaCl to make a 5% solution.
Remember, if you’re diluting a liquid compound, you must subtract out the volume of liquid being added from the final volume: 500 mL – 25 mL = 475 mL of water.

Make calcium acetate.,
Add the calcium acetate to a copper sulfate solution.,
Filter the solution.",How to Make Copper Acetate2," Add calcium carbonate to vinegar. Mix until the calcium carbonate is completely dissolved. You can order calcium carbonate from a chemical supplier, but this is not necessary as it is the main ingredient in chalk.Use plain white vinegar.
You can simply grind up chalk to make calcium carbonate powder.
Goggles and gloves should be worn while working with acids.
Use half as much calcium carbonate by volume as vinegar. For example, if you use two cups of vinegar, use one cup of calcium carbonate.

, Copper sulfate is another easy chemical to find at a home and garden store. It is often branded as a fungicide. It may also be labeled as a stump killer. It is found dissolved in water.Pour the calcium acetate solution in slowly until the color turns blue. The blue color indicates that you have made copper acetate.
The resulting solution should be blue in color.
Avoid getting the solution on your skin or in your eyes by wearing gloves and goggles.

, The blue solution contains dissolved copper acetate. There will also be a solid that precipitates out of the solution (calcium sulfate). Pour the solution through a strainer to remove the calcium sulfate. You will be left with a blue copper acetate solution."

Stir the water until the crystals are completely dissolved. The solution should be blue in color.If you have made your own copper acetate solution from household chemicals, this step is not necessary.

, Copper acetate will precipitate spontaneously. You should leave the solution in a cool, dry place. As the water evaporates, copper acetate will be forced out of solution. You will see blue crystals form across the surface of your dish.You can also drop a crystal in the solution to jump start the precipitation.
Put the solution out of reach for small children and pets. If left unattended, pets and small children may ingest the solution. This can lead to acute copper poisoning that can be dangerous or even fatal., Once you have obtained crystals, pour off any remaining solution. Transfer the crystals to a paper towel. Let them sit for a day or two to dry out."

Identify the formula weight (FW) of the compound you are using.,
Define the volume of the solution you are making in liters.,
Calculate the number of grams needed to make the desired molar solution.,
Weigh out the mass of the compound.,
Dilute the powder in the appropriate liquid volume.",How to Make Chemical Solutions2," The formula weight (often used interchangeably with molecular weight) of a compound will be listed in grams/mole (g/mol) on the side of the chemical bottle. If you cannot find the formula weight on the bottle, you can search for the compound online to find it.The formula weight of a compound is the mass in grams of one mole of the compound.
For example: The formula weight of sodium chloride (NaCl) 58.44 g/mol.

, It is very simple to make a 1 liter solution since molarity is simple moles/liter; however, you may need to make more or less than a liter depending on what you’re using the solution for. You will use the final volume of the solution to calculate the number of grams needed to make your molar solution.For example: Make a 50 mL solution of 0.75 molar NaCl.
To convert mL to L, divide by 1000: 0.05 L.

, To calculate the number of grams needed you will use the equation # grams = (desired volume)(desired molarity)(formula weight). Remember, the desired volume needs to be in liters, molarity is in moles per liter, and formula weight is in grams per mole.For example: If you want to make 50 mL of a 0.75 molar solution of NaCl (FW: 58.44 g/mol), you can calculate the number of grams of NaCl needed.
# grams = 0.05 L * 0.75 mol/L * 58.44 g/mol = 2.19 grams NaCl.
When you cancel all units, you should be left with grams of the compound.

, Using a properly calibrated balance, weigh out the necessary mass of the compound. Place a weighing dish on the balance and zero it out before weighing. Add the compound to the dish until you have the correct amount.


Clean the balance when you are finished using it.
For example: Weigh out 2.19 grams of NaCl.

, Most solutions will be diluted using water unless otherwise specified. The volume of the liquid to be used is the same that you used to calculate the mass of the compound. Mix the compound and the water together until the powder is fully dissolved.


Clearly label the solution with the molarity and the compound so it can be easily identified in the future.
For example: Using a graduated cylinder (measuring equipment for volume), measure 50 mL of water and mix it with the 2.19 g of NaCl.
Mix until the powder is fully dissolved.

Define the concentration of each solution.,
Determine the volume of the solution you want to make.,
Calculate the volume of working stock to be added to the final solution.,
Subtract the volume of the stock solution from the desired final volume.,
Combine the calculated volume of the stock solution with the volume of the dilution solution.",How to Make Chemical Solutions3," When diluting solutions, you must know the concentration of the working stock and the final concentration that you want your solution to have. This method is useful for diluting highly concentrated solutions into less concentrated solutions.For example: Make 75 mLs of a 1.5 M stock of NaCl from a working stock of 5 M. The working stock is at a concentration of 5 M and you want to dilute to a final concentration of 1.5 M.

, You must also define the total volume of the solution you want to make. You will calculate the amount of working solution that needs to be added in order to dilute it to the final concentration and volume.For example: Make 75 mLs of a 1.5 M stock of NaCl from a working stock of 5 M. For this example, you want a final volume of 75 mLs of solution.

, To determine the amount of working stock that needs to be diluted, you use the formula V1C1=V2C2; V1 is volume of the working stock and C1 is the concentration of the working stock; V2 is the desired final volume and C2 is the desired final concentration of the solution.To calculate the volume of the working stock needed, the equation gets rearranged to solve for V1: V1 = (V2C2)/C1

For example: Make 75 mLs of a 1.5 M stock of NaCl from a working stock of 5 M.
V1 = (V2C2)/C1 = (0.075 L * 1.5 M)/5M = 0.0225 L.
Convert L back to mL by multiplying by 1000: 22.5 mL.

, When diluting the stock solution, you need to make sure that you dilute to your final volume. By subtracting the volume of the stock solution to be added you will make sure the dilution is done properly.


For example: You want a final volume of 75 mLs and will be adding 22.5 mL of the stock solution. Therefore, 75 – 22.5 = 52.5 mLs. This volume is the amount of dilution solution you will use.

, Using a graduated cylinder (measuring equipment for volumes), measure out the volume of the stock solution and then mix it with the volume of the dilution solution.


For example: Measure 22.5 mLs of the stock 5 M solution of NaCl and dilute it with 52.5 mLs of water. Stir to mix.
Label the container with both the concentration and the compound: 1.5 M NaCl.
Remember, if you are diluting an acid with water, always add the acid to the water.

Wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE).,
Work in a ventilated area.,
Add acid to water.",How to Make Chemical Solutions4," When working with strong chemicals and solutions you want to make sure that your body is protected from harm. Wearing a lab coat, close-toed shoes, eye protection, and gloves are essentials when handling these compounds.


Wear a lab coat that is made of an inflammable material.
Eye protection should have side shields to protect from splashes across the face.

, When mixing solutions together, volatile gases can be formed and escape into the air. Some chemicals can only be handled in a chemical fume hood found in a laboratory. If working at home, open windows and have a fan blowing to make sure the air circulates.

, When diluting strong acids, always add the acid to the water. When water and acid mix, the reaction is exothermic (releases heat) and can be explosive if the water is added to the acid instead of the other way around.Refresh your memory with the proper safety precautions every time you work with acids.

Handle the solution with caution.,
Work in a well-ventilated area.",How to Make Flash Freeze Liquid," This substitute is made by combining dry ice and ethanol.For our purposes we will use 99% isopropyl alcohol or rubbing alcohol. You will also need a plastic 2-liter bottle, a plastic 18oz bottle, dry ice, and scissors.


Dry ice pellets are easier to use than a block of dry ice.
Using isopropyl with an alcohol content of less than 99% will form a gel when in contact with the dry ice and won’t work properly for this experiment.
If you don’t have plastic containers on hand, you can use Styrofoam. Avoid using glass materials as the supercool temperatures can cause the glass to break. Metal is also not recommended with the very cold temperatures.;
, You are going to nest the smaller bottle inside the larger bottle to make an outer layer for the dry ice. You should have a smaller bottle that will act like a sieve with enough space around it to pack with dry ice and the larger bottle that will hold liquid with no leaks.


Start by cutting the tops off of the two bottles.
Carefully poke many small holes into the smaller bottle. Make holes large enough for the alcohol to freely flow out but small enough that dry ice pellets can’t get through.
Place the smaller bottle inside the middle of the larger bottle.

, You need to have pieces that are small enough to fit in the space between the large and small bottle. Crush enough pieces to fill the space. Dry ice is very cold and can burn you if handled for too long. Use an oven mitt or other protective glove to prevent injury.


If you did not get the pellets, place your block on a wooden cutting board in your sink.
Place both the board and the block of dry ice in a large bag to help contain flying fragments.Carefully cut small pieces off the block using a knife or a hammer.

, Using the small pieces that chipped off the block or the dry ice pellets, fill the space between the bottles. Fill the space halfway to three-quarters of the way to the top.


Don’t put dry ice in the small bottle, put it around it.
Make sure the dry ice is below the top of the small bottle.

, Slowly pour the alcohol around the outside of the smaller bottle onto the dry ice.The alcohol will start to boil so pour slowly and carefully to avoid splashes.


Repeat until you have a sufficient amount of non-boiling liquid to use. The plastic bottle should be filled about 2/3 of the way up with liquid.
The gas released during this process is carbon dioxide. Work in a well-ventilated area and avoid breathing the gas directly.

, Submerge your item of choice for a few seconds. Although this solution doesn’t work as quickly as liquid nitrogen, it still only takes a few seconds to freeze the objects.


Try freezing a variety of objects and see how their properties change with extreme cold.
Unlike liquid nitrogen, which will bead and roll off of your skin, this solution will stick to your skin and cause severe burns. Wear insulated gloves and clothing that covers skin that could be exposed to the mixture.

, Although different than making a liquid nitrogen substitute, you can perform an experiment that allows you to flash freeze, also known as supercooling, water. Supercooling water can only be done with distilled water as tap water has impurities that will lead to premature freezing.As it freezes, water expands, so leave some space in the bottle when you fill it.

, Place the bottle in a spot that will not be knocked around at all during the cooling process. Cooling time will vary depending on the temperature of your freezer. An easy way to tell if your water is supercooled is to also place a bottle of tap water in the freezer. When the tap water is frozen, your bottle should be around freezing, but still liquid.After about 2 hrs, check the bottle of tap water every 15 minutes until it is frozen.
Be careful not to touch the bottle of distilled water.
If the distilled water is also frozen, you have left it in the freezer for too long. Let the water thaw and try again.

, Gently remove the bottle from the freezer without jostling it too much. A quick, jerky, movement can cause a supercooled liquid to crystallize into ice.

, Shaking the bottle will initiate the crystallization process and you can watch the water freeze before your eyes. This is also known as snap freezing as it happens quickly., Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide and is very cold. Always use insulated gloves when handling it directly.Wear goggles to protect your eyes from splashing.

, In small amounts, liquid nitrogen will boil off the skin and not cause immediate damage, however, prolonged contact will cause severe burns. This solution does not boil off and will cause severe burns with contact.Always wear protective clothing while handling the mixture.


Make sure no skin is exposed while handling the solution.

, This solution produces clouds of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide exists normally in our atmosphere but can be harmful in high quantities.Keep your face away from the gas as it’s produced and work in a room with good ventilation.


If you begin to feel light-headed, leave the room and step outside. Take some deep breaths.
Let the gas in the room dissipate before you re-enter. Open windows to increase ventilation and/or turn on a fan.

All your ingredients.,

If any ingredients are in containers where it's hard to get them out with a syringe, pour a portion of those ingredients into separate containers, such as cups.,Pick a bottle, and use the syringes to measure your decided amount of each ingredient into the bottle.,Close the bottle, and shake thoroughly to mix the ingredients.,Repeat for each bottle.,
Return unused ingredient to its containers.,Clean all syringes and all containers used to hold ingredients.",How to Make E‐Fluid,"

Determine the nicotine concentration of the e-fluid you are already using. It should be indicated on the label, and it is measured in milligrams of nicotine per milliliter of fluid (mg/ml).
Determine the concentration of your concentrated nicotine solution. It should be given on the label, in mg/ml.
Apply this formula: percentage of concentrated nicotine solution in your e-fluid = 100 * (desired concentration / concentration of nicotine solution)

For example, if your desired concentration is 3mg/ml, and you have 75mg/ml nicotine solution, your e-fluid needs to be 100 * (3/75) = 4% nicotine solution.;
,

As a starting point, try a concentration of 10% flavor concentrate. (This means that your e-fluid will be 10% flavor concentrate.)
Use trial and error to refine this. (The needed concentration may be different for different flavors, even if they are from the same manufacturer.)

, Take whatever percentage of the e-fluid is unaccounted for after the nicotine and flavorings, and split it up however you want between vegetable glycerin and/or propylene glycol. Experiment to see what works best for you.

For example, using 4% nicotine solution and 10% flavor concentrate, you could use 86% VG, or 70% PG and 16% VG.

,

Determine how much e-fluid your bottles hold. This should be indicated on the label or packaging.
Apply this formula for each ingredient: Amount of ingredient = volume of container * (percentage of ingredient / 100)

For example, let's say we want to make an e-fluid of 4% nicotine, 10% flavor, and 86% VG in a 30ml bottle. The measurements would be:

Nicotine: 30ml * .04 = 1.2ml
Flavor: 30ml * .10 = 3ml
VG: 30ml * .86 = 25.8ml



, Some e-fluid ingredients, such as vegetable glycerin, are highly viscous. Most liquids get more viscous when cold, and so your ingredients will also be more viscous if they have been in the refrigerator.

Highly viscous ingredients create two problems in mixing e-fluid. First, they can be difficult or impossible to get into the syringe. Second, they may refuse to mix effectively with the other ingredients.

, However, vegetable glycerin can be so viscous that it will refuse to go into the widest syringe you can find. At this level of viscosity, it also won't mix easily at all with the other ingredients., If your ingredients are very viscous, you may have no option but to make them less viscous. This can be done by heating them. You may find it necessary to do this with your vegetable glycerin, but probably not with any other ingredient.

To heat vegetable glycerin, you can put it in the microwave briefly. Exact time depends on amount and starting temperature, but 15 seconds is a good starting point.
Another way to heat ingredients is with a heated bath. This approach has the advantage of letting you maintain the ingredient at a high temperature for a long time, should that matter to you. It would also be an option if you need to heat an ingredient that you're nervous about putting in the microwave.

The endocrine system of humans is composed of several glands that have communications with a master endocrine gland which is called the pituitary gland.,
These mechanisms are mostly autonomic in nature and are controlled by loops between the pituitary gland and the other endocrine glands.,
The secretion of hormones by the various endocrine glands is controlled by the secretion of regulatory hormones that are secreted by the master gland, the pituitary gland.,
High level of the TSH hormone will initially cause an increase in the secretion of the thyroid hormone (TH).,
All the endocrine glands that are spread in the body are under the direct control and regulation by hormones of the pituitary gland.,
Both of these hormones are regulated by the degree of osmolality of the blood plasma and by the status of blood volume in the arteries.,
Usually high blood volume signals the decrease of secretion of both of these hormones to the blood circulation.,
The secretion of this hormone usually signals the kidney to conserve water to the blood.,
This hormone is regulated by the level of water or blood in the arteries and by the degree of osmolality of the blood.,
This structure of the brain controls the hormonal secretions by the pituitary gland through the release to the blood of releasing hormones that control by a mechanism of positive feedback the secretion of the hormones by the pituitary gland.

",How to Learn and Understand the Physiological Function of the Endocrine System in Humans," This gland is part of the brain and is located at the bottom aspect of the brain below the hypothalamus. The communication between the master gland and the other endocrine glands that are spread along the body organs is done via special mechanisms that are called feedback mechanisms.;
, The endocrine glands secrete special types of organic molecules that are called hormones. These molecules are the mediators of communication between the pituitary gland and the other endocrine glands. The feedback mechanism depends on the concentration of the individual hormone in the blood.

, The amount of secreted hormone by the pituitary gland will dictate the amount of hormone that is secreted by the target endocrine gland. For example, the hormone thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is secreted by the pituitary gland and it functions to stimulate the secretion of the thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland.

, After the concentration of the thyroid hormone is high enough the feedback loop starts to work. In this case the excess amount of the TH in the blood exerts a negative feedback signaling the pituitary gland to decrease its secretion of the TSH. This in turn decreases the amount of the TSH that is secreted by the pituitary gland. This mechanism ensures that the body maintains a state of equilibrium and homeostasis.

, The feedback mechanism that applies to all hormones of the glands in the body has two exceptions to this rule. One is the hormone aldosterone and the other is the hormone vasopressin. The secretion of these two hormones to the blood circulation is regulated by different mechanism than the normal feedback mechanism typical of the other endocrine glands in the body.

, This is so due to the unique function of these two hormones in the body. Both of these hormones have an effect on the blood volume and in particular they have direct effect on the amount of water in the body.

, The reverse is observed when there is a state of hypovolemia or low blood volume in the arteries. The hormone aldosterone is usually secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to decreased blood volume or in the case of hyponatremia.

, The same effect is observed with the secretion of the hormone vasopressin. This hormone is usually secreted by the pituitary gland from its posterior part.

, The secretion of hormones by the pituitary gland is its self regulated by the hypothalamus.

Acetylcholinesterase is one type of various enzymes in the body of humans that has specific and unique function that is related to neutralizing the effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by removing an acetyl group from its molecular structure.,
The targeting of this enzyme by nerve gases is mediated by the process of enzymatic inhibition of this particular enzyme by organophosphorus related compounds that have characteristic chemical properties of being able to inhibit the catalytic function of this enzyme through a noncompetitive mechanism of inhibition that leads to irreversible binding of the nerve agent to the active site of this enzyme.

,
By doing so the normal function of the enzyme is interrupted.,
The immediate clinical effect of this process of enzyme inhibition is the continuous contraction of the various muscles in the body.,
The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is an amine derivative that has a quaternary ammonium group as part of its molecular structure.,
By virtue of its polar and hydrophilic structure this compound is unable to penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane.,
This neurotransmitter is secreted by neurons into the neuromuscular junction based on a stimulus that the neurons receive.,
This molecule functions physiologically at the neuromuscular junction by inducing the opening of sodium ion channels in muscle cells.,
The most prominent clinical effect of this neurotransmitter is on the muscles of the digestive system.,
Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter of the autonomic nervous system.,
Enzymes inhibition is one main strategy that is used in chemical warfare as well as for other clinical processes such as for treating medical disorders.",How to Learn and Understand the Physiology Behind the Inhibition of the Acetyl Choline Esterase Enzyme," This enzyme is a convenient target of chemical warfare agents due to its important role in removing the immediate effect of the acetylcholine molecule at the neuromuscular junction between neurons and muscle cells.;
,, Therefore, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine molecules accumulate at the neuromuscular junction between neurons and the muscle cells which continue to function un-endlessly by inducing the process of muscles contraction in the autonomic and involuntary muscles of the body.

, The most dangerous effect of this muscles contraction is manifested in the muscles of the lungs and the muscle of the diaphragm. The continuous never-ending contraction of these muscles can hinder the normal process of breathing. This leads in turn to suffocation of the individual and subsequently to his unavoidable death.

, This ammonium group bears a positive charge that imparts hydrophilic properties to this compound. The immediate consequence of this typical chemical structure of this compound is its unique physiological effect of signaling the contraction of the muscle cells.

, Its main signaling function is by binding to receptors on the outer cellular membrane of muscle cells.

, The secretion of this neurotransmitter is reported to occur based on the accumulation of calcium ions in the inner side of the neurons. It is postulated that calcium ions have a role in inducing the secretion of this neurotransmitter into the neuromuscular junction.

, This opening of ion channels can induce an action potential in these muscle cells which can lead eventually through a sequence of events to the contraction of muscles primarily of involuntary type of muscles such as muscles of the gastrointestinal tract and the muscles of the lungs and the diaphragm.

, Contraction of the muscles of the intestine by the effect of this neurotransmitter leads to the so called peristaltic motion of the muscles of the intestinal wall. This in turn causes the propulsion and movement of food content in the stomach along the gastrointestinal tract. This neurotransmitter has many other functions that are related to its effects on muscle contraction in the body.

, Also secreted by this branch of the nervous system are the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine. These two neurotransmitters have completely different roles in the autonomic nervous system that are unrelated to the function of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter.

, In both cases the principle of action is very similar. It involves the inhibition of the particular enzyme by specific molecules that have potential of binding either reversibly or irreversibly to one amino acid that is located in the active site of the particular enzyme that is the target of inhibition by the drug.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Make the base.,
Mount the motor on the bottom of the wooden platform.,
Cut a slit through the wooden platform above the pulley attachment.,
Mount the caster wheels to the platform.,
Attach the scrap metal as a container stop.,
Slide the belt and container into place.,
Attach the motor to the power supply.,
Fill the container with small metal balls.,
Add the chemical you need to grind.,
Turn on the power supply.,
Let the mill run for a few hours.",How to Make a Ball Mill," Making a ball mill is a relatively simple process, but there are quite a few materials needed. A lot of the supplies can be recycled from other projects and found in junk piles, but some may need to be purchased. Once you have the following materials, you can start building (1 in = 2.54 cm):Wood screws
Four small caster wheels
A cylindrical container with secure lid (a diameter of 3-5 inches and length of around 12 inches should be sufficient for milling)
A 1”x10”x14” wooden platform (you may need a smaller or larger platform if your cylinder is smaller or larger)
Two 1”x10”x4” pieces of wood
Screwdriver
Rubber belt (diameter that is at least an inch larger than the container)
A jigsaw
12V DC motor with fine tooth pulley motor attachment (can be scrapped from an old printer)
Motor mount
A small piece of scrap metal
A DC power supply;
, The wooden base will serve as the support for the ball mill. It can be made by resting the wooden platform on top of the two 1”x10”x4” (2.54cm x 25.4 cm x 10.16 cm) pieces of wood. Place one smaller piece on either end of the platform and screw them in place using four wood screws evenly spaced across.Position the wood pieces so that the base sits at a height of 4” (10.16 cm).
You can secure the wood pieces in place with some wood glue before using the screws to make it more sturdy.

, You want to attach the motor to the underside of the platform. The motor will be attached to the belt which will cause the cylinder, or drum, to rotate. Attach the motor in the center of the platform about 1 inch from the left side. The motor should only fit into the mount in one position. Position the motor in the mount and screw one side of the mount in place.Leaving the other side of the mount unattached allows the motor to hang down increasing the tension and keeping the belt from slipping.

, With the motor mounted you can clearly see where the pulley attachment ends. Mark the platform just above where the motor arm ends and cut a long, narrow slit that is just wider than the width of the belt. The belt will be connected to the motor that will be mounted underneath the platform. It will be fed through the slit to wrap around the container and cause it to spin.Remove the motor before making the cut to avoid damage to the motor arm.
You want the slit to be large enough for the belt to spin without touching the sides of the slit.
Trace the width of the belt and add about 1/8” (32 mm) to either side. Use a jigsaw to cut out the slit.
Use caution when working with a jigsaw. Wear protective eyewear to avoid damage from flying bits of wood.

, Determine the best location for the caster wheels by placing them on top of the platform and setting the cylinder on top of the wheels. The casters will help the cylinder rotate. Adjust the wheels until the cylinder sits about ½” (13 mm) above the top of the platform.With the casters properly placed, screw them in to attach.

, With the cylinder sitting on top of the wheels, you can determine the best place to mount your scrap metal. The scrap metal will serve as a stop to prevent the cylinder from sliding out of the belt as it rotates. Screw down the scrap metal about 1/8” (32 mm) away from the edge of the cylinder.


A good shape for this piece is a thin rectangle: about 4”x1”x1” (10.16 cm x 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm).
If the cylinder slides while the instrument is running, it will be stopped from sliding out by the scrap metal.
An alternative to scrap metal would be a piece of wood or thick plastic.

, Slip the belt through the slit in the platform so that it hooks onto the pulley attachment of the motor arm. Keeping the belt hooked, slide the cylinder through the belt onto the casters.If everything has been constructed properly, the belt should be taut against the cylinder.
If the belt is not taut, you may need to lower the height of the motor arm or raise the casters.
The belt length itself cannot be adjusted, so if the belt is too big, you will need to get a smaller belt.

, The motor should have a black and a red wire coming out of it. Using wires with alligator clamps on the end, attach the red wire to the positive end of the power supply and the black wire to the negative end of the power supply.If you mix up the wires, that’s okay. The ball mill will still work, the motor will just rotate in the opposite direction.
Use caution when using the power source. If you’re unsure about the electronics, ask a friend who has more expertise before using it.

, Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½” (13 mm) and ¾” (19 mm) inside the mill.The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.For a cylinder drum of the size used above, about 40-60 balls should be sufficient. Larger drums will require more balls.
A good rule of thumb is to fill the container about 1/3 of the way with the balls.

, You can fill the container with as much of the substance to be ground as you’d like. You simply need to leave enough room for everything to be able to move around. Keeping the container about 2/3 full should be good.It is possible to overfill the container, so experiment with your own personal ball mill to test its limits.
Secure the lid tightly in place when everything has been added.
With the container full, you are ready to slide the container into the belt.
Do not grind explosive or flammable chemicals, especially with metal balls. The tumbling motion can cause the balls to spark and catch fire.

, Start with the power supply set to 12 volts. You can use the power supply to fine tune the rotation by changing the voltage. You want the cylinder to spin fast enough to grind up the chemical, but not so fast the balls doing the grinding stick to the sides of the cylinder from centrifugal force.The best voltage may change depending on the weight of the chemical that you are trying to grind.

, It takes time to grind up your chemical into a fine dust. Because the ball mill is quite loud, store it in a closet or the basement while it is running. Check on it periodically to make sure everything is running smoothly.After a few hours check the consistency of your chemical. If it is not fine enough for your liking, put it back in the grinder and let it run longer.
When you are done, pour the contents through a sieve to remove the steel balls and any pieces that didn’t get ground finely."

Study about the tumors of the gonads in males and females.,
Study the hormone vasopressin and its associated clinical manifestations.",How to Learn and Understand the Functions of the Pituitary Gland in Humans," The pituitary gland in humans is located at the base of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus. This anatomical structure in the brain is an important endocrine gland which is the main regulator of all other endocrine glands that are spread in the various parts of the body.;
, This relatively small anatomical structure is responsible for secreting many hormones into the blood circulation each of which is a specific signaling molecule of a different endocrine gland in the body.

, All the hormones of the pituitary gland are regulated by releasing hormones that are secreted by the hypothalamus. The hormones of the pituitary gland are all under positive feedback control by regulating hormones in the hypothalamus except for the hormone prolactin which is regulated by a negative feedback from the hormone dopamine. The secretion of prolactin is inhibited by excessive amount of dopamine in the blood. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is usually secreted by neurons in the basal ganglia of the brain. This hormone was shown experimentally to be involved in mediating psychotic episodes in experimental individuals which have administered excessive amounts of this hormone.

, The clinical psychiatric condition of mental psychosis is characterized biochemically by the presence of high concentration of this hormone in the blood of affected patients. Dopamine is usually synthesized from an amino acid that is called tyrosine. Patients who are schizophrenic usually secrete large amount of dopamine into the blood. One of the symptoms of this excessive secretion of dopamine is the development of psychotic symptoms that include visual and auditory hallucinations in addition to an increase in sexual desire and an increase in appetite for food.

, Patients of this clinical disorder are usually treated with antipsychotic drugs such as Zyprexa. This commercial drug is an antagonist to the action of dopamine by binding to its receptors in the nervous system. As a result of this the negative feedback on the secretion of prolactin is lifted and an increase in its secretion is observed. One of the symptoms of the increased secretion of prolactin into the blood is the development of infertility and gynecomastia or enlargement of the breast in males.

, Many other hormones that are secreted by the pituitary gland have also clinical effects in case of their deficiency or excess in the blood. An example is the regulator hormone of the thyroid gland that is called thyroid stimulating hormone. This hormone is responsible for the stimulation of the secretion of the thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland. In hypothyroidism the level of the thyroid hormone is diminished. As a result the negative feedback on the secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone is lifted and an increase in its secretion is observed. For this reason the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is usually done by finding high level of thyroid stimulating hormone in the blood.

, In hyperthyroidism the opposite effect is observed. Low level of thyroid stimulating hormone is observed in the blood of these patients due to the excessive amount of the thyroid hormone in the blood. Similar effects are observed with the other hormones of the pituitary gland. For example the hormone cortisol is regulated by the hormone corticotropin releasing hormone of the anterior pituitary gland. Excessive amount of this hormone in the blood can cause increased secretion of cortisol in the blood. This medical condition is called Addison disease.

, The opposite effect is observed with diminished secretion of corticotrophin releasing hormone. High cortisol level in the blood exerts a strong negative feedback effect on the hormone of the pituitary gland which causes its diminished secretion into the blood circulation. Clinical manifestation of Cushing syndrome includes diminished amount of corticotrophin releasing hormone in the blood of affected individuals. Testosterone and estrogen are also under the regulation of common hormone by the anterior pituitary gland that is called gonadotropin releasing hormone. The testosterone and estrogen hormones have wide spread function in the sexual organs of males and females.

, Abnormalities in their concentrations in the blood can therefore have many clinical symptoms. Tumors of the gonads in males such as prostate cancer usually secrete high levels of testosterone. This can in turn exert negative feedback effect on the secretion of the gonadotropin releasing hormone by the pituitary gland. The same effect is also observed with the excessive secretion of estrogen in females. The other pituitary gland hormones are vasopressin and oxytocin. These two hormones are secreted by the posterior part of the gland. They have distinct function in the body. Clinical symptoms are observed with concentration abnormalities of these two hormones.

, Vasopressin is the more important hormone clinically among the two hormones. This hormone is the main regulator of water balance in the blood. Its concentration abnormality is associated with distinct clinical symptoms such as increased blood pressure in the case of excess of vasopressin in the blood. Also its deficiency in the blood is associated with decreased blood pressure of affected individuals.

Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with mathematical calculations that lead eventually to the determination of the energy and geometry of particular chemical compounds of interest to the chemist.,
The most important electrons in the atom or the molecule are those that are located in the highest electronic shell or in the language of orbitals the highest occupied (HOMO) and unoccupied (LUMO) molecular orbitals.,
Chemical calculations on organic compounds are part of the computational chemistry scheme.,
Chemical compounds reactivity is governed by the HOMO orbital and the LUMO or the frontier molecular orbitals.,
The basic equation that is used to determine the energetics of chemical compounds is the Schroedinger equation.,
The Schroedinger equation is a linear differential equation that is mathematically solvable in exact manner only for simple systems such as the particle in a box and the energetics of the hydrogen atom.,
For atoms other than hydrogen, solutions of the Schroedinger equation cannot be obtained mathematically in an accurate fashion due to the presence in the Hamiltonian of the Schroedinger equation a potential energy term that makes the analytical solution of the Schroedinger equation impossible.,
Most calculations in chemistry involve this type of perturbation theory.,
The other part of the Hamiltonian that is difficult to solve exactly is due to the spin-orbit coupling which is a relativistic effect.,
In the 1990th the most well known calculation method for the chemist was the Hartree-Fock method or the self consistent field.",How to Learn About the Various Computational Techniques That Are Used in Chemistry," For the most part, the interesting information that a chemist seeks are electronic energies of atoms and molecules. The calculation can also predict if the compound is stable enough to be existent.;
, These orbitals are responsible for the chemical characteristics of the molecules, namely whether they will react with other molecules or not and by which symmetry.

, They are difficult to calculate accurately due to the involvement of many atoms in their molecular structure. However, organic compounds which have small number of atoms are relatively easy to calculate due to the low electron count in them.

, In particular, the interaction between the LUMO of one compound and the HOMO of the other reactant are important. The difference in energetics between these two orbitals as well as the matching of the symmetry will dictate if there will be a reaction between these two compounds. Therefore, it is important to perform calculations on the energetics of these orbitals and not on the inner core orbitals in order to verify if there will be a reaction between these two molecules or not.

, This equation is nonrelativistic and does not account for relativistic effects such as the phenomenon of the spin. The quantum mechanical variant of this equation that involves relativistic effects on atoms and molecules is called the Dirac equation.

, For atomic systems it is solved only for the hydrogen atom in an exact manner. In this case also the solution involves formidable mathematical equations that involve laplacian in spherical coordinates. In addition, it involves also differential equations that are not straightforward to solve for the practitioner chemist.

, For this reason many efforts were done in order to overcome this difficulty by deriving several approximation methods that are called perturbative methods. They involve solving the the energy term of the perturbation itself and then adding it to the general energy of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.

, This is especially important for many electron atoms and molecules. In many electron atoms there are two main perturbations that prevent from solving the Schroedinger equation in an exact manner. These are: the correlation between electrons or the repulsion forces between the various electrons which add a term to the Hamiltonian that makes the mathematics impossible for solving the problem. This electronic correlation is manifested not only in many electrons atoms but also in all molecules.

, It originates due to the relative motion of the nucleus around the electron itself. The movement of the nucleus around the electron generates a magnetic field that can interact with the spin and angular magnetic moment of the electron, thus giving rise to an additional term in the atomic Hamiltonian that impedes an accurate solution of the Schroedinger equation.

, Nowadays there are many perturbative methods such as the Muller plesset method which includes correlation between electrons in the Hamiltonian. In addition a popular method that is being used more and more in computational chemistry is the density functional theory which has the advantage of being less time consuming than the other methods. Additional computational methods especially useful for transition state calculations include the coupled cluster methods. for thermodynamic calculations a very efficient method is the semi-empirical method especially the PM3 method.

, Which of the C-C bond atoms does carry the positive charge? How many carbon atoms is it bonded with? Remember that carbocations are placed in this order by decreasing stability: tertiary > secondary > primary. In the case of propene , you have two possible outcomes: a primary and a secondary carbocation. The secondary carbocation is much more stable than the primary one so it's the only actual carbocation you obtain., Bond the halogen anion to the carbon atom that carries the positive charge of the carbocation., Give a IUPAC name to the compound you have obtained.

Hydrogen atom is the simplest atom of all the elements in the periodic table.,
This theory although was successful to solve the orbital energies for the hydrogen atom was not possible to be applied to other atoms.,
Removal of the only electron in the hydrogen atom by ionization forms a positively charged hydrogen atom which is called a proton because it has only a proton confined to the nucleus.,
Adding an electron to a neutral hydrogen atom forms a reactive species that is called a hydride.,
Covalent bonds between atoms and hydrogen do also exist.,
Isotopes of hydrogen are known in which one neutron exist in the hydrogen nucleus along with the proton.,
The binding of two hydrogen atoms form the hydrogen molecule.,NaH + H2O-> H2 + NaOH

,
It can also be prepared from dissolving of sodium metal in water according to the following equation:

,Na + H2O -> H2 + Na2O

,
Hydrogen molecule can add across a double bond using a catalyst such as palladium or Pd.

,
Hydrogen bonds are special type of electrostatic interaction that happens for example in a solution of pure water.",How to Learn About the Chemistry of the Hydrogen Atom," It is composed of a proton which is confined to the nucleus and an electron which circulates around the nucleus in circular motion. It is the third element in abundance on earth after oxygen and silicon. Its simple structure attracted the attention of physicist as to predict the structure of the atom not known for sure at that time. The Bohr theory of the hydrogen atom was the first successful theory that predicted the structure and energetics of the hydrogen atom. This theory assumed the quantization of the angular momentum.;
, Schroedinger equation came later and although it can be solved accurately only for the hydrogen atom it could be applied to other atoms or even molecules through the application of perturbation theory. Einstein predicted the formation of the hydrogen bomb based on his observation that the nuclear reaction on the surface of the sun between two hydrogen nuclei fusion to give a helium atom releasing a massive amount of energy.

, According to the Bronsted theory of acids and bases proton or H+ is an acid and that every molecule which releases a proton is considered as an acid.

, All metal bonds to hydrogen are of the hydride type. This is so due to the lower electronegativity of metals in comparison with hydrogen which is more electronegative. Halogens and chalcogens form bonds with hydrogen of the proton types and this is so due the higher electronegativity of the halogens and chalcogens in comparison with hydrogen.

, An example is a bond between the carbon group and hydrogen. Methane is an example of a compound with covalent bond between carbon and hydrogen. This is so due to the similarity in electronegativities between carbon and hydrogen.

, This isotope is called deuterium and forms heavy water or D2O which is the analogue of light water or H2O. D2O is used in nuclear energy processing. It slows down the neutrons stream that bombards Uranium elements. Thus controlling the fission process of the radioactive atom. Another isotope of hydrogen has two neutrons in the nucleus and is called tritium.

, The hydrogen molecule is a relatively stable compound that has a covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms. It can be prepared from a reaction of a hydride source with water such as the following reaction:

,,,,, These bonds in water are responsible for the relatively high boiling temperature of water which is 100 °C (212 °F) in comparison to 30 °C (86 °F) in ethers which do not have hydrogen bonds.

Define the term ""heat capacity"" and how it affects the thermodynamics of the molecule.",How to Learn About the Subject of Thermodynamics As Applied to Chemical Reactions," Thermodynamics is a science which is built upon experimental facts that cannot be proven. But no one has so far succeeded to refute these principles. There are two experimental facts upon which thermodynamics is built. These are: the law of conservation of energy upon which the first law of thermodynamics is built.;
, The second experimental fact is that heat cannot be transferred from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir without the expenditure of work. This second fact is also a taken for granted reality that cannot be proven. Thermodynamics can tell us if a chemical process will take place or not. In addition, it can tell us if a chemical process will take place spontaneously or not.

, The thermodynamic function that tells us if a process is spontaneous or not is the free energy of Gibbs which is symbolized as G. It is so named for its discoverer Willard Gibbs.

, For negative values of G the chemical process is considered spontaneous. For positive value of G the process is not spontaneous. At G =0 the process is said to be in equilibrium. The thermodynamic function G is a basic function of thermodynamic systems under the control of pressure and temperature and number of moles.

, The thermodynamic function which will tell us if a process will take place or not is called the enthalpy function which is symbolized as H. Negative value of H tell us that the chemical process is exothermic and the whole process will proceed favorably. Positive value of H tells us that the process is endothermic with unlikelihood that the process will take place.


The enthalpy is a basic function of thermodynamics which like the free energy of Gibbs depends on the pressure with the difference that instead of the temperature it is dependent on its conjugate extensive variable the entropy. The enthalpy is equal to the heat of the system under constant pressure

, The first law of thermodynamics is actually the conservation of energy law which states that the internal energy of a given system or E is equal to its heat plus the work done on it. in formula:


E = Q + W
where Q is the heat of the system and W is the work done on it.

, In an expansion process of a gas against vacuum there is no thermal effect or a change in temperature. This is an experimental fact that was observed by Joule in one experiment. As a result there is no change in energy as a function of volume and pressure. This is true for an ideal gas.

, For non-ideal gases the change in energy as a function of volume and pressure is not zero. These results can be obtained by writing the exact differential of the energy extensive function as a function of volume and temperature.

, The heat capacity of a given system is defined as the change in in the heat of a system as a function of temperature. There are two types of specific heats. These are: volume independent specific heat or Cv and pressure independent specific heat or Cp.


For an ideal gas, the energy of a given gas is given by
E = CvdT
This states that the energy of an ideal gas is equal to the specific heat at constant volume times the change in temperature. The relation between Cv and Cp can be obtained easily for an ideal gas. It is given by the following equation
Cp - Cv = nR

Obtain gallstones.,
Place the gallstones between sheets of paper, then crush them by pounding lightly with a hammer.

,
Sterilize the gallstones by washing them with household bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite solution).

,
Weigh out the crushed gallstones.,
Add the crushed gallstones to a reaction container.

,
Add 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone), about 10 cc per gram of crushed gallstones, to the reaction container and heat to a gentle boil.,
Filter the hot solution through a paper filter disk/cone on a funnel into another clean container.,
Add methanol (caution: extremely toxic ""wood alcohol"") to the filtrate, about 5 cc per gram of starting crushed gallstone.

,
Reheat the filtrate to a gentle boil, then add water drop by drop until a very faint cloudiness appears.,
Carefully remove the solution from heat.,
Once at room temperature, unwrap and cool the container in ice to allow more cholesterol to crystallize out of solution.

,
Collect the cholesterol by filtration.",How to Isolate Cholesterol from Gallstones," In some places, you may request gallstones from the department of surgery or the department of pathology of hospitals.;
,,, Record the weight. This will be important to estimate how much solvent to use.

,, Stir gently. The solution will have a dirty-yellow to brown appearance from the bile pigment bilirubin.

, Apply a gentle vacuum in the receptor container to facilitate filtration. Rinse the cooking container with a small amount of hot 2-butanone and transfer that rinse to the funnel. The cholesterol will be completely dissolved in the 2-butanone solvent, while insoluble impurities (mostly composed of bilirubin, a metabolite of hemoglobin, that gives the gallstones a brown color) will be filtered out during this extraction process.


If the filtrate remains highly coloured, add activated charcoal and re-filter.

,, The cholesterol is very soluble 2-butanone, less soluble in methanol, and insoluble in water. Adding the water as a precipitant into the solution will help saturate the solution with cholesterol for crystallization. Methanol is needed to bridge the solvents, as 2-butanone and water are not very miscible with each other, and methanol is miscible with both water and 2-butanone.

, Wrap cotton padding or toweling around the hot container for insulation to allow slow cooling, then let it cool undisturbed to room temperature.

,, The yield is large colorless crystalline plates and needles of cholesterol, about 75% of starting crushed gallstones. Save the filtrate. If greater yield is desired, you can obtain a second crop of less purity by boiling the filtrate, adding water drop by drop, and repeating the crystallization process.

Re-read the text.,
Work to comprehend the homework problems.,
Have the latest version of the modern periodic table.,
Work through every problem step-by-step.,
Study the material that will be on the test.,
Make sure you understand the basics.,
Write and memorize chemistry symbols and terminology.",How to Get Good Grades in Chemistry," The study of chemistry is generally divided into five broad categories, each with its own sub-disciplines and unique methods of study.If you understand what broad field of chemistry you’re studying and what that means, you’ll be grounded and ready to learn particularities within the field. The five categories are:


Inorganic chemistry: the study of structures and compounds of substances made from all elements, except carbon.
Organic chemistry: the study of the compound of carbon.
Physical (or theoretical) chemistry: the application of mathematical methods to chemical problems.
Analytical chemistry: quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes chemical compounds.
Biochemistry (or physiological chemistry): the study of chemical reactions within living cells and the chemical structures of living material.;
, This will increase your familiarity with the material, and class itself will clarify questions that came up when you read the material, rather than raising questions. Reading material—such as book chapters and reading that will be covered in class— will familiarize you with the topic ahead of time.This technique is known as a “Flipped” or “Reversed” classroom, and has proven useful in multiple fields.

, This should help make learning easier, since the instructor is there to clarify and explain information. Don’t take this time for granted, but actively focus on apprehending every point your teacher makes.


Attend class regularly. As mundane as this can feel, regular attendance will ensure that you don’t miss the explanation of new topics. It’s easier to keep up with the class lessons than to catch up.

, Don’t hesitate to bring up your concerns in class if you are confused about any points, equations, or topics. No question is too small to ask; if you’re confused about a point in the lecture, it’s likely that other students are too.Discuss with your teacher or with your classmates if you have any problems with the chemistry topic.
If you’re struggling to understand a concept, ask your instructor for study guides or worksheets.

, You can think of this as writing a “summary” of class: what did the teacher lecture about; what new topics or equations were introduced; what relevant questions were asked and how where they answered?This is especially important in the chemistry classroom. New concepts and equations will be built on those that you’ve covered earlier in the semester (or quarter), so it’s important that you understand ideas of chemistry. Having these written in your notes will help you remember.
Pinning down the important points that your instructor has presented in a class period will help you to understand key topics and ideas.

, You can also review notes while working on your homework after a chemistry lecture. It’s best if you review your notes shortly after the class; if you wait until the weekend, you may have forgotten some of the material already.Take advantage of your school’s study-hall period to review notes from chemistry. You may find it easier to retain concepts when reading them from your own notes rather than from a textbook, since you will have already written the concepts in terms you understand.

, Before you jump into solving homework problems, re-read the textbook chapters that were covered in class. This will solidify your understanding of the material, and save you time when you go to solve problems.When working problems, avoid referring to the answer key unless you’re utterly confused. Work problems on your own as much as possible.
Study chemistry every day so that you retain as much of the information as possible. You will learn more and be more productive if you study chemistry for two hours each day, rather than 10 hours on Saturday., Comprehension will take time, but it’s more important than taking shortcuts to get the right answer. Give special care to the math problems, chemical formulas, and chemical equations.Many students consider the chemical formulas and math equations to be the most challenging aspects of a chemistry course, so these are where you should focus your time. If you need to, brush up on: logarithms and simple algebra, fractions, percentages, and exponential numbers., Usually teachers will provide a copy for you but if you don't ask for it or obtain it. It's crucial. It will help you a lot, as you will get many important resources in it. The periodic table is a complex way of presenting a great deal of helpful chemical information. Learn how to read it, and keep it with your chemistry text and notebook.If you don’t have a copy of the periodic table, it’s available for free at many online chemistry websites.

, Many students skip certain chemistry problems and math equations, as the equations can be time consuming. However, they are also one of the most important parts of succeeding at chemistry.Learn from the mistakes you’ve made in previous problems, and don’t move on to the next until you can solve each problem correctly.


Practice drawing any diagrams in your lectures, then label them. Although it may feel repetitive at first, this can help you understand the structure of chemicals. This may also help you memorize information that will come up on a test.

, At the end of every month (or every section of your chemistry course) you should study the topics taught during that time. If it helps, you can study together with your friends, and together discuss how to answer the questions.


Be attentive to your studying. Work in an environment with as few distractions as possible. Shut off the TV, put away food and snacks, and work in quiet, distraction-free space.

, To do well on any test or exam, you’ll need to have mastered the basics of chemistry, so you can solve more complex problems when they’re presented.Before a test, make sure you have a solid understanding of significant numbers, the periodic table of elements, and chemical names and symbols.


Solve sample tests or chemistry questions. This will make you more comfortable with tackling genuine test questions, and will also increase your chemistry confidence. Ask your instructor for sample tests, or search online for “sample chemistry test questions,” and specify your grade level.

, Like many of the sciences, certain aspects of academic chemistry must be memorized, especially before taking an exam. Write down terminology definitions, chemical symbols, and the names and properties of the 30 or 40 most common elements.Flashcards are a helpful way to commit these symbols and terms to memory. Review these flashcards multiple times throughout a week, and a few times a day when a test is upcoming."

Each atom has its own spot on the periodic table, and it’s own one or two letter symbol. For example, the symbol for hydrogen is “H” and for sodium it is “Na.”, One of the important characteristics of an atom is how much mass it has. This tells you how many particles are in the nucleus of the atom (the particles outside the nucleus are so small that they do not count in the mass). The periodic table is arranged so that mass increases as you go from left to right (across a row) and from top to bottom (down a column)., The periodic table is broken up into several different types of elements. The most broad categories are metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. The category that an atom belongs to can tell you about its physical properties and its reactivity., Three different subatomic particles make up an atom. Protons have a positive charge, neutrons lack charge, and electrons have a negative charge. The sum of protons and neutrons is equal to the mass of the atom (in atomic mass units). The mass of electrons is so little that they are not counted., The nucleus is the center of the atom. This is where you will find protons and neutrons. Electrons orbit the nucleus in electron orbitals. Electrons do not typically enter the nucleus and protons and neutrons do not typically leave the nucleus., When two or more atoms join together, it is called bonding. Protons and neutrons are not directly involved in bonding. Electrons are shared between two or more atoms in a bond and this forms a molecule., Ionic bonds occur between metals and nonmetals. Covalent bonds occur between two nonmetals. In an ionic bond, electrons are more likely to be found at one end of a molecule than the other. This results in a negatively charged and positively charged end of the molecule. Covalent bonds share electrons more evenly., Chemical formula’s provide information about what elements are present in a molecule or reaction, and in what proportions. For example, hydrochloric acid has a chemical formula of HCl and the chemical reaction describing burning methane is CH4 + 2O2 → 2H2O + CO2. The numbers before the chemical symbols is known as a coefficient and tells you how many of that molecule or atom is present. The number in subscripts tell you how many of particular atom is present in the molecule., Atoms and molecules bond together to become more stable. That is to say that they try to attain the lowest possible energy state. To break a bond, you have to add enough energy to make the bond no longer favorable. For this reason, bonds are often hard to break., To understand chemistry, you will need to have a working knowledge of algebra (at least). Understanding calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra is a huge plus in upper level chemistry courses, like physical chemistry. You will be required to take some of these courses to obtain your chemistry degree. You should also consider seeking a math minor (or even double major) to give yourself a leg up in your chemistry work.

, Chemists are broken up into several different categories of study. For example, there are physical chemists, biochemists, analytical chemists, etc. Decide what kind of chemistry you like the most, and concentrate on that topic. For example, if you really like organic chemistry, take more organic chemistry courses than are required for your degree.


You can also pursue a master’s or doctorate to further narrow your scope and build your expertise in chemistry.

, Classwork is a good place to start learning the concepts of chemistry. Lab classes will help to teach you the protocol for conducting yourself in a laboratory. Ultimately though, if you wish to understand chemistry, you will have to do research on a topic in chemistry. While research is required for most chemistry degrees, it is usually a minimal amount. Start doing research as early as you can under the supervision of a professor in the field you like most (e.g. biochemistry).

Keep up to date about new developments.",How to Learn About the Chemistry of Transition Metals," It is a branch of organic chemistry that is of relatively recent age that dates back to only few decades. This area of chemistry lies at the interface between organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry of the metals in all its types.

The need for the development of this area of chemistry stemmed from the fact that many organic reactions are unable to proceed under normal conditions of reactions in the organic laboratory.



 

;
, This is so due to the use by the transition metals of extra 5-d orbitals when bonding with the other elements.

, They are useful as catalysts for these organic reactions that otherwise would not proceed to completion.

There are many potential applications to industrial processes for the synthesis of important compounds, such as the synthesis of organic polymers.

, Analogous terminology to this phenomenon are the chemical reactions that occur in the body of humans and animals which proceed mostly under the catalysis of special type of proteins in the body that are called enzymes.

, They usually work by lowering the value of the free energy of Gibbs for the reactions that they catalyze. Organometallic compounds are very useful reagents that are able to catalyze organic reactions through a specific cycle of reactions that involve the central metal that is usually a transition metal.

This cycle usually involves well known steps such as oxidative addition to the metal and a process of migratory insertion and ends with reductive elimination to give the final product
These processes have been extensively from the kinetic point of view by labeling procedures using isotopes of hydrogen such as deuterium and other isotopes.







, The organic chemistry that is involved with lithium and magnesium groups is an ionic chemistry. This gives the organic functional group a nucleophilic character in its reactions, due to the large difference in electronegativity between the metal and the organic functional group.,

A well known example of an organometallic compound of this type is the Grignard reagent which is an organomagnesium reagent that is used extensively in the organic laboratory as an alkylating agent. Gringard reagents are usually prepared from alkyl bromides by the process of oxidative addition on neutral magnesium metal.






Another similar type of reagent that uses different metal is the Reformatsky reagent. This reagent is an organo-zinc compound that is also a nucleophile in its chemical behavior that is used as an alkylating reagent. Organo-zinc compounds are prepared in a similar fashion to Grignard reagents from alkyl bromides by the process of oxidative addition on the zinc metal.







,


Gringard reagents are much more stable thermodynamically than organolithium compounds. Therefore they are more nucleophilic and more selective also.
Organometallic reagents usually are very sensitive compounds to the environment that they are located in. They are very sensitive to water and oxygen. Therefore usually reactions that involve organometallic compounds are performed under inert atmosphere that require special laboratory techniques such as working in a glove box for example.







, Organo-transition-metals chemistry is a very important type of chemistry due to its potential application in catalyzing organic reactions. This topic in chemistry is called homogeneous catalysis by organometallic reagents., Some authorities place this area of chemistry to inorganic chemistry but others include it in the area of organic chemistry and call it applications of transition metals in organic synthesis.

, Numerous industrial processes have been designed to use these special type of organometallic reagents for the process of catalyzing organic reactions, such as the Ziegler-Natta process, which is an important industrial process in chemistry., This refers to the reductive elimination which restores the metal to its original oxidation state.

, The organometallic reagents that are used to catalyze organic reactions are usually used in one of two ways. These two ways are: stoichiometric and catalytic amounts of the organometallic reagent.

The choice of which one of these two possibilities to use will depend on whether the reagent is consumed in the reaction or whether it is regenerated.







, The search for new catalysts in this area of chemistry is pursued vigorously due to their potential uses in industry and in chemical research.

Fill your container with 39 liters of water.,
Add 1 liter of concentrated white phenyl to the water.,
Use to clean floors and surfaces.,
Store in a cool, dry place.,
Dispose of down the drain with water.",How to Formulate White Phenyle," For this recipe of concentrated white phenyle, you will be making a solution that is 70% pine oil and 30% emulsifier. To make it, you will need: pine oil concentrate (between 22%-26%), an emulsifier such as Emulsifier OP-95 or Pine Oil Emulsifier, and a bottle to contain the finished product.Pine oil and emulsifiers can be purchased online.
Make sure your container is large enough to hold the volume you are making. If you’re making a large quantity, you will need a larger container.
The recipe here is to make 1 liter of concentrated white phenyle.;
, You can calculate the amount of pine oil necessary to make a 70% solution or simply make 1 liter and measure out 700 milliliters. If you wanted to make 2 liters, you would double the amount (1.4 liters pine oil).


The easiest way to measure volumes is to use a graduated cylinder or measuring cup.

, You want the final solution to be 30% emulsifier, so you will add 300 milliliters to a final volume of 1 liter. Again, if you wanted to make 2 liters, simply double the amount of emulsifier (600 milliliters).


Clean out the graduated cylinder or measuring cup before measuring out a different solution.

, In a container large enough to hold both volumes, combine the measured volumes of pine oil and emulsifier. Stir well until the solution clears.The emulsifier will mix with the pine oil and together they will create a clear solution that has brownish-yellow tint to it.


At first, the solution will appear milky in color. This is normal. Continue to stir and then let it sit until the solution clears.
Once the solution clears you will have concentrated white phenyl.

, Concentrated white phenyle is usually diluted 1:40, but can be made as strong as a 1:20 dilution.For dilution, you will need concentrated white phenyle, water, a large plastic container, and a spoon or something to stir with.


You can make your own concentrated white phenyle or simply purchase it online.
The plastic container needs to be large enough to hold the volume of diluted solution that you will be making. If you get a container with a lid, you can simply shake the vessel instead of having to stir.

, To dilute a solution 1:40, you will use 39 liters of water and 1 liter of the concentrated solution. If you don’t need to make 40 liters worth of diluted white phenyl you can always do less.

, Measure out one liter of the concentrated solution and add it to the 39 liters of water. Stir the solution well into it is thoroughly combined. The solution should appear milky while stirring.


When a stable emulsion is formed, the solution will appear milky white and have a fresh pine scent.This solution can now be used to clean and disinfect your home.

, White phenyle is non-toxic to both humans and pets, but it is recommended to dilute before use.Because of its disinfectant properties, white phenyle is a good solution to use for cleaning floors and bathroom/kitchen surfaces.


White phenyle is safe to use on a variety of surfaces including glass, porcelain, wood, concrete, plastic, ceramic, etcAvoid ingestion and contact with eyes. Wash hands after use.

, It is recommended to store white phenyle in a cool, dry place away from flammable items. White phenyle is flammable, so it’s important to keep it away from any source of heat.Keep the container tightly closed to prevent spills.

, Instructions for disposal include using up the solution as intended and disposing of small amounts down the drain while running water. The label on your version of white phenyle may have more specific instructions on harmful dilutions and proper disposal.If you’re unsure about the concentration of your white phenyle, call the manufacturer and ask them about it.

Find the number of electrons in the outermost shell.,
Use the rows of the table as orbital shell shortcuts.",How to Find Valence Electrons," This is a color-coded table made up of many different squares that lists all of the chemical elements known to humankind. The periodic table reveals lots of information about the elements — we'll use some of this information to determine the number of valence electrons in the atom we're investigating. You can usually find these inside the cover of chemistry textbooks. There is also an excellent interactive table available online here., Generally, on a periodic table, all of the elements in a single vertical column will have the same number of valence electrons. If your periodic table doesn't already have each column numbered, give each a number starting with 1 for the far left end and 18 for the far right end. In scientific terms, these columns are called the element ""groups.""For example, if we were working with a periodic table where the groups aren't numbered, we would write a 1 above Hydrogen (H), a 2 above Beryllium (Be), and so on until writing an 18 above Helium (He).

, Now, locate the element that you want to find the valence electrons for on the table. You can do this with its chemical symbol (the letters in each box), its atomic number (the number in the top left of each box), or any of the other pieces of information available to you on the table.


For example purposes, let's find the valence electrons for a very common element: carbon (C). This element has an atomic number of 6. It is located at the top of group 14. In the next step, we'll find its valence electrons.
In this subsection, we're going to be ignoring the Transitional metals, which are the elements in the rectangle-shaped block made by Groups 3 to 12. These elements are a little different from the rest, so the steps in this subsection won't work on them. See how to deal with these in the subsection below.

, The Group number of a non-transition metal can be used to find the number of valence electrons in an atom of that element. The ones place of the group number is the number of valence electrons in an atom of these elements. In other words:


Group 1: 1 valence electron
Group 2: 2 valence electrons
Group 13: 3 valence electrons
Group 14: 4 valence electrons
Group 15: 5 valence electrons
Group 16: 6 valence electrons
Group 17: 7 valence electrons
Group 18: 8 valence electrons (except for helium, which has 2)
In our example, since carbon is in group 14, we can say that one atom of carbon has four valence electrons.


, As noted above, the elements in groups 3 to 12 are called ""transition metals"" and behave differently than the rest of the elements when it comes to valence electrons. In this section, we'll explain how, to a certain extent, it's often not possible to assign valence electrons to these atoms.


For example purposes, let's pick Tantalum (Ta), element 73. In the next few steps, we'll find its valence electrons (or, at least, try to.)
Note that the transition metals include the lanthanide and actinide series (also called the ""rare earth metals"") — the two rows of elements that are usually positioned below the rest of the table that start with lanthanum and actinium. These elements all belong to group 3 of the periodic table.

, Understanding why transition metals don't really ""work"" like the rest of the periodic table requires a little explanation of the way electrons behave in atoms. See below for a quick run-through or skip this step to get right to the answers.As electrons are added to an atom, they are sorted into different ""orbitals"" — basically different areas around the nucleus that the electrons congregate in. Generally, the valence electrons are the electrons in the outermost shell — in other words, the last electrons added.
For reasons that are a little too complex to explain here, when electrons are added to the outermost d shell of a transition metal (more on this below), the first electrons that go into the shell tend to act like normal valence electrons, but after that, they don't, and electrons from other orbital layers sometimes act as valence electrons instead. This means that an atom can have multiple numbers of valence electrons depending on how it is manipulated.
For a more detailed explanation, see Clackamas Community College's excellent valence electron page., Once again, the group number of the element you are examining can tell you its valence electrons. However, for the transition metals, there isn't a pattern you can follow — group number will usually correspond to a range of possible numbers of valence electrons. These are:Group 3: 3 valence electrons
Group 4: 2 to 4 valence electrons
Group 5: 2 to 5 valence electrons
Group 6: 2 to 6 valence electrons
Group 7: 2 to 7 valence electrons
Group 8: 2 or 3 valence electrons
Group 9: 2 or 3 valence electrons
Group 10: 2 or 3 valence electrons
Group 11: 1 or 2 valence electrons
Group 12: 2 valence electrons
In our example, since Tantalum is in group 5, we can say that it has between two and five valence electrons, depending on the situation.

, Another way to find an element's valence electrons is with something called an electron configuration. These may at first look complicated, but they're just a way to represent the electron orbitals in an atom with letters and numbers and they're easy once you know what you're looking at.


Let's look at an example configuration for the element sodium (Na):



1s22s22p63s1




Notice that this electron configuration is just a repeating string that goes like this:



(number)(letter)(raised number)(number)(letter)(raised number)...




...and so on. The first (number)(letter) chunk is the name of the electron orbital and the (raised number) is the number of electrons in that orbital — that's it!
So, for our example, we would say that sodium has 2 electrons in the 1s orbital plus 2 electrons in the 2s orbital plus 6 electrons in the 2p orbital plus 1 electron in the 3s orbital. That's 11 electrons total — sodium is element number 11, so this makes sense.

, Once you know an element's electron configuration, finding its number of valence electrons is quite simple (except, of course, for the transition metals.) If you're given the configuration from the get-go, you can skip to the next step. If you have to find it yourself, see below:


Here is the complete electron configuration for ununoctium (Uuo), element 118:



1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p65s24d105p66s24f145d106p67s25f146d107p6




Now that you have this, all you need to do to find another atom's electron configuration is just fill in this pattern from the beginning until you run out of electrons. This is easier than it sounds. For example, if we want to make the orbital diagram for chlorine (Cl), element 17, which has 17 electrons, we would do it like this:



1s22s22p63s23p5




Notice that the number of electrons adds up to 17: 2 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 17. You only need to change the number in the final orbital — the rest is the same since the orbitals before the final one are completely full.
For more on electron configurations, see also this article.

, As electrons are added to an atom, they fall into various orbitals according to the order given above — the first two go into the 1s orbital, the two after that go into the 2s orbital, the six after that go into the 2p orbital, and so on. When we're dealing with atoms outside of the transition metals, we say that these orbitals form ""orbital shells"" around the nucleus, with each successive shell being further out than the ones before. Besides the very first shell, which can hold only two electrons, each shell can have eight electrons (except, again, when dealing with transition metals.) This is called the Octet Rule.


For example, let's say we're looking at the element Boron (B). Since its atomic number is five, we know it has five electrons and its electron configuration looks like this: 1s22s22p1. Since the first orbital shell has only two electrons, we know that Boron has two shells: one with two 1s electrons and one with three electrons from the 2s and 2p orbitals.
As another example, an element like chlorine will have three orbital shells: one with two 1s electrons, one with two 2s electrons and six 2p electrons, and one with two 3s electrons and five 3p electrons.

, Now that you know your element's electron shells, finding the valence electrons is easy: just use the number of electrons in the outermost shell. If the outer shell is full (in other words, if it has eight electrons or, for the first shell, two), the element is inert and will not react easily with other elements. Again, however, things don't quite follow these rules for transition metals.


For example, if we're working with Boron, since there are three electrons in the second shell, we can say that Boron has three valence electrons.

, The horizontal rows of the periodic table are called the element ""periods."" Starting from the top of the table, each period corresponds to the number of electron shells the atoms in the period possess. You can use this as a shortcut to determine how many valence electrons an element has — just start from the left side of its period when counting electrons. Once again, you'll want to ignore the transition metals with this method.


For example, we know the element selenium has four orbital shells because it is in the fourth period. Since it is the sixth element from the left in the fourth period (ignoring the transition metals), we know that the outer fourth shell has six electrons, and, thus, that Selenium has six valence electrons.

Dress appropriately and know the precautions.,
Gather the materials.,
Turn on the stove to high.,
Heat the penny.,
Get your heat-proof container ready.,
Enjoy your zinc metal!",How to Get Zinc Metal1," You'll be working with hot objects in an indoor environment. Wear clothing that can cover your bare skin, tie back long hair, and put on safety goggles and thick gloves if you have any. In addition, move any food, drinks, and potentially flammable objects away from your workspace.;
, You will essentially need the following:


United States pennies (minted after 1982)
pliers
a heat-proof container (such as a crucible)
a gas stove.

, You want to make sure that the stove is producing a hot enough temperature to ensure your yield of zinc.

, With the pliers, place the penny on the tip of the flames (which is the hottest part). The penny will soon start to deform and soften. Be ready to get your container out!

, As the penny starts to crumple, the inner layer will start to liquify. Once you're at that stage, carefully hold the penny above the container, and rock it slightly to coax the liquid metal out; this is the zinc metal. You may still have a thin sheet of metal on your pliers; this is the outer copper layer. (It doesn't melt due to the higher melting point.) Keep in mind: the zinc metal is going to be very hot initially.

, This experiment works because current US pennies contain an inner layer of zinc. Zinc has a low melting point, which means that heating up a penny as such can liquefy the metal, allowing for its extraction.

Start with caster oil.,
Prepare and add rosin.,
Add caustic soda.,
Heat the mixture.",How to Formulate Black Phenyle Disinfectant1," Caster oil will be the base solvent for your soap solution. Roughly ninety percent of the soap solution will be comprised of caster oil. Pour the oil into a container that is safe to heat on the stove top or over a bunsen burner.For example, use 890 mL of caster oil to make 1 L of soap solution.;
, Rosin is a dry form of pine resin. It is solid and brittle at room temperature, but can be melted on the stovetop. Heat the rosin until it is in a liquid form. Roughly ten percent of your soap solution will be rosin. Pour the rosin into the caster oil. This will give the solution a pine scent.For example, 90 mL of rosin will be added to 890 milliliters (30.1  fl oz) of caster oil to make 1 L soap solution.

, A caustic soda is the common name for a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. Make the solution by adding 0.5% NaOH to a given volume of water. You only need to make a small volume of caustic soda solution, as it will only be one to two percent of the total soap solution.In the example of a 1 L solution, you would add 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of caustic soda solution to 890 milliliters (30.1  fl oz) of caster oil and 90 milliliters (3  fl oz) of rosin.To make 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of caustic soda solution you would add 0.1 mg of NaOH to 20 milliliters (0.68  fl oz) of water and warm the water slowly while stirring. When the NaOH has completely dissolved, you will have a clear caustic soda solution that is ready to use.Do not let the caustic soda solution cool before adding it to the soap solution., Heat the mixture on the stove or over a bunsen burner until it develops into a soap. To test the consistency of the solution, you can dip a piece of paper into it. If it leaves an oily stain on the paper, the solution will need to be heated longer."

You may also need pliers, wire cutters, screwdrivers, utility knives, and other similar implements to assist you in dismantling the battery. It is recommended that you wear gloves for the whole procedure.

, You will notice a rim at the top of the battery; using a knife or a screwdriver, cut/pry off the top.

, Inside the opened battery, you'll find four smaller batteries, all connected by wires. Cut off the wires, and you'll have the four batteries to work with.

, For each of the four batteries, pull the protruding end with a pair of pliers. You should be able to pull out the carbon rod. Then, dig out the remaining contents in the battery; the black powder you'll find is a mixture of manganese dioxide and carbon. This, along with the carbon rod, can be disposed, or stored for potential experimenting. (These chemicals are not hazardous, so you do not need to worry too much about handling/disposing them.)

, Avoid washing it, especially at a sink, as the manganese dioxide-carbon residue is not water-soluble. Instead, try wiping it clean, cutting open the battery if you need to. Once that's done, you'll have your zinc metal!

Motor neurons are a class of cells of the nervous system in all living systems including human individuals. Neurons of the nervous system in humans are classified according to their function into three main types. One is sensory type of neurons and the other is motor type of neurons and the third is called integrative type of neurons. This third type of neurons is used to connect and transmit information between the sensory neurons and the motor neurons. This way motor function is carried out as a response to sensory stimulation. This order of function is observed in the normal process of communication between the various neurons of the nervous system.;
, Usually sensory input is obtained into the brain through electrical signals that travel along the pathways of the nervous system starting at the nerve receptors of the skin that are called free nerve endings to the sensory area of the cerebral cortex that is specialized for interpreting and transmitting this sensory information to motor neurons through the intermediate station of integrative neurons. This station of integrative neurons helps in passing the electrical signals from the sensory neurons to the motor neurons. This combination of sensory and motor function of neurons of the nervous system through the relay of integrative neurons is typical of all types of communications between neurons of the nervous system.

, This article is concerned mainly with motor neurons of the nervous system in humans. Motor neurons are clinically very important due to their role in carrying muscles contraction and relaxation. This is manifested clinically by their involvement in movement disorders that are usually the result of dysfunctional motor neurons in specific parts of the nervous system. The clinical manifestation of a movement disorder will depend on the type of motor neurons that are injured. This type of neurons is abundant in all parts of the nervous system including the central and the autonomic parts of the nervous system. Generally speaking motor neurons can be found in specific areas of the nervous system including all the length of the spinal cord and the parts of the brain that are called the cerebellum and the basal ganglia and the motor areas of the cerebral cortex.

, These above mentioned motor areas of the nervous system are the main areas that have motor neurons in which clinical manifestations are observed obviously in the case of their injury or dysfunction. Motor neurons of the cerebral cortex are responsible for giving orders to many parts of the body including parts of the brain its self and the muscles of extremities such as the muscles of the hands and the legs.

, Motor neurons that are located in the cerebellum can give orders to the voluntary muscles of the body which in turn cause either its contraction or relaxation. Dysfunctional motor cells of the cerebellum can predispose to gait disorders such as inability to walk properly. Ataxia is another clinical manifestation of dysfunctional motor neurons of the cerebellum. In addition special types of nerves in the brain that are called cranial nerves can perform both sensory as well as motor functions. There are in the brain 12 pairs of cranial nerves. Some of these nerves have sensory functions only but others have both sensory as well as motor functions. For example, the ability of the pupil muscles of the eyes to contract and relax is mediated through one cranial nerve that is called oculomotor cranial nerve. Other cranial nerves can also serve motor functions.

, For example the ability of the individual to swallow food is mediated through the function of one cranial nerve that is called the glossopharyngeal nerve. In addition the normal function of the alimentary canal is controlled by the cranial nerve that is called the vagus nerve. This includes the motor orders that the muscles of the colon wall receive from neurons of this cranial nerve. Also motor neurons are spread along parts of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system. These motor neurons can for example allow the person to perform normal urination and normal defecation. Defecation is a process that is mediated not only by the vagus nerve but also by motor neurons of the enteric nervous system that is spread along the muscles of the colon wall. The other part of motor neurons that is of extremely important function in the nervous system of humans is called the basal ganglia. This cluster of neurons contains so called nuclei of nervous cells that have both sensory as well as motor functions.

, The motor function of neurons of this structure of the brain is very important for the proper function of mental cognition in humans. This brain structure is known to secrete important compound that has biological function that is related to the maintaining of healthy mental status by allowing for normal cognitive mental processes. It was observed experimentally that people who have excessive amount of this compound that is called dopamine in their body can develop cognitive dysfunction that is manifested by psychotic thinking that is detached from reality. Also other experimentally observed manifestations of this biochemical disorder are the development of paranoic symptoms as part of the handicapped cognitive function in these affected individuals.

, Some other observed symptoms of this metabolic disorder that is seen in part of the patients who suffer from this disease include episodes of grandiose thinking and the possession of ideas of reference. In addition symptoms of auditory and visual hallucinations can be seen in part of the patients that have this psychiatric disorder. Both of these two sensory dysfunctions are probably related to the either the disabled cognitive function of the affected individual or due dysfunctions in the sensory nerves that mediate the sensation modalities of the two cranial nerves that are responsible for transmitting sensory information into the cortex of the brain of these individuals. This disorder of dopamine excess in the brain is a major medical concern for the medical practice of psychiatry. This disorder can have many variable variations that include schizophrenia which is psychiatric disorder that is of genetic origin. People with this disease can grow up normally and yet develop the disorder later in life as a result of a stressful event that can trigger in these people the latent symptoms of this genetic psychiatric disease.

, The medical symptoms that are associated with schizophrenic patients have similarity to other psychotic patients. These include the detachment of the thinking of these people from reality. This can be a manifestation of the poorly developed cognitive function in these affected people. Cognitive processes in these patients can be obtained by correcting the level of dopamine concentration in the brain of these patients. This hypothesis was corroborated by experimental results that showed the improvement in thinking processes of these patients when the level of this compound was diminished in the brain. Usually and clinically this is achieved by the administration of anti-psychotic drugs that function by blocking the receptors in the brain of this neurotransmitter.

, Cognitive improvement was seen in all patients that suffer from psychosis and who are schizophrenic. In addition other psychiatric disorders that involve this compound are seen in the mentally ill population. One example is called Huntington disease. Also deficiency of this important neurotransmitter has clinical manifestations that are of concern for the neurological science and not the psychiatric medicine. Parkinson disease is one form of dopamine deficiency that has neurological symptoms such as tremor in the various parts of the voluntary muscles of the body extremities. This disorder can also be triggered due to the administration of excessive amounts of anti-psychotic drugs that function to antagonize the effect of dopamine. Parkinson disease can be easily treated by increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain.

Know the difference between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.,
Differentiate between the chemistry of cis and trans double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids.",How to Learn and Understand the Chemistry and Biological Functions of Lipids in Humans," Lipids are biologically important organic compounds that are highly energetic molecules. This means that they contain a lot of latent heat that is stored in the numerous C-H bonds that are abundant in these compounds. Lipids are organic esters of glycerol and fatty acids. This is the crude form of most fats that are ingested into the body as food rich in these compounds. These lipids are degraded in the small intestine into fatty acids and glycerol molecules by the action of the pancreatic enzyme that is called lipase. This is one of several enzymes that are secreted by the exocrine pancreas into the duodenum. There they are activated chemically into its enzymatically active form. This form of enzyme is responsible for the digestion of these esters into its fatty acids and glycerol constituents. These compounds in turn are absorbed in the epithelium of the small intestine into the blood circulation.;
, Fatty acids are highly energetic organic compounds that contain a lot of saturated C-H bonds. These C-H bonds contain a lot of calories that can be released by oxidation processes using oxygen in the liver cells of the body. The long chain of saturated CH bonds that are contained in these acids are used to generate many ATP molecules in oxidative metabolic reactions of these acids in the presence of oxygen and specific enzymes for this purpose. The oxidation of fatty acids is a very useful metabolic process for the generation of energy rich ATP molecules. The energetic yield in the form of ATP molecules from the metabolic combustion of one fatty acid is much more than that obtained from the combustion of one glucose molecule. This is so due to the high content of C-H bonds in fatty acids in comparison with glucose molecules.

, Fatty acids are a convenient source of energetic ATP molecules that can be easily obtained using metabolism that is specific for these acids. This metabolism is especially efficient and useful in diabetic patients who are unable to exploit their glucose molecules for the generation of ATP compounds. Fatty acids are hydrophobic organic compounds that easily cross the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane of the liver cells. This physiological property is not possible for glucose molecules which are more hydrophilic in its chemical structure. Fatty acids are used biologically in the body to synthesize cholesterol molecules. These steroidal compounds are then incorporated into the cellular membrane of most cells of the body. Also fatty acids are used as convenient source of bio fuel for the production of ATP molecules for the body.

, Clinically speaking, saturated fatty acids are the less desired compounds for the body. This is so due to their insolubility in the blood plasma. This problem can trigger precipitation of these fatty acids in the various blood arteries. This can in turn cause blockage of these arteries with the consequence of blocking the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the various tissues of the body. Stroke is one form of arteries blockage that can occur due to excess saturated fatty acids in the body. More useful fatty acids to the body are the unsaturated compounds of this type of molecules. Unsaturated fatty acids with CIS configuration of the double bonds are very useful fatty acids for the body. They are usually water soluble due to the existence of dipole moment within their structure that is located across the CIS double bonds of these compounds.

, Trans double bonds are not useful in this respect due to the absence of dipole moments in these compounds. Fatty acids are used in the chemical industry to produce various types of commercial forms of soaps. Soap is an organic compound that is used for cleaning purposes. The principle behind the use of these compounds in the cleaning industry relies on its ability to solubilize both organic and inorganic materials at the same time. This fact is especially useful for removing oily material that is usually not soluble in water alone. Variable length of the saturated organic chain can impart variable chemical properties to the soap.

Study the physiology of the adrenal medulla.",How to Learn and Understand the Function of the Adrenal Gland in Humans," The adrenal gland is located directly above the kidney. There are two adrenal glands each is located on top of each kidney. The adrenal gland has very important roles in maintaining homeostasis inside the body. This is manifested by the number of hormones that it secretes into the blood circulation. Histologically speaking each adrenal gland is composed of a cortex and a medulla. The cortex of each gland secretes three types of hormones from specialized cells that are located at different sites within the cortex.;
, The hormones of the adrenal cortex include aldosterone and cortisol in addition to androgens which are sexual hormones precursors of testosterone and estrogen. These androgens are mainly important in females due to their clinical symptoms in cases of adrenal cortex tumors. In the case of adrenal cortex tumor these androgens can be excessively secreted. This can cause in turn male pattern sexual characteristics in females such as hair growth and deepening of the voice.

, In males these disorders are less important clinically. This is so due to the fact that the main source of androgens in males is not the adrenal cortex but the testes of the male genitalia. Specialized cells in the testes which are called Leydig cells usually secrete the hormone testosterone abundantly into the blood circulation. This hormone is responsible for male pattern characteristics in males such as hair growth. Also this hormone is responsible for the production of sperm through the process of spermatogenesis.

, In females the production of androgens is clinically more important than in males. The other important hormone that is secreted by the adrenal gland is called cortisol. This is a steroid hormone that is water insoluble. This chemical characteristic allows it to penetrate the phospholipid bilayer of the cellular membrane of target cells. For this reason signaling of this hormone is different than water soluble hormones such as the polypeptide vasopressin.

, Cortisol concentration in the blood is tightly regulated by negative feedback mechanism from the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. Cortisol is experimentally known as a suppressor of the immune system. It is therefore used in transplant surgery to deactivate the immune system in order to prevent rejection of the implanted organ in the body. Also cortisol is known to induce high blood pressure in high concentrations in the blood. In addition cortisol has effect on the level of glucose in the blood.

, The excess of cortisol in the blood such as occurs in Cushing syndrome can cause excessive amount of glucose in the blood. This can in turn cause diabetes in the affected individuals. This hormone is regulated by a hormone from the anterior pituitary gland which is called corticotropin releasing hormone. Disorders of cortisol level in the blood are manifested either as excess or deficiency of this hormone in the blood. These two disorders have different clinical symptoms. Cortisol also has effect on the blood pressure in humans.

, Its excess can induce states of hypertension and vice versa. Cortisol is synthesized in specialized cells of the adrenal cortex through a genetic code from the DNA of these cells. Also androgens and aldosterone are similarly synthesized using genetic codes of the DNA of the specialized cells of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone is the third type of hormones that is secreted by the adrenal cortex. This is a steroid hormone that is important clinically in maintaining normal blood pressure in humans.

, The main effect of this hormone is on the reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidney tubules. The effect of this hormone on water is secondary to changes in sodium level in the blood and extracellular space. Aldosterone disorders are mainly of two types. One is excess aldosterone in the blood and the other is deficient amount of this hormone in the blood. All hormones of the adrenal gland are steroids that are not water soluble.

, The adrenal medulla secretes two important hormones that are epinephrine and norepinephrine. These two organic compounds are usually secreted by neurons of the autonomic nervous system. They induce stressful conditions in high concentrations in the blood such as increased sweating and high heart beat. The most important clinical symptom that involves the medulla of the adrenal gland is called pheochromocytoma. This syndrome is typified by excessive secretion of epinephrine into the blood. The main symptom of this disorder is high blood pressure. These two hormones stimulate the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system in humans.

Learn about ketosis.,
Determine potential signs of ketosis.,
Observe your body functions closely.,
Test for ketosis at home.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.,
Manage ketosis.,
Refrain from exercise.,
Flush out your system.,
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.,

Seek counseling.",How to Identify Ketosis," Doctors know that ketosis is caused by an increased level of ketones in the system as a result of the body burning fat as fuel.There are certain factors that can put you into a state of ketosis, which if left unchecked, can develop into the more dangerous state of ketoacidosis, which can lead to serious conditions such as brain swelling.Factors that can put you in a state of ketosis are:


Eating a low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet for weight loss or building muscle massHaving diabetes (there is a greater risk for those with type 1 diabetes, but people with type 2 diabetes can develop ketosis as well) Being male
Experiencing emotional or physical trauma or stress
Abusing drugs and alcohol
Having surgeryKetoacidosis occurs when the levels of ketones present during a state of ketosis rise above levels that are healthy.Ketoacidosis can lead to loss of consciousness and even death.;
, There are some key signs associated with ketosis that can help you determine if your body is in this state. This can help you monitor your level of ketones and minimize your risk for developing ketoacidosis.The signs of ketosis include:Dry mouth
Bad or ""fruity""-smelling breath or metallic taste in your mouth
Strong urine odor
Decreased appetite
Feelings of euphoria or increased energy
Excessive thirst

, Because ketosis can quickly progress into the dangerous state of ketoacidosis, paying close attention to your body and its functions is important. This can help you get timely treatment and prevent bigger issues.If you are in ketosis, note when the signs start and if and under what conditions they cease. Keeping notes may help you more readily identify if you are in a state of ketosis or ketoacidosis.Understand that the signs of ketosis can vary from person to person. It can be obvious for some that they are in a state of ketosis, while others may not recognize it as readily., If you suspect you are in a state of ketosis, you can test for it at home. By measuring blood sugar or testing urine, you may be able to confirm it and ensure that your ketone levels remain healthy.You can monitor ketone levels in your blood with an at-home kit.If your blood sugar is over 240mg/dl, you may have too many ketones in your system.You can purchase ketone testing kits at many pharmacies or medical supply stores. These kits require a urine sample, which will change color to indicate the amount of ketones in your system.It’s important to use a dipstick and a clean-catch urine sample to get the most optimal results., If you suspect your level of ketones are too high, schedule an appointment to see your doctor. She can provide a definitive diagnosis and help you formulate an effective plan to keep your levels of ketones in check.Your doctor may order a blood ketone test. This will require a sample from a vein or a finger stick.This may be a more effective test than a urinalysis.
Your doctor may order a urine test to determine the amount of ketones in your system; however, this may not be as accurate because it can take time for the ketones to pass through your system.Ketoacidosis can cause problems with your heart, so you may need and EKG as well.

, If your doctor confirms that you are in a state of ketosis, he may suggest ways to keep your ketone levels within a healthy and manageable range. This may include everything from watching your diet to counseling. It is important to follow your doctor’s suggestions in order to minimize your risk developing ketoacidosis.There are several different ways to manage the amount of ketones in your system. These include: fluid replacement, insulin therapy, blood sugar monitoring, hydration and changing your diet., If you exercise regularly, you may want to refrain from vigorous activity if your ketone levels are high.Exercise often increases the number of ketones in the body and avoiding it can prevent your ketosis from developing into ketoacidosis.If you need some form of activity to help you feel good, consider light activities such as walking or biking while your ketone levels are high.

, Staying hydrated is often the most effective way to control the level of ketones in your body.By drinking enough water throughout the day, you may be able to effectively eliminate excessive ketones from your system.Most people need nine to 13 cups of water per day, and up to 16 if you are active or pregnant.Water and other non-caloric beverages are the best liquids with which to flush out your system.Avoid drinking too much caffeine or alcohol when your ketones are high, as these can dehydrate you and may thus increase the levels of ketones in your system., Most individuals who consume a healthy, well-balanced diet do not experience increased levels of ketones. Ceasing a low carbohydrate diet in favor of a balanced diet can help you to manage ketone levels and minimize your risk of developing ketoacidosis.You should eat around 1,800–2,200 calories per day, depending on your activity level.Get calories from a wide variety of nutrient-dense whole foods. Include foods from all of the major food groups of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean proteins. Incorporating foods that you may have avoided, such as bread or pasta, may help keep your ketone levels in check.Be aware that this may make you gain slight weight, but it’s better to minimize the risk of ketoacidosis and related conditions than keeping off a couple of pounds by avoiding otherwise nutritious foods., If your elevated ketone levels are a result of diabetes or other issues with your blood sugar, control it as best you can through insulin and diet. This may help manage ketone levels and prevent related conditions.If you are giving yourself insulin shots, your doctor may prescribe a temporary increase in your dosage or the number of injections you get daily., If you have ketosis as a result of malnutrition from anorexia or bulimia, your doctor may refer you to counseling. A therapist can help you work through your issues with food, which in turn may help resolve high ketone levels and prevent ketoacidosis.If you are reducing carbohydrates to reduce weight for any reason, you may want to discuss with a counselor the reason why you are possibly putting your health in jeopardy in pursuit of perceived beauty.

Get to know how molds impact life on earth.,
Know the three things that all molds need.,
Identify a potential food source.,
Find an appropriate container.,
Locate the ideal environment.,
Seal the mold’s food source into the container.,
Check the progress of the mold growth daily.,
Learn about the mold that you grew.,
Dispose of the mold when you are done.",How to Grow Mold," Mold is just one of the many types of fungi that humans are in contact with every day. Molds are scientifically defined as multicellular organisms of the kingdom fungi (a taxonomic order at the same level as plants or animals). The single organism, made up of genetically identical cells, is known as a mycelium., Most people recognize mold as the furry or discolored patch on a slice of bread or a piece of fruit, but not all molds are undesirable. Some molds aid in the preservation of foods—as is the case with some cheeses. Others (penicillin) have provided life-saving antibiotics to human beings. Molds and other fungi also play a vital role in the process of decomposition. They break down the structures of plant and animal cells and allow the nutrients they contain to re-enter the food web., Molds are living things, and in fact their cell structures are more like that of animals than plants. Like all living things, molds need water, a food source, and the right environment in order to thrive.


Much like animals, molds (and all fungi) cannot produce food internally. All of the calories and nutrients that they require to function must be obtained from an external source. Molds, as a broad category, are not choosy. Some grow well in starchy foods, others target fruits and vegetables, while others still will sprout from the tiny shreds of organic matter (mostly paper) in moist drywall.Molds survive best in wet environments. Of course most living things live close to water, but molds are especially dependent upon it. Unlike both plants and animals, molds employ a process of external digestion. Dry environments make the absorption of nutrients difficult for molds. They will not thrive without access to moisture.Most forms of mold also prefer warm temperatures. There are two primary reasons for this. The enzymes that molds use in both external digestion and internal cell processes function best at temperatures well above the freezing point. In addition, molds are multicellular organisms without complex circulatory systems. It is easier to transfer nutrients from cell to cell in warm environments than in cold ones.
Though a few molds are actually light sensitive, most are not directly affected by sunlight. Molds typically do not grow in sunny places only because such areas are at risk of drying out., As mentioned above, nearly anything that was once alive (and a few that were not) are potential food sources for mold. However, some molds are more common than others.


One of the most common molds is penicillin, which often grows on bread. Bread is convenient for mold for the same reason that it is a great food for people. The organic matter in the grains that make up bread have already been partially broken down. Just as with humans, bread is easier for mold to digest than are the grains themselves.Dairy products, and cheese in particular, also grow molds effectively. It may be easiest to trace the development of mold on a mold-free cheese such as a soft mozzarella. On the other hand, some cheese contain live mold inside of them or on an outer skin. These cheeses could serve as both mold food and a source for mold., Molds release spores that can cause allergies, and a few can even cause infections. While most are harmless, you should protect yourself. Look for a potential container in which the mold can grow. The best containers should be clear so you can observe the mold without exposing yourself to it. They also must have airtight and watertight seals. Even if you do not add moisture, the decomposition process will likely get messy.


One of the best container options is a clear, sealable plastic bag. You can observe the mold as it grows and keep it perfectly contained. You may want to use a high quality plastic bag, as a broken seal later can lead to an awful mess.
For all of the reasons previously mentioned, you should find a disposable container. After you have created a container full of mold, you must not open it.

, As noted earlier, molds do not need to be kept out of the light, but high exposure to sunlight can potentially dry them out. Also, while some can live in the cold, the majority grow best in warm environments. Find a warm, sheltered place to keep you mold as it grows.

, Mold spores are everywhere, and you will not need to “plant” them on the food source. They are certainly already there.


Make sure the environment in the container is moist enough. Your goal should be to seal the container and never open it again while growing the mold. If the food source dries out as you are still waiting for mold to grow, you may have to open the container up and add more water. At the same time, most molds do not grow in directly in water. Keep the food source moist without flooding it.

, Check the container for mold regularly, and daily if possible. If there is no apparent mold and the food source looks dry, open the container and sprinkle a few drops of water onto it.


If you open the container, it may be a good idea to wear disposable rubber gloves and a mask to cover you face and nose. Even if you cannot see the mold, some may be growing already. Most molds are not dangerous, but some can be. Do not take any risks., Observe it closely and note the colors and forms of the mold patches. They can indicate the type that is growing on the food source. You can find out more about common molds on the webpage of the US Department of Agriculture website (link below)., Throw the entire container in the garbage. Do not open the container.

Learn the importance of enzymes for the performance of metabolic reactions inside the body.,
Study the role of enzyme inhibition in the treatment of medical disorders.,
Learn about the types of interactions between pharmacological drugs and the active site of the enzyme.",How to Learn and Understand the Chemistry and Physiology of Enzymes in Humans," Enzymes are a class of proteins that have special functions in the body of living organisms including human individuals. These enzymes are synthesized in the body by the same mechanism of proteins translational processes that involves the coding of amino acids by codons that are comprised each of three DNA bases. Each codon of three neighboring DNA bases codes for one amino acid. This amino acid is in turn transported to the cellular ribosome using special type of RNA molecule that is called transfer RNA molecule. These amino acids that are collected at the ribosomal surface become covalently attached to each other by the effect of specialized enzymes. Eventually the formed protein leaves the ribosomal surface and becomes an active protein that can serve one of several functions in the body including enzymatic functions.;
, Enzymes differ than other forms of proteins by their special morphological chemical structure that contains an active site. This active site is located within a small hole in the structure of the tertiary folded protein. It is presumed that catalytic effects of all enzymes occur within these small holes of all proteins. These holes contain few amino acids that have immense physiological value due to their participation in performing the catalysis of the metabolic reactions. Enzymes usually have chiral structure that gives it character as a selective catalyst for the biochemical reactions inside the cells of body. Enzymatic catalysis inside the body usually proceeds at body temperature of 37 °C (99 °F). This is in contrast to chemical reactions that occur in the chemical laboratory which can require high temperature to proceed. Also typical of enzymatic reactions inside the body is the use of water as the medium for the reaction.

, In the chemical laboratory this process usually occurs in organic solvents. Also inside the body there is no need for separation of biochemical products of the metabolism in the cells of the body. On the other hand there is a need to isolate the products of reactions that take place in the chemistry laboratory by evaporation technique of the organic solvent. Also enzymes mediated biochemical reactions are highly selective and specific in their progression. This is rarely observed in the chemistry laboratory with normal non biochemical reactions. These non metabolic reactions usually involve multiple products of the chemical reaction that poses difficulties of separating them. In this respect enzymes catalyzed reactions are superior to chemical reactions that take place in the chemistry laboratory.

, All metabolic reactions inside all living organisms share the common characteristic of being performed under enzymatic catalytic conditions. Metabolic reactions cannot proceed without the assistance of enzymes. This is partly due to the limitation of low temperature on the reaction conditions inside the body. Enzymes are used pharmacologically in the treatment of various medical disorders. Pharmacologists use the fact the these biochemical reactions do not proceed without the assistance of the enzymes for designing pharmacological drugs in order to treat diseases in the body of humans. Especially notable here is the effect of these drugs on microbial agents such as bacterial microorganisms. These microorganisms use very specific metabolic pathways for their life sustaining. In this respect they use special enzymes to drive these metabolic reactions to completion. Pharmacological drugs are used in most cases to inhibit the function of key enzymes in the metabolic pathways of important biochemical reactions within the bacterial microorganism.

, Inhibition of these important enzymes can be either reversible or irreversible. Irreversible inhibition refers to the inability of the enzyme to restore its biological effect by chemical means. This is usually obtained by the binding of the inhibitor drug covalently to one of the amino acids in the active site of the enzyme. This usually neutralizes completely the catalytic function of the enzyme. On the other hand reversible inhibition can usually be modified to restore the full catalytic function of the enzyme. This is usually done by increasing the concentration of competitive substrate in the body to the pharmacologic drug. This can diminish the effect of the drug on the catalysis of the enzyme. Reversible inhibition is usually obtained by the formation of electrostatic interaction between the drug and the amino acid within the active site of the enzyme.

, One type of such common interactions is the hydrogen bonding type of electrostatic interactions. The kinetics of enzymatic catalysis is a major concern of research that is done in order to elucidate the presumed catalytic function of the enzyme. Also structural studies of amino acids sequence of the enzymatic skeleton is less likely done due to the usual long sequence of amino acids that characterizes most enzymes in the body. Genetic diseases can affect the quality of the enzyme structure by virtue of the dependence of its synthesis on the sequence of the DNA bases that usually code for its synthesis. Also cancer can cause defective enzymes synthesis due to the defective genetic material that is triggered by the mutational effect of the cancer.

Know what is metabolic alkalosis.,
Learn what are acids and bases.,
Lewis bases can be found in the body such as an electron pair on nitrogen of amino acids.,
Fortunately, these changes in acidity and basicity are well controlled by well defined buffers in the body which usually are effective within a given range of pH.,
Know what is a buffer.,
Acids usually enter the cell and are buffered there by either the phosphate ion of the proteins.,
Learn the most important ions in the extracellular space.,
Know how metabolic alkalosis occurs.,
This acid can sometimes cause peptic ulcer to the stomach mucosa due to its corrosive nature.,
This basic environment is then absorbed to the blood circulation causing alkalosis of the blood.

,
Also ingestion of large amount of base such as bicarbonate ions in order to treat an existing metabolic acidosis can by itself induce a state of metabolic alkalosis if the base is taken in large quantity.,
Also, a state of low potassium level in the extracellular space and in the blood can induce a state of metabolic alkalosis.",How to Learn and Understand Metabolic Alkalosis," Metabolic alkalosis is one of the disorders which affects acid and base balance in the blood and the extracellular space. This disorder is manifested by increased amount of base in the blood and a decreased amount of acid with concomitant increase in blood pH. It can have several causes that will be mentioned in this article.;
, Acids and bases are concepts that when applied to the body means protonic acid and inorganic bases such as the bicarbonate base and phosphate base. There are different types of acids and bases which are called Lewis acids and Lewis bases. Lewis acids are available in the chemistry laboratory but are not found in the body.

, Most bases in the body are weak in nature such as the bicarbonate base and phosphate base. Acids and bases abound in the body and are subject to many chemical reactions that can alter the basicity and acidity of the blood.

, There are several buffers in the body. Some of them function mainly outside the cell and others function only inside the cell.

, The most important buffer inside the cell is the base phosphate in addition to proteins that are present inside the cell which can function also as a base due to the charged amino acids on its structure. These two types of bases usually buffer acids that enter the cell by way of the specialized ion pump H+/K+ pump or by diffusion. This pump exchanges hydrogen ions for potassium ions.

, Especially important is the protein hemoglobin which is an important buffer in the body.

, The main extracellular base is the bicarbonate ion which is along with carbonic acid is under the regulation of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme which produces water and CO2 from carbonic acid. Bicarbonate ions are the most important extracellular buffer in the body. Also ammonia is another base which can trap acids. Ammonia is a Lewis base which is toxic to the body in high concentration. It is obtained as a metabolic product of the deamination process of amino acids in the liver.

, Metabolic alkalosis is the opposite syndrome to metabolic acidosis. It can be caused for example due to vomiting from the stomach. Usually, the stomach secretes large amount of gastric juice which functions to digest food that is present in the stomach. This acid is secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach.

, Vomiting of the gastric content leaves behind basic content in the duodenum and the small intestine which is obtained by the basic secretions from the gallbladder and the pancreas which contain the bicarbonate ion.

,, Large amount of the base bicarbonate has not only an effect on the basicity of the blood but also can affect the blood pressure inside the arteries. Bicarbonate ions contain the counter ion sodium in addition to the bicarbonate ion which is a known potent factor in elevating blood pressure by conserving water in the kidney.

, This is done using the H+/K+ ion pump in which potassium ion is pumped to the outer side of the cell to compensate for the hypokalemia. In exchange hydrogen ions are pumped to the inner side of the cell to maintain charge neutrality. This causes in turn a state of alkalosis.

The cells of the human body are typical for a mammalian animal.,

Cells in the human body are not present in a free situation in the solid tissue.,

The most important type of tissue in the body is called an epithelium.,
By virtue of its developed physiologic structure in comparison with other animals human cellular structure is very complicated and also very sophisticated in its function.,

There are various types of cells in the body that depend on the type of tissue that they belong to.,

Other key type of cells in the body is the cells of the endocrine system.,

Other important cells in the body and which serve specific functions in the body are cells of the immune system.,
This type of cells differentiates form mother cell that is called a monocyte.,
Blood cells whether they are red blood cells or white blood cells can also reproduce by the mechanism of cellular differentiation from mother cells that usually are obtained in the bone marrow.,

Liver cells are another important type of cells in the body that are very important for the normal functioning of the body in humans.,

There are many other important cells in the body but the size of this article does not suffice to discuss all of them such the pancreatic cells and cells of the reproductive system.",How to Learn and Understand the Function of the Various  Cells in the Human Body," Most cells of the human body are eukaryotic in its structure. This means that they reproduce by way of cellular division and cellular differentiation. These two processes that characterize cells in the body are prominent feature of the cellular life in humans. The type of cells in the body of humans is a function of the type of tissue that it serves.
, An exception is the circulating cells in the blood such as macrophages and blood cells. Usually cells in the body are organized in clusters of cells that are attached to basement membrane. The main organization of the cells in the solid structures of the body is called a tissue. A tissue is an aggregate or a collection of similar cells that are connected with each other using special form of connection that differs from one type of tissue to another., This type of tissue usually covers the lining of the skin and the lining of the intestine. Other tissues serve different function and are also of different structure on the cellular level., Most cellular processes in the body are under regulatory mechanisms that control their function.Examples of such regulatory systems are the endocrine system and the nervous system. For this reason cells in the body are not autonomic in its function but obey orders by higher biological systems in the body through a signaling process that involves mediators in the form of biochemical compounds that are secreted in response to a particular stimulus., An important type of cells in the body of humans is the cells of the nervous system. The nervous system in humans is one of the most complicated structures in the body. This is so due to its numerous functions that are essential for maintaining a constant environment inside the body. Cells of the nervous system are called neurons and they have completely different function than other cells in the body. Neurons mediate many essential functions in the body such as maintaining a state of consciousness and mental arousal., These cells a very important due to their role in secreting signaling compounds that function to transmit information from one cell to another. These cells are organized in clusters of very organized cells that are called glands. These glands synthesize and secrete specific compounds which are called hormones in response to a stimulus that it receives through a regulatory mechanism that is called feedback loop. The understanding of the mechanisms of these loops is key to the understanding of the process of hormonal function in the body., These cells are unusually developed genetically due to their ability to monitor the body for foreign antigens. The mechanism of action of the immune cells is very complicated but the understanding of its mechanism of action is a purely technical issue that requires only strong memory. The cells of the immune system have astonishing and remarkable ability to recognize and fight microbes and antigenic materials. One type of such cells is called macrophage., Cells of the immune system reproduce by one of two ways either by cellular differentiation as occurs with red blood cells for example. The other possible way of reproduction is through the direct cellular division that is typical of eukaryotic cells in the body., White blood cells are part of the general lymphatic system cells that are obtained by the differentiation process that is typical for this type of cells and for red blood cells., These cells are very specialized and unique in its function. Their important function is manifested by the synthesis of proteins in the body in hepatocytes. In addition hepatocytes synthesize an important group of compounds which are called bile acids. These compounds are important for the proper function of the food digestion in the intestine. Also these cells are the site of amino acids metabolism., This is in addition to cells of the two kidneys and the cells of the adrenal gland. These will be discussed in a separate article."

Their coat is long, though it will be thinner during the summer. During the winter, the hair grows much longer, especially around the mane and legs. The tail is plumed.The breed is single coated and has no undercoat.;
, The most common color for a Turkish Angora is white. However, breeders have started trying for other colors. They can also come in blue, black, red, and cream, along with tortoiseshell, blue-cream, mackerel tabby, spotted tabby, or bi-colors.This breed can pretty much come in any shade or pattern. However, colors that point to any hybridization, like lavender, chocolate, or pointed pattern, are not accepted for this breed.

, Turkish Angoras have very slim, long, elegant features. The limbs are graceful, and it is slim medium-sized cat. Some consider the cat dainty because of their small, fine bones and narrow chest., Turkish Angoras have wedge-shaped heads that taper near the chin. They have tall, pointed ears, and long, slender necks and torsos.Their eyes are large and almond-shaped. The eyes come in multiple colors, including blue, green, and amber. Some Turkish Angoras have two different colored eyes, one of which is blue."

Expect an outgoing, social cat with alpha tendencies.,
Notice an independent streak.,
Look for a cat that loves to run and play.",How to Identify a Turkish Angora2," Turkish Angoras are active cats who love to be around others. They don’t like to entertain themselves and expect their owners to interact with them often. They get bored easily if they don’t get as much attention as they want. They like to take charge and rule everyone around them.This breed is good for families and other pets. This breed will take the alpha role when around other cats and dogs.
The breed does well with visitors.

, Turkish Angoras are independent cats who like to do things on their own, and sometimes “talk” to you to give their opinion on how you should do something. They don’t like the be held often, and they are not lap cats.These cats bond with their humans and love spending time with them. They generally stay in the same room with you, watching and supervising.
They are stubborn cats who can easily get into bad habits because of their independent streak. However, they are intelligent and learn tricks and commands.

, Turkish Angoras love to dance around and play with toys. They have a strong hunting instinct, so they will pounce on fake mice and birds, and even their owner’s feet. They like to run around, especially if they are chasing toys.Turkish Angoras also love to climb.

Find a breeder.,
Try adoption.,
Be patient.",How to Identify a Turkish Angora3," If you want to adopt a Turkish Angora from a breeder, locate a reputable breeder. Turkish Angoras are a rare natural breed. Prices for a pet Turkish Angora range from around $150 to $400. If you want a cat that is show worthy, they range from $700 to over $1000. White Angoras with blue eyes are the rarest and most expensive.You can generally get a kitten from a breeder when they are between 12 to 16 weeks old.An ethical breeder will provide health certifications that show they have screened for genetic health problems. They will raise kittens at home and will socialize them early.Start by checking cat breed websites, such as The Cat Fanciers’ Association, The Fanciers Breeder Referral List, Cat’s Center Stage, and The International Cat Association.
If you visit breeder websites, watch for red flags. These include immediately available kittens, multiple litters, paying online with a credit card, and your choice of any kitten.

, Instead of going to a breeder, consider adopting a Turkish Angora. They are relatively rare, but you can check local shelters and pet adoption websites. Petfinder and Adopt-a-Pet may provide you with listings for Turkish Angoras for sale.Talk to your vet or local breeders about whether they know of any Turkish Angoras that need rescuing.

, Finding a Turkish Angora may take awhile since they are an uncommon breed. If you are interested in getting a cat from a breeder, be aware that since they are rare, the wait time may be awhile. You may be able to find a breeder who will have a litter soon, but remember you will have to wait up to 16 weeks before you get your kitten."

Biochemical processes in mammalians in general and in humans and animals in particular are different than other analogous processes which occur in other types of animals and also are different than those which occur in plants and microorganisms.,
In humans for example there are higher mental thinking that is manifested by the presence in the brain of specialized areas in its cortex for the different functions of the nervous system such as motor neurons and sensory neurons.,
The endocrine system in humans is very developed and more sophisticated in its function in comparison with reptiles for example.,
The main neurotransmitter that is operative under these conditions is called epinephrine and is secreted from both neurons of the autonomic nervous system and from specialized cells in the adrenal medulla.,
In animals the most dominant feature of their behaviors is the presence of primitive forms of autonomic reflexes.,
So far there are not found creatures that are more intelligent than humans on this planet.,
Genetics is a subject that belongs to the area of biology and it is molecular basis.,
Due to their intelligent nature humans are the subject of scientific investigation more than other animals.,
Research in the body everyday explores new enzymes and hormones that were not found before.",How to Know the Various Controlling Systems of the Body," Mammalian cells have more sophisticated functions and more developed than its counterparts in other species. This is manifested especially in humans which are smarter than other creatures in the animal kingdom. Also the nervous system of mammalians and in humans in particular is more developed and is more intricate in function than other animals such as the reptiles. These primitive animals have basic structure of their nervous system that is built mostly of autonomic reflexes that allow it to sustain their life needs.;
, This is in addition to the presence of neurons that have other functions such as receptors of pain and other sensations that are located in the skin. These sensations are perceived in special areas of the brain cortex and give the appropriate sensation to the affected individual.

, The endocrine system in humans is multifunctional system that its function is mediated through multiple endocrine glands that are located in various areas of the body. These glands secrete chemical compounds that have signaling function for the various cells of the body. In addition this system is much more developed than in certain animals such as the reptiles. The endocrine system in humans is a controlled system that has master glands that govern and dictate the function of the other endocrine glands in the body. This master gland in humans is located in the brain as is part of the central nervous system in humans. The mechanism of defense in humans in the case of emergency is governed by the autonomic nervous system and in particular the sympathetic nervous system.

, This is the basic mechanism which occurs in humans and animals of the more developed species. This mechanism of adaptation to stressful situations is characterized by specific symptoms that distinguish this situation such as increased heart rate and increased sweating. Also humans use their more developed brains in order to assess and evaluate the situation that faces them.

, Humans also have autonomic autonomic reflexes but these are minor part of their nervous system which include developed centers in the brain which specialize in higher mental thinking and other intelligent functions that lack in other animals. Also in the brain of humans there are centers for the sensation of hunger and thirst in which can be expressed vocally through the specialized function of the larynx which lacks in all animals.

, This however does not rule out their existence. Intelligence of animals in general and humans in particular is a controversial subject in as much as its basic causes. It is however agreed that both biological as well as environmental causes contribute to the development of intelligence in humans.

, The answer of many unsolved questions about the mechanisms of many phenomena in the body of humans is likely to be found in the structure of genes in the various humans. An example cancer is sometimes of genetic causes. Also the many other diseases of the body are of genetic origin. The subject of genetics is based on the chemical structure of the DNA molecules and its translational process of protein synthesis at the ribosome. Dysfunctional DNA molecule by virtue of its wrong sequence of bases can lead to the synthesis of dysfunctional proteins and enzymes. Also these enzymes can sometimes be deficient completely and not synthesized by the cell. This can have severe clinical symptoms of the affected individuals.

, Also the disease processes that occur in humans have led to the investigation of the molecular biology of the human cell and the cellular biochemistry of microorganisms. The biochemical processes in humans are much more understood than in other animals. This is however still not a complete understanding of the nature of biochemical processes which occur in the body.

, This is possible due to the intensive research that is being done on this area of science and other areas as well. Exploration of the nature of the human body and the essence of our existence is a main impetus for humans to proceed in the process of scientific research in all areas of science.

Read your biology book ahead of time.,
Take note of important biology concepts.,
Bring notes to class.",How to Get Good Grades in Biology Class1," Read any relevant chapters before class so that you can understand the lecture better. You will also be aware of any concepts that you have difficulty understanding. You can ask the teacher before class or during class to clarify these concepts., As you are reading and studying before class, you should take notes. This way, you solidify the material in your mind. You should also scan or redraw any figures or diagrams that are important (e.g. they show up multiple times in the chapter)., For every class, you should bring notes from previous classes. You should also bring your notes from independent studying, including pictures. This can give you an edge on taking notes in class, which will free up more time for you to absorb what the teacher is saying."
"
Take notes.,
Pay close attention to biology lectures.,
Ask questions.,
Complete all homework.",How to Get Good Grades in Biology Class2," While you are in class, you will need to be diligent about taking notes on important topics. Anything that the teacher writes on the board should be in your notes. Also, if you are told to write something down, do it. Never assume that you will remember important topics.Also take careful notes about assignments and tests, this will help you understand what the instructor is looking for.

, Biology is a complex subject, and the lectures can get very involved. Avoid the urge to use your phone or talk to the person beside you. Focus only on what the instructor is discussing.It is a good idea to record the lectures, but you must have your instructor’s permission ahead of time.

, Your instructor’s job is to help you learn. When you are struggling to understand something that they are teaching, speak up and ask them. You can even wait until office hours or after class if you are uncomfortable speaking in front of the class.For example, you might ask “Professor, how does a cell replicate?”

, Homework is given for two reasons. Either your instructor wants to grade it, or they want you to learn the material so they can grade you on similar concepts later. Both are important to your success in the class. Dedicate time every day after class to do your biology homework."

Make sure that you understand the concepts and procedures addressed in the experiment. Write down any questions, especially those pertaining to safety, before lab., Biology labs are used to reinforce concepts learned in lecture, and to prepare students for more advanced lab work. Following the safety precautions not only protects you, it is often a part of your grade. In addition the the general lab rules that your instructor gives you, you should look for any special safety precautions mentioned in the literature for each experiment.

, If you have the privilege of choosing your lab partner, make sure to choose someone who is there to do well. Your success can be helped or hindered by your partner’s drive. Single out someone you know is committed to biology and ask them ahead of time to be your partner.

, Most labs are designed to be a two (or more) person job. Avoid the urge to do it all, and delegate some work to your partner. If your partner seems to be doing the majority of the work, pitch in and make sure you understand the concepts. Labs are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in your biology class."

Make a study schedule.,
Know your learning style.,
Avoid cramming sessions.,
Attend a study group.",How to Get Good Grades in Biology Class4," Spreading out study time is crucial to success in a biology course. This technique keeps your studying disciplined and predictable.The general rule for biology courses is that you should set aside roughly two hours of study time for each hour of class., Understand what types of information you retain best. You aren’t likely to have control over how the instructor lectures, but you will have control over how you study. Use this to your advantage and study the materials in the way you learn best. The recognized learning types are:Visual - You prefer to include pictures, images, videos, etc.
Auditory - You like hearing information and/or integrating music and sounds.
Linguistic - You learn information when it is in the form of language (written or spoken).
Kinesthetic - You are a “hands on” learner. Movement and physical touch help you retain information.
Mathematical - You rely on systems of logic to learn.
Interpersonal - Most of your learning occurs in a group setting.
Intrapersonal - Learning alone suits you best.

, Research shows that cramming is ineffective. Using the same amount of study time spread over days or weeks will allow your brain to retain more information than a single cram session. Focus on one biological concept at a time, and spread out complicated processes over multiple sessions. Remember to take a study break every forty-five minutes to rest your brain.Review old material each session.
Use note cards for quick, on the go studying.

, Studying as a social activity can be very beneficial. It allows you to see different points of view on biological concepts, and different study techniques. Offer your take on things as well, you might find that you know things that others in the group have missed.You can also tutor other students in biology courses.
If you need extra help in biology, consider seeking out a tutor.

Understand that all organisms are composed of cells.,
Remember essential molecules.,
Analyze inherited traits.",How to Get Good Grades in Biology Class5," The most basic foundation of biology is that all organisms are composed of some number of cells that are independent of each other, but function as a multicellular organism. The number of cells varies from single celled organisms to organisms with trillions of cells. Keep in mind that not all cells in an organism have to be identical to one another (e.g. brain cells and heart cells)., Cells function by moving molecules and energy back and forth. There are a number a molecules that are key to life as we know it. You should have an understanding of these biologically significant molecules and what they do. This will make understanding biology much easier.For example, ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) is the energy storage molecule. It allows cells to store energy and use it later.

, No organism lives forever. Instead, organisms reproduce one generation after another. Their genetic information is passed down through DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) to guide the development of their offspring. Traits that help an organism survive in its environment are favored and get reproduced more frequently, while other traits die off. This forms the basis for concepts such as inheritance and evolution, and is central to the biology field."

Add dish soap.,
Pour in rubbing alcohol.,
Wait for the DNA to separate.,
Purchase a DNA kit.,
Collect your DNA.,
Deliver the sample to a lab.",How to Extract Your DNA," To extract your DNA from saliva, you'll need to create a mouth rinse first. You'll be mixing salt into water, because salt provides a rough, granular texture to help collect cells from your mouth. It also helps protect the negative phosphate ends of your DNA, allowing it to precipitate out of the saliva.Mix one tablespoon of salt into 500 milliliters of clean drinking water. Stir until the salt is dissolved, then measure out three tablespoons of the rinse into a clean, clear cup.;
, Using the smaller cup with three tablespoons of saltwater, pour the rinse into your mouth without swallowing. Gargle and swish the rinse around in your mouth for at least one minute.While swishing the rinse in your mouth, gently scrape your teeth against the insides of your cheeks. This will help release additional cells to be suspended in the saltwater., After about one minute of gargling, swishing, and gentle scraping inside your mouth, spit the rinse back into the smaller, clear cup. You will not be able to see it with the naked eye yet, but cells from your cheeks are now suspended in the saltwater rinse., Carefully squeeze out one drop of dish soap into the cup containing your used saltwater rinse.Gently stir the soap into the water without making creating bubbles. Alternately, you can make a diluted solution of two parts water to one part soap, and gently mix one teaspoon of the diluted solution to the used saltwater rinse.Soap breaks down the cell's membranes and nucleus, releasing your DNA directly into the saltwater.

, Measure out 100 milliliters of rubbing alcohol (isopropyl). Carefully add this to the saltwater by tipping the DNA cup at an angle (approximately 45 degrees) and pouring the alcohol against the side of the cup.The goal is to pour the alcohol gently enough that it forms an undisturbed layer on top of the saltwater.
Alcohol helps precipitate your DNA while leaving the other components of the cup in the original solution.Do not drink any of the isopropyl alcohol. This type of alcohol is extremely dangerous and is not meant for human consumption.

, After approximately two to three minutes, you should begin to see clumps and strings of a white substance form between the saltwater and alcohol layers (though it may take up to 10 minutes for these clumps to fully form). Those strings and clumps are your DNA precipitating out of the saliva and saltwater., There are numerous types of DNA kits commercially available. These kits are designed to collect your saliva or a cheek swab and preserve the sample. Please note that these kits allow you to collect your DNA at home, but require you to mail your sample to a lab or testing facility in order for your DNA to be sequenced.


The most common methods of saliva DNA collection are whole-saliva collection (spitting directly into a container), buccal swab/brush collection (using a swab or specially-designed brush to gently scrape the insides of your cheeks), and oral rinse collection (described above).
Of the three methods of collection, whole-saliva collection provides a significantly higher yield of DNA., How you collect your DNA will vary, depending on the type of kit you've purchased. If using a brush or swab, you'll rub the collection device against the insides of your cheeks for approximately 30 seconds to a minute. Some kits may require you to use a stabilizing rinse immediately after scrubbing your cheeks. Do not swallow the rinse. You will need to spit it out into a bottle, if using a rinse.If using a whole-saliva collection method, simply spit into the tube or container that came with your kit until your liquid saliva (excluding bubbles) reaches the marked fill line.Some kits require you to vigorously shake your sample. Others do not. Follow the instructions on the kit that you've purchased.

, Some kits will include an address that you can mail your completed sample to. Others will not, and you may need to find a lab near you that will sequence/analyze DNA. You can find labs in your area (if you need to) by looking in a phone book or searching online and looking at the services offered by local testing laboratories. If the kit you purchased includes mailing instructions, follow those packing and shipping instructions to send your sample off for sequencing.


DNA sequencing can tell you vital information about your genetics, your lineage, and even your risk of certain genetic diseases. DNA sequencing can also help pregnant couples determine the risk that their child will carry a genetic mutation or disease."

It is color coded and assigns each element a unique 1, 2, or 3-letter abbreviation. Other elemental information includes atomic weight and atomic number.You can find a periodic table online or in a chemistry book.
In tests, normally, a periodic table will be provided.;
, The table orders elements by atomic number and separates them into three main groups: metals, non-metals, and metalloids (semi-metals). Further elemental groupings include alkali metals, halogens, and noble gases.Using the group (columns) or period (rows) can make the element easier to locate on the table.
You can also search the table for the symbol of the element if you don’t know any other properties.

, The atomic number is located above the element symbol, in the upper left-hand corner of the square. The atomic number will tell you how many protons make up a single atom of an element.For example, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, therefore it has 5 protons.

, Protons are particles in the nucleus of an atom that have a positive charge. Electrons are particles that have a negative charge. Therefore, an element in a neutral state will have the same number of protons and electrons.


For example, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, therefore it has 5 protons and 5 electrons.
However, if the element includes a negative or positive ion, then the protons and electrons will not be the same. You will have to calculate them. The ion number will appear as a small, superscript after the element.

, To find the number of neutrons, you will first need to find the atomic mass. An element’s atomic mass (also known as the atomic weight) is the average mass of atoms of an element.The atomic mass can be found underneath the symbol for the element.


Make sure that you round the atomic mass to the nearest whole number. For example, the atomic mass of boron is 10.811, but you can just round the atomic mass up to 11.

, To find the number of neutrons, you will need to subtract the atomic number from the atomic mass. Remember that the atomic number is the same as the number of protons, which you have already identified.For our boron example, 11 (atomic mass) – 5 (atomic number) = 6 neutrons

, The number of ions in an element will appear as a small, superscript number following the element. An ion is an atom that has a positive or negative charge due to the addition or removal of electrons.Although the number of protons in the atom remains the same, the number of electrons is altered in an ion.


Because an electron has a negative charge, when you remove electrons, the ion becomes positive. When you add more electrons, the ion becomes negative.
For example, N3- has a -3 charge while Ca2+ has a +2 charge.
Keep in mind that you do not have to do this calculation if there is no superscripted ion number following the element.

, When an ion has a positive charge, the atom has lost electrons. To calculate the remaining number of electrons, you subtract the amount of extra charge from the atomic number. In the case of a positive ion, there are more protons than electrons.


For example, Ca2+ has a +2 charge so it has lost 2 electrons from the neutral state. Calcium’s atomic number is 20, therefore the ion has 18 electrons.

, When an ion has a negative charge, the atom has gained electrons. To calculate the total number of present electrons, you simply add the amount of extra charge to the atomic number. In the case of a negative ion, there are fewer protons than electrons.


For example, N3- has a -3 charge therefore it has gained 3 electrons compared to the neutral state. Nitrogen’s atomic number is 7, therefore this ion has 10 electrons.

Round off the atomic weight to the nearest whole number to find the atomic mass.,
Subtract the atomic number from the atomic mass.,
Remember the formula.",How to Find the Number of Neutrons in an Atom1," For this example, we’ll look at osmium (Os), which is in the sixth row down.;
, This tends to be the most visible number pertaining to a given element and usually sits above the element symbol. (On the chart we're using, in fact, no other numbers are listed.) The atomic number is the number of protons in a single atom of that element. Os is number 76, meaning one atom of osmium has 76 protons.

, This number is usually found beneath the atomic symbol. Note that the chart in this example is based solely on atomic number and doesn’t list the atomic weight. This won’t always usually be the case. Osmium has an atomic weight of 190.23.

, In our example, 190.23 would be rounded to 190, resulting in an atomic mass of 190 for osmium.

, Since the vast majority of an atom’s mass is found its protons and neutrons, subtracting the number of protons (i.e. the atomic number) from the atomic mass will give you the calculated number of neutrons in the atom. The numbers after the decimal point represent the usually very small mass of the electrons in the atom. In our example, this is: 190 (atomic weight) – 76 (number of protons) = 114 (number of neutrons).

, To find the number of neutrons in the future, simply use this formula:



N = M – n

N = number of Neutrons
M = atomic Mass
n = atomic number

, This tends to be the most visible number pertaining to a given element and usually sits above the element symbol. (On our example chart, in fact, no other numbers are listed.) The atomic number is the number of protons in a single atom of that element. C is number 6, meaning one atom of carbon has 6 protons.

, This is incredibly easy with isotopes, as they are named according to their atomic mass. Carbon-14, for example, has an atomic mass of 14. Once you find the atomic mass of the isotope, the process is the same as it is for finding the number of neutrons in a regular atom.

, Since the vast majority of an atom’s mass is found its protons and neutrons, subtracting the number of protons (i.e. the atomic number) from the atomic mass will give you the calculated number of neutrons in the atom. In our example, this is: 14 (atomic mass) – 6 (number of protons) = 8 (number of neutrons).

, To find the number of neutrons in the future, simply use this formula:



N = M – n

Analyze your answer.",How to Find the Volume of an Irregular Object Using a Graduated Cylinder," Choose a graduated cylinder that the object will easily fit inside. Tilt the cylinder while pouring the water to reduce bubbles. Pour enough water in to fill the cylinder to the halfway mark., You will notice that the water is higher on the sides of the cylinder and droops slightly in the middle. This droop is known as the meniscus and is the standard point at which the water level is measured. Make sure that the cylinder is on a flat, level surface and that there are no bubbles. Look closely where the meniscus rests., It will be important to know the initial water level exactly. Write down the measurement that you took in a table or lab notebook. Your measurement will be mL. , Tilt the cylinder. Slide the object into the water slightly. Be sure that your object is completely submerged in the water. If there is not enough water to submerge the object, you will have to start over with more water in the cylinder., Let the object and the water settle. Make sure that the cylinder is on a flat level surface. Now look at the water level (again read the meniscus). The water level should have increased with the object being added to the cylinder., The final measurement will be just as important as the initial measurement in your calculations. It too must be precise. Write down the final water level in mL in your table or lab notebook., Some people jump to the conclusion that the final reading gives them the volume of their object, but this is incorrect. The final reading is the volume of water plus the volume of your object. You will need to find the difference of the final and initial readings to know the volume of your object., You will set up the equation Vtotal - Vwater = Vobject. Vtotal is your final measurement, Vwater is your initial measurement, and Vobject is the volume of your object. In other words, subtract the first measurement from the second to find the volume of your object., Make sure that the volume you calculate makes sense. Obviously, you can check your calculation with a calculator. Some obvious signs of a mistake are things like your object having negative volume (this isn’t possible) or a volume larger than the cylinder could hold (a volume of 30 mL cannot be measured in a 25 mL cylinder). If your answer seems wrong, you should first check your equation to make sure you did the math properly. If you did, you will have to redo the experiment and obtain new measurements.If you found a negative volume, it is likely that you simply mixed up the initial and final measurements in your equation and do not need to redo the experiment.
If you obtain a number too large to be reasonable, you either made an arithmetic error or wrote down incorrect measurements. If it is the latter, you will have to redo the experiment.

Know what the empirical formula is.,
Understand the term 'percent composition'.,
Be aware that you will be dealing with gram atoms.,
Know how to find the atomic ratio.,
Understand how to convert numbers of atomic ratio into whole numbers.,
Understand what those whole numbers mean for the empirical formula.",How to Find the Empirical Formula1," In chemistry, the EF is the simplest way to describe a compound—it is basically a list of the elements that make up a compound, organized by percentage. It's important to note that this simple formula does not describe the arrangement of the atoms within the compound, it simply states which elements compound is made of.For example:


A compound that is made up of 40.92% Carbon, 4.58% hydrogen, and 54.5% Oxygen would have an empirical formula of C3H4O3 (we will go through an example of how to find the EF of this compound in Part Two).;
, 'Percentage composition' refers to the percent of each individual atom in the whole compound that we are looking at. To find the empirical formula of a compound, we must know the percentage composition of the compound. If you are finding the empirical formula for homework, you will most likely be given the percentages.


In a chemistry lab, to find the percentage composition, the compound would be examined through some physical experiments and then quantitative analysis. Unless you are in a lab, you will not need to actually do these experiments.

, A gram atom is the specific amount of an element that's weight in grams equals its atomic mass. To find a gram atom, the equation is: The percent of the element in the compound (%) divided by the element’s atomic mass.For example, let’s say that we have a compound that is made up of 40.92% carbon. The atomic mass of carbon is 12 so our equation would be 40.92 / 12 = 3.41.

, When you are working with a compound, you will have more than one gram atom to calculate. After you have found all of the gram atoms in your compound, look at all of them. To find the atomic ratio, you will have to pick out the gram atom that is the smallest out of all of the gram atoms that you calculated. You will then divide all of your gram atoms by the smallest gram atom. For example:


Let’s say that we are working with a compound that has three gram atoms: 1.5, 2 and 2.5. The smallest gram atom out of those three numbers is 1.5. So to find the atomic ratio, you must divide all of the numbers by 1.5 and then separate them with the symbol for ratio :.
1.5 / 1.5 = 1. 2 / 1.5 = 1.33. 2.5 / 1.5 = 1.66. So your atomic ratio is 1 : 1.33 : 1.66.

, When writing an empirical formula, you need whole numbers. This means you can’t use a number like 1.33. After you have found your atomic ratio, you need to convert any partial numbers (again, like 1.33) into whole numbers (like 3). To do this, you have to find a whole number that can be multiplied by each individual number in your atomic ratio to get a whole number. For example:


Try 2. Multiply the numbers in your atomic ratio (1, 1.33, and 1.66) by 2. You get 2, 2.66, and 3.32. These are not whole numbers so 2 doesn’t work.
Try 3. You get 3, 4, and 5 when you multiply 1, 1.33, and 1.66 by 3. Therefore, your atomic ratio of whole numbers is 3 : 4 : 5.

, The whole number ratio that we just solved actually fits in to the empirical formula. Those three whole numbers are the little numbers that hang at the foot of each letter that represents a separate element of the compound. For example, our made up empirical formula would look like:


X3Y4Z5

Convert the masses to moles.,
Divide all molar values by the smallest molar value.,
Round your molar values to whole numbers.,
Understand an empirical formula.,
Know what a molecular formula tells you.,
Understand structural representations.",How to Find Molecular Formula," The empirical formula provides a ratio of atoms within a molecule, for example, two oxygens for every carbon. The molecular formula tells you how many of each of those atoms is present in the molecule. For example, one carbon and two oxygens (carbon dioxide). The two formulae are related by a whole number ratio such that if the empirical formula is multiplied by the ratio, it will yield the molecular formula., This means utilizing the ideal gas law. You can determine the number of moles based on the pressure, volume, and temperature provided by the experimental data. The number of moles can be calculated using the following formula: n = PV/RT.In this formula, n is the number of moles, P is the pressure, V is the volume, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and R is the gas constant.
Example: n = PV/RT = (0.984 atm * 1 L) / (0.08206 L atm mol-1 K-1 * 318.15 K) = 0.0377 mol

, This can only be done after finding the moles of gas present using the ideal gas law. You will also need to know how many grams of gas were present. Then divide the grams of gas by the moles of gas present to yield molecular weight.


Example: 14.42 g / 0.0377 mol = 382.49 g/mol

, Each atom in the empirical formula has its own atomic weight. This value can be found at the bottom of the atom’s square on the periodic table. Add these weights together to get the weight of the empirical formula.Example: (12.0107 g * 12) + (15.9994 g * 1) + (1.00794 g * 30) = 144.1284 + 15.9994 + 30.2382 = 190.366 g

, In doing this, you can determine how many times the empirical weight is repeated within the actual molecule. Knowing how many times the empirical weight is repeated will let you find the number of times that the empirical formula repeats itself in the molecular formula. This should be a whole number. If the ratio is not a whole number, you will have to round it.


Example: 382.49 / 190.366 = 2.009

, Multiply the subscripts of the empirical formula by the ratio. This will yield the molecular formula. Note that for any compound with a ratio of “1,” the empirical formula and molecular formula will be the same.


Example: C12OH30 * 2 = C24O2H60

, Sometimes the mass of each atom will be given. Other times, it will be given as a percent mass. If this is the case, assume a 100 g sample of the compound. This will allow you to write the percent mass as an actual mass in grams.Example: 75.46 g C, 8.43 g O, 16.11 g H

, You need to convert the molecular masses of each element to moles. In order to do this, you need to divide the molecular masses by the atomic masses of each respective element. You can find the atomic mass in the bottom of that element’s square on the periodic table.Example:

75.46 g C * (1 mol / 12.0107 g) = 6.28 mol C
8.43 g O * (1 mol / 15.9994 g) = 0.53 mol O
16.11 g H * (1 mol / 1.00794) = 15.98 mol H



, You need to divide the number of moles for each separate element by the smallest molar amount from all the elements present in the compound. In doing so, you can find the simplest mole ratios. This works, because it gives sets the least abundant element to “1” and provides the respective ratios of other elements in the compound.Example: Smallest molar amount is oxygen with 0.53 mol.

6.28 mol/0.53 mol = 11.83
0.53 mol/0.53 mol = 1
15.98 mol/0.53 mol= 30.15



, These numbers will become the subscripts in the empirical formula. You should round them to the nearest whole number. After finding these numbers, you can write the empirical formula.Example: The empirical formula would be C12OH30

11.83 = 12
1 = 1
30.15 = 30



, An empirical formula gives you information about the ratios of one atom to another in a molecule. This does not provide any information about exactly how many atoms are present in the molecule. The empirical formula also fails to provide information about the structure and bonding of atoms in a molecule., Like the empirical formula, the molecular formula fails to provide information about the bonding and structure of a molecule. Unlike the empirical formula, the molecular formula gives you details about how many of each atom is present in the molecule. The empirical formula and molecular formula are related by a whole number ratio., Structural representations give even more information than molecular formulas. In addition to showing how many of each atom is present in a molecule, structural representations give you information about the bonding and structure of the molecule. This information is crucial to understanding the way the molecule will react."

Obtain a periodic table of elements.,
Find the element in question on the periodic table.,
Find the atomic number of an element.",How to Find Electrons1," This is a color-coded table that organizes all the known elements by atomic structure. Each element has a 1, 2, or 3-letter abbreviation and is listed along with its atomic weight and atomic number.Periodic tables can easily be found in chemistry books and online.;
, The elements are ordered by atomic number and separated into three main groups: metals, non-metals, and metalloids (semi-metals). They are further grouped into families including alkali metals, halogens, and noble gases.Every column of the table is called a group and every row is called a period.


If you know the details of your element, such as what group or period it is in, it will be easier to locate.
If you don’t know anything about the element in question, just search the table for its symbol until you find it.

, The atomic number appears in the upper left-hand corner, above the element symbol in the square. The atomic number defines the number of protons present in that particular element.Protons are the particles in an element that provide a positive charge. Because electrons are negatively charged, when an element is in its neutral state, it will have the same number of protons as electrons.


For instance, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, meaning that it has 5 protons and 5 electrons.

Determine the percentage composition of your compound.,
Find the number of gram atoms in the compound.,
Figure out the atomic ratio.,
Convert the ratio to whole numbers.,
Write down the empirical formula.",How to Find the Empirical Formula2," If you are trying to find the empirical formula for a homework assignment, you will most likely be given the percentage composition—you just need to know where to look. For example:


Let’s say that the assignment asks you to look at a sample of vitamin C. It lists 40.92% Carbon, 4.58% hydrogen 54.5% Oxygen—this is the percent composition.
40.92% of the vitamin C is made up of carbon, while the rest is made up of 4.58% hydrogen and 54.5% oxygen.

, As discussed in Part 1, the equation for finding the number of gram atoms is: The percent of the element in the compound (%) divided by the element’s atomic mass. For our example, the atomic mass of carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1 and oxygen is 16.


Number of gram atoms of carbon = 40.92 / 12 = 3.41
Number of gram atoms of hydrogen = 04.58 / 01 = 4.58
Number of gram atoms of oxygen = 54.50 / 16 = 3.41

, Look for the gram atom that is the smallest of all of the gram atoms that we just calculated. For our example, this is 3.41 (carbon or oxygen—they both have the same value). You must then divide all of the gram atom values by this number. You write the ratio like this: value Carbon : value Hydrogen : value Oxygen.


Carbon: 3.41 / 3.41 = 1
Hydrogen: 4.58 / 3.41 = 1.34
Oxygen: 3.41 / 3.41 = 1
The atomic ratio is 1 : 1.34 : 1.

, If your atomic ratio has whole numbers you can skip this step. For our example, however, we have to convert 1.34 to a whole number. Our smallest whole number that can be multiplied with the numbers in our atomic ratio to create whole numbers is 3.


1 x 3 = 3 (this works because 3 is a whole number).
1.34 x 3 = 4 (4 is also a whole number).
1 x 3 = 3 (again, 3 is a whole number).
Our whole number ratio is therefore Carbon(C) : Hydrogen(H) : Oxygen(O) = 3 : 4 : 3


, To do this, all you have to do is write the letters of each component, in this case C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen, with their whole number counter parts as subscripts. The empirical formula for our example is:


C3H4O3

Find the atomic number of the element.,

Subtract the charge from the atomic number if the ion is positive.,
Add the charge to the atomic number if the charge is negative.",How to Find Electrons2," The atomic number appears in the upper left-hand corner, above the element symbol in the square on the periodic table. The atomic number defines the number of protons present in that particular element.Protons are the particles in an element that provide a positive charge. Because electrons are negatively charged, when an element is in its neutral state, it will have the same number of protons as electrons.


For instance, boron (B) has an atomic number of 5, meaning that it has 5 protons and 5 electrons.

, Adding and removing electrons from an atom does not change its identity, but it changes its charge. In these cases, you now have an ion, such as K+, Ca2+, or N3-. Usually, the charge is expressed in a superscript to the right of the atom abbreviation.


Because an electron has a negative charge, when you add extra electrons, the ion is more negative.
When you remove electrons, the ion becomes more positive.
For example, N3- has a -3 charge while Ca2+ has a +2 charge.

, If the charge is positive, the ion has lost electrons. To determine how many electrons are left, subtract the amount of charge from the atomic number. In this case, there are more protons than electrons.


For example, Ca2+ has a +2 charge therefore it has 2 fewer electrons than a neutral calcium atom. Calcium’s atomic number is 20, therefore this ion has 18 electrons.

, If the charge is negative, the ion has gained electrons. To determine how many total electrons there are, add the amount of charge to the atomic number. In this case, there are fewer protons than electrons.


For example, N3- has a -3 charge which means it has 3 more electrons than a neutral nitrogen atom. Nitrogen’s atomic number is 7, therefore this ion has 10 electrons.

These proteins are built chemically from amino acids that are connected to each other using covalent bonds that are called peptide bonds. These peptide bonds are formed from the combination of a carbon atom of a carboxyl group of one amino acid with the amino group of a neighboring amino acid. This type of chemical bond between two amino acids is difficult to make in the usual organic chemical lab due to the nature of the organic groups that are involved. Especially notable here is the effect of pH on the performance of this type of bonds.

, In the body these chemical bonds are performed more conveniently using enzymatic catalysis. The whole process of making one protein molecule in the cell requires many amino acid molecules as building blocks for that particular protein. Most known proteins possess as little as 100 amino acids each. This is a very large number of chemical compounds that the body needs to recruit in order to build this protein and other proteins as well with similar and more numbers of amino acids. This means that the body needs a huge number of these amino acids on a daily bases in order to supply the row materials in order to synthesize these molecules in the body. This whole process requires therefore an exceptionally high amount of energy for the production of these protein compounds.

, The question then arises whether the economic value of making these compounds in the body is worthy the expenditure of this large number of calories in the body. Obviously this use by the body of macromolecules is universal for all its tissues and cells. This choice of these large compounds is of no clear energetic value for the body.

, The biological design of the body tissues that is so made to use primarily these large compounds is clearly a defective design for building a useful biological living system. These systems exploit energy so recklessly.

, Energy conservation is key factors in the design of all working systems in the world including living systems as well. This fact is obviously not being considered carefully in the design of our living systems. This question of energetic worth for sustaining a living system as it is in its current form at the molecular level should be seriously questioned. This design of using macromolecules so large as building materials for living systems is ubiquitous in this world. This is true for living organism as small as bacteria to systems as large as humans. The research in biology and biochemistry should not be aimed at the understanding of the function of these living systems. It should be directed at the way they were generated and what purpose they serve that this expenditure of the large amount of energy in the form of organic compounds worth their existence.

, Also the search for more useful forms of lives that are energetically less costly is a profitable process here.

, Also research should be directed to the design of living systems that do not have chemical components. Living systems are composed of chemical compounds that can be easily transformed by the effect of a foreign chemical material. For example dopamine analogues can induce psychotic symptoms in the body. This dependence of the body normal conditions on a foreign chemical substance is clearly a serious defect in this living system. This dependence on chemical compounds is observed not only with this compound. Other chemical compounds can trigger amnesia in affected people making them lose their memory. In addition other chemical compounds can trigger in the human body cancerous transformations that are incurable and intractable.

, Obviously all these above mentioned examples should give an idea about how much the human body is vulnerable in its existence to the effect of a foreign offensive material. The current structure of the living system that is chemically based is obviously not a good choice for building a human that is disease resistant and can live longer than it is possible today. The other choice is to design robots that use electrical circuits that could be reproduced and exist by its self. This can be achieved for example through the use of biologically based neurons that do not rely on metabolic chemical reactions for their survival. These are only ideas that one can think about.

Decide what the uranium will be used for.,
Convert the uranium ore to a gas.,
Enrich the uranium.,
Convert the UF6 gas to uranium dioxide (UO2).",How to Enrich Uranium1," Most mined uranium contains only about 0.7 percent 235U, with most of the rest being the comparatively stable isotope 238U.What type of fission reaction the uranium will be used for determines what the level of 235U must be raised to for the uranium to be used effectively.


Uranium used in most nuclear power plants needs to be enriched to a level of 3 to 5 percent 235U.(A few nuclear reactors, such as the CANDU reactor in Canada and the Magnox reactor in the United Kingdom, are designed to use unenriched uranium.)
Uranium used for atomic bombs and warheads, in contrast, needs to be enriched to 90 percent 235U.;
, Most of the methods currently in existence for enriching uranium require the ore to be converted to a low-temperature gas. Fluorine gas is normally pumped into an ore conversion plant; the uranium oxide gas reacts with the fluorine to produce uranium hexafluoride (UF6). The gas is then acted on to separate out and gather the 235U isotope.

, The remaining sections of this article describe the various processes available to enrich uranium. Of these, gaseous diffusion and gas centrifuge are the two most common, but the laser isotope separation process is expected to replace them., Once enriched, the uranium needs to be converted to a stable solid form for its intended use.

Prepare for the procedure.,
Turn your kelp to ash.A Bunsen burner and cooking tray will work well here.,
Mix your kelp ash with purified water.Measure out 20 cubic centimeters of purified water in your graduated cylinder.,
Heat your solution until it boils.Put the beaker onto the Bunsen burner.,
Filter the ash from the water.Place a coffee filter on top of a second beaker.,

Store your iodine crystals in an airtight container.As soon as the solution has fully evaporated, remove the iodine crystals.",How to Extract Iodine1," In the Things You'll Need section you will find a list of necessary items and equipment. Most of this you will be able to find at a hardware store. Some items may require shopping online. Be sure to have everything together and set out before beginning. Be sure to wear your safety gear at all times.;
, Cook the batch of kelp on the cooking tray above the burner. Be careful to pile the kelp so that it stays on the tray while it is cooked. Ensure proper ventilation exists as the burning process may cause enough smoke to set off an alarm.

, Pour the water into a beaker to be boiled. Remove the kelp ash from the burner. Deposit the ash into the beaker and stir.


You will need about a dozen 50cm lengths of kelp for this step.
Pile your kelp so that air can flow into the pile. This will help with evaporation and speed up the process.

, Allow the solution to heat until it boils.

, Secure the filter with a rubber band. Pour the still-hot solution into the second beaker slowly. Allow time for the water to filter into the second beaker. When you are finished, remove the coffee filter and rubber band.

, Do this very slowly to avoid splashing. Because you are using a diluted solution, splashing should have minimal effects but should be avoided nonetheless.

, This is about 1.6 moles of hydrogen peroxide. Mix the solution briefly with a stirring rod. As the hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the iodine ions you will see the solution turn brown.


Be careful as you procure the 20 volume hydrogen peroxide. Many health and beauty stores that stock different volumes of hydrogen peroxide do so for dying hair. These hydrogen peroxide solutions may not be pure, and they may contain conditioners in addition to the hydrogen peroxide.

, Make sure the bottom is closed off tightly. Place the separating funnel over the sink to drain with running water later.

, Close the separating funnel with a rubber stopper in the upper opening. Shake the funnel and mixture for about 30 seconds. Replace the funnel. Remove the top stopper briefly to release any pressure. When the solution separates open the lower valve to drain off the water.

, Move the dish into a fume cupboard. This will limit your exposure to toxic fumes released during evaporation. As the solution evaporates, iodine crystals will form in the evaporating dish.


There is no need to heat the solution. The evaporation will take place properly at room temperature.

, Place the crystals in an airtight container promptly. If you wait too long, the iodine crystals will turn into gas (i.e., sublimate).

Gather the necessary materials.,
Wear proper protective equipment.,
Scrub the metal surface clean.,
Measure 5 parts water.,
Add 1 part muriatic acid to the water.,
Connect one alligator clip to each prong of the battery supply.,
Connect the copper to the positive terminal of the battery.,
Connect the metal piece to be plated to the negative terminal of the battery.,
Submerge both metals into the diluted muriatic acid bath.,
Remove metal piece when you are satisfied with the coat.",How to Electroplate Household Metals1," To setup this system, you will need water, muriatic acid, a 6 volt DC lantern battery, two alligator clips, a piece of copper metal, the metallic item you are trying to plate, and a container large enough for the metal you want to electroplate to be submerged. All of these items can be found at a local hardware or home improvement store.


The 6 volt battery has two prongs that make it easier to connect to the system, but you can use a battery of lower voltage.
Alligator clips are insulated electrical wires that have metal clips as the ends used for connecting circuits together.
The piece of copper is the source of copper that ions that will be used to plate your metal item.
Steel and nickel are two metals that can easily be plated with copper.;
, When electroplating metals, you are dealing with acids and other chemicals that you need to be protected from. Wear protective eye goggles, gloves, and a lab coat or clothes that you don’t mind ruining if something splashes.

, To get an even electroplated coat, you must first clean the surface of your metal object. Dirt and oils on the surface can prevent the donor metal from coating the surface. Start with a degreaser such as a detergent (dish soap) and then scrub the metal with an abrasive, acidic cleaner to ensure the surface is very clean.A mixture of vinegar and baking soda can be used to scrub the surface clean.

, To make the electroplating solution you will mix 5 parts of water with 1 part muriatic acid. Never add water directly to acid! Adding water to acid causes an exothermic reaction that can lead to the acid exploding and be very harmful. You want to fill a container large enough to submerge both pieces of metal that will be used for the electroplating process. Start with 5 cups of water and add more as necessary.Always maintain the ratio of 5:1. For example, if you need more than 5 cups, measure out 10 cups of water and add 2 cups of muriatic acid.

, To avoid injury, remember to always add the acid to the water. If you’ve measured out 5 cups of water, measure out 1 cup of acid and slowly add it to the water while stirring.Remember to keep the ratio of 5:1 water to acid.
The outside of the container will be warm because adding acid to water is exothermic (it creates heat).
Stir with a glass or plastic stirrer because the acid will attack a metal.

, The battery will serve to produce the current necessary for the electroplating process. Attach one clip to one prong and the second clip to the second prong of the battery.


At this stage, it doesn’t matter which clip is connected to which terminal, just that a separate clip is attached to each one.

, Using the alligator clip attached to the positive terminal of the battery, clip the other end to the metal piece of copper. If you clip the copper piece to the wrong terminal, the electroplating will not work.On a standard 9 volt battery, the positive terminal is the male side of the battery.

, Take the clip attached to the negative terminal of the battery and attach it to the metal you are trying to plate. Attach the clip in the least conspicuous place possible. If there is no out-of-the-way place to attach the clip, you will need to alter the location of the clip during the plating process so the piece of metal gets evenly coated.The negative side of a standard 9 volt battery is the female component.
If you attach the positive clip to the metal, the electroplating will not work. Double check that you have the correct terminals attached.

, Once everything is connected, you can place both metal pieces into the bath. The copper piece doesn’t have to be fully submerged, but the piece you are plating does.


Stir the solution during the plating process to get an even coat.
Keep the two metal pieces at least an inch apart from each other to avoid getting burn spots where the copper accumulates too quickly.

, Using this method makes it a little more difficult to get a thick coat of copper, but you will be able to get a thin, even coat. When are you are satisfied with the look of the metal you were trying to plate, you can remove the metal from the bath and place it on a towel to dry.


The plating can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
If you have more metals to plate, you can connect the next metal to the clip, place it in the acid bath, and stir to coat.

Reframe your thinking about inorganic chemistry.,
Read your syllabus and prepare a study plan.,
Designate regular time to this subject.,
Do lots of practice problems.,
Attend office hours.",How to Excel in Inorganic Chemistry," Being a branch of chemistry, inorganic chemistry requires that you understand the basic structure of an atom and the properties that arise from this structure. Knowing atomic structure and the way in which atoms can interact with each other is essential to excelling in inorganic chemistry.Have a firm knowledge and understanding of atomic mass, electron configuration, atomic number, protons, neutrons, electrons, etc.;
, This may seem a little crazy, but memorizing the periodic table will help you have a fundamental understanding of the elements, how they’re arranged, and how they interact with each other. Knowing the group and period of an element gives you information about its structure, electron shells, valence electrons, and reactivity with other elements.The columns of the periodic table are called “groups” while the rows are called “periods.”
The table is split up into metals and non-metals.Knowing the chemical symbol of an element will also help you when working with inorganic equations.

, The types of bonds that form between elements affect how a compound will react with other compounds. There are two main types of chemical bonding: ionic and covalent. Ionic bonds form when an electron is transferred from one atom to another while covalent bonds result from two atoms sharing an electron.There are also attractive forces that allow for weak bonding between molecules called hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.
Bonding specifically between metal ions is referred to as metallic bonding.

, Redox reactions, combustion, acid-base reactions, and decomposition are all types of reactions that you will see when working with inorganic chemistry. A good way to learn them is to understand the context in which these reactions are written.


In books, many reactions are written for the same element to illustrate its chemical properties. Once you understand the basic concept, the rest should fall into place.
Don't forget to balance your reactions., A coordination compound forms when a molecule has a metal center and is bound to a ligand such as another atom, ion, or molecule that donates an electron to the metal. These compounds have properties different from that of the properties of each individual atom that comprises it.The ligand and the complex geometries that result in these complexes are an important aspect of inorganic chemistry that must be mastered.

, Stop thinking that you have to study only because you have to pass an exam or give a presentation. Learning this subject will undoubtedly help you in Organic and Physical Chemistry too as many concepts taught here are used in these fields as well.


Find the fun in inorganic chemistry. Try to apply some of the concepts to the real world and solve real problems with what you’re learning., At the beginning of the course, read through the syllabus and figure out how much time you think you will need to study inorganic chemistry each week. Read the corresponding chapters of the textbook before class.Write up a study plan that designates certain topics to specific days of the week for study. Spreading out the studying over time will help you avoid cramming for the exam later., The key to learning any subject is to study it regularly. Set aside an hour each day or maybe two hours every other day to focus specifically on inorganic chemistry. Read your textbook, answer practice problems, and use online resources to increase your understanding of the subject.


Choose a time of day where you are most alert. If inorganic chemistry is the subject you struggle with the most, study it first so you are not too tired by other subjects., Much of chemistry involves chemical reactions and determining how certain compounds will react with each other. The best way to master this subject is to do lots of practice problems of all types of reactions until you have a firm understanding of each one.Redo your homework assignments, answer questions in the back of the book, and seek out more problems online.

, Your professor will have office hours at least once a week. Go to them and ask any questions you may have about the subject or the homework assignments. Office hours are specifically for you to have one-on-one time with your professor to discuss concepts that you didn’t fully understand during the lecture. Take advantage of them!


If your professor’s office hours conflict with another one of your courses, ask your professor about scheduling another time to meet up and ask questions.

Find a copy of the periodic table.,
Find the element you're studying.,
Look for the atomic number.,
Confirm based on nearby elements.,
Understand atomic number.,
Find the atomic weight.,
Understand atomic mass.,
Round to the mass number.,
Calculate the number of neutrons.,
Understand isotopes.",How to Find Atomic Number," We've got one here if you don't have one handy. Every single element has a different atomic number, so there are no quick rules to learn. It's either find a copy of the periodic table, or memorize one.


Most chemistry textbooks have a periodic table printed on the inside cover.;
, Most periodic tables include the full name of the elements, as well as the chemical symbol (such as Hg for Mercury). If you're having trouble finding it, search online for ""chemical symbol"" followed by the name of the element.

, The atomic number is usually in the top left or top right corner of the element's box, but it could be in a different spot. This is always a whole number.


If the number includes a decimal point, you're probably looking at atomic mass instead.

, The periodic table is arranged in order of atomic number. If your element's atomic number is ""33,"" the element to the left should be ""32"" and the element to the right should have a ""34."" If this pattern holds true, you have definitely found the atomic number.


You may see gaps after elements 56 (Barium) and 88 (Radium). There's no actual gap; the elements with those atomic numbers are located in two rows below the rest of the chart. They are only separated like this to fit the periodic table in a more narrow shape.

, An element's atomic number has a simple definition: the number of protons in one atom of that element.This is the fundamental definition of an element. The number of protons determines the total electric charge of the nucleus, which determines how many electrons the atom can support. Because electrons are responsible for almost all chemical interactions, the atomic number indirectly sets almost all of the element's physical and chemical properties.


To put it another way, every atom with eight protons is an oxygen atom. Two oxygen atoms might have different numbers of neutrons or (if one is an ion) different numbers of electrons, but they will always have eight protons each.

, The atomic weight is typically printed below the element name on the periodic table, usually to two or three decimal places. This is the average mass of one atom of the element, weighted to what you would expect to find in nature. This number is in ""atomic mass units"" (AMU).


Some scientists prefer the term ""relative atomic mass"" instead of atomic weight., Atomic mass is a closely related concept to atomic weight. The only difference is, you're looking at a specific atom instead of the average of a sample.A gram of iron contains many atoms with slightly different masses, so you look up the ""relative weight"" to find the average. If you pick out a single iron atom, you don't care about the average — you only care about the exact mass of that specific atom.


In practice, chemistry problems dealing with single atoms usually tell you the atomic mass. Just understand this concept so you aren't surprised when it's different than atomic weight.

, The mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons in one atom of an element. This is easy to find: just take the atomic weight printed on the periodic table, and round to the nearest whole number.This works because neutrons and protons are both very close to 1 AMU, and electrons are very close to 0 AMU. The atomic weight uses precise measurements to get the decimal value, but we're only interested in the whole numbers that tell us the number of protons and neutrons.
Remember, if you use the atomic weight, you're getting an average for a typical sample. A bromine sample has an average mass number of 80, but as it turns out, a single bromine atom almost always has a mass number of 79 or 81., Now you know that atomic number = number of protons, and mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons. To find the number of neutrons in an element, subtract the atomic number from the mass number. Here are a couple example:


A single helium (He) atom has a mass number of 4 and an atomic number of 2. It must have 4 - 2 = 2 neutrons.
A sample of silver (Ag) has an average mass number of 108 (based on the periodic table) and an atomic number of 47. On average, each silver atom in the sample has 108 - 47 = 61 neutrons.

, An isotope is a specific form of an element, with a certain number of neutrons. If a chemistry problem mentions ""boron-10"" or ""10B,"" it's talking about boron elements with a mass number of 10.Use this mass number instead of the values for ""typical"" boron.


Isotopes never change the atomic number. Every isotope of an element has the same number of protons.

Draw finger-like shapes for the endoplasmic reticulum.,
Draw a set of dumbbell-like shapes for the Golgi body.,
Draw two small rectangles at right angles to represent centrioles.,
Draw another small circle for the lysosome.,
Add dots inside the cell but outside the other organelles to show ribosomes.",How to Draw an Animal Cell," The cell membrane of an animal cell is not a perfect circle. You can make the circle misshapen or oblong. The important part is that it does not have any sharp edges.Also know that the membrane is not a rigid cell wall like in animal cells. Cell membranes do allow molecules to pass in and out of animal cells.Make the circle large enough to decipher all the organelles you draw inside.;
, Detailed animal cell models may also include a pinocytic vesicle on the cell membrane. This will appear as a small bulbous shape. It should push into the outer circle of the cell membrane without breaking it.In pinocytosis the cell membrane wraps around extracellular fluids (those outside the cell). It then pulls the fluid into the cell for digestion or absorption.This is why you draw the vesicle as a bulbous shape that the membrane has wrapped around.

, The nucleus is one of the larger structures of the cell. Form the nucleus by drawing two circles—a larger circle that takes up around 10% of the cell with a slightly smaller circle inside it.The nucleus of an animal cell has pores in it called nuclear pores.To represent these pores, erase three or four small sections of each circle. Then connect the outer lines to the inner lines. The finished product will resemble curved cylinders that don’t quite touch.This outer shell of the nuclear membrane is also called the nuclear envelope.To make a highly detailed cell model, put several dots on the outside of the nuclear membrane to represent ribosomes that attach to the membrane., The nucleolus is at the center of the nucleus and makes ribosomal sub-units that combine elsewhere in the cell.Represent the nucleolus with a small shaded circle., Most of the rest of the nucleus interior should appear as one big squiggle.This squiggle represents the chromatin material such as DNA and proteins., The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. Draw them by making two or three large, rod-shaped ovals in the cell but outside the nucleus.Each mitochondrion (singular) should contain an enclosed shape with many ridges and switchback lines.This shape represents the mitochondrial cristae or inner folds of the organelle’s membrane that provide more surface area to carry out processes.Leave a gap between the oval of the outer membrane and the inner membrane., Starting at one edge of the nuclear membrane, draw a large shape that extends out of the membrane with several finger-like shapes pointing to each side before reconnecting to the nucleus.This entire shape is the endoplasmic reticulum. The shape should be fairly large because the endoplasmic reticulum can take up as much as 10% of the volume of the entire cell.Animal cells have both a smooth and a rough endoplasmic reticulum. To make the rough endoplasmic reticulum, place dots on the outside edge of the finger-like shapes on one side of the endoplasmic reticulum. These dots represent ribosomes., To make the Golgi body (or Golgi apparatus), draw a set of three dumbbell-type shapes that are cylindrical at the center and bulbous at the ends.Each dumbbell should successively increase in size as they get farther from the nucleus and closer to the cell membrane.The Golgi body packages and sends complex molecules around and out of the cell. It does this via vesicles that you can represent around the Golgi body with a few small circles.Capitalize Golgi since it is the name of the discovering biologist.

, Centrioles help assist with cell division. They are close to but separate from the nucleus.Form the centrioles by drawing two small rectangles perpendicular to each other near the nucleus.The centrioles are paired organelles, which is why you draw two of the rectangles together., The lysosome is like the scrapyard of the cell that breaks down unneeded material to reuse.Represent the lysosome with a small circle at the edge of the cell. Add many small dots in the lysosome to show the digestive enzymes inside, which is called a hydrolytic enzyme mixture.You can place the lysosome near the Golgi apparatus since the organelles are often budded from the Golgi body., Ribosomes also float around in the cytosol, which is the cellular fluid inside the membrane but outside of all the organelles. Show the extra ribosomes in the cytosol by making several more dots inside the cell.If you have color-coordinated your drawing, make the ribosomes in the cell, attached to the nuclear membrane, and attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum all the same color.
Cytosol and cytoplasm are often used interchangeably for the fluid in the cell.Though the fluid in the nucleus is nucleoplasm."

Pump UF6 through pipelines.

,
Force the gas through a porous filter or membrane.,
Repeat the diffusion process until enough 235U is collected.,
Condense the UF6 gas into liquid form.",How to Enrich Uranium2,", Because the 235U isotope is lighter than the 238U isotope, UF6 containing the lighter isotope will diffuse through the membrane faster than the heavier isotope.

, The repeated diffusion is called a cascade. It may take as many as 1,400 passes through porous membranes to get enough 235U to enrich the uranium sufficiently., Once the gas is sufficiently enriched, it is condensed into a liquid and then stored in containers, where it cools and solidifies for transport to be made into fuel pellets.


Because of the number of passes required, this process is energy-intensive and is being phased out. In the United States, only one gaseous diffusion enrichment plant remains, located in Paducah, Kentucky."
"
Assemble a number of high-speed rotating cylinders.,
Pipe the UF6 gas into the centrifuges.,
Extract the separated gases.

,
Reprocess the separated gases in separate centrifuges.",How to Enrich Uranium3," These cylinders are the centrifuges. The centrifuges are assembled in both series and parallel layouts.

, The centrifuges use centripetal acceleration to send the heavier 238U-bearing gas to the cylinder wall and the lighter 235U-bearing gas to the center.

,, The 235U-rich gases are sent to a centrifuge where still more 235U is extracted, while the 235U-depleted gas goes to a different centrifuge to extract still more of the remaining 235U. This enables the centrifuge process to extract much more 235U than the gaseous diffusion process can.The gas centrifuge process was first developed in the 1940s, but was not brought into significant use until the 1960s, when its lower energy requirements for producing enriched uranium became important.At present, a gas centrifuge processing plant exists in the United States in Eunice, New Mexico.In contrast, Russia currently has four such plants, Japan and China have two each, while the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Germany each have one."
"
Build a series of stationary narrow cylinders.

,
Inject UF6 gas into the cylinders at high speed.",How to Enrich Uranium4,", The gas is blown into the cylinders in such a way that it is induced to spin in cyclonic fashion, producing the same kind of separation between 235U and 238U as is achieved in a rotating centrifuge.


One method being developed in South Africa injects the gas into the cylinder on a tangent. It is presently being tested with light isotopes such as those in silicon."
"
Liquefy the UF6 gas under pressure.

,
Construct a pair of concentric pipes.,
Surround the pipes with a jacket of liquid water.,
Pump the liquid UF6 between the pipes.

,
Heat the inner pipe with steam.",How to Enrich Uranium5,", The pipes should be fairly tall, with taller pipes enabling more separation of the 235U and 238U isotopes.

, This will cool the outer pipe.

,, The heat will create a convection current in the UF6 that will draw the lighter 235U isotope toward the hotter inner pipe and push the heavier 238U isotope toward the colder outer pipe.


This process was investigated in 1940 as part of the Manhattan Project, but was abandoned while still in an early stage of development when the more efficient gaseous diffusion process was developed."
"
Ionize the UF6 gas.

,
Pass the gas through a strong magnetic field.

,
Separate the ionized uranium isotopes by the trails they leave when passing through the magnetic field.",How to Enrich Uranium6,",, Ions of 235U leave trails that curve differently than those of 238U. These ions can be isolated to enrich uranium.


This method was used to process uranium for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 and was also the enrichment method Iraq used in its nuclear weapons program of 1992. It requires 10 times more energy than gaseous diffusion, making it impractical for large-scale enrichment programs."
"
Tune a laser to a specific color.,
Shine the laser light on the uranium.,
Extract the uranium atoms with excited electrons.",How to Enrich Uranium7," The laser light needs to be entirely of a specific wavelength (monochromatic). This wavelength will target only 235U atoms, while leaving the 238U atoms untouched.

, Unlike the other uranium enrichment processes, you don’t have to use uranium hexafluoride gas, although most of the laser processes do. You can also use an alloy of uranium and iron as the uranium source, which the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) process does.

, These will be atoms of 235U.

Prepare your filter and storage containers.Place a pair of coffee filters on top of a different beaker.,
Filter your mixture through coffee filters.Pour the solution through the filter into the beaker.,
Dry your crystals for a very brief time.Remove the filter from the beaker.,
Store your iodine crystals in a small airtight container.As soon as you are satisfied that your crystals are dry, move them to an airtight, glass container.",How to Extract Iodine2," Look at the Things You'll Need section to see what you'll need for the procedure. You will find most of these items at your local hardware store. However, you may need to do some online shopping to complete the list. Be sure to have everything together and set out before beginning. Don't forget to wear your safety gear at all times.

, These tinctures have only a small amount of iodine. Multiple bottles are necessary for significant results. Many tinctures are only about 2% iodine.


Do not use povidone iodine for this extraction. Extracting iodine from povidone iodine requires a different procedure than discussed in this method.

, Use purified water for this step. The water will have minimal effect on the tincture so you do not need to be careful about pouring at this point. Just avoid splashing.


Distilled water is a type of purified water. Distilled water can be used as well.

, Pour the mixture slowly. Fumes will begin forming while mixing. Do not inhale the fumes as they are toxic.


Muriatic acid found in hardware stores is about 30% hydrochloric acid. This will work for this method of iodine extraction.

, You need about 10 milliliters of bleach per bottle of tincture. Slowly pour the bleach into the solution. Fumes will begin to form as you pour. Be careful not to inhale the fumes.


You will see iodine crystals begin forming within the solution and settling on the bottom. Wait until there are few to no new crystals forming before filtering.

, Secure them using a rubber band. Use two coffee filters instead of only one here. The acids will act on the filters, and a single filter may break.

, Pour slowly to allow the solution to drain through. When you get to the bottom, solid iodine crystals may remain in the beaker. Pour purified water into the beaker, swirl, and filter until all crystals are in the filter.

, Scrape the crystals into an evaporation dish to allow them to dry. Let them dry only as long as necessary. The iodine crystals will turn into gas (i.e., sublimate) if left out.

, Something like a test tube will work well. Use something small to reduce the amount of potential sublimation.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Combine and heat equal parts vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.,
Soak half of the copper scrubbing pad in the vinegar-peroxide solution.,
Attach one end of each alligator clip to the terminals of the battery.,
Clean the metal to be electroplated.,
Connect the positive alligator clip to the copper scrub.,
Connect the negative alligator clip to the to-be-plated metal.,
Submerge the metals in the blue copper solution.,
Remove the metal when the coat is even.",How to Electroplate Household Metals2," To electroplate with this method, you will need a piece of copper, the metal to be plated, vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, alligator clips, a 6 volt lantern battery, a glass/plastic container, and gloves. All of these items can be purchased at a local hardware or home improvement store.


A cheap and easy way to obtain 100% copper is to use a copper scrubbing sponge that can be found in the cleaning supplies of the supermarket.
Alligator clips are electrical wires that have metal clips on each end used for connecting circuits.
You can use a battery with a voltage as low as 1.5 volts if you don’t have a lantern battery.
Use a container large enough to submerge the metal that you’re trying to plate.

, You will need enough of this solution to submerge your to-be-plated metal. To make four cups of solution, add two cups of vinegar to two cups of hydrogen peroxide.Combining vinegar and hydrogen peroxide makes peracetic acid which must be handled with caution., The solution will turn blue, indicating that the scrub has dissolved into the solution. You now have a copper ion solution that can be used for electroplating.Wear gloves from this step on because the copper solution is toxic.
Soak the copper until the solution turns a light blue. It is better for the solution to be of weak concentration, so remove the copper scrub before the solution gets too dark.

, The battery provides the current necessary to transport the metals from the donor to the recipient. Connect one alligator clip to the positive terminal of the battery and another alligator clip to the negative terminal.


At this stage, it doesn’t matter which clip is connected to which terminal, as long as there is a separate clip attached to each one.

, Before starting the electroplating method, you must ensure that the metal is clean so the new metal atoms can form a solid bond to the recipient metal.Wear gloves to both protect your hands and keep the metal surface clean. It is essential to do this step well for an even electroplate.


Clean the grease with a mild detergent such as dish soap.
Scrub the metal surface with an acidic, abrasive cleaner. Vinegar works well to clean copper.Rinse the surface well to remove any residue and pat dry with a paper towel.
From this point on, handle the metal only with gloves on to avoid contaminating the surface.

, Take the other half of the copper scrub that wasn’t used to make the solution. Attach the alligator clip connected to the positive terminal of the battery and connect it to the copper scrub. If you attach it to the negative terminal, the electroplating won’t work., The other clip should be connected to the negative terminal of the battery. Attach this clip to the metal that you are plating. Try to attach it in a place that is inconspicuous.


You may need to move the clip during the plating process, so you get an even coat.
If you attach the metal to be plated to the positive terminal, the electroplating won’t work. Simply switch the clips and the process will work.

, Once both metals have been connected, submerge them in the blue copper solution you already made. Because they are connected to the battery, a current is flowing through the circuit. Atoms of copper will transfer from the copper metal and bond with the metal you are plating to form a coat.To avoid burn spots (spots where the copper accumulates too quickly), keep the two metals at least one inch apart and keep the solution in constant motion.

, When you are satisfied with the look of the plating on your metal, remove it from the solution. You can take it out of the solution and check the coat, then replace it in the solution without disrupting the process.


Rinse the metal and set on a towel to dry.

Write the atomic symbol for each atom.,
Determine the degree of the bond between the two atoms.,
Add your bonds to the drawing.,
Draw unbound electrons.",How to Draw Lewis Dot Structures1," Write the two atomic symbols side by side. These symbols will represent the atoms present in the covalent bond. Be sure to leave enough space between the atoms to draw your electrons and bonds.Covalent bonds generally occur between two nonmetals.;
, Atoms can be held together by a single, double, or triple bond. Generally, this will be dictated by each atom’s desire to reach a full valence shell with eight electrons (or in the case of hydrogen, two electrons). To find out how many electrons each atom will have, multiply the bond degree by two (each bond involves two electrons) and then add the number of unshared electrons., Each bond is represented with a line between the two atoms. For a single bond, you would simply draw one line from the first atom to the second. For a double or triple bond, you would draw two or three lines respectively.For example, N2 (nitrogen gas) has a triple bond connecting the two nitrogen atoms. So, its bond will be notated in a Lewis diagram as three parallel lines connecting the two N atoms.

, Some of the valence electrons in one or both of the atoms may not be involved in a bond. When this happens, you should represent each remaining electron with a dot around it’s respective atom. In most cases, neither atom should have more than eight electrons bound to it. You can check your work by counting each dot as one electron and each line as two electrons.For example, O2 (oxygen gas) has two parallel lines connecting the atoms, with two pairs of dots on each atom.

"
"
Determine which atom is your central atom.,
Consider the valence electrons of the central atom.,
Write the symbol of your central atom.,
Show the electron geometry of the central atom.,
Add remaining atoms.,
Fill in remaining electrons.",How to Draw Lewis Dot Structures2," This atom is usually least electronegative. As such, it is most capable of forming bonds with many other atoms. The term ‘central atom’ is used because all the other atoms in the molecule are bonded to this particular atom (but not necessarily to each other).Atoms like phosphorus and carbon are often central atoms.
In some more complex molecules, you may have multiple central atoms.

, As a general (but not all-exclusive) rule, atoms like to be surrounded by eight valence electrons (this is known as the octet rule). When the central atoms bonds to the other atoms, the most stable configuration is one that will satisfy the octet rule (in most cases). This can help you determine the number of bonds that will be between the central atom and the other atoms because each bond represents two electrons.Some large atoms such as phosphorus can break the octet rule.
For example, carbon dioxide (CO2) has two oxygens covalently double-bonded to the central atom, carbon. This allows the octet rule to be satisfied for all three atoms.
Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) breaks the octet rule by having five bonding pairs around the central atom. This molecule has five chlorine atoms covalently single-bonded to the central atom, phosphorus. The octet rule is satisfied for each of the five chlorine atoms, but it is exceeded for the phosphorus atom.

, With larger covalent molecules, it is best to start the drawing with the central atom. Resist the urge to write all of the atomic symbols at the same time. Leave plenty of room around the central atom to place your other symbols after you have determined their place., For each unshared electron pair, draw two small dots right next to each other around the central atom. For each single bond, draw a line going away from the atom. For double and triple bonds, instead of one line, draw two or three, respectively. This maps out where the other molecules can bond to the central atom., Each remaining atom in the molecule will attach to the one of the bonds coming from the central atom. Write the symbol for each of these atoms at the end of one of the bonds you placed around the central atom. This indicates that electrons are being shared between that atom and the central atom., Count each bond as two electrons (double and triple bonds as 4 and 6 electrons, respectively). Then add electron pairs around each atom until the octet rule is satisfied for that atom. You can check your work on each atom by counting each dot as one electron and each bond as two electrons. The sum should be eight.Of course, exceptions include atoms that exceed the octet rule and hydrogen, which only has zero or two valence electrons at any given time.
When a hydrogen molecule is covalently bonded to another atom, it will have no other unshared electrons surrounding it.

"
"
Write the atomic symbol.,
Fill in the electrons.,
Designate the charge of the ion.",How to Draw Lewis Dot Structures3," The atomic symbol for an ion will the be the same as the atomic symbol for the atom that formed it. Leave enough space on the paper around the symbol to be able to add electrons and brackets later. In some cases, ions are polyatomic (more than one atom) molecules and are designated by writing the atomic symbol for all atoms in the molecule.To create the symbol for polyatomic ions (such as NO3- or SO42-), follow the instructions for “Creating Lewis Structures for Large Covalent Molecules” in the above method.

, Generally, atoms are neutral and do not carry a positive or negative charge. However, when an atom loses or gains electrons, the balance of positive and negative charge in the atom is altered. Then the atom becomes a charged particle known as an ion. On you Lewis structure, add any extra electrons and remove any electrons that were given up.When drawing the electrons, keep the octet rule in mind.
When electrons are lost, a positive ion (known as a cation) is formed. For example, lithium loses its one and only valence electron during ionization. Its Lewis structure would just be ‘Li’ with no dots around it.
When electrons are gained, a negative ion (known as an anion) is formed. Chlorine gains one electron during ionization, giving it a full shell of eight electrons. Its Lewis structure would be ‘Cl’ with four pairs of dots around it.

, Counting dots on every atom would be a tedious way of determining if that atom had a charge. To make the structures easier to read, you need to show that your structure is an ion with some charge. To show this, draw brackets around the atomic (or polyatomic) symbol. Then, write the charge outside the brackets in the upper right corner.For example, the magnesium ion would have have an empty outer shell, and would be notated as 2+.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Remove the eraser and sharpen both ends of each pencil.,

Attach the battery clip to the 9-volt battery.,
Gather the necessary materials.,
Set up the electrolysis system.,
Fill the container with warm water.,
Position the test tubes in the container.,
Slide the free end of one pencil into each tube.,
Attach the battery clip to the battery.",How to Electrolyse Water," Separating hydrogen and oxygen is done through the simple process of electrolysis. To do this experiment, you will need a 9-volt battery, a battery clip with alligator clamps attached to the end of each wire, two pencils, a small glass, water, a small piece of cardboard, and baking soda or salt.Most of these items can easily be found around the home.
Battery clips with end-attached alligator clamps can be found at electronics stores or superstores.;
, Pencils have graphite inside of them and these will serve as the electrodes for the experiment. Electrodes will conduct the electricity into the water and cause the molecules to break apart.


Sharpen the ends so that the graphite is well-exposed on both ends of each pencil.

, By adding salt or baking soda to the water, you increase the conduction of electricity through the water. Add a cup of warm water to your glass and a tablespoon of salt or baking soda.Stir until the powder is fully dissolved.
If you add salt, the reaction with be different than just electrolyzing pure water. As the molecules of water break apart, hydrogen gas will be formed, and oxygen will combine with the sodium ions to form hydroxyl ions and the chlorine in the salt will form a chlorine gas.

, Make holes in the cardboard about ½ inch apart by pushing the pencils through. Position them so that the cardboard is about halfway down the pencils. If the pencils are not secure, tape them to the cardboard.Cut the cardboard so that it hangs over the top of the container. Position it on top of the container so that the pencils dangle just above the bottom.
Make sure the pencils are not touching each other.

, At this point, you should have the two pencils sticking out of the glass with the bottoms submerged in the water. Attach one alligator clamp from the battery clip to the graphite portion of each pencil.It doesn’t matter which clamp you attach to which pencil.

, After you have everything set up and ready to go, you can connect the electricity. Attaching the clip will cause a current to run through your system. Once the battery is attached, you will see bubbles forming at the ends of the pencils submerged in the water.The bubbles produced are bubbles of hydrogen and chlorine gas. The oxygen combines with the sodium to form hydroxyl ions and the remaining chlorine forms a gas.

, It is one thing to just show electrolysis working, but you may also want to collect the hydrogen gas produced. In order to collect the gases, you will use a similar set up to the one in the first part, but you will also need two test plastic test tubes and rubber bands/tape to hold them in place. You’ll need a container larger than a glass for this; a small plastic food container works really well.You’ll also need the same supplies as above: two pencils, 9-volt battery, battery clip with alligator clamps, and water.

, This setup will be slightly different because both of the pencils will be completely submerged in the container. Sharpen both ends of each pencil so that the pencil is shorter than the length of the test tube. Attach an alligator clamp to one end of each pencil. Tape the alligator clamps to the bottom of the container so that the pencils stick straight up into the air.Position the pencils in the clamp so that the tips don’t touch the bottom of the container.

, If you want pure hydrogen and oxygen, do not add salt to the mixture. If you are just interested in collecting hydrogen gas, you can add salt, but know that the reaction will produce hydrogen and chlorine gas from the salt.The oxygen atoms will combine with the sodium and available hydrogen ions to form sodium hydroxide.

, Place the test tubes upside down in the container and tilt them so that they fill completely with the solution. Once they are completely full, attach them to the side of the container with rubber bands or tape.It’s very important that no bubbles are present in the test tubes.

, At this point one end of the pencil has a clamp on it and the other is free. Tilt the test tube so that you can slide one pencil into the tube. Repeat this with the second test tube and pencil. If the pencil is touching the end of the test tube, sharpen it down to make it shorter.Remember the test tube needs to be completely full of water with no bubbles anywhere.

, When the whole setup has been completed, attach the battery clip to send current running through the system. The pencil that is connected to the negative side of the battery will produce hydrogen, while the pencil connected to the positive side will produce oxygen.As the gas is produced, the water in the tube will be displaced and you will have a tube of pure hydrogen and chlorine gas or oxygen.

Request the test be done at your next appointment. Alternatively, you can donate blood to an organization (e.g. Red Cross) and they will test your blood type and inform you of the results. There are four possibilities:A
B
AB
O;
, An alternative to having professionals test your blood type is to do it yourself. You can order blood type testing kits. With these kits, you will expose your blood to a series of antibodies, and draw results by analyzing which antibodies affect your blood., Knowing each parent’s blood type allows you to find which genes may be present in each parent. Different combinations of genes can express the same blood type because some genes are dominant and some are recessive. For example:The blood type O means that the parent has two O alleles. This is because O is recessive and only expressed when both alleles match.
The blood type A means that the parent either has two A alleles or one A and one O. This is because A is dominant and will be expressed any time it is present.
The blood type B means that the parent either has two B alleles or one B and one O. This is because B is dominant and will be expressed any time it is present.
The blood type AB requires one A allele and one B allele. Both are dominant and expressed equally.

, Testing for the most prominent blood antigens (A and B) will determine whether you are A, B, AB, or O. However, the Rh factor is another important antigen that can affect how your blood reacts to a transfusion and can be vital for pregnant women. Testing for the Rh factor is similar to testing for the other antigens. The blood is exposed to antibodies, if it reacts, you are Rh positive. If it does not react, you are Rh negative. While this factor is important for medical purposes, it is not needed for simple blood typing predictions. Considering the Rh factor makes the prediction more complicated as it doubles the number of possible blood types:A+

A-

B+

B-

AB+

AB-

O+

O-


, A Punnett square is used to find genotype. Start making the square by writing all of the possible alleles of the father down a column on the left hand side. This accounts for the first half of the baby’s genetics.For example, if the father has the blood type “A,” you would need to list allele combinations “A,A” and “A,O.” That would mean you have four alleles going down the leftmost column (three A’s and one O).

, Next, write the mother’s possible alleles across the top row. These alleles account for the other half of the baby’s genetics. This will allow you to predict which alleles the baby could inherit from the mother and the father.For instance, if the mother had the blood type “AB,” there is only one allele combination that could produce it. That means you would write two alleles in the first row (one A and one B).
A Punnett square can be used to determine other traits as well. For example, you can use a Punnett square to predict your baby’s eye color.

, The number of rows in a Punnett square is set by the number of possible alleles on the father’s end. This will vary depending on the father’s blood type. If the father has a homozygous blood type, there will be fewer rows. If his blood type could be heterozygous, there will be more rows.Homozygous means that the father carries only one type of allele (O,O). Heterozygous means that the father carries two different alleles (A,O).

, Just as the number of rows depends on the number of the father’s alleles, the number of columns depends on the mother’s alleles. You should draw a separate column for each allele that the mother could possess. Any allele she has could be passed down to the baby., Each square in the Punnett square represents a blood type that the baby could have. Within each square, write the allele from the mother and the allele from the father that correspond to the row and column of that square.For example, you would fill in the first square with the “A” allele from the father and the “A” allele from the mother.

, The number of boxes present will tell you how many possible gene combinations could be passed down to the baby. This is important for determining the chances of any one blood type being passed down. Simply count the boxes to determine the number of possibilities.In the case of a parent with type “A” and a parent with type “AB,” there will be eight boxes.

, Once you have counted the number of squares, count the number of each blood type. There are likely duplicates in some of the squares. The duplicates mean that there is a higher chance for that blood type emerging in the baby.For example, you might have eight squares total with three AA’s, three AB’s, one AO, and one BO.

, To do this calculation, you only need to take the number of squares occupied by a certain blood type and divide it by the total number of squares. Playing off of the example above, the chances of each blood type would be:AA = ⅜ = 37.5% chance
AB = ⅜ = 37.5% chance
AO = ⅛ = 12.5% chance
BO = ⅛ = 12.5% chance

Calculate the molar mass of the reactant.,
Convert grams of a substance to moles using molar mass.",How to Do Stoichiometry," Using the chemical equation you can identify the atoms of each element in the reaction. Because a chemical reaction can never create or destroy new matter, a given equation is unbalanced if the number (and types) of atoms on each side of the equation don't perfectly match.


Don’t forget to multiply through by a coefficient or subscript if one is present.
For example, H2SO4 + Fe ---> Fe2(SO4)3 + H2

On the reactant (left) side of the equation there are 2 H, 1 S, 4 O, and 1 Fe.
On the product (right) side of the equation there are 2H, 3 S, 12 O, and 2 Fe.;
, Identify the lowest common factor between all elements that aren’t oxygen and hydrogen to get equal numbers of atoms on both sides.


For example, the lowest common factor between 2 and 1 is 2 for Fe. Add a 2 in front of the Fe on the left side to balance it.
The lowest common factor between 3 and 1 is 3 for S. Add a 3 in front of H2SO4 to balance the left and right sides.
At this stage, our equation looks like this: 3 H2SO4 + 2 Fe ---> Fe2(SO4)3 + H2


, Hydrogen and oxygen atoms are balanced last because they commonly appear in multiple molecules on each side of the equation. At this stage in balancing the equation, don’t forget to recount the atoms if you’ve added coefficients to molecules.


In our example, we added a 3 in front of H2SO4 and now have 6 hydrogens on the left and only 2 on the right side of the equation. We also have 12 oxygen on the left and 12 oxygen on the right, so it is balanced.
We can balance hydrogens by adding a 3 in front of H2.
Our final balanced equation is 3 H2SO4 + 2 Fe ---> Fe2(SO4)3 + 3 H2.

, Once you've finished, it's smart to go back and check the equation for balance. This can be done by again adding up all of the atoms on either side of the equation to make sure they are equal on both sides.


Let's check our equation, 3 H2SO4 + 2 Fe ---> Fe2(SO4)3 + 3 H2, for balance.
On the left side of the arrow, there are 6 H, 3 S, 12 O, and 2 Fe.
On the right side of the arrow, there are 2 Fe, 3 S, 12 O, and 6 H.
The left and the right sides of the equation match, therefore, it is now balanced.

, The molar mass is the amount in grams (g) of one mole of a compound.It allows you to easily convert between grams and moles of a substance.To calculate the molar mass you need to identify how many molecules of an element are in the compound and the atomic mass of each element in the compound.


Define the number of atoms of each element in a compound. For example, glucose is C6H12O6, there are 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.
Identify the atomic mass in grams per mol (g/mol) of each atom. The atomic masses of the elements in glucose are: carbon, 12.0107 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 g/mol.
Multiply each elements atomic mass by the number of atoms present in the compound. Carbon: 12.0107 x 6 = 72.0642 g/mol; Hydrogen: 1.007 x 12 = 12.084 g/mol; Oxygen: 15.9994 x 6 = 95.9964 g/mol.
Adding these products together yields the molar mass of the compound. 72.0642 + 12.084 + 95.9964 = 180.1446 g/mol. 180.14 grams is the mass of one mole of glucose.

, Using the molar mass as a conversion factor, you can calculate the number of moles present in the stated number of grams of the species. Divide the known amount of grams (g) by the molar mass (g/mol).,An easy way to check that you’ve done the correct math is to make sure the units cancel out leaving only moles.


For example: How many moles are in 8.2 grams of hydrogen chloride (HCl)?
The atomic mass of H is 1.0007 and Cl is 35.453 making the molar mass of the compound 1.007 + 35.453 = 36.46 g/mol.
Dividing the number of grams of the substance by the molar mass yields: 8.2 g / (36.46 g/mol) = 0.225 moles of HCl.

, In order to determine the yield of a product in a given reaction you need to determine the molar ratio. The molar ratio tells you the ratio in which substances react with each other and is given by the coefficient of the species in the balanced1 reaction.For example, what is the molar ratio of KClO3 to O2 in the reaction 2 KClO3 ---> 2 KCl + 3 O2.
First, check to see the equation is balanced. Never forget this step or your ratios will be wrong. In this case there are equal amounts of each element on both sides of the reaction so it is balanced.
The ratio of KClO3 to O2 is 2/3. It doesn’t matter which number goes on top or on bottom as long as you keep the same compounds on the top and bottom throughout the rest of the problem., To calculate the number of moles of a species produced or required for a reaction, you will use the molar ratio.Problems will usually ask you to determine the number of moles required or the number of moles produced in a reaction given a certain number of grams of reactant.


For example, given the reaction N2 + 3 H2 ---> 2 NH3 how many moles of NH3 will be produced given 3.00 grams of N2 reacting with sufficient H2?
In this example, sufficient H2 means that there is enough available and you don’t have to take it into account to solve the problem.
First, convert grams of N2 to moles. The atomic mass of nitrogen is 14.0067 g/mol so the molar mass of N2 is 28.0134 g/mol. Dividing mass by molar mass gives you 3.00 g/28.0134 g/mol = 0.107 mol.
Set up the ratios given by the question: NH3: N2 = x/0.107 mol.
Cross multiply this ratio by the molar ratio of NH3 to N2: 2:1. x/0.107 mol = 2/1 = (2 x 0.107) = 1x = 0.214 mol.

, You will use molar mass again, but this time you will multiply to convert moles back to grams. Be sure to use the molar mass of the correct species.


The molar mass of NH3 is 17.028 g/mol. Therefore 0.214 mol x (17.028 grams/mol) = 3.647 grams of NH3.

, STP is the set of conditions given where 1 mole of an ideal gas will occupy 22.414 liters (L) of volume.Standard temperature is 273.15 Kelvin (K) and standard pressure is 1 atmosphere (atm).Generally, a reaction will say that it is given at 1 atm and 273 K or will simply say STP.

, If your reaction is happening at STP, you can use 22.414 L/mol to calculate the number of moles in a given volume of gas.Divide the volume of gas (L) by the conversion factor to determine moles.


For example, convert 3.2 liters of N2 gas to moles: 3.2 L/22.414 L/mol = 0.143 moles.

, If you are given a reaction that does not occur at STP, you will have to use the ideal gas law PV = nRT to determine the number of moles in the reaction.P is pressure in atmospheres, V is volume in liters, n is the number of moles, R is the gas law constant 0.0821 L-atm/mol-degree, and T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin.The equation can be rearranged to solve for moles: n = RT/PV.
The units of the gas constant are designed to cancel out the units of the other variables.
For example, determine the number of moles in 2.4 liters of O2 at 300 K and 1.5 atm. Plugging in the variables yields: n = (0.0821 x 300)/(1.5 x 2) = 24.63/3.6 = 6.842 moles of O2


, Sometimes chemical equations will give you the volume of a liquid reactant and require the amount of grams or moles needed for the reaction. To convert to grams, you will use the density of that liquid. Density is given by mass/volume.If the density is not given within the problem, you may have to look it up in a reference text or online.

, To convert the volume of liquid to mass (g) you will need to the use the density of that liquid. Density is given in grams per milliliter (g/mL), therefore, the volume of the liquid needs to be in milliliters to convert.


Identify the volume given. For example, let’s say the problem states that you have 1 liter of H2O. To convert to mL simply multiply by 1000. There are 1000 milliliters in a liter of water.

, When you multiply a volume (mL) by the density of that liquid (g/mL), the milliliters cancel out and you are left with grams of the substance.For example, the density of H2O is 18.0134 g/mL. If the chemical equation states that you have 500 mL of H2O, then the amount of grams is 500 mL x 18.0134 g/mL is 9006.7 g.

, The molar mass is the amount in grams (g) of one mole of a compound. It allows you to easily convert between grams and moles of a substance. To calculate the molar mass you need to identify how many molecules of an element are in a compound and the atomic mass of each element in the compound.


Define the number of atoms of each element in a compound. For example, glucose is C6H12O6, there are 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.
Identify the atomic mass in grams per mol (g/mol) of each atom. The atomic masses of the elements in glucose are: carbon, 12.0107 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 g/mol.
Multiply each elements atomic mass by the number of atoms present in the compound. Carbon: 12.0107 x 6 = 72.0642 g/mol; Hydrogen: 1.007 x 12 = 12.084 g/mol; Oxygen: 15.9994 x 6 = 95.9964 g/mol.
Adding these products together yields the molar mass of the compound. 72.0642 + 12.084 + 95.9964 = 180.1446 g/mol. 180.14 grams is the mass of one mole of glucose.

, Using the molar mass as a conversion factor, you can calculate the number of moles present in the stated number of grams of the species. Divide the known amount of grams (g) by the molar mass (g/mol).,An easy way to check that you’ve done the correct math is to make sure the units cancel out leaving only moles.


For example: How many moles are in 8.2 grams of hydrogen chloride (HCl)?
The atomic mass of H is 1.0007 and Cl is 35.453 making the molar mass of the compound 1.007 + 35.453 = 36.46 g/mol.
Dividing the number of grams of the substance by the molar mass yields: 8.2 g / (36.46 g/mol) = 0.225 moles of HCl.

Clean up.",How to Dissect a Squid," To dissect a squid you need the proper tools and materials: a scalpel, some tweezers, a pair of dissection scissors, pins/toothpicks, a dissection pan, hand lenses/magnifying glass, gloves, and paper towels. The squid itself can be purchased from a local bait shop, seafood market, or a laboratory science company.The rest of these tools should be found in your school’s science lab and provided to you.;
, Dissecting anything can get messy. Make sure you cover up your clothes with a lab coat or some other type of smock to keep yourself clean of squid guts. Closed-toe shoes and pants should also be worn on dissection day. Eye goggles are recommended to prevent spray from getting into your eyes.

, If you received the squid frozen and in a preservative, you will have to thaw it before you can begin. Take it out the night before and let it thaw for at least eight hours. Placing it in a warm water bath will speed up this process.Once the squid has thawed, remove it from the packaging and thoroughly rinse it off to remove the preservative., Identify the dorsal (back) side of the squid. The dorsal side has darker shading than the ventral (front) side. Place your squid on the dissection plate with darker dorsal side facing up.Identify the following features of the squid:Mantle: The mantle is the part of the squid’s body that is not the arms and tentacles. It is just above the head of the squid.
Funnel: The funnel is the part of the squid that allows it to move. It pumps seawater out of the mantle through the funnel to propel itself forward.
Fins: A squid has two fins at the very top of the mantle and uses them to direct its movements through the water.
Chromatophores: Chromatophores are tiny dots on the skin of the squid that can be expanded and contracted by the squid to change the color of its skin. These dots are actually small sacs filled with pigment (color).

, Spread out the arms using the tweezers or a toothpick and count how many there are. You may notice that there are two different types of arms: some are longer than others. There should be eight shorter arms and two longer ones.The shorter projections that have suckers all along them are called arms.The longer projections with suckers only at the ends are called tentacles.
The tentacles are used to capture prey, while the suction cups on the arms are used to hold onto the prey and bring the food to the mouth., Cut off one of the suckers from a tentacle and observe it through the magnifying glass. If you have access to a microscope, look at it under this as well. You should notice that the suction cup actually has small teeth all along its outer edge.These are used to hold onto prey after capture to prevent its escape.
Observe multiple suckers from both the arms and the tentacles to see if they differ.

, The mouth can be found in the center of the arms. Holding the squid upside down, let the arms fall away and find the beak inside the mouth. The beak is surrounded by a muscular mass called the buccal bulb. Cut around the base of the arms to remove the buccal bulb and the beak.Notice how sharp the beak is. It is used to tear prey apart.
The buccal bulb is also attached to a long tube that is the squid’s esophagus., Look at the size and location of the eyes on the squid. You’ll notice they are quite large in comparison to their head. Snip the cornea (the soft membrane covering the eye) and find the lens inside. Using your finger, you should feel something hard inside the eye, this is the lens. Pull it out and compare the lens of the squid to that of a round human lens.Squids cannot see colors, but can see gradients of light and dark.

, Flip the squid over so that the ventral (front) side of the squid is now facing up. Using the dissection scissors, cut down the middle of the mantle, starting at the funnel and finishing at the top.Try to hold the top of the mantle up while cutting to avoid cutting through any of the internal organs.Once you have sliced the mantle, you can fold the sides over and view the internal organs of the squid. If it doesn’t fall open, there may be cartilage still holding the mantle in place. These pieces can easily be pulled apart with your fingers.

, At the top of the mantle cavity are the gonads (sex organs) of the squid. In males, these will be the testes, while in females, they will be ovaries. The gonads will be by the fins of the squid and can be used to identify the gender.Female squid will have eggs inside the ovaries that are yellowish in color and look like jelly. Females also have a large white organ called the nidamental gland above the ovary.Male squid will have sperm which is a cloudy white with a watery feel.

, On either side of the body cavity, there will be a feathery-like structure that are the gills of the squid. These are used for breathing and getting oxygen throughout the squid’s body. A squid has three hearts and two of them are located at the base of each gill. Technically, they are called branchial hearts, but they are often referred to as the gill-hearts.The third heart is called the systemic heart. It is larger and located between the two gill-hearts. It may be obscured by the kidney, which is in the same location and may cover the heart., The digestive system of the squid consists of the esophagus, stomach, caecum, intestine, anus, and funnel retractor muscles. You probably pulled the esophagus out when you cut out the buccal bulb and the beak. The esophagus connects to the stomach which can be difficult to find. It is generally found near the base of the gills.The caecum, intestine, and anus process the food and connect to the funnel, where the waste is disposed of.

, The ink sac is attached the intestine of the squid. It is relatively easy to find given its dark color. It will vary in size depending on how much ink is inside the sac. Remove the sac by cutting just above and below it being careful not puncture it. The ink is used as a defense against predators: a squid will squirt it into the water and then turn black using its chromatophores to blend in.Once it is removed, you can pierce it and write your name with squid ink!

, The pen is a stiff internal structure that is used to support the squid as it moves though the water. It is found underneath the muscles and organs, starting near the reproductive organs. It can be removed by gently tugging the tip until it comes out.Take note of the flexible nature of the pen. It is similar to the stalk of a feather, or a thin, flexible plastic.

, Once you have finished dissecting your squid, place all of the dissected organs back into the cavity of the squid and dispose of it. Carefully clean the tools and wipe down your work surface with a cleaning solution. Wash your hands after finishing the clean-up. Complete any assignments associated with the dissection.

Clean up your space.",How to Dissect a Frog," Frogs and other small animals are typically dissected in biology labs to learn anatomy. If your class is going to dissect a frog, your teacher should provide all the necessary tools for the job. It doesn't take much, though. You'll usually need a clean dissection tray, which is a bit like a baking pan with a rubber lining on the bottom. To make incisions, you'll need a sharp scalpel and a pair of tweezers, or some other kind of poking device, dissection pins, lab instructions, and your frog.


In the old days, advanced science students would be required to put down their frogs themselves, using chemicals. While this resulted in fresh frogs for dissection, the practice is pretty rare nowadays. For the most part, you'll get frogs that have been dead for quite some time.;
, Most frog dissection labels involve a basic identification procedure. You'll be required to open the frog, identify the basic organs and systems of the frog, explore the anatomy of the animal, and probably fill out a short lab report to accompany the project. Always defer to materials provided to you by your instructor.


If you're not comfortable dissecting a frog in class, tell your teacher. Digital alternatives are common.

, The use of latex or rubber gloves, safety glasses, and cleanliness is important. For the most part, dissection specimens are sterilized and safe, but it's still very important to keep your hands, eyes, and mouth free of the formaldehyde used to preserve the frogs for dissection. Sit up straight while you work, wear the protective materials provided to you in the lab, and wash your hands thoroughly afterward.

, To start the lab, remove the frog from its packaging and place it on its back, belly-up in the tray. Some frogs will be slightly stiff from the preservative solution, meaning that you may need to massage them out slightly, bending the legs and softening the joints until the frog sits comfortably on its back.

, The easiest way to quickly tell the difference between male and female frogs isn't to look between the legs, but to look at the feet. The front feet of male frogs should have a fatter thumb pad, and the thumb should look bulbous and fatter than the thin fingers of the female frog.If the specimen is female, keep an eye out for eggs and enlarged ovaries, which may need to be removed before you can identify certain organs.

, On the head of the frog, most labs will want you to label and recognize a few important features. The eyes and the thin nictitating membranes that cover the eyes, so the frog can see under water, are the most important and probably easiest to locate on the frog's head. You should also locate and label the mouth.


The external nares are the technical term for the frog's nostrils, which are used for breathing and should be far forward, above the mouth opening. Each tympanum is located behind the eyes, and is a flattish round spot used for sensing sound., Use your scalpel to cut the membrane that connects the hinges of the frog’s mouth and open the mouth widely to examine the inside. You should be able to see and label the esophagus, which connects to the stomach, and the glottis, which connects to the lungs. Also easy to identify is the tongue, which is quite large and stretchy.


The eustachian tubes are to the left and right of the back of the throat, and are used to equalize pressure.
The vomerine teeth are behind the maxillary teeth, though both are used to secure prey and keep it secure in the mouth.

, The cloaca is the spot where you'll make your first incision, which should be between the frog’s hind legs. Use scissors to lift the abdominal muscles away from the body cavity at the cloaca, if necessary, and make your incision when you're instructed to. It's always important to wait for specific instructions in the lab.

, Different instructors will have different opening techniques, but for the most part you'll start with a basic ""X"" pattern: one cut down each leg, connected by a single cut up the belly. To start, cut out toward each leg, then connect them with a single straight cut up the ""girdle"" in the center of the frog's belly.


Cutting open the torso with an ""H"" pattern is also common. To do this, make transverse (horizontal) cuts just inside the arms and legs, and connect them with a lateral cut up the belly. This should create two hefty flaps that you can pull back and open the frog, pinning them to the tray if necessary., To get the skin out of the way and open up the frog to work, it's usually common to pull the skin back and secure it into the rubber bottom of the dissection tray with pins. Pull it back gently until it connects with the bottom of the tray, then use a pin at each corner to secure the skin back. Be careful not to tear the skin.

, There is a spiderweb-like membrane that covers many of the organs, which you may have to carefully pick off to get a clear view of the organs inside. Make a careful incision to pierce it, being carefully not to poke any of the organs, then pull it loose and free of the body cavity to expose the organs and move forward.

, These should look something like spaghetti-bright orange and yellow grids of tubes along the abdominal wall. If you have a larger frog, the fat bodies may actually need to be removed to see the other organs. If you have trouble seeing beyond this stuff, make sure it's OK with your teacher to remove it before moving forward.

, The organ is the biggest organ in the frog's body, and should be the easiest to locate. It's usually brownish and composed of three big structures, or lobes. Sometimes, it's also streaked with a greenish or bluish color, as well.


For the most part, you won't want to remove the organs until you've identified them. They can help to keep an accurate portrait of the anatomy, finding other organs in relation to what you've already identified. Follow the instructions of your lab instructor, however, and remove them when it comes time to do so.

, The heart has a triangular shape, and it's just above the liver. It's composed of left and right atriums on top and a single ventricle that runs along the bottom of the frog's heart. The conus arteriosus is the big vessel that comes out of the heart and pumps blood throughout the frog's body.

, The frog's lungs are quite small, shaped like little beans, and should feel slightly spongy in texture. You may have to pull the lungs and heart up and out of the way to find them. If you have trouble finding the lungs, you're not alone. Ask your teacher for help if you're struggling.

, There should be a small and greenish sac under the lobes of the liver, where digestive bile is stored for the frog's digestive system. This is usually quite striking, because it looks a whole lot like snot., The esophagus is the tube that leads from the frogs mouth to the stomach. Open the frogs mouth and find the esophagus, then gently poke your probe into it and see where it leads. Follow that tube to find the stomach and begin examining the digestive tract of the frog, your next major step in the dissection process.

, If you haven't already, it's usually common to remove the liver at this point to continue exploring the cavity inside. The stomach curves under the liver. When you find the stomach, follow its curve down to the bottom to look for the pyloric sphincter, which is a valve that channels digested food into the small intestine.

, The small intestine is what attaches to the end of the stomach, and is made up of the duodenum and the ileum, connected by the mesentery. Blood vessels that trail away from the mesentery are used to carry the energy from the digested food away from the intestines and into the blood stream. It's how the frog gets its strength and energy from the food it eats.


Follow the small to the large intestine. The large intestine, also known as the cloaca, should widen at the bottom of the small intestine. This is where waste exits the body of the frog.

, The spleen of the frog should be dark red, and shaped like a little orb. This is where blood is held during the digestion process, aiding in carrying away the energy from the frog.

, Depending on your assignment, some instructors will want you to open the stomach and some may not. Always follow instructions.


If its part of the project, use your scalpel to carefully open the stomach with a horizontal cut, opening it gently with a small cut. Keep your face up and away, in case any spitting occurs. What seems to be inside?

, In frogs, the genital and excretory systems are linked. The kidneys are like flat bean-shaped organs, which can be found basically where there are in humans, tower the lower back, near the spine of the frog. Also like in human anatomy, they should be relatively dark, sometimes highlighted by yellow fat bodies, which are attached at the top.


You probably won't remove any organs from the frog at this point in the process. You should have removed everything necessary to locate and identify all the organs in the frog, making removal unnecessary.

, Confusingly, the genitals of frogs can look awfully similar, due to a phenomenon known as ""vestigial oviducts,"" on male frogs. The best way to tell the difference is to look for testes. If you don't see them, you've got a female.


If you've got a male frog, find the testes at the top of the kidneys. They should be pale and round.
If you've got a female frog, find the oviducts. There should be a curly structure outside the kidney, where female frogs produce eggs.

, The bladder is an empty-looking sac in the lowest cavern of the body, which stores urine and expels it from the frog's body via the cloaca, the small hole where you started your incision. Frogs expel all waste and sperm through this little hole.

, Typically, you'll be presented with a diagram of a frog's organs, which you'll need to label. Different labs may also have different specific assignments or quizzes to complete as part of the project. Before you get rid of your frog, complete any necessary paperwork.

, Discard your dissected frog as soon as you're done with your paperwork. In the lab, there should be a designated disposal area and a place to clean up your dissection tray. Wash it thoroughly with soap and water, throw away your gloves, and wash your hands thoroughly.


It may take some work to get the smell of the preservative off your hands, so you may want to return to them after a couple hours for another scrubbing.

,


Each side group on the stereocenter can be on a wedge or a dash.







, A Newman Projection focuses on one specific bond of the molecule, and note which atoms are attached to these carbon atoms. Add an eye with an arrow looking down the carbon-carbon bond being studied.


Example: 2-3 means looking down the carbon 2 and carbon 3 bond. Notice how the two hydrogens have 3-Dimensional structure. While not a stereocenter, drawing the hydrogens in this way makes drawing the Newman Projection much easier.

, Note: molecule being drawn in the Newman Projection is 2-butanol.

,, Look at the 3-Dimensional Drawing from above and label which atoms are attached to this carbon and where each is located.


Atoms on a wedge point right

, Look at the 3-Dimensional Drawing from above and label which atoms are attached to this carbon and where each is located.


Note the 3-Dimensional location of all the atoms from the structure above and check to make sure the Newman Projection matches for each.







, Each 60 degree turn of the atoms creates a new conformation, and there are six total conformations for each Newman Projection.


Staggered is most stable, eclipsed is least stable.











Completing the other three conformations is done in a similar way, with 60 degree rotations done for each.

Some of it might be uncomfortable if you don’t like insects or gore. But to get the most of the experience, you should put aside these concerns.


Remember insects are among the most numerous animals on the earth. You are not threatening the species.;
, It would be cruel (and difficult) to dissect a live animal. Although it may seem easy to kill insects, many methods take a long time, and in some cases the insect may be alive even after it has stopped moving. There are several ways to prepare a humane ""killing jar"" for insects:


Start with a glass jar about 15 cm (6 in) tall with a removable, airtight lid.Mix enough plaster of Paris to cover the bottom 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the jar, along with a little water and 1 tsp (5 mL) potassium cyanide, sodium cyanide, or ethyl acetate. Let the plaster harden, then drop the locust in and seal the lid. The insect usually becomes comatose after a few minutes, but wait three hours to ensure death.Alternatively, use the natural source of cyanide found in Prunus laurocerasus (cherry laurel). Bruise the leaves well and drop them in a glass jar to a depth of 2 cm (¾ in). Leave the jar closed for at least two or three days before use, and change the leaves once a month.Always read and follow safety procedures when handling potentially dangerous chemicals. Many poisons used to kill insects can also cause harm to humans.

, You will need scissors, forceps, and needles to pin the locust. You will need a tray with a layer of a soft permeable substance, like wax, cork, or soft wood. You will place the pins through this surface to secure the grasshopper to the tray., Stab pins through the large back legs of the locust into the soft surface of the tray. Try to place the pins through the upper parts of the legs (the femur), where there is more mass to keep the pin in place. This will hold secure the locust in place as you begin to dissect it.Pin down the locust so that its antennae are facing upward. You will want to cut along the back of the locust.
If you find that the wings get in the way, cut them off with your scissors. Consider securing the locust first.You can also pull gently on the bottom of the locust and put a pin through its abdomen to keep it stretched out during the procedure.

, Starting at the the top of the abdominal segment, cut down to the bottom of the locust's abdomen and back around in a circle to where you began the incision. To avoid damage to internal organs, try to pull up, away from the body with the scissors, as if you are lifting up the skin. When you are done, there should be a oval-shaped incision that you can pull on to remove a section of the exoskeleton.The incision should begin near the top of the abdomen, and continue on through the abdomen, up to the head., Once you have cut an oval-shaped incision, use tweezers to remove the “shield,” or exoskeleton. The heart should come off with the exoskeleton. Muscle should also be attached to the section of the exoskeleton that you remove; this will be necessary to reveal the internal organs.If you want to inspect the heart, set the exoskeleton aside and look at it later., To better inspect the body, pin the left and right side of the body to the tray. Open up the the incision as far as is possible and insert pins through the exoskeleton on each side of the body and into the tray underneath. This will keep the incision open and easy to inspect., You will need some sort of assistance to better see the insides of the body. You might be surprised by some of the strange organs that a locust sports.If you are a teacher, give your students a list of organs to find and identify. Try to explain what each of the organs do.
Some structures you could ask your students to identify are salivary glands, the gizzard, the midgut, the colon, and the rectum.
Consider removing a small piece of the midgut and inspecting it under a microscope
Allow students to compare their locusts. Some features, like air sacs, will vary considerably in size. Students might find that their insects look rather different.

, The locust's body is composed of three parts: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Understanding the difference is essential to locating many parts of the grasshopper's anatomy.

The head includes the eyes and the antennae. The body narrows a bit at what looks like a neck, at which point the thorax begins.
The thorax is the part of body that the wings and legs attach to.
The thorax ends at about the point where the wings attach to to the body. From that point, the rest of the body is the abdomen., Most of the head is visible before dissection. These include the eyes, which are located along the sides of the head. The antennae are two thin structures extending out of the top of the grasshopper's head. The labrum is located at the mouth of the grasshopper and acts as the upper lip, keeping food in the locust's mouth as it eats., To determine the sex of your locust, inspect the end of the abdomen. The end of a female abdomen will narrow to a point that is used to lay eggs. The end of male abdomen's will be rounded and point upward., The digestive system runs from the mouth of the grasshopper to its anus. The digestive system is responsible for processing food that the grasshopper consumes. It will run through the center of the grasshopper and constitutes its largest organ system.

The first large structure in the digestive system is the crop. It is one of the largest organs and is a big, oval-shaped structure close to the mouth. Its function is to store food before it is digested.
After the crop, the stomach is the next large structure in the digestive system. It is the second of four oval-shaped organs in the system. Between the stomach and the crop are the gastric caeca, which are shaped somewhat like the petals of the flower. These contain bacteria that are used in the process of digestion.The third, smaller oval structure in the digestive system is the intestine. Between it and the stomach are thin vein like structures known as the Malpighian tubule. This is used to process liquid into urine.After the intestine, the digestive system narrows into a small tube, then opens back up again to a small, oval structure, connecting to the anus. That is the rectum. This is where digested food is released from the body as feces.

, The reproductive system will be above the large intestine, between it and the stomach. Ovaries will contain yellow, oval-shaped eggs. In contrast, if your locust is a male, you should be looking for testes, which are white.

Both of these structures are small and can be difficult to see, especially the male testes., The heart was likely removed with the exoskeleton during the dissection. The heart is composed of several small chambers that run along the length of the grasshopper's body. Each of these heart chambers will be connected by ostia, openings that allow blood to circulate between the heart chambers."

Use heat.,
Apply alcohol.,
Change the pH.,
Try heavy metal salts.",How to Denature a Protein1," Heat is one of the easiest ways and most common ways to denature a protein. When the protein in question is present in food, simply cooking the food will denature the proteins. Many proteins can be denatured by exposing them to a temperature of or above 100° C (212° F).This allows the proteins to coagulate and reduce their solubility.

The length of exposure depends on what you are exposing to heat. An egg, for example, may cook in a pan on medium heat in five minutes, while a roast may take hours to cook in a oven.;
, Alcohol disrupts the hydrogen bonds the occur between amide groups. When a protein is exposed to an alcohol solution, the alcohol molecules form new bonds with the protein chain. Use a solution of 70% alcohol to break through the cell wall of bacteria and denature the protein.Concentrated alcohols can be dangerous, as they are both flammable and toxic. Always wear full safety equipment including gloves and eye protection, and handle in a secure, temperature-controlled environment., The internal structure of a protein can be broken down when its environment is very acidic or very alkaline, as they disrupt the ionic bonds that hold the protein’s salt bridges together. Add an acid or base solution to the protein. The surrounding environment should be at a pH of above 10 or below 4 to encourage denaturation., Heavy metals can disrupt bonds in the protein, causing it to lose its structure. Salts of heavy metals such as mercury and lead may be used to denature different proteins. Such salts are available from most chemical suppliers, and should always be used with caution and proper safety equipment including gloves and eye protection."
"
Determine if a protein can refold.,
Remove the denaturing factor.,
Use a renaturation kit.",How to Denature a Protein2," Some forms of denaturation are permanent, while others can be undone. Cooking an egg or meat, for example, cannot be undone, but a protein that has been exposed to a high pH may regain shape when put in a more neutral environment., Return the environment around the protein to stasis and remove the denaturing element. Remove the acid or base, for example, or bring the protein back to a more reasonable temperature., Many laboratory supplies companies sell renaturation kits that allow you to screen for the best parameters to encourage renaturation. Such kits can be especially helpful if you are looking at proteins in a laboratory or experimental setting."

Know your flower structure.,
Obtain your equipment.,
Cut the flower off the plant, if you haven't already.,
Remove the petals and sepals from the flower.,
Pin the flower to the dissection board.,
With your scalpel (or knife), cut the flower straight down the middle.,
Observe the internal structure.",How to Dissect a Flower," Whilst they come in many varieties with different positions for different structures, most flowers possess the same parts:


The distinctive petals are the most obvious part. Their colors help attract insects to the plant and their large size helps them to land. Many petals reflect ultraviolet light that humans cannot see, but makes them bright beacons for insects.
Sepals are the small, green leaf-like structures in between the petals and the stem.
Anthers, which appear as small, thin hairs poking out from inside, with yellow tips known as stamens, are the male reproductive organs of the plant, and have pollen on their tips. Pollen is the male gamete in flowering plants, equivalent to the human sperm cell
The stigma, which can be shorter or longer than the anthers, is the female reproductive organ and is the depository site for pollen. Normally, insects brushing against the anthers will transfer some pollen to the stigma. The pollen will burrow a tube through the stigma and into the ovary to fertilize eggs.
The gynoecium, which contains the ovary where eggs are produced, is a large, round segment. It is sometimes within the petals, where it is known as superior, or below the sepals, where it is known as inferior. It's the same on the inside, though - unfertilized eggs are produced in the ovary within. When pollen grains burrow all the way to the eggs, fertilization occurs, which eventually leads to the formation of seeds.;
, If you want to accurately dissect the flower, you'll need a scalpel, dissecting board and pins. If you'd prefer to do it more simply at home, you can use a sharp knife, but you probably won't get as neat a cut. If you have a spare bit of wood, you can use that as your dissecting board, and needles as pins. Otherwise, you could try cutting it on a chopping board, but it might be hard to stop it from moving, and there's also a risk of injury with the lessened precision.

, Be careful to leave a bit of the stem, you don't want to cut through the gynoecium accidentally.

, They can be plucked by hand, but be careful not to take off more than the petals. To remove them, pull them down towards the stem.

, Place one pin in the very tip of the stigma, and place the other pin in the stem at the bottom of the flower. This will hold it in place and stop it from moving while you cut. If you don't have the equipment, you can use needles and a spare piece of wood.

, Start at the tip of the stigma, move down through the gynoecium, and finally end at the stem at the bottom. Try to make as straight a cut as you can, as a tidier cut will make things easier to see. This is where having a scalpel helps. The pins will also get in the way at the top and bottom, so remove them when you're ready to cut through.

, You should easily be able to see where the anthers, petals and sepals join to the base of the flower. The ovary should now be exposed, and there may be seeds or ovules visible. These can be extracted and viewed under a magnifying glass if you so wish.

Sprinkle grass seeds on top.,
Water the seeds.,
Turn the top upside down and place it inside the base.,
Seal with tape around the edges.,
Place the ecosystem in a sunny spot.",How to Create an Ecosystem in a Bottle1," To make a bottle ecosystem, you will need a 2 quart (2 liter) plastic bottle. It is best to use a clear plastic so that you can see inside the bottle and make observations. Cut off the top of the bottle, just below the neck.To ensure your cut is straight, you can put a piece of masking tape around the bottle and then cut along the edge of the tape.Use a pair of scissors or a utility knife to cut all the way around the top of the bottle.
Set aside the neck of the bottle with the cap for later use.;
, Use a small garden shovel and add 2-3 inches (5-7 cm) of potting soil to the bottom of the bottle. Lightly tap the soil with your hand to help it settle. Make sure you do not press too hard because you do not want to pack the soil tightly.If desired, you can add ½ an inch of pebbles to the bottom of the bottle for drainage. This is be done before adding the soil, but is optional.

, The depth of the holes will vary depending on the type of seed you are planting. It is recommended that you start by planting green beans. They are hardy seeds that should grow easily. Read the directions on your seed packet to know how deep to make the holes. Use your finger or a pencil to make the holes in the soil.If you are planting beans, the holes should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep.
Make the holes near the edge of the bottle. This way you will be able to easily see the roots growing.

, Once you have dug the holes, place one seed in each hole. You should be able to fit approximately 5-6 plants. Cover the seeds with dirt.Aside from beans, you could also try planting a variety of herbs, such as mint, basil, and oregano., Then, place two pinches of grass seeds on top of the soil. Lightly cover them with dirt. If you would like, you can also try adding insects and worms to the ecosystem., Prior to sealing your ecosystem, you need to water the seeds. Sprinkle water into the bottle. You want the soil to be damp, but not soaked. Let the water seep into the soil and then sprinkle a bit more. You want the water to fully permeate the soil.If you tilt the bottle and water runs up the side, you have too much water.

, Now, take the top of the bottle with the cap and turn it upside down. Place it inside the ecosystem so that the neck and top of the bottle are hanging a few inches above the soil., In order to hold the top of the bottle in place, and to seal the ecosystem, you should tape around the edge of the bottle. This will attach the top of the bottle to the base.You will no longer need to add water to your bottle ecosystem.

, Now that the ecosystem is sealed, you should place it in a sunny spot. For example, a windowsill is a great place to keep your bottle ecosystem. The location should receive indirect sunlight for most of the day.You can also add a label to the base of the ecosystem with the date and identifying number. This way you can record notes and compare it with other bottle ecosystems that you make.

The plastic near the bottom is usually quite thick and as a result, you may not be able to cut it with scissors.You can discard the small base of the bottle because it will not be needed.
Place the top of the bottle with the cap to the side, for later use.

, Take a second 2 quart bottle and cut all the way around the bottle just below the neck. You can use scissors or a utility knife to cut the bottle.Keep both pieces from this bottle. The base of this bottle will form the base of your ecosystem and the top will be used to as a cap to seal the ecosystem shut.

, Remove the lid from the first 2 quart bottle that you cut. Place the lid on a cutting board and then use a pair of pliers or a small handheld vice to hold the cap in place. Carefully drill a small hole through the center of the bottle cap.You should ask an adult to help with drilling the hole into the cap.
Make sure to wear safety glasses when using the drill.

, Next, push a thick cotton string or long wick through the hole. Wicks can be purchased from your local craft supply store. The wick or string should be about 3-4 inches (7-10 cm) long.Screw the lid back onto the bottle.
Set this piece aside for later use.

, Now you will need the base portion of bottle. Fill the bottom of the bottle with water. You may need to experiment a little to find the exact measurement of water. If you have too much water the cap will be submerged and if you don't have enough water the wick will not be able to reach the water., Make sure the string is submerged in the water, but the cap should not be touching the water. This string will collect water and help keep the soil above moist. This is how your seeds will get water once they have been planted., Now, pour 3-4 inches (8-10 cm) of top soil into the bottle. Make sure that the string or wick is buried in the soil., You can plant a variety of different seeds in your ecosystem. For instance, you could try green beans, basil, mint, oregano, peppers etc. Read the instructions provided on the seed packet to know exactly how deep to plant the seeds. Most will only be about an inch (2.5 cm) deep. Space the seeds out and record where you put each type of plant. This way you can monitor their growth., Once you have finished planting your seeds, you should water them in order to help them grow. They will receive water from the base of the ecosystem, but it is a good idea to give them a bit of water at the start., Take the remaining bottle top and place it on top of your ecosystem. Tape around the edge to seal it in place. You should also make sure that the lid is sealed on tightly., Now that you have sealed your ecosystem, you should place it in a sunny spot. Record any changes that take place on a daily basis.

Place the ecosystem in a sunny spot.",How to Create an Ecosystem in a Bottle3," Use a 2 quart (2 liter) plastic bottle and fill it ¾ of the way with water. You can either use water from a local pond or stream, or from the tap. Pond or stream water is preferable because you will also get small microorganisms that may be present in the water.If you have to use tap water, make sure that you let it sit in an open container for at least 24 hours before using in your ecosystem. The chlorine present in tap water may kill any animal or plant species that you add to your ecosystem.

, Next, add 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of tiny rocks or pebbles. You should always wash any rocks prior to adding them to your ecosystem. This will help remove any contaminants.


At this stage you could also add one dead leaf. This will provide a food source for any microorganisms in the water.

, You can buy aquatic plants from your local pet supply store. When you add the plants to your ecosystem, make sure to separate them and add them individually.Alternatively, you could pick water plants from a local pond.

, You can also purchase small freshwater snails at your local pet supply store. Alternatively, you may be able to find water snails from a local pond. Make sure the snails are small enough to fit through the opening of the bottle., Once you have placed everything into your ecosystem, you should wait approximately 24 hours before sealing it closed. This will allow your ecosystem to settle. After 24 hours you can screw the cap onto the top of the bottle.

, Situate your aquatic ecosystem in a sunny spot. The bottle should receive indirect sunlight throughout the day."

There are two cases in calculating LOD score.",How to Calculate LOD Score1," The most often one is when you have a small number of progeny. In that case, use the method below the heading ""When progeny size is small"". In case your progeny size is small and you feel that the number of recombinants and non-recombinants accurately represents the genetic distance between the two genes (which is rare in human genetics), use the method under the heading ""When progeny size is large""."
"
Assume a certain genetic distance between the two genes (between 0 and 0 and 50cM).,
Assume that you have 13 individuals out of which 2 are recombinant.,
Since you want to track each genotype, you divide it by 2: (1-r)/2=0.45.,
Repeat this process for r as 0, 0.01, 0.03 ,0.05, 0.3 and 0.5.",How to Calculate LOD Score2," Assume you take the genetic distance (r) as 0.1.
, The probability of non-recombinations will be 1-r = 1-0.1 = 0.9, The probability of recombinants will be r/2 = 0.1/2 = 0.05

The probability of Data if the two genes are linked is ((r/2)^R)*(((1-r)/2)^NR) where R= # of recombinants and NR = # of non-recombinants. So the probability of Data if the two genes are linked is ((0.05)^11)*((.45)^2)
The probability of Data if the two genes are non-linked is (0.25)^(R+NR) = (0.25)^13
Now log of odds = (probability of Data if the two genes are linked)/(probability of Data if the two genes are non-linked). So, Log of odds = (((.05)^2)*((0.45)^11)) / ((0.25)^13) = 25.7
The LOD score will be log10(25.7) = 1.41.

,

The highest value of LOD score you get is your correct answer. The genetic distance you've assumed is probably close to the actual distance between the two genes of interest.

Establish a pedigree for two loci of interest.,
Determine the number of recombinant and number of nonrecombinants.,
Calculate the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are linked.,
Calculate the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are not linked.,
Divide the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are linked (from Step 3 above), by the probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are not linked (from Step 4 above).,
Take the base 10 logarithm of the ratio obtained above (Step 5).",How to Calculate LOD Score3," The more data you gather, the better., For example, suppose alleles A1 and B1 one locus 1 came from one parent, and A2 and B2 on locus 2 came from the other. Progeny inheriting A1B1 or A2B2 is non - recombinant, while those inheriting A1B2 or A2B1 are recombinant., This is given by ((R/(R+NR))^R)*((1-(R/(R+NR)))^NR), where R = number of recombinants, NR = number of nonrecombinants.

For example, in the MNS blood group system, M and S are linked, and N and s are linked. Suppose that in 100 random individuals, 25 have MS haplotype, 30 have Ms haplotype, 6 have NS haplotype, and 39 have Ns haplotype. Since M and S are linked, and N and s are linked, MS and Ns are non - recombinants, and Ms and NS are recombinants.
Thus, the number of recombinants = R = 30+ 6 = 36, while the number of nonrecombinants = NR = 25 + 39 = 64. The recombinant frequency is R/(R+NR) = 36/(36+64) = 0.36.
The probability of obtaining the results assuming the two loci are linked is therefore ((0.36)^36)*((1-(0.36))^64) = 4.19187538*10^-29.

, This is given by 0.5^(NR+R). In the example above, this is 0.5^(64+36) = 0.5^100 = 7.88860905×10^-31., For our example, this equals 4.19187538*10^-29/7.88860905×10^-31 = 53.14., For the example, this equals log 53.14 = 1.73."

Avoid the smell.,
Enjoy a mint.,
Sit down.,
Take anti-nausea medicine, such as Pepto Bismol or Dramamine.,
Locate a trash can.",How to Cope when You Feel Sick During a Dissection1," Formaldehyde is used to preserve specimens. Many students report being adversely affected by the smell of formaldehyde during a dissection. Try breathing through your mouth as much as you can and stepping away from the specimen when you are able. It might also help to wear a mask., A mint can help cover up the smell of the formaldehyde. Keep them in your pocket the day of the dissection. Alternatively, strongly flavored gum or candies can have the serve the same purpose.


It is best practice not to eat in the lab, so you might want to address this with the instructor beforehand.

, Roughly one in ten students report that they feel like fainting during a dissection. If you feel light headed or weak at all, sit down. If you are extremely dizzy or light headed, put your head between your knees. This will prevent you from hitting your head if you pass out., If you know you will experience extreme nausea, take some medication before the dissection. You can prevent yourself from feeling sick and be a more productive student. Read the medication label well before taking any medication.


Some anti-nausea medications will make you drowsy.

, If you do feel the urge to vomit, you should go to a trash can or the restroom immediately. Your lab partners will not be fond of cleaning your vomit off of their clothes. You also want to avoid contaminating the dissection since that would mean starting the whole process over.

Input known information.",How to Determine Genotype1," A Punnett square is used to determine the likelihood of an offspring’s genotype based on the genotypes of its parents. The square will be labeled with the genotype of each parent. Within the square, the possible genotypes of the offspring will be shown., Take the genotype of one parent and split the two letters (representing dominant and recessive traits). Place one letter to the left of the top row, and one letter to the left of the bottom row. This will represent that parent’s contribution to the offspring’s genotype.It is customary to put a dominant trait (capital letter) on the top row and a recessive trait (lowercase letter) on the bottom if the two traits are different.

, The other parent’s traits should be split in the same way. This time, place one letter in above the left column, and the other above the right column. This will represent the second parent’s contribution to the offspring’s genotype.It is customary to put a dominant trait (capital letter) on the left and a recessive trait (lowercase letter) on the right if the two traits are different.

, Each square can now be filled. Inside each square, write the letter that corresponds to the row that the square is in. Next, write the letter that corresponds to the column the square is in. This will identify all possible genotypes for the offspring as well as the percentage at which they would occur.For mixed traits, write the genotype so that the dominant trait is listed first (Rr instead of rR).

Think academically about the dissection.,
Read about the dissection process.,
Look at a virtual dissection.",How to Cope when You Feel Sick During a Dissection2," If you view the dissection as a meaningless, disgusting task, it will be harder to push yourself through it. Instead, consider it an opportunity to learn about the different organs present in most animals. Realize that dissections give you the opportunity to see parts of an animal that you would likely never see otherwise.Also, keep in mind that the specimen is embalmed, meaning all blood has been removed.

, Read your lab manual or other books detailing the dissection that you will be doing. This will force you to view the procedure in an academic light, and give you exposure to the process before you have to do the dissection. If you have trouble finding reading material, ask your instructor for suggestions.

, You can find virtual dissection programs on the internet for free. Using such a program will show you the shapes and structures of the specimen you plan to dissect. It can also preview the dissection so that you understand what you are doing, and are better prepared and focused."

Find other lab tasks to do.,
Discuss the assignment with your instructor.,
Request that you be given an alternate assignment.,
Gather support for moral objections.",How to Cope when You Feel Sick During a Dissection3," During the dissection, there will be several things that need done aside from cutting the specimen. Most lab assignments require notes to be taken and even diagrams to be drawn of different structures. Offer to do the majority of these other tasks if your lab partner(s) perform the majority of the dissection.

, If you are hesitant about doing the dissection, talk it over with your instructor. You may feel better about the procedure after your talk, and if not you can ask for an alternative to doing the dissection., Some instructors will allow you to do a report or other written assignment in place of a dissection. A virtual dissection is also an option in some cases.Try speaking with your teacher and say something like, “I do not want to participate in the dissection. Would it be possible for me to have an alternate assignment?”
In some states, K-12 students have the right to refuse to participate in a dissection.
If you do not want to participate in a dissection, make sure that you talk to your teacher about it well before the day of the dissection. You may also have to put your intention in writing and distribute it to your teacher, principal, and other administrators in your school district., If the dissection makes you ill because of your moral objections, be sure to do your research and present that research to your instructor. You can also enlist classmates, parents, and other faculty to support your cause. Start a group or club that has the goal of ending traditional dissections in your school.It might also help to take the stance that virtual dissections are a better learning experience for students.

Once bound, the binder can be detected to determine whether or not that sequence was present in the sample. This allows for testing of specific sequences that correspond to a certain genotype., Once you have selected a primer that binds to the sequence in question, you will need to extract DNA from the cell. Follow the appropriate extraction protocol for your lab. Once you have collected a sample, you can test it., Add the primer to the DNA sample. If the sequence corresponding to that primer is present, it will bind to the molecule. Once this is complete, you can move on to analysis., For simple cases, the results simply come back as positive or negative based on whether or not the primer was bound to the DNA strands. Some more complex methods may require post-PCR procedures. These procedures can be lengthy and expensive, and are avoided when possible."

Expose the paper.",How to Determine Genotype3," A DNA digestion is a process that breaks the two strands of DNA apart. This leaves each strand without its complementary base pair. This opening allows the DNA to bind with other complementary strands., Electrophoresis is a process that uses electric current to carry molecules through a gel. In this case, you should use an agarose gel. The DNA will travel to toward the positive end of the gel and be separated by size., Once the strands have been separated, they must be transferred out of the gel. Use a Southern transfer procedure to transfer the sample to a sheet of nylon or nitrocellulose paper. These mediums are more appropriate for adding the probe., Probes are strands of DNA that compliment the strands in question. If the strand representing a specific genotype is present, it will bind the probe. The probe also contains a fluorescent molecule that will be detectable during analysis., After allowing ample time for the probe to bind to any sample present, you need to wash the paper. Follow the specific procedures for your lab, but this usually only involves lightly rinsing the paper with water. Be careful not to contaminate or damage the sample during the wash., Once the sample has been washed, you can examine it. Exposing the to sample to ultraviolet light will excite the fluorophore attached to the probe. This will produce an image with areas of intense light relative to the background. If there is no probe present, there will be no lighted areas.The presence of the probe indicates that the sequence corresponding to the genotype in question is present.

If you are diluting bacteria or other cells, you will likely want to dilute in culture media.The liquid you choose will be used for every serial dilution.


If you’re unsure what liquid to use, ask for help or check online to see if other people have performed a similar dilution.;
, These tubes will serve as your dilution blanks.You will be adding your undiluted sample to the first tube and then serially diluting into the following tubes.


It’s helpful to label all of your tubes before you begin so you don’t get confused once you begin with the dilutions.
Each tube will be a 10-fold dilution starting from the undiluted tube.The first tube will be a 1:10 dilution, the second a 1:100, the third a 1:1000, etc. Determine the number of dilutions you need to do beforehand so you don’t waste tubes or diluting liquid.

, The minimum amount needed to perform this serial dilution is 1 mL of undiluted solution. If you only have 1 mL you will not have any remaining undiluted solution. Label this tube US for undiluted solution.


Thoroughly mix your solution before starting any dilutions., Draw 1 mL of undiluted solution from test tube US with a pipette and transfer it to the test tube labeled 1:10 containing 9 mL of the dilution liquid and mix thoroughly. There is now 1mL of the undiluted solution in 9 mL of the dilution liquid. The solution, therefore, has been diluted by a factor of 10.

, For the second serial dilution, you will take 1 mL of solution from tube 1:10 and add it to the 9 mL of dilution liquid in the tube 1:100. Thoroughly mix tube 1:10 before adding to the next tube. Again, mix the tube 1:100 following dilution. The solution from test tube 1:10 has been diluted 10-fold into test tube 1:100.

, This process may be repeated as many times as necessary to achieve the desired solution. In an experiment involving concentration curves, you can use a serial dilution to create a series of solutions with dilutions of 1, 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000.

Calculate the final dilution ratio in a serial dilution.,
Determine the concentration of the solution following dilution.,
Confirm that all units match.",How to Do Serial Dilutions2," The total dilution ratio can be determined by multiplying the dilution factor of each step leading up to the final step. This can be mathematically illustrated with the equation Dt = D1 x D2 x D3 x … x Dn where Dt is the total dilution factor and Dn is the dilution ratio.For example, let’s say you did a 1:10 dilution of your liquid 4 times. Plug your dilution factor into the equation: Dt = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000
The final dilution factor of the fourth tube in your serial dilution is 1:10,000. The concentration of your substance is now 10,000 times less than the original undiluted solution.

, To determine the final concentration of your solution following serial dilution you will need to know your starting concentration. The equation is Cfinal = Cinitial/D where Cfinal is the ending concentration of the diluted solution, Cinitial is the starting concentration of the original solution and D is the dilution ratio previously determined.For example: If you started with a solution of cells with a concentration of 1,000,000 cells per mL and your dilution ratio is 1,000, what is the final concentration of your diluted sample?
Using the equation:

Cfinal = Cinitial/D

Cfinal = 1,000,000/1,000

Cfinal = 1,000 cells per mL.



, When performing any calculation, you want to make sure that your units always match at the end.If you started with cells per mL make sure you are ending with cells per mL. If your starting concentration is parts per million (ppm), then your final concentration must be ppm.

Turn on the machine and let it sit for at least 15 minutes before running any samples.Use the warm-up time to prepare your samples.;
, If you are doing a lab for school, you may be using disposable test tubes that don’t need to be cleaned. If you are using cuvettes or reusable test tubes, make sure they are properly cleaned before use. Rinse each cuvette thoroughly with deionized water.


Take care with cuvettes as they can be quite expensive.
When handling the cuvette, avoid touching the sides the light will pass through (generally, the clear sides of the container)., Some cuvettes have a maximum volume of 1 milliliter (mL) while test tubes may have a maximum volume of 5 mL. As long as the laser producing the light is passing through the liquid and not an empty part of the container, you will get an accurate reading.


If you are using a pipette to load your samples, use a new tip for each sample to prevent cross-contamination., Known as a blank, the control solution has only the chemical solvent in which the solute to be analyzed is dissolved in. For example, if you had salt dissolved in water, your blank would be just water. If you had dyed the water red, the blank must also contain red water. The blank is the same volume as the solution to be analyzed and kept in the same kind of container., Before placing the cuvette into the spectrophotometer you want to make sure it is as clean as possible to avoid interference from dirt or dust particles. Using a lint free cloth, remove any water droplets or dust that may be on the outside of the cuvette., Use a single wavelength of light (monochromatic color) to make the testing more effective. The color of the light chosen should be one known to be absorbed by one of the chemicals thought to be in the test solute. Set the desired wavelength according to the specifications of your spectrophotometer.In a classroom lab, the wavelength will likely be given to you.
Because the sample will reflect all light of the same color as it appears, the experimental wavelength will always be a different color than that of the sample.
Objects appear as certain colors because they reflect light of particular wavelengths and absorb all other colors. Grass is green because the chlorophyll in it reflects green light and absorbs everything else., Place the blank into the cuvette holder and shut the lid. On an analog spectrophotometer, there will be a screen with a needle that moves based on the intensity of light detection. When the blank is in, you should see the needle move to the right. Record this value in case you need it for later. With the blank still in the machine, move the needle to zero using the adjustment knob.


Digital spectrophotometers can be calibrated in the same way, they will just have a digital readout. Set the blank to 0 using the adjustment knobs.
When you remove the blank, the calibration will still be in place. When measuring the rest of your samples, the absorbance from the blank will automatically be subtracted out.

, With the blank removed the needle should stay at zero or the digital readout should continue to read zero. Place the blank back into the machine and ensure the needle or readout doesn’t change. If the machine is properly calibrated with your blank, everything should stay at zero.


If the needle or readout is not zero, repeat the calibration steps with the blank.
If you continue to have problems, seek assistance or have the machine looked at for maintenance.

, Remove the blank and place the experimental sample into the machine. Wait about 10 seconds until the needle is steady or until the digital numbers stop changing. Record the values of %transmittance and/or absorbance.


The more light that is transmitted, the less light the sample absorbs. Generally, you want to record the absorbance values which will usually be given as a decimal, for example, 0.43.
Repeat the reading for each individual sample at least three times and average them together. This ensures a more accurate readout.

, To eliminate uncertainty, repeat your readings at 25 nm intervals across the spectrum. This will allow you to detect other chemicals suspected to be in the solute.

, Transmittance is how much of the light that passed through the sample reached the spectrophotometer. Absorbance is how much of the light has been absorbed by one of the chemicals in the solute. Many modern spectrophotometers have an output of transmittance and absorbance, but if you recorded intensity, you can calculate these values.The transmittance (T) is found by dividing the intensity of the light that passed through the sample solution with the amount that passed through the blank. It is normally expressed as a decimal or percentage. T = I/I0 where I is the intensity of the sample and I0 is the intensity of the blank.
The absorbance (A) is expressed as the negative of the base-10 logarithm (exponent) of the transmittance value: A = -log10T.For a T value of 0.1, the value of A is 1 (0.1 is 10 to the -1 power), meaning 10 percent of the light is transmitted and 90 percent is absorbed. For a T value of 0.01, the value of A is 2 (0.01 is 10 to the -2 power), meaning 1 percent of the light is transmitted.

, The absorbance value is plotted on the vertical y-axis against the wavelength of light used for a given test plotted on the horizontal x-axis. Plotting the maximum absorbance values for each wavelength of light tested, produces the sample's absorbance spectrumand identifies the compounds making up the test substance and their proportions.


An absorbance spectrum usually has peaks at certain wavelengths that can allow you to identify specific compounds.

, Compounds have unique absorbance spectrum and will always produce a peak at the same wavelength every time they are measured. By comparing your plots of unknown compounds to those of known compounds, you can identify the solutes that compose your solution.


You can also use this method to identify contaminants in your sample. If you are expecting one clear peak at a specific wavelength and you get two peaks at separate wavelengths, you know something is not right in your sample.

Make or buy a chromatography strip.,
Place a colored line near the bottom of the strip.,
Secure the chromatography strip vertically.,
Put water in a cup.,
Lower the chromatography strip into the water.,
Wait patiently.,
Count bands you see.,
Notice the color of each band.,
List the bands by how far each of them traveled.",How to Do Simple Chromatography," A chromatography strip is a strip of material that the mobile phase mixture moves through. It serves as the stationary stage. You can by specially formulated chromatography strips for superior results, but for simply chromatography you can make your own. Cut a coffee filter into straight strips about one inch wide and five or six inches long.Paper towels, or any other paper, can be substituted for the coffee filter.;
, Measure up about one inch from the bottom of the strip. There, use a black marker to draw a straight line across the width of the strip. Make sure that your line is up high enough that you can submerge the bottom of the paper without submerging the line.In place of a line, some people use a dot. This will work as well, but the bands will not be as clearly defined using this method.

, Use clothespins to hang the strip vertically. It should be hung such that the side with the marker line is nearest the ground. Make sure to place the clothespin as high on the strip as possible while still having a good hold. If the clip is too far down on the strip, it may interfere with the bands.You can hang the strip with paper clips, tape, or any other mechanism you see fit.

, When doing simple chromatography, your solvent (the liquid that carries the mobile phase across the stationary phase) will be water. Add a little water to a clear cup or glass. You only need enough for the chromatography strip to soak up, so just a few ounces is plenty., Keeping your chromatography strip vertical, lower it into the water. Make sure that you have an apparatus set up to hold the strip there, as this process can take quite a bit of time. The bottom of the strip should be submerged, but the marker line should not be submerged. If you accidentally submerge this line, throw the strip away and make another.An example apparatus would be to have the clothespin that is holding the strip clamped to a pencil lying across the top of the glass. This way, the strip dangles down and just barely touches the water.

, As the water moves up the strip, it will carry the different compounds in the marker with it. The lighter (smaller) compounds will move faster, and the heavier (larger) compounds will move slower. This will separate the compounds out into “bands” based on their size. This is a slow process, however. Watch the strip until you see the water reach about one inch from the top of the strip.The exact time it takes the water to reach one inch from the top of the strip will depend on what kind of strip you are using.

, Once you have removed the strip from the water, your bands should stay in place. This will allow you to count how many different bands are visible on your strip. That will give you a rough idea of how many different sized compounds are in the marker’s ink., The marker’s black ink is made up of several different pigments. These pigments all have their own unique colors. When you separate them into bands, the bands will be the color of that individual pigment. By noting the color of each band, you can analyze what color pigments went into created the black ink in the marker., Write the colored bands down in order from the top of the strip to the bottom of the strip. The bands near the top are your lightest compounds, and the bands near the bottom are your heaviest compounds. You are also likely to notice a color trend from top to bottom. Lighter colors are usually smaller compounds, and thus move farther up the strip, and darker colors will linger closer to the bottom because they are generally heavier compounds.The ratio of the distance a compound moved to the distance the solvent moved is called the Rf value. You can calculate the Rf value for any band by dividing the distance the band traveled from the original line to the distance the solvent traveled from the original line.For example, if you have a band two inches past above the line you made and the solvent traveled five inches above the solvent, you could use the equation Dband/Dsolvent = Rf. For this example, that means:

Rf = 2 inches / 5 inches
Rf = 0.4

Send the pipette for calibration, if necessary.",How to Do Pipette Calibration," To check the calibration of a pipette, you will need the pipette, pipette tips, distilled water, a beaker, a thermometer, a balance, and weigh boats. The balance needs to be specific to micrograms to calibrate micropipettes with a maximum of 1 µL.You won’t need more than 5 mLs of water. Fill the beaker with the water.
Make sure the pipette tips are the correct tips that properly fit the pipette.;
, Place the thermometer in the water and leave it for at least one minute. If the red line on the thermometer is still moving, leave it for another minute. After a minute, record the temperature in a notebook. Remove the thermometer and dry it off when you are finished.Knowing the temperature of the water is important for the calculations that will be done to check the calibration.

, Ideally, you will use a balance that has doors on it and is an isolated chamber. Place the weigh boat in the chamber and close the doors. If you don’t have doors, simply place the weigh boat on the balance. Press the “Zero” or “Tare” button and wait until the balance reads zero.Zeroing the scale subtracts the weight of the plastic boat and allows you to measure just the weight of whatever you put into the boat.

, Wipe down the pipette with ethanol before beginning and make sure nothing is clogging the tip end of the pipette. Place the appropriate tip on the end and set the volume that you want to test.For calibration, test both the smallest volume and the largest volume the pipette can dispense., Press the button to the first stop and stick the tip into the distilled water so that about 2 mm is immersed in the liquid. Release the button to aspirate some liquid and then dispense the liquid again by pushing the button down. Repeat this three times to pre-rinse the tip.Push the button to the second stop to dispense any liquid that remains in the tip and remove the pipette from the water.

, With the tip out of the liquid, push the button down to the first stop. Place about 2 mm of the tip into the distilled water and release the button to aspirate the liquid into the tip. Wait about 1 second before removing the tip from the water.Make sure the tip is completely immersed during the whole aspiration process. You don’t want any bubbles in the tip or the results will be wrong.

, Place the tip against the bottom of the weigh boat and push the button down to the first stop. Move to another spot slightly away from the water and push the button to the second stop. Keeping the button pressed, lift the tip away from the weigh boat.Keep the tip on the pipette as you will use it again to weigh out more calibration tests.

, Close the door if you are using a chamber balance. Wait until the numbers stop changing. Record this number in your notebook.It’s important to wait until the number has stabilized before recording it. Your readings will be incorrect if you don’t wait.

, Zero the scale, pre-rinse the tip, aspirate the same volume, dispense the volume, and then record the weight. You want to have multiple recordings of the same volume and then you can average them all together.You can repeat this same process with different volumes as long as you take multiple readings per volume.

, The formula for calculating the volume dispensed by the pipette is V = w * Z where w is the weight of the water, Z is the conversion factor based on the density of the water, and V is the calculated volume of how much water was dispensed.


You can find the Z variable by looking up the density of water using the temperature recorded at the beginning of the experiment.For example: If the temperature of the water was 23°C, then you will use a Z value of 1.0035 µg/mg.

, You should have weighed the volume of water dispensed by the pipette at least 10 times. In order to average all of these values together, add them all up and divide by 10. If you did more or fewer trials, add up each trial and divide by the total number of trials.


For example: The ten weights you recorded for a pipette volume of 10µL are as follows: 9.89, 10.01, 10.02, 9.99, 9.95, 10.04, 9.96, 10.01, 9.99, and 9.98.
The average is: (9.89 + 10.01 + 10.02 + 9.99 + 9.95+ 10.04 + 9.96 + 10.01 + 9.99 + 9.98)/10 = 99.84/10 = 9.984

, Once you have determined the proper numbers to use for each variable, you can plug them into the equation and solve for the calculated volume. To solve, simply multiply the average weight of all the trials by the Z value.


For example: V = w * Z = 9.984 * 1.0035 = 10.019

, To calculate the accuracy you can use the equation A = 100 x Vavg/V0, where A is the accuracy of the pipette, Vavg is the average calculated volume and V0 is the value you set the pipette to dispense. Accuracy should be between 99-101%.If the pipette is properly calibrated, the calculated value should be very close to the actual value you set on the pipette.
For example: A = 100 x Vavg/V0 = 100 x 10.019/10 = 100 x 1.0019 = 100.19%
This particular pipette is properly calibrated.

, If your pipette does not pass the calibration test, stop using it for experiments immediately. Pipettes are very delicate and expensive pieces of lab equipment. You cannot fix the calibration yourself, so you will need to send them in for proper servicing. Alternatively, some companies will come to your lab and calibrate your pipettes there.Contact the company that makes your particular brand of pipette for servicing.

In this case it is iodine.;
,


Since there are 5 fluorine atoms, you will need 5 bonds.

,, The group numbers tell how many valence electrons an atom has.


Both iodine and fluorine are both in Group 7A, giving both atoms 7 electrons each.

,


Iodine has 7 and each fluorine has 7.
Since there are five fluorines, you have to multiply the seven electrons of one fluorine atom by five.
1(7) + 5(7) = 42 total electrons.

,


Remember to follow the Octet Rule.
Single bonds count for 2 electrons.
Therefore, give each fluorine atom 6 electrons.

,


Each fluorine atoms has 8 electrons around them including the bonding electrons.
This gives you 40 out of the 42 total electrons.

,


You must use the remaining two electrons; since all five fluorine atoms have eight electrons, place the remaining electrons on iodine.
Iodine is an exception to the Octet Rule because it can expand its orbitals since it has a ""d"" subshell.

, Remember that lone electron pairs do not participate in the molecular geometry. Use the bonds to draw sides of the shape.

,


In the case of iodine pentafluoride, iodine and four fluorine create a square for the base.

,


The shape of iodine pentafluoride looks like a pyramid with a square base.
Thus, the name of the molecular shape for iodine pentafluoride is square pyramidal.

,


Iodine has 5 bonds and 1 lone electron pair.
Each fluorine has 1 bond and 3 lone electron pairs.

,


Since iodine has a total of 5 bonds and 1 lone pair, the hybridization is sp3d2. The exponents on the subshells should add up to the number of bonds and lone pairs.
Fluorine has 1 bond and 3 lone pairs giving a total of 4, making the hybridization: sp3. Adding up the exponents, you get 4.

Write the symbols for all atoms in the molecule.,
Find the central atom.,
Add all of the bonds.,
Include unbound electrons.,
Look for dipoles.",How to Determine the Polarity of a Molecule1," Atomic symbols for atoms can be found on the periodic table. These symbols are used to represent each atom in a Lewis dot structure. Be sure not to mix up the symbols, as this would cause confusion.For example, if you are looking at a water molecule, you would write out O, H, and H.;
, The central atom is the atom that all (or at least most) of the other atoms is bonded to. Those atoms may or may not be bonded to each other as well. As a rule of thumb, central atoms are usually atoms with low electronegativity.The water molecule breaks this general trend since the oxygen atom (the most electronegative atom in the molecule) is the center atom.
Carbon dioxide is an example of a molecule that follows the trend of center atoms being less electronegative.

, Use the octet rule to determine the number and type of bonds present. Each atom’svalence shell should contain eight electrons for the molecule to be stable. Some atoms may be double or triple bonded to achieve this.You should add a single bond from the oxygen to both hydrogens. The hydrogens are not bonded to each other.

, While most electrons are used in bonding, some atoms have a set of non bonding electrons. These electrons should also be included in the Lewis structure, as they are very important when determining polarity. Represent all electrons (bonded and unbonded) with dots around their respective atoms.Oxygen has two lone pair electrons. This means they are not used for bonding, but stay attached to the oxygen.

, A dipole exists when electrons are unevenly distributed from one side of the molecule to the other. If this is present, then the molecule is polar. If the distribution looks even, the molecule is nonpolar.Since electrons are more attracted to oxygen than hydrogen, they tend to congregate on that end of the molecule. That gives the oxygen a negative charge and the hydrogens a positive charge, creating a dipole. Thus, water is polar.

Fill a beaker with water.,
Add a nonpolar solvent to a new beaker.,
Place equal amounts of the substance into each beaker.,
Stir and/or heat the mixtures.,
Allow both beakers to cool.,
Observe the outcomes.",How to Determine the Polarity of a Molecule2," Water is a polar solvent. Put 100 mL of water into a clean beaker. Set the beaker aside to come back to later., Nonpolar solvents include things like toluene, gasoline, and oils. Add 100 mL of a chosen nonpolar solvent to another beaker. Let this beaker sit beside the water beaker.Many nonpolar solvents fall into the category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are quite dangerous. Be careful when heating them, and always wear a mask and gloves.
For example, you could put vegetable oil into the second container. It is not volatile, but still acts as a nonpolar solvent.
Acetone is also relatively safe organic solvent, but you should still keep it away from fire and wear your mask and gloves. Acetone is a volatile compound.

, Put the substance in question into both beakers. Be sure to use the same amount in each beaker for consistency. You can start by adding 10-20 grams in each beaker (or 10-20 mL if the substance is a liquid).For example, you could put 20 mL of isopropyl alcohol into each beaker.

, The solvents may need to be heated or stirred to spur interaction. If this is the case, be sure that you stir and heat the solvents to the same degree. That said, heating organic solvents, such as toluene, is very dangerous and you should exercise caution.There is no need to heat when testing isopropyl alcohol. Stirring is sufficient.
If heating, use a hot plate and heat slowly. Do not heat organic solvents with a flame.

, Once the substance seems to have interacted with one or both of the solvents, let them each cool. This will give the substance a chance to separate from the solvent if it is not compatible. It also makes the samples easier for you to handle., Look for any solids or liquids separating from the solvent. This indicates that the substance is not compatible with that solvent. Since polar molecules are compatible with polar solvents and nonpolar molecules are compatible with nonpolar solvents, you can deduce that any substance that dissolves in water is polar. Any substance that does not dissolve in water, but dissolves in gasoline, toluene, acetone, or another nonpolar solvent is nonpolar.Once both beakers settle, you will notice that the isopropyl alcohol dissolved completely in the water. However, there will be two distinct layers where the alcohol separated from the vegetable oil in the second beaker. This shows that isopropyl alcohol is polar.

Bring the substance close to a magnet.,
Look for any interaction.,
Put the substance in question in a microwave.,
Turn on the microwave.,
Observe the substance.",How to Determine the Polarity of a Molecule3," If you bring a substance close to a magnet or magnetically charged object, you may be able to tell if it is polar or nonpolar. Place the substance on a bench and bring the magnet close. Avoid touching the substance with the magnet., If there is any attraction or repulsion from the magnet, your substance is polar. However, that does not mean that the substance is nonpolar if the magnet does not interact. Some polar molecules are not polarized enough to interact with a weak magnet.For example, if you have a running stream of water, a magnet will cause the stream to bend. This shows a clear interaction.

, Microwaves work by using high frequency electromagnetic radiation to cause polar molecules to spin. The spinning creates friction, which creates heat. To test the polarity of your substance, place it in the microwave.Never put metals, flammables, or explosives into a microwave.
If you put water in the microwave, you will notice that it gets hot. It is polar.
If you try putting baby oil in the microwave, you will notice that the microwave doesn’t seem to heat it very well. It is nonpolar.

, When the microwave comes on, the substance will be subjected the radiation. If it is a polar substance, the radiation will make the molecules spin (though this will not be visible). If the substance is nonpolar, the microwaves will have little effect., Look for signs of deformation or melting. Check to see whether the substance is hot. If the microwave affected the substance, it is polar."

Identify the rate equation from the reaction.,
Identify the order of each reactant.,
Add the order for all reactants together.",How to Determine Order of Reaction1," Only the rate equation can help you determine the order of the reaction. This equation shows the increase or decrease of a particular substance with respect to time. Other equations related to the chemical reaction will not help you identify the order of the reaction., Each reactant listed in the rate equation will have an exponent of either 0, 1, or 2 (above 2 is very rare). That exponent denotes the order of that reactant. Looking at each exponent:A zero means that the concentration for that reactant has no bearing on the rate of reaction.
A one means that increasing the concentration of this reactant will increase the rate of the reaction in a linear way (doubling the reactant doubles the rate).
A two means that the rate of the reaction will increase by the square of the increased concentration (doubling the reactant will increase the rate by four times).
Zero order reactants are often not listed in the rate equation, since any number to the zeroth power is equal to one.

, The overall order of a reaction is the sum of each reactants’ orders. Add the exponents of each reactant to find the overall reaction order. This number is usually less than or equal to two.For example, if reactant one is first order (an exponent of 1) and reactant two is first order (an exponent of 1) then the overall reaction would be a second order reaction.

In other words, the dependent variable will change as much in the first second as it does the second, third, and so on. A linear graph looks like a straight line on the page., This will indicate how much reactant remains at any given point during the reaction. If this graph is linear, it means that the concentration of the reactant has no bearing on the rate at which the reaction proceeds. In this case, the reactant is a zeroth order reactant., If graphing the natural log of the reactant results in a linear graph, the reactant is a first order reactant. This means that the concentration of the reactant impacts the rate of reaction. If the graph is not linear, you must graph test for a second order reaction., A linear graph of indicates a second order reaction. This means that the rate of the reaction will increase by the square of any increase in reactant. If this graph is not linear, you must try graphing zeroth and first order reactions., Once you have found a linear graph for each reactant, you will know the order of each reactant. This allows you to calculate the overall reaction order. Add all reactant orders together. This is your reaction order for the whole reaction."

In this case, both reactants are first order. The sum of two first order reactants is a second order reaction., If changing the concentration of a reactant produces no change in rate, that reactant is said to be of the zeroth order. In this case, both reactants are of the zeroth order. Reacting two zeroth order reactions gives you an overall reaction order of zero., The reactant that impacts the reaction rate is of the second order. The second reactant has no impact on rate and is of the zeroth order. The sum of orders is two, thus this is a second order reaction."

",How to Do a Simple Mass Balance," A material balance is accounting for all materials entering and exiting a system.;
, A mass flow rate is how much unit of mass is flowing through a process per unit of time.

, A mass fraction is (mass of a substance)/(total mass). This can also be called weight percent, wt%.

, A mass ratio is how much of a substance in a system relative to another substance.

, A flow chart is a drawn representation of the system you are working with.

, A degrees of freedom analysis is meant to make sure the problem is solvable. The user needs to compare the number of unknown variables to the number of independent equations they can use.


The degrees of freedom equation is given by:

, Try to understand what the author is asking us to find. For example, your question might be:


Strawberries contain about 15 wt% sugar and 85 wt% water. To make strawberry jam, crushed strawberries and sugar are mixed in a 45:55 mass ratio, and the mixture is heated to evaporate water until the residue contains one-third water by mass.

Draw and label a flowchart of this process
Do the degree-of-freedom analysis and show that the system has zero degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of unknown process variables equals the number of equations relating them). If you have too many unknowns, think about what you might have forgotten to do.
Calculate how many pounds of strawberries are needed to make a pound of jam.



, Write down what is know from the problem description.



Knowns:

Mass fraction of the solid (sugar) in the strawberries is 0.15 and mass fraction of water in the strawberries is 0.85.
The mass fraction of sugar in 1.00lb of jam is 0.667 (lb Suagr)/(lb Jam) and the mass fraction of water is 0.333 (lb water)/(lb Jam)

You know this because we are told that the jam is heated until (1/3) of the mass of the jam is water.


The mass of strawberry to mass of sugar ratio is 45:55 ratio.



,


Draw the mixer.
Draw stream 1 entering the mixer: m1 (lb of strawberries)

0.85 (lb water)/(lb Jam)
0.15 (lb Suagr)/(lb Jam)


Draw stream 2 entering the mixer: m2 (lb of sugar)
Draw stream 3 leaving the mixer: m3
(1/3) lb of water left
So, 0.333 (lb water)/(lb Jam)
0.667 (lb Suagr)/(lb Jam)


Draw Stream 4 coming out of the mixer: m4 (lb of evaporated water)

Stream 4 is the excess water that is evaporated.



,



Unknowns:

m1 (mass of strawberries), m2 (mass of sugar), m3 (mass of evaporated water)
Therefore, nunknowns = 3



Independent Equations:

The mass balance equation for water and sugar, the mass ratio of sugar to strawberries.
nind.eqns = 3


Plug in these numbers into the degrees of freedom equation.
Therefore there are no degrees of freedom and the problem is solvable.

, In this case, you are asked to calculate how many pounds of strawberry is needed for 1lb of jam.

You know the above ratio. You can solve for m1.

Identify any metals.,
Note any non metals.,
Consider valence electrons for each atom.",How to Determine Bond Polarity1," Metals are typically shiny and malleable. They often have loosely bound electrons. That means that they have weaker electronegativity than many nonmetals. This allows metals to “give” some of their electrons to nonmetals, resulting in a dipole.A dipole is when a bond has a positive and negative charge at either end. The presence of a dipole indicates a polar bond.;
, Non metals are usually hard and brittle, and lack luster (shine). They often have a greater electronegativity than metals. This means that they can “take” the electrons from the metal atoms to which they are bound. This will create a dipole in the bond., The valence electrons of an atom are the ones that reside in its outer shell. For the most part, atoms follow the octet rule, meaning that eight valence electrons will create the most stable configuration. Atoms with nearly eight are likely to “take” other electrons, while atoms with only one or two valence electrons are likely to “give” up their outer electrons.For example, sodium (Na) has one valence electron, and chlorine (Cl) has seven. When they bond, they form the salt sodium chloride (NaCl) because the sodium gives up its one valence electron and the chlorine accepts it. This is a polar bond.

"
"
Account for the electron affinity of each atom.,
Consider the ionization energy for each atom.,
Utilize the periodic table trends.",How to Determine Bond Polarity2," The electron affinity of an atom is the measure of how likely that atom is to “take” electrons from another atom. Electron affinity grows as you go from left to right across the periodic table, and up from bottom to top. In other words, small, non metallic atoms tend to have the highest electron affinity.Electron affinity is one component of the atom’s electronegativity.
Some atoms with high electron affinity are fluorine, chlorine, oxygen, and nitrogen.
A few low affinity atoms are sodium, calcium, and hydrogen.

, Ionization energy is the amount of energy needed to remove an electron from any particular atom. The ionization energy rises as you go from left to right across the periodic table, and from bottom to top. This means that small, non metallic atoms are the hardest atoms from which to remove electrons. Large, metallic atoms are the easiest.Ionization energy is the other component of the atom’s electronegativity.

, By looking at the periodic table, you can tell a lot about how polar a bond will be between any two atoms. Atoms at the top right of the table will tend to ionize and hold a negative charge. Atoms on the far left of the table tend to form positive ions. Atoms in the middle of the table form less polar bonds."
"
Consider all nonpolar bonds covalent.,
Recognize polar covalent bonds.,
Categorize ionic bonds.",How to Determine Bond Polarity3," By definition, a non polar bond must be covalent. That means that electrons are shared evenly from one atom to the next. A truly nonpolar bond has a negativity difference of zero between the two atoms.For example, hydrogen gas (H2) forms a nonpolar bond between the two hydrogen atoms because they have the exact same electronegativity.

, Polar covalent bonds are formed when you have two atoms with similar (but not identical) electronegativities. This generally happens between two nonmetals, and has a weak dipole. These bonds have an electronegativity difference that is greater than zero, but less than two.For example, a carbon hydrogen bond is weakly polar, making it a polar covalent bond.

, Ionic bonds usually form between metals and non metals. When each atom ionizes to an anion or cation, there is a strong dipole. Ionic bonds have atoms with an electronegativity difference greater than two.Bonds between calcium and chlorine are ionic.

"
"
Determine the polarity of table salt.,
Find the difference in electronegativity for carbon and hydrogen.,
Give an example of a truly nonpolar bond between two different atoms.",How to Determine Bond Polarity4," Table salt bears the chemical formula NaCl, as it is comprised of one sodium and one chlorine atom. To determine the polarity of table salt, you can find that the electronegativity of sodium is 0.9 and that of chlorine is 3.0. You will find the difference between the two electronegativities to be 2.1, which means that table salt is held together by an ionic bond (and thus is polar).

You could also make a reasonable assumption that the bond is polar simply by noticing where each atom lies on the periodic table.

, Start by looking at a periodic table that lists electronegativities. You will find that of hydrogen to be 2.1 and that of carbon to be 2.5. The difference between the two is 0.4, meaning that a carbon-hydrogen bond is (slightly) polar., To accomplish this, you must look at a periodic table that lists electronegativities. Locate two atoms that have identical electronegativities. These two atoms will form a covalent bond.

For example, hydrogen and tellurium will form a covalent bond.

Learn about ionic compounds.,
Understand solubility.,
Study the rules of solubility.,
Compounds are soluble if they contain alkali metals, including Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+.,
Compounds of NO3-, C2H3O2-, NO2-, ClO3-, and ClO4- are soluble.,
Compounds of Cl-, Br-, and I- are usually soluble.,
Compounds containing SO42- are usually soluble.,
Compounds containing OH- or S2- are insoluble.,
Compounds containing CO32- or PO43- are insoluble.",How to Determine Solubility1," Each atom normally has a certain number of electrons, but sometimes they pick up an extra electron, or lose one. The result is an ion, which has an electric charge. When an ion with a negative charge (an extra electron) meets an ion with a positive charge (missing an electron), they bond together just like the negative and positive ends of two magnets. The result is an ionic compound.


Ions with negative charges are called anions, while ions with positive charges are cations.
Normally, the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons, canceling out the electrical charges.;
, Water molecules (H2O) have an unusual structure, which makes them similar to a magnet: one end has a positive charge, while the other has a negative. When you drop an ionic compound in water, these water ""magnets"" will gather around it, trying to pull the positive and negative ions apart. Some ionic compounds aren't stuck together very well; these are soluble since the water will pull them apart and dissolve them. Other compounds are bonded more strongly, and are insoluble since they can stick together despite the water molecules.Some compounds have internal bonds that are similar in strength to the pull of the water. These are called slightly soluble, since a significant amount of compounds will be pulled apart, but the rest will stay together.

, Because the interactions between atoms are quite complex, it's not always intuitive which compounds are soluble and which are insoluble. Look up the first ion in the compound on the list below to find out how it usually behaves, then check the exceptions to make sure the second ion doesn't have an unusual interaction.


For example, to check Strontium Chloride (SrCl2), look for Sr or Cl in the bold steps below. Cl is ""usually soluble,"" so check underneath it for exceptions. Sr is not listed as an exception, so SrCl2 must be soluble.
The most common exceptions to each rule are written beneath it. There are other exceptions, but you are unlikely to encounter them in a typical chemistry class or laboratory.

, These are also called the Group IA elements: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium. Almost every single compound that includes one of these ions is soluble.



Exception: Li3PO4 is insoluble.

, Respectively, these are the nitrate, acetate, nitrite, chlorate, and perchlorate ions. Note that acetate is often abbreviated OAC.Exceptions: Ag(OAc) (silver acetate) and Hg(OAc)2 (mercury acetate) are insoluble.
AgNO2- and KClO4- are only ""slightly soluble.""

, The chloride, bromide, and iodide ions almost always make soluble compounds, called halogen salts.



Exception: If any of these pair with the ions silver Ag+, mercury Hg22+, or lead Pb2+, the result is insoluble. The same is true of less common compounds made from pairing with copper Cu+ and thallium Tl+.

, The sulfate ion generally forms soluble compounds, but there are several exceptions.



Exceptions: The sulfate ion forms insoluble compounds with the following ions: strontium Sr2+, barium Ba2+, lead Pb2+, silver Ag+, calcium Ca2+, radium Ra2+, and diatomic silver Ag22+. Note that silver sulfate and calcium sulfate dissolve just enough that some people call them slightly soluble.

, These are the hydroxide and sulfide ions, respectively.



Exceptions: Remember the alkali metals (Group I-A) and how they love forming soluble compounds? Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ all form soluble compounds with the hydroxide or sulfide ions. In addition, hydroxide forms soluble salts with the alkali earth (Group II-A) ions: calcium Ca2+, strontium Sr2+, and barium Ba2+. Note that the compounds resulting from hydroxide and an alkali earth do have just enough molecules that stay bonded to sometimes be considered ""slightly soluble.""

, One last check for carbonate and phosphate ions, and you should know what to expect from your compound.



Exceptions: These ions form soluble compounds with the usual suspects, the alkali metals Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+, as well as with ammonium NH4+.

Look at the data.,
Determine the number of grams for each element.,
Convert the mass of each element to moles.,
Divide each mole value by the smallest number of moles present.,
Multiply the ratio values to find near whole numbers.,
Round the values to nearest whole numbers.,
Write your final answer.",How to Determine an Empirical Formula1," If you are given the elemental composition of an unknown compound in percentages rather than grams, you should assume that there are exactly 100.0 grams of the substance involved.


These are the instructions you should follow if the above is true. If you are given the elemental composition of an unknown substance in grams, see the section on ""Using Weight in Grams.""

Example: Determine the empirical formula of a compound made from 29.3% Na (sodium), 41.1% S (sulfur), and 29.6% O (oxygen).;
, Based on the assumption that there are 100 grams of the unknown substance, you can determine that the number of grams present for each element equals the percentage value of each element mentioned in the problem.



Example: For 100 g of unknown substance, there are 29.3 g Na, 41.1 g S, and 29.6 g O.

, The mass of each element in your composition, presently expressed in grams, will need to be converted into moles. To do so, each mass must be multiplied by the mole ratio per their respective atomic weights.


In simpler terms, you will need to divide each mass by the atomic weight of that element.
Also note that the atomic weights used in this calculation should include at least four significant figures.

Example: For a compound with 29.3 g Na, 41.1 g S, and 29.6 g O:

29.3 g Na * (1 mol S / 22.99 g Na) = 1.274 mol Na
41.1 g S * (1 mol S / 32.06 g S) = 1.282 mol S
29.6 g O * (1 mol O / 16.00 g O) = 1.850 mol O



, You will need a stochiometric comparison between the elements in your compound, which essentially means that you need to calculate how much of an element you have in relation to the other elements present in your compound. To do this, divide each number of moles by the smallest number of moles present.



Example: The smallest number of moles present in the compound is 1.274 moles (the number of moles for Na, sodium).

1.274 mol Na / 1.274 mol = 1.000 Na
1.282 mol S / 1.274 mol = 1.006 S
1.850 mol O / 1.274 mol = 1.452 O



, The amount of moles present for each element may not equal whole numbers. For small values that are within a tenth value away from a whole number, this does not present a problem. Once you have an excess value exceeding this amount, however, you should multiply the ratio values as needed to bring that value up to a whole number.


If one element has a value near 0.5, multiply each element by 2. Similarly, if one element has a value near 0.25, multiply each element by 4.

Example: Since the amount of oxygen (O) present is close to 1.5, you will need to multiply each value by “2” to bring the ratio of oxygen closer to a whole number.

1.000 Na * 2 = 2.000 Na
1.006 S * 2 = 2.012 S
1.452 O * 2 = 2.904 O



, Even after the last step, the amount of moles present for each element may not be in exact whole numbers. Since no decimals are used in empirical formulas, you will need to round each value to its nearest whole number.



Example: For the ratio determined in the previous step:

2.000 Na can be written as 2 Na.
2.012 S can be rounded down to 2 S.
2.904 O can be rounded up to 3 O.



, Translate the ratio of elements into the standard format used for empirical formula. The molecular amount of each element should be indicated in subscript beside its respective element's symbol for all amounts greater than one.



Example: For a compound that is 2 parts Na, 2 parts S, and 3 parts O, the empirical formula should be written as: Na2S2O3

Look up the product solubility constant Ksp.,
Write the chemical equation.,
Modify the equation to use variables.,
Account for common ions, if present.,
Solve the equation.",How to Determine Solubility2," This constant is different for each compound, so you'll need to look it up on a chart in your textbook or online. Because these values are determined experimentally, they can vary widely between charts, so it's best to go with your textbook's chart if it has one. Unless otherwise specified, most charts assume you are working at 25ºC (77ºF).


For example, if you're dissolving lead iodide, or PbI2, write down its product solubility constant. If referring to the chart at bilbo.chm.uri.edu, use the constant 7.1×10–9.

, First, determine how the compound splits apart into ions when it dissolves. Next, write an equation with the Ksp on one side and the constituent ions on the other.


For example, a molecule of PbI2 splits into the ions Pb2+, I-, and a second I-. (You only need to know or look up the charge on one ion, since you know the total compound will always have a neutral charge.)
Write the equation 7.1×10–9 = 2


, Rewrite the equation as a simple algebra problem, using what you know about the number of molecules and ions. Set x equal to the amount of the compound that will dissolve, and rewrite the variables representing the numbers of each ion in terms of x.


In our example, we need to rewrite 7.1×10–9 = 2

Since there is one lead ion (Pb2+) in the compound, the number of dissolved compound molecules will be equal to the number of free lead ions. So we can set to x.
Since there are two iodine ions (I-) for each lead ion, we can set the number of iodine atoms equal to 2x.
The equation is now 7.1×10–9 = (x)(2x)2


, Skip this step if you are dissolving the compound in pure water. If the compound is being dissolved into a solution that already contains one or more of the constituent ions (a ""common ion""), however, the solubility is significantly decreased.The common ion effect is most notable in compounds that are mostly insoluble, and in these cases you can assume that the vast majority of the ions at equilibrium come from the ion already present in the solution. Rewrite the equation to include the known molar concentration (moles per liter, or M) of the ions already in the solution, replacing the value of x you used for that ion.For example, if our lead iodide compound was being dissolved in a solution with 0.2 M lead chloride (PbCl2), we would rewrite our equation as 7.1×10–9 = (0.2M+x)(2x)2. Then, since 0.2M is such a higher concentration than x, we can safely rewrite it as 7.1×10–9 = (0.2M)(2x)2.

, Solve for x, and you'll know how soluble the compound is. Because of how the solubility constant is defined, your answer will be in terms of moles of the compound dissolved, per liter of water. You may need a calculator to find the final answer.


The following is for solubility in pure water, not with any common ions.
7.1×10–9 = (x)(2x)2

7.1×10–9 = (x)(4x2)
7.1×10–9 = 4x3

(7.1×10–9) ÷ 4 = x3

x = ∛((7.1×10–9) ÷ 4)
x = 1.2 x 10-3 moles per liter will dissolve. This is a very small amount, so you know this compound is essentially insoluble.

Consider the number of grams.,
Convert the mass of each element into moles.,
Divide each mole value by the smallest calculated number.,
Multiply the ratio values to find near whole numbers.,
Round your answer to the nearest whole number.,
Write the final answer.",How to Determine an Empirical Formula2," If you are given the elemental composition of an unknown substance in grams, you will need to proceed according to the following instructions.


On the other hand, if you are given the composition in percentages instead of grams, see the instructions on ""Using Weight Percentages.""

Example: Determine the empirical formula of an unknown substance made from 8.5 g Fe (iron) and 3.8 g O (oxygen.)

, To determine the molecular ratio of elements in the compound, you need to convert the amount of each element from grams to moles. Do so by dividing the mass in grams for each element by the elements' respective atomic weights.


From a more technical perspective, you are actually multiplying the mass in grams by the mole ratio per atomic weight.
Note that the atomic weight should be rounded to four significant places to maintain a certain degree of accuracy in your calculations.

Example: When there are 8.5 g Fe and 3.8 g O:

8.5 g Fe * (1 mol Fe / 55.85 g Fe) = 0.152 mol Fe
3.8 g O * (1 mol O / 16.00 g O) = 0.238 mol O



, Determine how much of each element is present when compared to the other elements in the compound. In order to calculate this, you will need to identify the smallest number of moles present and divide each number of moles by that number.



Example: For this problem, the smallest amount of moles present is 0.152 moles (the amount of Fe, iron, present).

0.152 mol Fe / 0.152 mol = 1.000 Fe
0.238 mol O / 0.152 mol = 1.566 O



, Oftentimes, the moles present for each substance may not equal a whole number. If the excess is within one-tenth, you can simply round it off. For excess values that exceed this, however, you will need to multiply each value by a number that can bring the ratio value nearer to a whole number.


For instance, if one element has an excess near 0.25, multiply each element amount by 4. If an element has an excess near 0.5, multiply each element amount by 2.

Example: Since the ratio amount of oxygen equals 1.566, you will need to multiply both ratio amounts by 2.

1.000 Fe * 2 = 2.000 Fe
1.566 O * 2 = 3.132 O



, Once the ratio values of all elements in the compound are roughly within one-tenth of a whole number, you can round off any difference to the nearest whole number.



Example: The amount of Fe can be written as 2. The amount of O can be rounded down to 3.

, The ratio of elements should be rewritten in empirical formula form. Each ratio value should be indicated in subscript beside its respective element's symbol, unless the ratio value equals one.



Example: For a compound that is 2 parts Fe and 3 parts O, the empirical formula is: Fe2O3

Determine if the subscripts can be reduced.,
Find the greatest common factor between the subscripts.,
Divide each subscript by the greatest common factor.,
Write the final answer.",How to Determine an Empirical Formula3," If you have the molecular formula of an unknown compound but are told to identify the compound by its empirical formula, you need to determine if the formula can be reduced. Look at the subscripts for each element present. If all three subscripts share at least one common factor (other than the number 1), you will need to take a few more steps to determine the compound's empirical formula.



Example: C8H16O8

On the other hand, if the subscripts do not all share a common factor, the molecular formula is also the empirical formula.


Example: Fe3O2H7




, Write the factors of each subscript within your formula. Identify which factor is greatest in value.



Example: For C8H16O8, the subscripts are ""4"" and ""8.""

The factors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8
The factors of 16 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16
The greatest common factor (GCF) between the two numbers is 8.



, To get each subscript in its simplest form, you will need to divide all subscripts present in the formula by the GCF you just found.



Example: For C8H16O8:

Divide the subscript of 8 by the GCF of 8: 8 / 8 = 1
Divide the subscript of 16 by the GCF of 8: 16 / 8 = 2



, Replace your original subscripts with their simplified values. In doing so, you have determined the compound's empirical formula from its molecular formula.


Note that values of 1 are not usually indicated with subscripts.

Example: C8H16O8 = CH2O

The concept of heat capacity is derived from the thermodynamic science and is a thermodynamic quantity that is defined as the rate of change of the energy of the given system as a function of temperature.,
Usually large value of the heat capacity means that the system is able to absorb much heat without significant change in the temperature of the system.,
We start from the relativistic energy equation of a photon and differentiate it with respect to the temperature T. Thus:

,
E=p*c

dE/dT=(dp/dT)*c






The first term is nothing but the heat capacity at constant volume Cv.,Dr/dt is the expression of the velocity and

,
dT/dr is the rate of change of temperature as a function of the place.,Q=k*(dT/dr)

,
Thus the final expression of Cv looks like this:


Cv=F1*c/{(Q/K)*v}=F1*c*K/(Q*v)

,
Here Q is the heat that is conducted in the system.

,
Now an expression for Cp or the heat capacity at constant pressure will be derived.

,
At constant pressure we have:


Q=H=E+PV






Cp is by definition the rate of change of the heat at constant pressure as a function of temperature.,
For an ideal gas of photons we have:

dE/dT=Cv and at constant pressure we have






d(PV)=P*dV/dT Thus we obtain:






Cp=Cv+PdV/dT







,
We then get an expression for dV/dT from the equation of the ideal gas: PV=nRT Thus we obtain:

,dV/dT=nR/P

,
Substituting this expression for dV/dT in the above equation for Cp we get:

,Cp = Cv + nR

,
We remember that:

Cv = F1*c*K/(Q*v).",How to Derive Mathematical Expressions for the Heat Capactities at Constant Volume and Pressure for an Ideal Gas of Photons," There are two variations of heat capacities. One is defined at constant volume and the other is defined at constant pressure. Heat capacity is a measure of the given system's ability to absorb heat as a function of the change in temperature.;
, An example of such a system is the molecule of water which has high value of its heat capacity. Small value of the heat capacity usually means that a dramatic change in the temperature of the system is associated with little absorption of heat from the surrounding. In what follows the mathematical expressions of both heat capacities at constant volume and pressure will be derived for an ideal gas of photons.

,, Thus we have:


Cv=(dp/dT)*c






Dp/dT does not have any significant physical value. Therefore we try to change the differentiation of p from T to t which is the time. Thus we get:


Cv=(dp/dt)*(dt/dT)*c






Dp/dt is known as the force F1. Dt/dT is the inverse of the rate of change of temperature as a function of time. This is still a not convenient expression. Therefore we change the differentiation from T to r which is the displacement. Thus we get:


Cv=(dp/dt)*c/(dT/dt)






Cv=(dp/dt)*c/{(dT/dr)*(dr/dt)}






This expression has more familiar terms that have physical significance.
Dp/dt is the force F1



,, This is a well known term in the equation for heat conduction:

,,,,, Thus one has:


dQ/dT=Cp=dH/dT=dE+d(PV)






Cp=dE/dT+d(PV)/dT







,,,,,, Thus we obtain the following expression for Cp:






Cp = F1*c*K/{Q*v} + nR

Learn the theory.,
Use a derivation of the equation of an ideal gas of photons based on the recent theory of photons that are related through an equation of forces and velocities of light photons.,
By using the ideal gas law PV=nRT, one can isolate V in terms of the other components so that one has the following expression:


V=nRT/P

,
By substituting this value of V into the equation of dG one gets:


dG=nRT*dP/P

,
By integrating both sides of the equation one gets the following formula for G:


G = nRT*ln(P2/P1)

,
We know, however, from previous work the following equation: F1*L=nRT*ln(V2/V1), that we can change the Pressure function in the mathematical expression for G to the volume using the ideal gas equation:


PV=nRT

,
By doing so the mathematical expression for G looks now like this:


G = nRT*ln(V1/V2)

,
We want now to write the expression of G in terms of parameters of the photon equation of forces.

,
By doing so one gets the following mathematical expression:


G = -F1*L

,
Summarize.",How to Derive a Mathematical Expression for the Free Energy of Gibbs of an Ideal Gas of Photons," The free energy of Gibbs is a thermodynamic function that is formulated under the on control of the temperature and pressure. his basic thermodynamic function has importance especially in predicting spontaneous direction of chemical reactions. Its absolute value is indicative about the direction of the chemical reaction.


For example, a positive value of this function usually signifies a non-spontaneous direction of the chemical reaction.
Also, a negative value of this thermodynamic function is usually indicative of a spontaneous process of the thermodynamic reaction. A zero value of the free energy of Gibbs usually signifies an equilibrium state of the chemical reaction. Therefore, this thermodynamic function is predominantly used to predict the direction of spontaneity of thermodynamic processes.;
, The free energy of Gibbs has the following general mathematical structure: G=H-TS. It can be shown that at constant temperature the free energy of Gibbs has the following differential form:


dG=VdP






This expression is correct for an ideal gas at constant temperature.

,,,,,,,, This simple mathematical expression relates the free energy of Gibbs of an ideal gas of photons to the force F1 in terms of the work that is done by this force along the distance L.


If the force F1 sign is positive then this means that the G is negative and the process that involves the photons is spontaneous.
If the sign of the force F1 is negative then this means that the value of G is positive and the process that involves the photons is then non-spontaneous.

Understand the importance of water regulation in the body.,
Learn about the biological constituents of the blood plasma of humans.,
Study the medical disorders that are associated with water balance disturbances in the body of humans.,
Be familiar with the main hormones that affect water levels in the body of humans.,
Study the clinical manifestations that are associated with water level disturbances in the body.,
Learn how hormones are deactivated after the completion of their physiological role in the body.",How to Be Familiar With the Hormonal Regulation of Water in the Body of Humans," The regulation of water level in the body is a very important physiological process that helps in sustaining proper functioning of all the systems of the body. This is so particularly due to the fact the blood plasma is predominantly composed of water that functions as the solvent and carrier medium for all nutrients of the body and for cellular components of the immune system. Also the water of the blood plasma is the carrier medium for oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules that travel in the blood bound to hemoglobin molecules to and from the lungs. In addition hormones of the endocrine system function appropriately due to the assistance of water as a carrier medium of the blood plasma that transports these important molecules to the various tissues of the body.;
, The blood plasma contains water as well as dissolved electrolytes such as sodium and potassium ions in addition to other organic compounds such as water soluble vitamins and proteins that are water soluble. These water soluble proteins can function as a facilitating factor for the solutilization of water insoluble compounds such as the steroidal hormones. Water insoluble compounds in the body use simple mechanism to increase their solubility in the blood plasma by chemically binding to water soluble macromolecules such as proteins and carbohydrates. For all these reasons we see the importance of this essential medium for the sustaining of life in humans. For these reasons also the regulation of the level of this compound in the blood is regulated by more than two hormones of the body of humans.

, Disturbances in the volume of blood plasma as manifested by low or high volume of water can lead to clinical symptoms that can be associated with hypertension or states of shock (hypovolemia). There are three main known regulators of water level in the blood and the extra cellular space. Two of them are protein hormones while the third is a steroidal hormone. The steroidal hormone that participates in the regulation of water in the blood is called aldosterone. It does this indirectly by regulating the level of sodium ions in the body. Water is linked to the sodium regulation in the body by an osmotic effect that the concentration of sodium in the extra cellular space exerts. This effect is called osmotic effect.

, Increased level of aldosterone in the blood leads to the increased retention of sodium ions. The accumulation of this ion in the body leads also to the retention of water by an osmotic effect. Water in this case follows sodium ions. This hormone is one main regulator of water level in the body. Disturbances in the concentration of this hormone in the body can lead to clinical symptoms that are mainly associated with either increased blood pressure or low blood pressure. In the case of hypertension that results from an excessive amount of this hormone in the body edema of water accumulation in the cavities of the body can result. These are the main clinical symptoms that are associated with water level disturbances in the body as a result of changes in the concentration of this hormone in the blood. Aldosterone is a steroidal hormone that usually travels in the blood plasma using a water soluble carrier molecule that is usually either a protein or a carbohydrate molecule. The other main regulator of water level in the blood is the hormone vasopressin. This is essentially the main regulator of water in the body. It has direct effects on the level of water in the blood. Vasopressin is a polypeptide hormone of approximately 10 amino acids chain length. This hormone has immense physiological effects on the level of water in the blood plasma.

, Disturbances in the concentration of this hormone in the body have drastic clinical manifestations on the affected individual. This hormone is synthesized and secreted by specialized cells of the posterior pituitary gland. The mechanism of its function as related to the regulation of water in the body is well understood and is presumed to involve binding of this hormone to cellular receptors in the kidneys. For this reason proper functioning of the kidney cells is important also for keeping constant levels of water in the body. Vasopressin is usually deactivated in the liver cells by the effect of appropriate enzymes that can modify its chemical structure. Liver failure for this reason can affect water level in the body due to the inability of the liver to neutralize this hormone which sustains its activity endlessly.

, All hormones of the body share this common characteristic of being neutralized chemically in the liver cells after performing its physiological function in the body. The third less important hormone of the body that has effect on water level in the body is called atrial natriuretic peptide. This is a protein hormone that is synthesized and secreted by specialized cells of the heart. This hormone is observed experimentally to lower blood pressure of people who have hypertension. This protein hormone is however less significant in its physiological effect than either the vasopressin or the aldosterone hormones. Other non-hormonal factors that contribute to the balance of water in the body include the level of electrolytes in the blood predominantly sodium ions which prevalent in the blood plasma and the extracellular spaces.

Few people can get any income from searching for creatures.Even if you manage to publish a book on cryptozoology, you may not make much money. Cryptozoology for most people is a passion, not a career.
Keep in mind that much of cryptozoology consists of travel. It is recommended that you do not pursue this field if you do not like to travel.
Cryptozoology can be an expensive hobby. Some common costs include travel, recording equipment, and DNA testing on samples.;
, While you may have a general interest in cryptids, you might want to choose one or two cryptids to focus your research on. You might choose based on geographical region or type of animal (hominid, sea creature, primate, etc.). Some cryptids you might consider include:



Bigfoot: This cryptid is also known as a yeti, Sasquatch, or skunk ape. While many believe that bigfoot is not real, some speculate that it is really an undiscovered giant primate.Since big foot sightings are reported around the world, this may be a good place to start if you cannot travel far.

El Chupacabra: El Chupacabra is a creature believed to live in South America. They are reported to suck the blood of livestock.Ebu Gogo: the ebu gogo is a small, human-like creature that exists within the folklore of Indonesia. It is very aggressive and will eat anything., Cryptozoologists often need expertise in many different fields. Try reading up on as much biology, zoology, psychology, anthropology, and conservation as you can. This will help you understand the behavior and biology of certain cryptids.


Look into areas related to your cryptid. For example, if you are interested in sea creatures, you might read up on marine biology.There is no accredited degree for cryptozoology available. Online programs promising to offer degrees in it do not have accreditation., Most fieldwork involves going to isolated and uninhabited areas to search for cryptids. To make sure that you can survive in these regions, train yourself in wilderness survival, first aid, hunting, and other useful techniques.


Pick up skills that will help hunt your specific cryptid. For example, if you are interested in the orang pendek of Sumatra, you may want to learn to speak Indonesian. Since it lives in trees, you may want to practice climbing trees., Once you have decided to focus on a particular cryptid, you should do as much research as you can on the creature. Other cryptozoologists have likely done work on this cryptid. Start by reading field reports, books, and studies done on the cryptid., While you should read texts by cryptozoologists, you should also do some scientific and anthropological research as well. Find out what scientists think so that you can consider both sides of the argument.


For example, many scientists think that most cases of El Chupacabra are really just coyotes with mange., Many stories about cryptids are recorded in local folklore, myths, and urban legends. Read the folklore of the region you are travelling to. These stories can tell you the various names for the cryptid, what it eats, where it lives, what time of day it comes out, and how to find one.

, Many cryptids hide within natural features of their environment, such as trees or caves. Many are well-adapted to their regions. To make sure you that you can successfully find the cryptid, examine the geographical features of its natural habitat.


For example, if you are going after the Loch Ness Monster, look into the geographical features of the Loch Ness area, such as the Great Glen Fault and the River Ness.

, If your cryptid lives in another part of the world, you should start saving some money to visit it. Research the specific areas where the creature lives.


Plan to give yourself plenty of time in the area to search for the creature. You probably will not encounter them in a day or two.
You should only travel far away if you believe that the creature really does exist. If you are uncertain, you may not want to spend the money, or you may decide to look for a cryptid closer to home.

, Whether you are traveling far away or close to home, you should pack the proper supplies for your journey. What you need may vary based on where you’re traveling and which cryptid you are looking for. In general, you will need:


Camera and recording equipment
Audio recorder
Sterile collecting bottles, vials, and bags
Latex gloves
Markers to label samples
Ruler and/or measuring tape
Magnifying glass
Logbook or journal, You should listen to what other people have seen and heard about the creature.You can ask local librarians, policemen, town officials, and historians.These eyewitness accounts can give you clues about how to find the cryptid.


Some questions you might want to ask include: “What can you tell me about the bunyip?”; “Have you seen a bunyip yourself? If so, where?”; and “How does one find a bunyip?”
If you are about to head out into the wilderness or if you are in an unfamiliar part of the world, you may want to consider hiring a local guide.

, Fieldwork is the process of collecting evidence while out in the areas where the cryptid lives. Fieldwork includes taking samples, recording audio and video, and tracking footprints.


Take pictures of everything. If the creature is shy, you can set up a camera with an automatic timer, and leave the area for a while.
If you find feces, bone, or hair, use tweezers to place the sample in a bag. Label each bag with what it is, when you collected it, and where you found it.
If you find a footprint, measure it with a ruler or tape measure. Take a picture of the footprint with the ruler beside it.Write everything down. Keep a log book of everything that you do, see, hear, and find. Be as detailed as possible.

, Sometimes you may arrive at the conclusion that your cryptid does not exist. All is not lost, however. You can simply enjoy the fact that you had an interesting experience.

, The easiest way to talk about your cryptozoological work is to start an online blog. Publish pictures, DNA test results, recent sightings, and speculation. If you kept a log book during your fieldwork, you can publish entries from the logbook.


If you keep comments open on your blog, you can hear from other cryptozoologists. They may have information related to one of your mysteries.
Blogs are also a great way to solicit donations for your travels and research.

, While you may not become rich writing a cryptozoological book, you can make a little extra money on the side.A book requires extensive research. You can publish it traditionally or make an ebook.

, There is a large community of active cryptozoologists who would love to hear about your research and findings. Online forums, blogs, and newsletters regularly advertise the latest discoveries. You may even find other people to form a research team with.


Look to see if there is a cryptozoological association in your local area. If there is not, you might try starting one yourself.

Dispose of materials.",How to Gram Stain," Put on gloves and tie back long hair to prevent contaminating the bacteria sample you'll be testing. Disinfect a workspace under the fume hood, or in another well-ventilated area. Check that the bunsen burner and microscope are functional before you begin.;
, If the glass slide is dirty, wash it in soapy water to remove grease and dirt. Disinfect the slide with ethanol, glass cleaner, or whichever method is recommended by your laboratory.

, You can use the Gram stain method to help identify bacteria present in medical samples, or bacterial cultures grown in a petri dish. In order for the Gram stain to be useful, add a thin layer of the sample on the stain. A sample under 24 hours old is recommended, as older bacteria may have damaged cell walls that respond less predictably to gram staining.If using a tissue sample, add 1–2 drops onto the glass slide. Spread it evenly on the slide to form a thin smear, using the edge of a second sterilized glass slide. Allow it to air dry before continuing.
If taking bacteria from a petri dish, sterilize an inoculation loop in a Bunsen burner flame until it glows, then let it cool. Use it to place a drop of sterile water on the slide, then sterilize and cool the loop again before transferring a tiny sample of bacteria and gently stirring into the water.Bacteria in broth should be mixed in a vortexer, then added with an inoculation loop as above, without adding the extra water.If you have a swab sample, roll the swab lightly across the slide., Heat will fix the bacteria to the slide, so they are not as easily rinsed off during the stain. Quickly pass the slide two to three times through a Bunsen burner flame, or heat it on top of an electric slide warmer. Do not overheat, or the samples may become distorted. If using a Bunsen burner, the flame should be a small, blue cone, not a tall orange one.Alternatively, the smear may be fixed by methanol instead, by adding 1-2 drops of methanol onto the dried smear, draining off the excess methanol, and allowing it to air dry. This method minimises damage to host cells, giving a cleaner background.

, A staining tray is a shallow metal, glass, or plastic dish with a small mesh or wire support running across the top. Place the slide on top of this support, so the liquids you'll be using can drain down into the tray.


If you do not have a staining tray, the slide can be placed directly on top of a plastic ice cube tray., Use a pipette to flood the bacteria sample with several drops of crystal violet dye, sometimes called gentian violet. Wait thirty to sixty seconds. Crystal violet (CV) dissociates in aqueous solutions into CV+ and chloride (Cl–) ions. These ions penetrate through the cell wall and cell membrane of both gram-positive and gram-negative cells. The CV+ ion interacts with negatively charged components of bacterial cells to stain the cells purple.


Many laboratories use ""Hucker's"" crystal violet, which adds ammonium oxalate to prevent precipitation., Tilt the slide and use a wash bottle to squirt a small stream of distilled or tap water over the top of the slide. The water should run down over the surface of the smear, but not be aimed directly at it.Do not rinse excessively, which might remove the stain from Gram positive bacteria.

, Use a pipette to cover the smear with iodine. Let it sit for at least 60 seconds, then rinse off with the same careful method.Iodine, in the form of negatively charged ions, interacts with CV+ to form large complexes of crystal violet and iodine (CV–I complexes) within the inner and outer layers of the cell. This will trap the purple crystal violet colour in the cell, wherever it has stained.


Iodine is corrosive. Avoid inhalation, ingestion, or skin contact.

, A 1:1 mix of acetone and ethanol is typically used for this critical step, which must be timed carefully. Hold the slide at an angle, then add the decoloriser until no more violet colour is visible in the draining runoff. This typically takes under 10 seconds, or even less time if the decoloriser contains higher concentrations of acetone. Stop immediately, or the decoloriser will remove the crystal violet stain from both gram-positive and negative cells, and the stain will have to be repeated. Immediately rinse off excess decoloriser, using the earlier technique.


Pure (95%+) acetone can be used instead.The more acetone there is, the faster the decoloriser will work, requiring more precise timing.
If you are having trouble timing this step, consider adding the decoloriser drop by drop., A counterstain, typically safranin or fuchsin, is used to add extra contrast between gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, by staining decolorised (gram-negative) bacteria pink or red.Leave it on for at least 45 seconds, then rinse off.Fuchsin will stain many gram-negative bacteria more intensely, such as haemophilus spp and legionella spp.This may make it a better option for beginners.

, You may allow the slide to air dry, or blot it dry using bibulous paper sold for this purpose.The Gram stain is complete.

, Place the slide under the light microscope. Bacteria vary greatly in size, so the total magnification required will vary from 400x to 1000x.At the higher end of these magnifications, an oil immersion objective lens is recommended for greater clarity. Place a drop of immersion oil on the slide, avoiding motion during application to prevent bubbles.Move the microscope turret so the objective lens clicks into place, touching the oil.


Oil immersion can only be used on specially designed lenses, not a ""dry"" lens.

, Examine the slide under the light microscope. Gram-positive bacteria appear purple, due to the crystal violet trapped within their thick cell walls. Gram-negative bacteria appear pink or red, since the violet washed through the thin cell walls, then the pink counterstain entered them.


If the sample is too thick, you may see false positive results. Stain a new sample if all bacteria types are gram-positive, to make sure the result is correct.
If the decoloriser ran too long, you may see false negative results. Stain a new sample if all bacteria types are gram-negative, to double-check your results.

, If you are not certain what a bacteria is, look through a collection of reference images, sorted by shape and result of the gram stain. You can find databases online at the National Microbial Pathogen Database, Bacteria in Photos, and many other sites. To make identification easier, common or diagnostically important examples are sorted below by gram status and shape.

, Bacteria are further classified by their shape under the microscope, most commonly as cocci (spherical) or rods (cylindrical). Here are a few common gram-positive (purple-stained) bacteria organized by shape:



Gram-positive cocci are generally either Staphylococci (meaning cocci in clusters) or Streptococci (meaning cocci in chains).

Gram-positive rods include Bacillus, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, and Listeria. Actinomyces spp. rods often have branches or filaments., Gram-negative (pink-stained) bacteria are often classified into three groups. Cocci are spherical bacteria, rods are long, thin bacteria, and coccoid rods are somewhere in between.



Gram-negative cocci are most commonly Neisseria spp.

Gram-negative rods include E. coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas, and many others. Vibrio cholerae can appear as ordinary rods or curved rods.Gram-negative ""coccoid"" rods (or ""coccobacilli"") include Bordetella, Brucella, Haemophilus, and Pasteurella.

, Some bacteria are difficult to stain precisely, due to the fragility or waxiness of their cell walls. They may have a mix of purple or pink stain in the same cell, or among different cells in the same smear. Any bacteria sample over 24 hours old can have this problem, but some species are difficult to stain at any age. They may require more specialized tests to narrow down the identification, such as an acid-fast stain, culture growth observation, TSI medium cultures, or genetic testing.Actinomyces, Arthobacter, Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. are all considered gram-positive bacteria, but often appear inconclusively stained.Small and slender bacteria such as Treponema, Chlamydia, and Rickettsia spp. are difficult to Gram-stain properly., Waste disposal procedures vary between laboratories and according to the materials being used. Typically, the liquid in the staining tray is disposed of in sealed bottles as hazardous waste. Soak slides in a 10% bleach solution, then dispose of them in sharps containers.

Set up your equation.,
Substitute any given values.,
Solve the equation and cancel out the units.",How to Convert Mass Into Mole," The equation you'll need is n=mM{\displaystyle n={\frac {m}{M}}}, or the numbers of moles n{\displaystyle n} is equal to the mass m{\displaystyle m} divided by the molar mass M{\displaystyle M}.

, For example, if you have to calculate how many moles go into 74 g of hydrogen peroxide, you'll get n=74g37gmol{\displaystyle n={\frac {74g}{37{\frac {g}{mol}}}}}, since you have 74 g of hydrogen peroxide, and the molar mass is 37 gmol{\displaystyle {\frac {g}{mol}}}.
, Gram is both in the numerator and denominator, so that cancels out. Mole is in a denominator in a denominator, which leaves you with mole in the numerator. The final answer is n=7437mol=2mol{\displaystyle n={\frac {74}{37}}mol=2mol}.

Understand how scientific names can be more helpful than common names.,
Make use of the binomial nomenclature whenever your involved in any form of natural science.,
Use the basic three rules of Binomial Nomenclature to help you recognize a scientific name of an organism.,
Approach this procedure as a process of elimination.,
Think of the scientific name as a person's own name, with the first and last parts reversed.,
Recognize that the first part of the scientific name is the genus.,
Learn that the last part of the scientific name is the species.,
Accept the fact that some organisms have more than one scientific name which is called a synonyms.,
Learn how to recognize hybrids.,
Watch for the signs of a subspecies or cultivar.,
Look for obvious and not so obvious clues within the name.,
Use a reference to find out the origins of more difficult names.",How to Understand Binomial Nomenclature," Let's take a lovely trip to the zoo, conservatory or aquarium. For example the species of cat we call a lion is known scientifically as Panthera leo. The more specific and precise name can help you identify and distinguish between animals that would be lumped together under one common name.

Many common names given to organisms can be silly and misleading. A sea robin (Prionotus carolinus) is not a bird but a fish which glides through the waves and has a orange belly.
The gopher common name for example can be referring to not only the gopher rodent species but also 5 species of turtle (Gopherus polyphemus) or snake (Pituophis catenifer) as well. Lady's Slipper flower in even the same garden center can mean two totally different plants! Also certain species of the same genus can be different sizes and have different environmental needs.
Scientific names like your first and last name remain the same all over the world. The common names we use like giraffe and tiger aren't the same names used in other countries of the world.
Many organisms don't have a common name for them. Often times these are new discoveries or ignored species. Many species of organisms still have to be completely examined and sorted out. Many common names are actually the organisms exact scientific name. This is really common in plant names like Poinsettia or Petunia. Sometimes the scientific name is accented or abstracted like Peony is the same name for Paeonia.;
, Geologic, astronomic, and medical fields for example have names that come from the same Latin language root and concept as the scientific name system only with one part or name instead of two. ""Canis Major"" is the Latin name of the dog constellation (pattern of stars).

The same goes for dealing with anything even slightly or indirectly involving plants, microorganisms and/or animals. Natural herbal supplements(especially in drinks and food) and whenever you are looking for how toxic or potent a certain plant or animal is it's much better to know the scientific name as many such sites and companies only list that name and not the common name. This can be really handy when ordering herbs from foreign country. Knowing the scientific name of a venomous snake or plant can save the medical staff minutes if not hours of additional resource which can save a life as well. The names of many viral, parasitic and bacterial illnesses are in fact the names of the microorganisms causing the illness, flu is short for influenza. Streptococcus pneumoniae give us the pneumonia.

,

All scientific names are in Latin. This is understood by members of the scientific community. Most of the names in this system come from the Latin language root. The same root where English Spanish and French languages come from. Often times the names are accented with extra letters like ""sis"" ""ens"" ""ica"".
The scientific name always contains 2 words. Exceptions exist if it is a subspecies or cultivar which is explained in further steps.
The scientific name has very specific grammar rules. The genus is always the first name which is always capitalized. The species is always the second name without capitalization.
The scientific name, in most cases, should always be italicized.
Some stores and exhibits don't follow the grammar rules but once you learn to recognize these Latin names, you'll be able to distinguish these names from common names easily.

, Just like isolating a specific single pair of red designer sneakers from 12 similar pairs of shoes we are using the same mindset., It's similar to how an encyclopedia, dictionary or teacher will list last names first and first names last. This person's last name designates the family of which that person was born into and the person's first name is referring to him or her as a specific member of that family., The genus refers to a specific group of organisms with something in common. Let's take the group of animals called Canis, also called the dog or wolf group. This includes wolves, foxes, coyotes and dogs. When we think of these animals we think about all the things associated with the wolf. A moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and sharp teeth (called canines), long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails. They belong to the same genus.

, Now we are going to pick a more specific group of animals with identical characteristics. From the large Canis genus group, we are going to take a creature many are very familiar with the grey wolf. The species name is lupus., As technology and natural science studies grow more advanced old scientific names are updated. The Norway spruce tree, was once called Pinus abies. This name is no longer in use: it is now a synonym of the current scientific name which is Picea abies. That's because in earlier years of scientific studies any tree that had needle-like leaves and bearing cones was classified as a tree species of the genus Pinus (pine) and later research soon considered the fact that this ""pine"" tree had very different features from other pine trees (different cone shape) thus the genus Picea (spruce) genus was created.

Some synonyms also are the result of conflicts between two or more scientists as well.

, A hybrid is a mixing of two distinct species of the same genus or two genus within a family (larger group of organisms with characteristics in common), whether by man or in nature. Hybrids are designated somewhere in the name by a x.

The family in Binomial Nomenclature is a more broader group classification than the genus. It's like now we are not only dealing with one's simple immediate family but cousins (even far way) and other distant relatives. A good example is the diverse (Pinaceae) or pine family. All these species are species we use as Christmas Trees and they all produce fruits we call pine cones.
Intergeneric hybrids are hybrids between two species from two separate genus within the same family. X Fatshedera lizei a common houseplant is an example of this. Fatsia japonica (Japanese Fatsia) and Hedera helix (English Ivy) got crossed by humans. Notice how the two genus names got stuck together. The x is in the front of the genus.
Interspecific hybrids are when two species within the same genus are involved. Petunia × hybrida, which is the typical Petunia flower sold in garden centers as a bedding plant, is a good example. This plant was created by crossing P. axillaris and P. integrifolia, two different species. Other times the two or more species are listed with the x presented before each species. The x in the case is in the middle. Even if the species name is missing like in named hybrids you'll see the x after the genus name.
Some hybrid organisms do not have any binomial nomenclature and are not considered existing species by most scientists. The blood parrot cichlid (or more commonly and formally known as parrot cichlid; no binomial nomenclature) is a hybrid of the midas (A. citrinellus) and the redhead cichlid (Paraneetroplus synspilus) is an example of such a case.

, Be careful here and don't worry a lot about this part because different situations change the rules here greatly. There's also a great deal of controversy here that professionals debate about. The only real rule here is there are three or more names in the scientific name. Two basic rules to keep in mind include:

A subspecies is a specific population group that got isolated from the main group in some way and developed into a slightly different population with slight different characteristics. The subspecies name is in most cases written in Latin lowercased and italicized.The dog is a subspecies Canis lupus familiaris. This population of grey wolf started joining hunter gathering humans on hunts and became domesticated and did not breed with other wolves. All kinds of dogs from the poodle to rottweilers came from this ancient extinct wolf subspecies.
There are 6 existing subspecies of the familiar jungle cat the tiger (Panthera tigris). The tiger we most likely see in zoos or associate with tigers is the Bengal Tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) which lives in India. However there's another tiger called the Siberian Tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) lives in Siberia also called Russia. This subspecies has paler colors, longer fur and is much larger than other tigers. The two populations of tiger are isolated by landscape and do not breed together.
A cultivar is like a subspecies created by human. However they can also be hybrids. The specific cultivar name is designated with quotation marks and is not italicized and not always in Latin. We run into these a lot when we go shopping for fruits and vegetables. Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Yellow Delicious, Gala are all cultivars of Apples. Tagetes erecta ‘Crackerjack Mix’ is also a cultivar. It's a cultivar of a plant called marigold.
Many cultivars are indeed natural subspecies marketed under a totally different name. This is very common in plant trades and in the aquarium fish market.
There are also what are called sports, variants and mutants that humans isolate from main population and reproduce them for their own purposes. For example in a garden bed of red tulips the bulb breeder suddenly runs into a red tulip with yellow stripes. In a tank of regular goldfish one is found with longer fins. The striped tulip and long finned goldfish are examples of a sport, variant, or mutant Other cases are not so obvious to a novice like a tomatoes that resists wilt disease.

, Break down the names into smaller parts and mentally remove the accents. Look for other familiar words within the name.

A huge number of the scientific names of plants and animals come from the name of the actual explorer or as a dedication to an loved or admired person. For example, Joel Roberts Poinsett is the explorer of the well-known plant associated with Christmas that is the Poinsettia.
Many other names even come from Greek mythology like Helianthus the scientific name of the sunflower genus comes from Helios the sun god. Narcissus the genus of the familiar daffodil spring bulb flower comes from a Greek hunter who was so in love with his own looks he couldn't stop looking down at a reflection in the water until he died.
Other names can from the name of a specific location. Chinensis, japonica, and canadensis are names of countries that a plant or animal has been found in, and is associated with in the name. However, Australia in some names means just south and not referring to the continent.
Color names include rubus (red) like the gemstone ruby, aurea (yellow), Blanca (white), niger (black); as well as azure, cerulean and lapis like the gemstone (blue).
Names that explain sizes include superbus or gigantea (big), pumila or miniata (minute size), reptans (low), and altissima (tall).
The word pseudo in any part of a name means false or fake. If a species is easily confused with another similar species or genus it has this often added somewhere to the name. This also goes for any name ending in -oides.

, Yes, there are some scientific names that not fully understood even to the professionals. Some names have unknown origins. A good example is Chlorophytum comosum the name of the spider plant a popular houseplant, genus name practically means ""Chlorophyll producing plant"" yet every plant on earth produces chlorophyll."

Decide you can do it.,
Find a passion.,
Write a list of objectives.,
Spend time getting to know whatever you chose.,
Write the book.,
Take or find pictures.,
Cite your sources, write your acknowledgements, write the introduction, give credit where credit is due and write a short biography of yourself.,
Put the whole book together into a file in the correct format.,
Submit the book to a publisher.,
Enjoy the aftermath, forever.",How to Write a Field Guide When You Are a Young Naturalist," A lot of people think that a kid cannot write a real book but do not let that discourage you. As long as you can write and you set your mind to it, you can write a credible resource; age does not matter. In order to write the book, however, you do have to become somewhat of a field expert, so do not think this will be an easy project. Just know that it is possible.;
, Your passion should be something you have an interest in and something that you have lots of access to (for example, the original book that inspired this article was about snakes). Choose something nearby where you live. Commit to success. That means, choose a subject that you know you will be able to find around you, something that is plausible to research and to find outdoors. The ancient Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu said that the wise general never fights a battle unless he is already sure of his victory. Do not enter a project that you do not think you can complete.

, The list should be composed of what you want your book to accomplish and what you want it to consist of. It helps to look at other books that are similar to what you will write; look at books of comparable size and depth, but about a different subject matter (like frogs instead of butterflies that you might like to write about). Some of them should be much bigger than your book and some of them should be just pamphlets. While looking at these books, you can agree and disagree with different aspects of them:


Look for (and write down about each one) the strengths and weaknesses of those you examine.
Try to figure out what each book is supposed to be used for. Some are for quickly identifying species, while others are meant to be used for research papers and the like. The different books probably have different target audiences too.
Choose your target audience/market and put that on the top of your list, right under the topic that you are writing about.
Think about if you want it to be big, small, pocket size, table size, expandable or complete.
Write down all the qualities that your want your book to have and write down those qualities in the list. Here is an example list, which you can use if you want:

small, accurate, easy to use, fun to read/use, help save the wildlife


Make a list of resources also. For example:


nature centers, zoos, books, internet, education centers near me, and teachers.


Go through each one of your qualities and resources and fill in with the names of those that might help you to learn what you need to learn.

, Spend time outdoors. Learn to love the outdoors. Get to know your home environment. Then focus on your topic (say, butterflies) and spend time outside with them (in a safe way). Look for them. Get books and read about them and you can also research online a little bit but make sure that the sites you use are credible. Keep track of every source that you use and what information you get from each source. Talk to experts if you can. Professional biologists and ecologists love it when kids show interest in their field and will go to great lengths to help you succeed. Be confident and show your interest and knowledge (without showing off) and they will really want to help you. Remember to stay organized throughout this process. Organization is absolutely vital to successfully completing any big project, especially like writing a book. Make sure everything is in neat, accurately labeled computer files so that you never have to search for anything you have done and everything is always at your command.

, Make sure you have an outline before you start. Write an introduction, table of contents with the chapters or sections, and whatever other tables or charts you want. Write the book in sections, one by one. Before you write the actual paragraphs in the document, have each chapter and section labeled so that then you can just fill in the content. To take the snake as an example, you might have a chapter for each snake and in each chapter have sections called: Caution: Approaching and Handling, Abundance, Description, Lifestyle and Death etc. If you like this chapter format, you can use it, although there will be differences depending on the book subject. For example, if you do birds, you might want a section on the song that it sings. The order that you write the chapters does not matter, but write a section all at once, or over a brief period of days. Try to do all the sections for one species before moving on, or do all of one section in a row (like all of the descriptions). Keep your pattern but you can take breaks if you want between sections. Have patience (do not burn out) and try to be disciplined with yourself. Do not expect the book to write itself. It is normal to take almost two years to complete a book, even though it could have been written in a couple of months, because it is better to pace yourself and just do a section or two and then break for a month before doing another one. Writing a book does not, and should not, be a full time occupation. Write when you have free time, but make sure you are getting it done, do not put it off forever because then it will never happen.

, Field guides need to have pictures. As it is said, a picture is worth a thousand words. You can use illustrations, or photographs. Illustrations are much harder to use and not always as accurate, so unless you are very confident with your drawing or your illustrator, use a camera! Where a computer has a camera (such as XO's, new Macs), this can make it very easy. In most cases, color is better than black and white but not absolutely necessary. Some of the species you are looking for may be almost impossible to find. If this is the case, you can search for pictures online. Email the photographer who took the picture or group of pictures you are interested in using and ask if you can use it. Also ask your teacher in your school for help in getting you in contact with the photographer in question.

, Cite all of your sources, both of information and photographers. Make sure that each photograph that you use is labeled with the photographer's name (this might be you in some cases).


Write an acknowledgement section in order to thank everyone who helped you along the way (if your family was a big supporter, thank them all in the introduction to the book). Write your bibliography using proper format. Use the US MLA format but any good format that your teachers recommend or that you used during your research will work.
Write an introduction that explains the purpose of your book and what you intend for it to accomplish.
Lastly, write a brief biography about yourself and your project.

, This step is pretty self-explanatory. Put the book together into a file that is neat and in a nice format and labeled, ready for production.

, You need to use a publisher to get your book printed. You can find out about publishing companies by talking to various experts, talking to your teachers, and if you are part of the OLPC project, talking to any OLPC people that you may meet. Once the layout and design people and the publishers have your book, it could take up to a couple of years for them to get around to publishing it. This is because they have so many books to get through. Do not be discouraged. Your work is over. During this time you do not have to do anything at all except wait to see your book get published. If they decide not to publish it, then take their reasons; maybe you need to change something. Do whatever changes you deem necessary and then submit it again to the same, or a different publishing company. The bulk of your work will already be in the past by then.

, Years after publishing, you will still get pleasure from your book. Good things come from writing and publishing a book. You will learn about an interesting subject. You will have learned all about how to write a book. You will have the respect of your peers, family and teachers alike. You may be able to sell your book for money. You will have helped educate people about nature, so that maybe they will be more careful about wrecking our precious and fragile environment. If you want to go to a university, they will be impressed by your hard work, because it shows that you are able to achieve long term projects. If there is an interesting, beautiful or rare species in your areas, tourists, especially scientists, will come to see it. All of these good things might come true for you too if you write a book on some kind of plant or animal where you live. You get to meet a lot of new people from the international science community that you would not have met otherwise and they might want your help, advice, and involvement in other awesome projects. These things can easily happen for you, even years after publication.

Find out why Punnett squares are useful.",How to Make a Punnett Square," Draw a box and divide it into four smaller squares. Leave room above the box and to its left, so you can label it.



Review the background information below if you have trouble understanding any of the steps that follow.;
, Each Punnett square describes how variations of a gene (alleles) could be inherited if two organisms sexually reproduce. Choose a letter to represent the alleles. Write the dominant allele with any capital letter, and the recessive allele with the same letter in lowercase. It doesn't matter which letter you choose.


For example, call the dominant gene for black fur ""F"", and the recessive gene for yellow fur ""f"".
If you don't know which gene is dominant, use different letters for the two alleles.

, Next, we need to know the genotype each parent has for that trait. Each parent has two alleles (sometimes the same one) for the trait, just like every sexual organism, so their genotype will be two letters long. Sometimes, you'll already know exactly what this genotype is. Other times, you'll have to work it out from other information:


""Heterozygous"" means it has two different alleles (Ff).""Homozygous dominant"" means it has two copies of the dominant allele (FF).
""Homozygous recessive"" means it has two copies of the recessive allele (ff). Any parent that shows the recessive trait (has yellow fur) belongs to this category.

, Pick one parent – traditionally the female (mother), but either will work.Label the first row of the grid with one of that parent's allele. Label the second row of the grid with the second allele.


For example, the female bear is heterozygous for fur color (Ff). Write an F to the left of the first row, and an f to the left of the second row.

, Write the second parent's genotype for the same trait as labels for the columns. This is typically the male's, or father's.


For example, the male bear is homozygous recessive (ff). Write an f above each of the two columns.

, The rest of the Punnett square is easy. Start in the first box. Look at the letter to its left, and the letter above it. Write both these letters in the empty box. Repeat for the remaining three boxes. If you end up with both type of allele, it's customary to write the dominant allele first (write Ff, not fF).


In our example, the top left box inherits F from the mother and f from the father, to make Ff.
The top right box inherits an F from the mother and f from the father, to make Ff.
The bottom left box inherits an f from both parents, to make ff.
The bottom right box inherits an f from both parents, to make ff.

, The Punnett square shows us the likelihood of creating offspring with certain alleles. There are four different ways the parents' alleles can combine, and all four are equally likely. This means that the combination in each box has a 25% chance to occur. If more than one box has the same result, add up these 25% chances together to get the total chance.In our example, we have two boxes with Ff (heterozygous). 25% + 25% = 50%, so each offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the Ff allele combination.
The other two boxes are each ff (homozygous recessive). Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting ff genes.

, Often, you're more interested in the children's actual traits, not just what their genes are. This is easy to find in the most basic situation, which is what Punnett squares are usually used for. Add up the chance of each square with one or more dominant alleles to get the chance that the offspring expresses the dominant trait. Add up the chance of each square with two recessive alleles to get the possibility that the offspring expresses the recessive trait.


In this example, there are two squares with at least one F, so each offspring has a 50% chance to have black fur. There are two squares with ff, so each offspring has a 50% chance to have yellow fur.
Read the problem carefully for more information about the phenotype. Many genes are more complex than this example. For example, a flower species might be red when it has the RR alleles, white when it has rr, or pink when it has Rr. In cases like this, the dominant allele is then referred to as an incomplete dominant allele., A gene is a piece of ""genetic code"" that determines a trait in a living organism – for example, eye color. But eye color can be blue, or brown, or various other colors. These variations of the same gene are called alleles.

, All your genes together make your genotype: the entire length of DNA that describes how to build you. Your actual body and behavior are your phenotype: how you ended up, partly because of genes but also because of diet, possible injury, and other life experiences., In sexually reproducing organisms, including humans, each parent passes on one gene for each trait. The child keeps the genes from both parents. For each trait, the child might have two copies of the same allele, or two different alleles.


An organism with two copies of the same allele is homozygous for that gene.An organism with two different alleles is heterozygous for that gene.

, The simplest genes have two alleles: one dominant and one recessive. The dominant variation shows up even if a recessive allele is also present. A biologist would say that the dominant allele is ""expressed in the phenotype.""


An organism with one dominant allele and one recessive allele is heterozygous dominant. These organism are also called carriers of the recessive allele, since they have the allele but don't show the trait.An organism with two dominant alleles is homozygous dominant.
An organism with two recessive alleles is homozygous recessive.
Two alleles of the same gene that can combine to make three different colors are called incomplete dominants. An example of this are cream-dilute horses, where cc horses are red, Cc horses are a shade of gold, and CC horses are a light shade of cream.

, The end result of a Punnett square is a probability. A 25% chance at red hair doesn't mean that exactly 25% of the children will have red hair; it's just an estimate. However, even a rough prediction can be informative in some situations:


Someone running a breeding project (usually developing new plant strains) wants to know which breeding pair gives the best chance at good results, or whether a certain breeding pair is worth the effort.
Someone with a serious genetic disorder, or a carrier of an allele for a genetic disorder, wants to know the possibility that he'll pass it on to his children.

Gather the necessary tools for solving a chemistry problem.,
Identify the elements in the compound that you need to convert into moles.,
Determine the number of atoms that each element contributes to the compound.,
Write down the atomic weight of each element.,
Calculate molecular mass.,
Set up the conversion formula.,
Plug your numbers into the formula.,
Solve the equation.",How to Convert Grams to Moles," Having everything you need easily accessible will simplify the process of solving the assigned problem. You will need the following:


A pencil and paper. Calculations are easier to solve when you write them out. Be sure to show all your steps to get full credit.
A periodic table. You will need to be able to find atomic weight of elements using the periodic table.
A calculator. Calculators are necessary to simplify calculations of complex numbers.;
, The first step in calculating molecular mass is identifying each element that composes the compound. It is easy to distinguish elements because abbreviations contain only one or two letters.


If a compound is abbreviated with two letters, the first will be capitalized while the second will be lowercase. For example, Mg is the abbreviation Magnesium.
The compound NaHCO3 has four elements in it: Sodium (Na), Hydrogen (H), Carbon (C), and Oxygen (O).

, You must know how many atoms of each element are present to calculate the molecular mass. The number of atoms each element contributes will be written in a subscript next to the element.


For example, H2O has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
If a compound has parentheses followed by a subscript, each element within the parentheses gets multiplied by the number in the subscript. For example, (NH4)2S has two atoms of N, eight atoms of H, and one atom of S.

, A periodic table is the easiest way to find the atomic weight of an element. Once you locate the element on the table, the atomic weight is usually found underneath the symbol for that element.


For example, the molecular weight of oxygen is 15.99.

, The molecular mass of a substance is calculated as the number of atoms of each element multiplied by the atomic weight of that element. Knowing the molecular mass is necessary to convert grams to moles.


Multiply the number of atoms each element contributes to the compound by the atomic weight of that element.
Add the total weight of each element in the compound together.
For example, (NH4)2S has a molecular weight of (2 x 14.01) + (8 x 1.01) + (1 x 32.07) = 68.17 g/mol.
Molecular mass is also referred to as molar mass. , The number of moles you have of a compound can be calculated by dividing the number of grams of the compound by the molecular mass of the compound. The formula looks like this: moles = grams of compound/molar mass of compound

, Once you have properly set up the formula, the next step is just putting your calculations into the correct part of the formula. An easy way to check that you have everything in the right place is by the units. Canceling out all the units should leave you with just moles.

, Using a calculator, divide the number of grams by the molar mass. The result is the number of moles in your element or compound.


For example, imagine you have 2 g of water, or H2O, and you want to convert it to moles. The molecular mass of H2O is 18g/mol. Divide 2 by 18, and you have 0.1111 moles of H2O.

Understand cells.,
Develop a concept for your model.,
Think about the materials you would use.,
Be creative.",How to Build 3D Models of Animal and Plant Cells1," You must understand the primary organelles (cell components, essentially like the organs of the cell), their relation to one another, and the differences between plant and animal cells if you are going to construct an accurate 3D model.


You must know the different organelles if you are going to model them. Vitally, you must understand their shape. The colors usually given to the different cell components in text books are used for contrast and usually bear no resemblance to reality, so in that instance you can be creative. But you must develop the correct shapes in order to model them.
It is also important to know how the various cell structures relate to one another. For example, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is always located close to the nucleus because if processes the proteins that are used in DNA replication. You must understand this fact as you are creating your model.Know the differences between plant and animal cells. Most importantly, plant cells have an exterior cell wall made of cellulose, contain very large vacuoles (a membrane-bound collection of water and enzymes), and possess chloroplasts (the portions of the plant cell that convert sunlight into usable energy).;
, Will your model be a transparent representation, with the cell components suspended in a see-through material? Will it instead be a cutaway model, giving the appearance of a cell that has been cut in half but containing organelles that provide a three-dimensional appearance? Instructions on how to construct two alternative styles of model appear later in this article, but will be summarized here:


The first option is a fully three-dimensional representation of a cell, with all of the organelles suspended in clear gelatin.
The second option involves using craft materials to construct a cut-away model that shows a cell with a section removed to facilitate viewing.

, The materials will obviously vary depending on the type of model you have decided to construct.


It is easiest to use items that already have the general shape of the object you are modeling--say, something roughly circular for a cell nucleus.
Of course, many of the organelles are shaped so strangely that it may be impossible to find something that already has the same appearance. In this case you should think of materials that are flexible and can be fitted to whatever appearance you need.

, Will your 3D model be edible? What types of colors will you use for each organelle? Never lose sight of the vital elements that must be represented in this project, but the form of your model does not always have to limit its style and creativity.

Get the materials to make your cell parts.,
Get a gelatin mold.,
Make the gelatin.,
Add your cell parts.,
Put the model back into the refrigerator.,
Make a table or key that defines each part.",How to Build 3D Models of Animal and Plant Cells2," You'll be making the parts of your cell out of various food and kitchen items. What you use is up to you but here are a few ideas:


Clear gelatin will work as the cytoplasm. If you are simply going for authenticity, non-flavored gelatin would work perfectly well. If you have decided to go edible, choose a variety that won't be so darkly colored as to obscure the model organelles you place inside.
For the nucleus, nucleolus and nuclear membrane: Purchase a pitted fruit, such as a plum or peach. The pit is the nucleolus, the fruit is the nucleus, and the skin is the nuclear membrane. (If you are not expected to deliver this level of complexity, a simple round food item will do).
Centrosomes are supposed to be spiky, try putting bits of toothpick through a gumdrop or other small gummy item.
Model the Golgi apparatus using cut-out pieces of cardboard, wafers, crackers, sliced bananas or, perhaps best yet, a fruit roll-up stacked like an accordion.
For the Lysosomes, use small, round candies or chocolate chips.
Mitochondrion are somewhat oblong, so try using lima beans or perhaps certain types of un-shelled nuts.
Ribosomes: For ribosomes, you'll want something small. Try sprinkles, peppercorns, or plain pepper.
The rough endoplasmic reticulum looks much like Golgi apparatus, in that it is a structure of flat, folded sections clumped together; though unlike the Golgi apparatus it has a rough-looking surface. You could use similar materials for it, but try to find a way to stick something rough or textured to it (perhaps sprinkles) in order to make the two distinct.
The smooth endoplasmic reticulum looks more like a tangled and irregularly sized series of connected tubes. For this, you'll want something smooth and bendy. Use cooked spaghetti, gummy worms, or stretched-out taffy.
Vacuole: For an animal cell, use a few moderately sized gumballs--ideally uniform in color, but with some transparent quality (there are essentially just sacks of water and enzymes, after all). Vacuoles in plant cells are much, much larger. If you really want to get tricky here, you could make a separate gelatin (perhaps made with the concentrated formula for extra rigidity) earlier and attempt to insert it into the model plant cell.
Microtubules can be modeled using uncooked pieces of spaghetti or, depending on the scale of your project, straws.
For chloroplasts (plant cell only), use peas, green jelly beans, or green beans cut in half. Keep them green.

, You'll need a mold to make your cell in but you'll need to decide what type of cell you're making first. Animal and plant cells have different shapes and will require different molds.


If you're making a plant cell, the first thing you'll need is a rectangular baking dish, preferably made out of porcelain. The dish itself will be your cell wall and membrane, in your model.
If you're making an animal cell, you'll want a round or oblong baking dish, like a casserole dish. This dish can be your cell membrane, or you can later remove the cell model from the dish and cover it in saran wrap cut to shape and size and call that the membrane.

, Cook the gelatin according to the instructions on the box--it usually begins by boiling water on the stovetop, and then mixing the gelatin in. Carefully pour the hot liquid into the casserole dish or baking pan. Put in the fridge and let it set for about an hour, or until it's almost hardened. Do not wait until the gelatin has completely settled. You want the gelatin to reform or solidify around the areas where you have inserted the model organelles.


If you can't find clear gelatin, buy the lightest color possible, like yellow or orange. You can also make gelatin from scratch.

, Start putting your cell parts into the gelatin. Here's how you might want to arrange the pieces:


Put the nucleus near the middle (unless you are modeling a plant cell).
Place the centrosome near the nucleus.
Put the smooth endoplasmic reticulum near the nucleus.
Place the Golgi body near the nucleus (though farther away than the endoplasmic reticulum).
Add the rough endoplasmic reticulum onto the other side of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (away from the nucleus).
Arrange everything else wherever you have room. Try not to crowd too much into one space. In a real cell, there are a few structures that float all around the cytoplasm. These can be mixed in almost randomly.

, Allow the gelatin to settle for another hour or two until it is completely solidified.

, After you've added your cell pieces, write up a list of what part of a cell each item corresponds to (e.g., ""Gelatin = Cytoplasm,"" ""Licorice = Rough ER""). You'll probably need to be able to tell people about the parts of your cell later on.

Obtain the materials.,
Cut out a 1/4 section of the styrofoam base.,
Paint it.,
Make the cell parts.,
Add the cell parts.,
Make a table or key that defines each part.",How to Build 3D Models of Animal and Plant Cells3," Here are a few options:


You can use a styrofoam cell base. Craft or art stores and will have styrofoam balls (if making an animal cell) roughly the size of a basketball or a styrofoam rectangular cube (if making a plant cell).
Cardstock can be used to form a number of cell structures, such as the Golgi apparatus or rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Straws or small hoses can be used to form tube-like structures. The microtubules could be constructed out of stirring straws, while flexible straws or tubes can be used to model the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.
Use beads of various sizes and shapes as other cell structures, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. Try to keep them on an appropriate scale compared to the other structures in the model cell.
Modeling clay can be used to create any structure that is difficult to replicate using preexisting materials.
Paint can be used to fill in the cytoplasm and differentiate between it and the exterior of the cell. You can also paint any clay structures you have created.

, Measure the base and make dots at the points that equal half the length of a side. Draw lines showing where to cut. Then use an exacto knife or something similar to cut and remove a 1/4 section.


For the plant cell, do this by drawing the center line on any two adjoining sides and continue those lines all the way around until they circle back.
If doing this for the animal cell, draw the lines like you were making the equator and the meridians on a globe.

, Paint the inside of the 1/4 section in order to help your cell parts stand out. You can also paint the outside in a different color to contrast it with the cytoplasm.

, Create them from the craft items listed above.


The trickiest of these will be the parts that you must model out of clay. Keep these structures as simple as possible while remaining true to the basic structure you are modeling. It may be best to only make the simplest of structures out of clay and leave more complex parts--say, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum--to be replicated using tubes or some other item.

, Add the parts to your cell base (the styrofoam). This can be done by using hot glue, regular glue, toothpicks, pins, staples, or a number of other methods. In some cases you may also need to literally dig or carve out space in the styrofoam to fit in the parts.


The Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum can be shaped out of cardstock using your hands. In this case, make slices into the styrofoam and slide pieces of cardstock in to form the folded shapes of these structures.

, After you've added your cell pieces, write up a list of what part of a cell each item corresponds to. You'll probably need to be able to tell people about the parts of your cell later on.

Define metabolic reactions.,
Study the regulation of body temperature as an example of a biochemical reaction.,
Be aware that biochemical reactions inside the body are, in most cases, catalyzed reactions that use enzymes for their progress to completion.,
Contrast the selectivity involved in biochemical reactions with that of the chemical laboratory reactions.,
Study the use of enzymes for catalyzing these reactions.",How to Contrast Biochemical Reactions Inside the Body and Chemical Reactions in  the Chemistry Laboratory," Metabolic reactions refer to biochemical reactions that take place inside the body of living systems. This includes mammalians and microorganisms in addition to plants. This type of chemical reactions is characteristic of living tissues only. It is not observed in the chemistry laboratory for example. This type of chemical reactions differs than chemical reactions that take place in the chemical laboratory in several aspects.;
, A principal metabolic reaction is the regulation of a constant temperature in the human body, a temperature at which all biochemical reactions inside the body take place. This is in contrast to chemical reactions that take place in the chemical laboratory and which can have variable thermal conditions that depend on the type of reaction. Besides the thermal control of the reaction conditions also other factors can be different between the two types of reactions.

, Enzymes are rarely used in chemistry laboratory. Instead, chemical reactions which occur in the laboratory usually proceed using catalysts that can be organo-metallic reagents or they can be heterogeneous catalysts that are present in the solid state. This type of catalyst is very different from the enzymes used to catalyze biochemical reactions inside the body.

, One basic difference is the lack of selectivity that is observed in the usual chemical laboratory. In contrast, biochemical reactions inside the body are highly selective and very specific. This is so due to the chiral nature of the enzyme molecule. Enzyme catalysis of biochemical reactions is a very efficient process that proceeds to completion with 100% yield. This process is usually not observed with normal chemical catalysts such as those used in homogeneous catalysis of organic reactions. This type of reactions usually is not selective nor is it specific. A mixture of products is usually obtained in this type of reactions. Also, another difference between the two types of chemical reactions is the unusual type of biochemical reactions that can occur inside the body. This type of reactions is completely specific for metabolic reactions in the body.

, This usage can allow for unusual reactions to occur which otherwise do not proceed without the enzyme catalysis. The types of chemical reactions that take place in the chemistry laboratory are very simple reactions that are based on simple rules of chemical reactivity.


The study of chemical reactions inside the body is completely dependent on the enzyme catalysis. Therefore, usually the kinetics of enzyme catalysis of a given biochemical reaction is extensively studied in order to elucidate the mechanism of reaction and the mechanism of catalysis. The study of chemical reactions in the chemistry laboratory usually is based on spectroscopic and kinetic techniques that can give information about the mechanism of the specific reaction. Also, the experimental techniques that are used in these two types of reactions are very different. This is so due to the difference of molecules which are involved in the chemical reactions. Biochemical reactions are usually done in aqueous media at room temperature. This is in contrast to chemical reactions which occur in the laboratory. In this case organic solvents are usually used instead of water medium. This difference in solvent leads to differences in the separation techniques that are used with each type of reactions. Also, biochemical reactions in aqueous media are environmentally more favorable than reactions in the laboratory that involve organic solvents.

Gather the necessary materials.,
Wear proper protective equipment.,
Prepare the experimental setup.,
Submerge the test tube in the water.,
Add hydrochloric acid to the Erlenmeyer flask.,
Start the chemical reaction by adding metal pellets to HCl.,
Collect the hydrogen in a submerged test tube.,
Confirm the gas is hydrogen.",How to Collect Hydrogen1," To collect hydrogen using the reaction of mixing a strong acid with an active metal, you will need: a Erlenmeyer flask, a rubber stopper, plastic tubing, water, test tubes, a large container, water, 3 molar hydrochloric acid (HCl), and magnesium or zinc pellets.An Erlenmeyer flask is a glass flask that has a conical bottom and narrows at the top.The rubber stopper is for the top of the flask and needs to have a hole in the middle for the tubing to go through.
Either magnesium or zinc will work for this experiment, you do not need both.
Some of these supplies may need to be purchased online or at a laboratory supply store.;
, When working with a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid, you want to make sure you take proper safety precautions. Wearing a lab coat, gloves, closed-toe shoes, and eye protection are essential.Goggles should wrap around the sides of your eyes to protect them from splashes.
Wear gloves that fit properly so you maintain good dexterity of your hands and fingers.

, Insert one end of the tubing into the hole of the rubber stopper. You want the tubing to go all the way through the rubber stopper and stick out slightly from the end. Fill the large container with water and place the free end of the tubing into the water. When the experiment begins, you will put the rubber stopper into the Erlenmeyer flask.Set these pieces aside until you are ready to use them.

, Take at least one test tube (you can use more if you want to collect more hydrogen) and submerge it in the water. Tilt the tube so that no air bubbles remain in the tube. Place it on top of the tubing that is attached to the rubber stopper.It’s essential that all air bubbles are removed from the tube before you begin. If they are not, the gas collected in the tube will be more than just hydrogen.

, Add enough hydrochloric acid to fill the flask about halfway. About 100 mL should be sufficient. Make sure the flask is clean and dry before adding the acid. Wear rubber gloves and use caution when filling the flask.


Take care not to spill any water into the acid. Water added to acid can lead to an explosion and injury., Add a handful of zinc or magnesium pellets to the hydrochloric acid in the flask. The exact amount you put in is not important, but a small handful should be enough to start the reaction.


After adding the pellets, place the stopper into the flask so that the system is now closed.

, As the metal reacts with the acid, hydrogen gas is produced. This hydrogen travels to the top of the flask, through the tubing and into the test tube submerged in the water. The gas will displace the water and you should see a bubble form at the top of the test tube.When the test tube fills with hydrogen, submerge another tube with water and place it over the tubing. You can collect as much hydrogen as is produced by your reaction.
Keep the test tubes facing down to prevent the hydrogen gas from escaping into the air.

, In order to confirm that the gas is hydrogen, you can do what is called the splint test. Light a match and hold it underneath the tube. You’ll hear a “pop” or squeaking sound, indicating that hydrogen is present."

Gather the necessary materials.,
Remove the eraser from the pencil and break it in half.,
Wrap two rubber bands around the container in an X-shape.,
Make a baking soda and water solution.,
Fill the plastic container and test tubes with the baking soda solution.,
Attach the alligator clamps to the graphite.,
Slide the unclamped end of the pencil into the test tube.,
Attach the battery clip to the 9 volt battery.,
Collect hydrogen and oxygen in the two test tubes until you have a few inches of gas in each tube.,
Test for the presence of hydrogen.",How to Collect Hydrogen2," In this experiment, you will use electricity to separate hydrogen and oxygen gasses in molecules of water.To collect hydrogen using electrolysis, you will need: a 9 volt battery, a pencil, two test tubes, a plastic container, water, baking soda, two large rubber bands (optional), and a battery clip with clamps at the end.


The pencil must have graphite in them for this to work. A number 2 pencil is perfect. Two small pieces of graphite will also work for this.
A small food storage container or bowl is sufficient.
Make sure the battery clip can fit a 9 volt battery and that it has a red and black wire with alligator clamps at the end. These clamps will be used to hook up your system to the battery.

, You need two pieces of graphite, one for the positive end of the battery and for the negative end of the battery. Sharpen both ends of each piece of the pencil to a point. Make sure the graphite is well exposed.This step can be skipped if you already have two pieces of pure graphite.

, This step is optional, but is an easy way to keep the test tubes in place while the experiment is running. Stretch one rubber band over the container and stretch a second rubber band over it so that it crosses over the first, forming an X.If you don’t use rubber bands, be sure to secure the test tubes with tape or string so that they stay upside down during the experiment.

, Dissolving baking soda in water will help the electricity be conducted in the system. The exact amount of baking soda added is not important, but about 1 teaspoon per 1 cup of water should be sufficient. Stir until completely dissolved.Use warm water to speed up the dissolving of the baking soda.

, The container needs to be large enough to hold both of the test tubes. Add enough of the solution to fill the container about three-quarters full. Submerge the test tubes in the solution of the container and flip them upside down. Place each tube in the cross of the rubber band X to hold it in place.It is very important that both test tubes are completely full of water and no air bubbles remain.

, Take one clamp from the battery clip and attach it to the end of one of the pencils. Make sure it is touching as much of the graphite as possible. Do the same with the remaining alligator clamp and pencil piece.One pencil should be attached to the red clamp and one pencil to the black clamp.

, Keeping the test tube completely submerged, tilt it slightly so that you can slide the unclamped end of the pencil into the tube. Repeat this process with the other pencil and the other test tube.


At this point, everything should be under water and there should be one piece of pencil inside each test tube.
Keep the end of the battery clip that attaches to the battery out of the water.

, With everything setup, you are now ready to apply the electricity provided by the 9 volt battery. The end of the battery clip should be sticking out of the container so simply clip the battery in place. Once the battery is attached, you should notice bubbles rising from the end of the graphite and floating to the top of each test tube.If you don’t see bubbles produced, check to make sure the alligator clamps are firmly attached to the graphite of the pencil. Also, check that your battery is fully charged.
The test tube with the negative wire attached to the pencil will be producing hydrogen, while the test tube attached to the positive wire of the battery will be producing oxygen., Remember, the tube connected to the negative end of the battery will have the hydrogen.Remove the test tubes from the jar, one at a time. Keep them upside down and let the water drain out. The gas in the tubes will remain even though you can’t see it.

, You can test for the presence of hydrogen by striking a match and holding the flame up to the gas. It will make a very distinct “squeaky pop” sound if it is hydrogen. You can also use a lit candle instead of a match.To test for oxygen in the test tube that was connected to the positive side of the power source, blow out a lit match (or candle) and place the still glowing end under the test tube. If the candle reignites, oxygen is present.

When you place a metal into hydrochloric acid it will react to form hydrogen gas and a metal chloride compound.You only need about 20 milliliters (mL) of dilute hydrochloric acid (about 2 molar).
Magnesium strips can be purchased online.
Safety is important so be sure to wear gloves and eye protection throughout the whole experiment.
Adult supervision is recommended for this experiment.;
, Ideally, this experiment will be performed within a chemistry lab. Safety equipment such as a fire extinguisher, eye wash station, and safety shower should be easily accessible. The room should also be open and well-ventilated.


Do not perform this experiment by yourself in your bedroom. Be sure to have an adult around to supervise.

, Pour about 20 mL of hydrochloric acid into the test tube. You don’t need exactly 20 mL, but pour just enough hydrochloric acid until there is about 2 cm in the bottom of the tube.If you are diluting the acid always add the acid directly to the water. If you add the other way around, the acid can explode and cause injury., Drop the magnesium strip into the tube with the hydrochloric acid. The solution should start to bubble as soon as the metal comes into contact with the liquid. These bubbles are the hydrogen gas.You can add more than one strip to accelerate the formation of hydrogen.

, Place some plastic wrap over the top of the test tube immediately after adding the metal. Rubber band the plastic in place to cover the tube as tightly as possible so the hydrogen gas doesn’t slip out into the air. Because the gas is less dense than the liquid it will rise to the top of the test tube as it is created.You can also cover the tube with another test tube or simply put your thumb on top.
Let the reaction go for at least a minute to build up the amount of gas in the tube.

, You don’t have to use a match for this, but you need something that is lit on fire. You can use a lighter if you would prefer. Whatever flame source you are using, light it and have it ready to put near the tube as soon as you remove the covering.


Adult supervision is recommended while working with an open flame.

, Remove the rubber band securing the plastic in place and then lift the plastic off the top of the tube. Proceed immediately to the next step after uncovering the tube so you don’t let too much of the gas escape.


As soon as the covering is removed, the hydrogen will start to escape into the surrounding air.

, Bring the lit match to the tube immediately after uncovering it. Once the flame comes in contact with the gas, it will likely be blown out, but you will hear the characteristic “squeaky pop” at the same time.Use caution during this process. You are working with flammable gases and open flames.
Have adult supervision when you do this.
If you don’t hear the pop, there likely isn’t enough gas in the tube. Recover it and let the reaction go for a longer amount of time. Make sure the solution is bubbling.

, Remove the metal from the test tube using tweezers. Pour the hydrochloric acid down the drain while running some water at the same time. Rinse the metal in the sink and then dispose of it in the trash.


You can also save the metal and use it again to repeat the experiment if you would like.

, The primary objective for teaching this type of experiment is to talk about chemical reactions. This particular experiment is an example of metals reacting with acids to create gases. Students will be able to see with their own eyes how reactive the metal is and how quickly gas is produced by the reaction.A secondary goal could be to discuss lab safety and working with flammable gases.

, Talk about how the acid reacts with the metal. When discussing chemical reactions you want to talk about the reactants and how they combine together to form the various products. Talk about the states the products and reactants exist in. The magnesium is a solid that reacts with the aqueous hydrochloric acid to form hydrogen gas and aqueous magnesium chloride.The chemical equation for this experiment is: Mg (s) + 2 HCl (aq) --> MgCl2 (aq) + H2(g).
This reaction is also known as a single replacement reaction, meaning that the magnesium replaces the hydrogen bound to chlorine to form magnesium chloride.

, This type of experiment is a good way to test for the presence of small amounts of hydrogen gas. Remember, hydrogen is flammable so if you suspected that there was a lot of hydrogen gas present, you wouldn’t want to do this test.In a controlled laboratory setting where you know the experiment is supposed to produce hydrogen, you can use this test to confirm.

, Provide the students with other types of metals such as iron, aluminum, copper, and zinc. Do the exact same procedure and then test for the presence of hydrogen gas. You’ll notice that not every type reacts with hydrochloric acid to form a hydrogen gas.Do the same experiment but warm the acid a bit. You’ll notice that more of the metals will react to form hydrogen gas when the acid is warm.
Discuss the results with your students.

Repeat the calculation for the other product if desired.",How to Calculate Theoretical Yield," A chemical equation is like a recipe. It shows the the reactants (on the left side) reacting to form products (on the right side). A properly balanced equation will show the same number of atoms going into the equation as reactants as you have coming out in the form of products.For example, consider the simple equation H2+O2{\displaystyle H_{2}+O_{2}} → H2O{\displaystyle H_{2}O}. There are two atoms of hydrogen on both the left and right. But there are two atoms of oxygen going in as a reactant and only one atom in the product on the right. 

To balance, double the product, to get H2+O2{\displaystyle H_{2}+O_{2}} → 2H2O{\displaystyle 2H_{2}O}.

Check the balance. This change has corrected the oxygen, which now has two atoms on both sides. But you now have two atoms of hydrogen on the left with four atoms of hydrogen on the right.

Double the hydrogen in the reactant. This will adjust the equation to 2H2+O2{\displaystyle 2H_{2}+O_{2}} → 2H2O{\displaystyle 2H_{2}O}. This change now has 4 atoms of hydrogen on both sides, and two atoms of oxygen. The equation is balanced.

As a more complicated example, oxygen and glucose can react to form carbon dioxide and oxygen: 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} → 6CO2+6H2O{\displaystyle 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O} In this equation, each side has exactly 6 carbon (C) atoms, 12 hydrogen (H) atoms, and 18 oxygen (O) atoms. The equation is balanced.


Read this guide if you wish to review balancing chemical equations more thoroughly.
;
, Using the periodic table or some other reference, look up the molar mass of each atom in each compound. Add them together to find the molar mass of each compound of reactant. Do this for a single molecule of the compound. Consider again the equation of converting oxygen and glucose into carbon dioxide and oxygen: 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} → 6CO2+6H2O{\displaystyle 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O}For this example, one molecule of oxygen (O2{\displaystyle O_{2}}) contains two oxygen atoms.

The molar mass of one atom of oxygen is about 16 g/mol. If necessary, you can find more precise values.)

2 oxygen atoms x 16 g/mol per atom = 32 g/mol of O2{\displaystyle O_{2}}.

The other reactant, glucose (C6H12O6{\displaystyle C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}}) has a molar mass of (6 atoms C x 12 g C/mol) + (12 atoms H x 1 g H/mol) + (6 atoms O x 16 g O/mol) = 180 g/mol.

To review this step in more detail, you can review Calculate Molar Mass. 


, For an actual experiment, you will know the mass in grams of each reactant that you are using. Divide this value by that compound's molar mass to convert the amount to moles.For example, suppose you begin with 40 grams of oxygen and 25 grams of glucose.

40 g O2{\displaystyle O_{2}} / (32 g/mol) = 1.25 moles of oxygen.

25g C6H12O6{\displaystyle C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} / (180 g/mol) = about 0.139 moles of glucose.


, A mole is a tool used in chemistry to count molecules, based on their mass. By determining the number of moles of both oxygen and glucose, you know how many molecules of each you are starting with. To find the ratio between the two, divide the number of moles of one reactant by the number of moles of the other.In this example, you are starting with 1.25 moles of oxygen and 0.139 moles of glucose. Thus, the ratio of oxygen to glucose molecules is 1.25 / 0.139 = 9.0. This ratio means that you have 9 times as many molecules of oxygen as you have of glucose.


, Look at the balanced equation for the reaction. The coefficients in front of each molecule tell you the ratio of the molecules that you need for the reaction to occur. If you use exactly the ratio given by the formula, then both reactants should be used equally.For this reaction, the reactants are given as 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}}. The coefficients indicate that you need 6 oxygen molecules for every 1 glucose molecule. The ideal ratio for this reaction is 6 oxygen / 1 glucose = 6.0.


, In most chemical reactions, one of the reactants will be used up before the others. The one that gets used up first is called the limiting reactant. This limiting reactant determines how long the chemical reaction can take place and the theoretical yield you can expect. Compare the two ratios you calculated to identify the limiting reactant:In this example, you are beginning with 9 times as much oxygen as glucose, when measured by number of moles. The formula tells you that your ideal ratio is 6 times as much oxygen as glucose. Therefore, you have more oxygen than required. Thus, the other reactant, glucose in this case, is the limiting reactant.


, The right side of a chemical equation shows the products created by the reaction. The coefficients of each product, if the reaction is balanced, tells you the amount to expect, in molecular ratios. Each product has a theoretical yield, meaning the amount of product you would expect to get if the reaction is perfectly efficient.Continuing the example above, you are analyzing the reaction 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} → 6CO2+6H2O{\displaystyle 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O}. The two products shown on the right are carbon dioxide and water. 

You can begin with either product to calculate theoretical yield. In some cases, you may be concerned only with one product or the other. If so, that is the one you would start with.


, You must always compare moles of reactant to moles of product. If you try to compare the mass of each, you will not reach the correct results.In the example above, glucose is the limiting reactant. The molar mass calculations found that the initial 25g of glucose are equal to 0.139 moles of glucose.


, Return to the balanced equation. Divide the number of molecules of your desired product by the number of molecules of your limiting reactant.

The balanced equation for this example is 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} → 6CO2+6H2O{\displaystyle 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O}. This equation tells you that you expect 6 molecules of the desired product, carbon dioxide (CO2{\displaystyle CO_{2}}), compared to 1 molecule of glucose (C6H12O6{\displaystyle C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}}).

The ratio of carbon dioxide to glucose is 6/1 = 6. In other words, this reaction can produce 6 molecules of carbon dioxide from one molecule of glucose.


, The answer is the theoretical yield, in moles, of the desired product.

In this example, the 25g of glucose equate to 0.139 moles of glucose. The ratio of carbon dioxide to glucose is 6:1. You expect to create six times as many moles of carbon dioxide as you have of glucose to begin with. 

The theoretical yield of carbon dioxide is (0.139 moles glucose) x (6 moles carbon dioxide / mole glucose) = 0.834 moles carbon dioxide.


, This is the reverse of your earlier step of calculating the number of moles or reactant. When you know the number of moles that you expect, you will multiply by the molar mass of the product to find the theoretical yield in grams.In this example, the molar mass of CO2 is about 44 g/mol. (Carbon's molar mass is ~12 g/mol and oxygen's is ~16 g/mol, so the total is 12 + 16 + 16 = 44.)

Multiply 0.834 moles CO2 x 44 g/mol CO2 = ~36.7 grams. The theoretical yield of the experiment is 36.7 grams of CO2.


, In many experiments, you may only be concerned with the yield of one product. If you wish to find the theoretical yield of both products, just repeat the process.

In this example, the second product is water, H2O{\displaystyle H_{2}O}. According to the balanced equation, you expect 6 molecules of water to come from 6 molecules of glucose. This is a ratio of 1:1. Therefore, beginning with 0.139 moles of glucose should result in 0.139 moles of water. 

Multiply the number of moles of water by the molar mass of water. The molar mass is 2 + 16 = 18 g/mol. Multiplying by the product, this results in 0.139 moles H2O x 18 g/mol H2O = ~2.50 grams. The theoretical yield of water for this experiment is 2.50 grams.

Practice.",How to Calculate the Enthalpy of Moist Air1," Specific enthalpy (enthalpy per kg of dry air) of moist air is the sum of the specific enthalpy of dry air and the specific enthalpy of  the water vapor in the air. This is given by the equation: h = ha + H*hg; where ha is the specific enthalpy of dry air, H is the humidity ratio, and hg is the specific enthalpy of water vapor.
, This is given by the equation cpa*T; where cpa is the specific heat of air, and T is the temperature of air.

You have to memorize the value of cpa which is 1.006 kJ/kgC since this is constant. T must be given in the problem, or it can simply be measured with a thermometer or other temperature measuring devices.

, In layman's terms, it gives the wetness of air. Along with the temperature of air, this must be given in the problem., Using a steam table, this can easily be found.

You must memorize the value 2501 kJ/kg, which is the specific enthalpy of water vapor at 0°C.
Therefore, to get the specific enthalpy at any temperature, you must add the term cpw*T; where cpw = 1.84 kJ/kg°C, which is the specific heat of water vapor at constant pressure; and T is the temperature of air.

, h = cpa*T + H*(2501 kJ/kg + cpw*T).

Determine the total mass of the reactants.,
Find the specific heat of your product.,
Find the difference in temperature after the reaction.,
Use the formula ∆H = m x s x ∆T to solve.,
Determine whether your reaction gains or loses energy.",How to Calculate the Enthalpy of a Chemical Reaction1," Any chemical reaction involves two categories of chemicals — products and reactants. Products are the chemicals created by the reaction, while reactants are the chemicals that interact, combine, or break down to make the product. In other words, the reactants of a reaction are like the ingredients in a recipe, while the products are like the finished dish. To find ∆H for a reaction, first identify its products and reactants.


As an example, let’s say we want to find the enthalpy of reaction for the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen: 2H2 (Hydrogen) + O2 (Oxygen) → 2H2O (Water). In this equation, H2 and O2 are the reactants and H2O is the product.;
, Next, find the masses of your reactants. If you don't know their masses and aren't able to weigh the reactants in a scientific balance, you can use their molar masses to find their actual masses. Molar masses are constants that can be found on standard periodic tables (for individual elements) and in other chemistry resources (for molecules and compounds). Simply multiply the molar mass of each reactant by the number of moles used to find the reactants' masses.


In our water example, our reactants are hydrogen and oxygen gases, which have molar masses of 2g and 32 g, respectively. Since we used 2 moles of hydrogen (signified by the ""2"" coefficient in the equation next to H2) and 1 mole of oxygen (signified by no coefficient next to O2), we can calculate the total mass of the reactants as follows:
2 × (2g) + 1 × (32g) = 4g + 32g = 36g


, Next, find the specific heat of the product you're analyzing. Every element or molecule has a specific heat value associated with it: these values are constants and are usually located in chemistry resources (like, for instance, in tables at the back of a chemistry textbook). There are several different ways to measure specific heat, but for our formula, we'll use value measured in the units joule/gram °C.


Note that if your equation has multiple products, you'll need to perform the enthalpy calculation for the component reaction used to produce each product, then add them together to find the enthalpy for the entire reaction.
In our example, the final product is water, which has a specific heat of about 4.2 joule/gram °C.

, Next, we'll find ∆T, the change in temperature from before the reaction to after the reaction. Subtract the initial temperature (or T1) of the reaction from the final temperature (or T2) to calculate this value. As in most chemistry work, Kelvin (K) temperatures should be used here (though Celsius (C) will give the same results).


For our example, let's say that our reaction was 185K at its very start but had cooled to 95K by the time it finished. In this case, ∆T would be calculated as follows:
∆T = T2 – T1 = 95K – 185K = -90K


, Once you have m, the mass of your reactants, s, the specific heat of your product, and ∆T, the temperature change from your reaction, you are prepared to find the enthalpy of reaction. Simply plug your values into the formula ∆H = m x s x ∆T and multiply to solve. Your answer will be in the unit of energy Joules (J).


For our example problem, we would find the enthalpy of reaction as follows:
∆H = (36g) × (4.2 JK-1 g-1) × (-90K ) = -13,608 J


, One of the most common reasons that ∆H is calculated for various reactions is to determine whether the reaction is exothermic (loses energy and gives off heat) or endothermic (gains energy and absorbs heat). If the sign of your final answer for ∆H is positive, the reaction is endothermic. On the other hand, if the sign is negative, the reaction is exothermic. The larger the number itself is, the more exo- or endo- thermic the reaction is. Beware strongly exothermic reactions — these can sometimes signify a large release of energy, which, if rapid enough, can cause an explosion.


In our example, our final answer is -13608 J. Since the sign is negative, we know that our reaction is exothermic. This makes sense — H2 and O2 are gasses, while H2O, the product, is a liquid. The hot gasses (in the form of steam) have to release energy into the environment in the form of heat to cool to the point that they can form liquid water, meaning that the formation of H2O is exothermic.

Since, in a chemical reaction, energy can be neither destroyed nor created, if we know the energy required to form or break the bonds being made (or broken) in the reaction, we can estimate the enthalpy change for the entire reaction with high accuracy by adding up these bond energies.


For example, let's consider the reaction H2 + F2 → 2HF. In this case, the energy required to break the H atoms in the H2 molecule apart is 436 kJ/mol, while the energy required for F2 is 158 kJ/mol.Finally, the energy needed to form HF from H and F is = -568 kJ/mol.We multiply this by 2 because the product in the equation is 2HF, giving us 2 × -568 = -1136 kJ/mol. Adding these all up, we get:
436 + 158 + -1136 = -542 kJ/mol.

, Enthalpies of formation are set ∆H values that represent the enthalpy changes from reactions used to create given chemicals. If you know the enthalpies of formation required to create products and reactants in an equation, you can add them up to estimate the enthalpy much as you would with bond energies as described above.


For example, let's consider the reaction C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O. In this case, we know the enthalpies of formation for the following reactions:C2H5OH → 2C + 3H2 + 0.5O2 = 228 kJ/mol
2C + 2O2 → 2CO2 = -394 × 2 = -788 kJ/mol
3H2 + 1.5 O2 → 3H2O = -286 × 3 = -858 kJ/mol
Since we can add these equations up to get C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O, the reaction we're trying to find the enthalpy for, we can simply add up the enthalpies of the formation reactions above to find the enthalpy of this reaction as follows:
228 + -788 + -858 = -1418 kJ/mol.

, It's important to note that when you use enthalpies of formation to calculate the enthalpy of a reaction, you need to reverse the sign of the enthalpy of formation whenever you reverse the equation of the component reaction. In other words, if you have to turn one or more of your formation reaction equations backwards in order to get all of your products and reactants to cancel properly, reverse the sign on the enthalpies of the formation reactions you had to flip.


In the example above, notice that the formation reaction we use for C2H5OH is backwards. C2H5OH → 2C + 3H2 + 0.5O2 shows C2H5OH breaking down, not being formed. Because we turned the equation around in order to get all of the products and reactants to cancel properly, we reversed the sign on the enthalpy of formation to give us 228 kJ/mol. In reality, the enthalpy of formation for C2H5OH is -228 kJ/mol.

Grab a clean container and fill it with water.,
Insert a thermometer into the container.,
Add one Alka-Seltzer tablet to the container.,
Measure the temperature when the reaction finishes.,
Estimate the enthalpy of the reaction.",How to Calculate the Enthalpy of a Chemical Reaction3," It's easy to see the principles of enthalpy in action with a simple experiment. To make sure that the reaction in your experiment will take place without any foreign contamination, clean and sterilize the container that you plan to use. Scientists use special closed containers called calorimeters to measure enthalpy, but you can achieve reasonable results with any small glass jar or flask. Regardless of the container you use, fill it with clean, room-temperature tap water. You'll also want to conduct the reaction somewhere indoors with a cool temperature.


For this experiment, you'll want a fairly small container. We'll be testing the enthalpy-altering effects of Alka-Seltzer on water, so the less water used, the more obvious the temperature change will be.

, Grab a thermometer and set it in the container so that the temperature-reading end sits below the water level. Take a temperature reading of the water — for our purposes, the temperature of the water will represent T1, the initial temperature of the reaction.


Let's say that we measure the temperature of the water and find that it's exactly 10 degrees C. In a few steps, we'll use this sample temperature reading to demonstrate the principals of enthalpy.

, When you're ready to start the experiment, drop a single Alka-Seltzer tablet into the water. You should notice it immediately start to bubble and fizz. As the tablet dissolves in the water, it breaks down into the chemicals bicarbonate (HCO3-) and citric acid (which reacts in the form of hydrogen ions, H+). These chemicals react to form water and carbon dioxide gas in the reaction 3HCO3− + 3H+ → 3H2O + 3CO2.

, Monitor the reaction as it proceeds — the Alka-Seltzer tablet should gradually dissolve. As soon as the tablet finishes its reaction (or seems to have slowed to a crawl), measure the temperature again. The water should be slightly colder than before. If it's warmer, the experiment may have been affected by an outside force (like, for instance, if the room you're in is especially warm).


For our example experiment, let's say that the temperature of the water is 8 degrees C after the tablet has finished fizzing.

, In an ideal experiment, when you add the Alka-Seltzer tablet to the water, it forms water and carbon dioxide gas (the latter of which can be observed as fizzing bubbles) and causes the temperature of the water to drop. From this information, we would expect the reaction to be endothermic — that is, one that absorbs energy from the surrounding environment. The dissolved liquid reactants need extra energy to make the jump to the gaseous product, so it takes energy in the form of heat from its surroundings (in this case, water). This makes the water's temperature fall.


In our example experiment, the temperature of the water fell two degrees after adding the Alka-Seltzer. This is consistent with the sort of mildly endothermic reaction we'd expect.

Write the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.,
Plug in the variables you know.,
Plug in your constants.,
Solve the equation.",How to Calculate Vapor Pressure1," The formula used for calculating vapor pressure given a change in the vapor pressure over time is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation (named for physicists Rudolf Clausius and Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron.)This is the generally the formula you'll need to solve the most common sorts of vapor pressure problems you'll find in physics and chemistry classes. The formula looks like this: ln(P1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R)((1/T2) - (1/T1)). In this formula, the variables refer to:



ΔHvap: The enthalpy of vaporization of the liquid. This can usually be found in a table at the back of chemistry textbooks.

R: The real gas constant, or 8.314 J/(K × Mol).

T1: The temperature at which the vapor pressure is known (or the starting temperature.)

T2: The temperature at which the vapor pressure is to be found (or the final temperature.)

P1 and P2: The vapor pressures at the temperatures T1 and T2, respectively.;
, The Clausius-Clapeyron equation looks tricky because it has so many different variables, but it's actually not very difficult when you have the right information. The most basic vapor pressure problems will give you two temperature values and a pressure value or two pressure values and a temperature value — once you have these, solving is a piece of cake.


For example, let's say that we're told that we have a container full of liquid at 295 K whose vapor pressure is 1 atmosphere (atm). Our question is: What is the vapor pressure at 393 K? We have two temperature values and a pressure, so we can solve for the other pressure value with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Plugging in our variables, we get ln(1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R)((1/393) - (1/295)).
Note that, for Clausius-Clapeyron equations, you must always use Kelvin temperature values. You can use any pressure values as long as they are the same for both P1 and P2.

, The Clausius-Clapeyron equation contains two constants: R and ΔHvap. R is always equal to 8.314 J/(K × Mol). ΔHvap (the enthalpy of vaporization), however, depends on the substance whose vapor pressure you are examining. As noted above, you can usually find the ΔHvap values for a huge variety of substances in the back of chemistry or physics textbooks, or else online (like, for instance, here.)In our example, let's say that our liquid is pure liquid water. If we look in a table of ΔHvap values, we can find that the ΔHvap is roughly 40.65 KJ/mol. Since our H value uses joules, rather than kilojoules, we can convert this to 40,650 J/mol.

Plugging our constants in to our equation, we get ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295)).

, Once you have all of your variables in the equation plugged in except for the one you are solving for, proceed to solve the equation according to the rules of ordinary algebra.


The only difficult part of solving our equation (ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295))) is dealing with the natural log (ln). To cancel out a natural log, simply use both sides of the equation as the exponent for the mathematical constant e. In other words, ln(x) = 2 → eln(x) = e2 → x = e2.

Now, let's solve our equation:
ln(1/P2) = (40,650/8.314)((1/393) - (1/295))
ln(1/P2) = (4,889.34)(-0.00084)
(1/P2) = e(-4.107)

1/P2 = 0.0165
P2 = 0.0165-1 = 60.76 atm. This makes sense — in a sealed container, increasing the temperature by almost 100 degrees (to almost 20 degrees over the boiling point of water) will create lots of vapor, increasing the pressure greatly

Write Raoult's Law.,
Identify the solvent and solute in your solution.,
Find the temperature of the solution.,
Find the solvent's vapor pressure.,
Find the mole fraction of your solvent.,
Solve.",How to Calculate Vapor Pressure2," In real life, it's rare to work with a single pure liquid — usually, we deal with liquids that are mixtures of several different component substances. Some of the most common of these mixtures are created by dissolving a small amount of a certain chemical called a solute in a large amount of a chemical called a solvent to create a solution. In these cases, it's useful to know an equation called Raoult's Law (named for physicist François-Marie Raoult),which looks like this: Psolution=PsolventXsolvent. In this formula, the variables refer to;



Psolution: The vapor pressure of the entire solution (all of the component parts combined)

Psolvent: The vapor pressure of the solvent

Xsolvent: The mole fraction of the solvent.
Don't worry if you don't know terms like ""mole fraction"" — we'll explain these in the next few steps.

, Before you calculate the vapor pressure of a mixed liquid, you need to identify the substances with which you are working. As a reminder, a solution is formed when a solute is dissolved in a solvent — the chemical that dissolves is always the solute and the chemical that does the dissolving is always the solvent.


Let's work through a simple example in this section to illustrate the concepts we're discussing. For our example, let's say that we want to find the vapor pressure of simple syrup. Traditionally, simple syrup is one part sugar dissolved in one part water, so we'll say that sugar is our solute and water is our solvent.Note that the chemical formula for sucrose (table sugar) is C12H22O11. This will be important soon.

, As we saw in the Clausius Clapeyron section above, a liquid's temperature will affect its vapor pressure. In general, the higher the temperature, the greater the vapor pressure — as the temperature increases, more of the liquid will evaporate and form vapor, increasing the pressure in the container.


In our example, let's say that the simple syrup's current temperature is 298 K ( about 25 C).

, Chemical reference materials usually have vapor pressure values for many common substances and compounds, but these pressure values are usually only for when the substance is at 25 C/298 K or at its boiling point. If your solution is at one of these temperatures, you can use the reference value, but if not, you'll need to find the vapor pressure at its current temperature.


The Clausius-Clapeyron can help here — use the reference vapor pressure and 298 K (25 C) for P1 and T1 respectively.
In our example, our mixture is at 25 C, so we can use our easy reference tables. We find that water at 25 C has a vapor pressure of 23.8 mm HG, The last thing we need to do before we can solve is to find the mole fraction of our solvent. Finding mole fractions is easy: just convert your components to moles, then find what percentage of the total number of moles in the substance each component occupies. In other words, each component's mole fraction equals (moles of component)/(total number of moles in the substance.)


Let's say that our recipe for simple syrup uses 1 liter (L) of water and 1 liter of sucrose (sugar.) In this case, we'll need to find the number of moles in each. To do this, we'll find the mass of each, then use the substance's molar masses to convert to moles.
Mass (1 L of water): 1,000 grams (g)
Mass (1 L of raw sugar): Approx. 1,056.7 gMoles (water): 1,000 grams × 1 mol/18.015 g = 55.51 moles
Moles (sucrose): 1,056.7 grams × 1 mol/342.2965 g = 3.08 moles (note that you can find sucrose's molar mass from its chemical formula, C12H22O11.)
Total moles: 55.51 + 3.08 = 58.59 moles
Mole fraction of water: 55.51/58.59 = 0.947


, Finally, we have everything we need to solve our Raoult's Law equation. This part is surprisingly easy: just plug your values in for the variables in the simplified Raoult's Law equation at the beginning of this section (Psolution = PsolventXsolvent).


Substituting our values, we get:
Psolution = (23.8 mm Hg)(0.947)
Psolution = 22.54 mm Hg. This makes sense — in mole terms, there's only a little sugar dissolved in a lot of water (even though in real-world terms the two ingredients have the same volume), so the vapor pressure will only decrease slightly.

Be aware of Standard Temperature and Pressure conditions.,
Rearrange the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find other variables.,
Account for the vapor pressure of the solute when it produces vapor.",How to Calculate Vapor Pressure3," Scientists frequently use a set of temperature and pressure values as a sort of convenient ""default"". These values are called Standard Temperature and Pressure (or STP for short). Vapor pressure problems frequently make reference to STP conditions, so it's handy to have these values memorized. STP values are defined as:Temperature: 273.15 K / 0 C / 32 F

Pressure: 760 mm Hg / 1 atm / 101.325 kilopascals


, In our example in Section 1, we saw that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is very useful for finding the vapor pressures of pure substances. However, not every question will ask you to find P1 or P2 — many will ask you to find a temperature value or even sometimes an ΔHvap value. Luckily, in these cases, getting the right answer is simply a matter of rearranging the equation so that the variable you're solving for is alone on one side of the equals sign.


For instance, let's say that we have an unknown liquid with a vapor pressure of 25 torr at 273 K and 150 torr at 325 K and we want to find this liquid's enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap). We could solve like this:
ln(P1/P2) = (ΔHvap/R)((1/T2) - (1/T1))
(ln(P1/P2))/((1/T2) - (1/T1)) = (ΔHvap/R)

R × (ln(P1/P2))/((1/T2) - (1/T1)) = ΔHvap Now, we plug in our values:
8.314 J/(K × Mol) × (-1.79)/(-0.00059) = ΔHvap

8.314 J/(K × Mol) × 3,033.90 = ΔHvap = 25,223.83 J/mol


, In our Raoult's Law example above, our solute, sugar, doesn't produce any vapor on its own at normal temperatures (think — when was the last time you saw a bowl of sugar evaporate on your counter top?) However, when your solute does evaporate, this will affect your vapor pressure. We account for this by using a modified version of the Raoult's Law equation: Psolution = Σ(PcomponentXcomponent) The sigma (Σ) symbol means that we just need to add up all of the different components' vapor pressures to find our answers.


For example, let's say that we have a solution made from two chemicals: benzene and toluene. The total volume of the solution is 120 milliliters (mL); 60 mL of benzene and 60 of toluene. The temperature of the solution is 25 C and the vapor pressures of each of these chemicals at 25 C is 95.1 mm Hg for benzene 28.4 mm Hg for toluene. Given these values, find the vapor pressure of the solution. We can do this as follows, using standard density, molar mass, and vapor pressure values for our two chemicals:
Mass (benzene): 60 mL = .060 L &times 876.50 kg/1,000 L = 0.053 kg = 53 g

Mass (toluene): .060 L &times 866.90 kg/1,000 L = 0.052 kg = 52 g

Moles (benzene): 53 g × 1 mol/78.11 g = 0.679 mol
Moles (toluene): 52 g × 1 mol/92.14 g = 0.564 mol
Total moles: 0.679 + 0.564 = 1.243
Mole fraction (benzene): 0.679/1.243 = 0.546
Mole fraction (toluene): 0.564/1.243 = 0.454
Solve: Psolution = PbenzeneXbenzene + PtolueneXtoluene

Psolution = (95.1 mm Hg)(0.546) + (28.4 mm Hg)(0.454)
Psolution = 51.92 mm Hg + 12.89 mm Hg = 64.81 mm Hg

This should generally take around 30 minutes, but check your pH meter’s operating manual for exact times.





;
, Take the electrode out of its storage solution and rinse it with distilled water under an empty waste beaker. Once rinsed, blot dry with Kimwipes or Shurwipes.








Be sure to rinse your electrode in a waste beaker that is different from the beaker you will be calibrating in.Avoid rubbing the electrode as it has a sensitive membrane around it.

, You will generally need more than one buffer for calibrating a pH meter. The first will be a “neutral” buffer with a pH of 7, and the second should be near the expected sample pH, either a pH of 4 or 9.21. Buffers with a higher pH (9.21) are best calibrated for measuring bases, whereas buffers with a low pH (4) are best for measuring acidic samples.

Some problems will give you this equation, while others ask you to write it out yourself. Since atoms are not created or destroyed during a chemical reaction, each element should have the same number of atoms on the left and right side.For example, oxygen and glucose can react to form carbon dioxide and oxygen: 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} → 6CO2+6H2O{\displaystyle 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O} Each side has exactly 6 carbon (C) atoms, 12 hydrogen (H) atoms, and 18 oxygen (O) atoms. The equation is balanced.


Read this guide if you are asked to balance an equation yourself.
;
, Look up the molar mass of each atom in the compound, then add them together to find the molar mass of that compound. Do this for a single molecule of the compound.

For example, one molecule of oxygen (O2{\displaystyle O_{2}}) contains two oxygen atoms.

Oxygn's molar mass is about 16 g/mol. (You can find a more precise value on a periodic table.)

2 oxygen atoms x 16 g/mol per atom = 32 g/mol of O2{\displaystyle O_{2}}.

The other reactant, glucose (C6H12O6{\displaystyle C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}}) has a molar mass of (6 atoms C x 12 g C/mol) + (12 atoms H x 1 g H/mol) + (6 atoms O x 16 g O/mol) = 180 g/mol.


, Now it's time to look at the specific experiment you are studying. Write down the amounts of each reactant in grams. Divide this value by that compound's molar mass to convert the amount to moles.For example, say you started with 40 grams of oxygen and 25 grams of glucose.

40 g O2{\displaystyle O_{2}} / (32 g/mol) = 1.25 moles of oxygen.

25g C6H12O6{\displaystyle C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} / (180 g/mol) = about 0.139 moles of glucose.


, Remember, a mole is just a large number that chemists use to ""count"" molecules. You now know how many molecules of each reactant you started with. Divide the moles of one reactant with the moles of the other to find the ratio of the two molecules.

You started with 1.25 moles of oxygen and 0.139 moles of glucose. The ratio of oxygen to glucose molecules is 1.25 / 0.139 = 9.0. This means you started with 9 molecules of oxygen for every 1 molecule of glucose.


, Go back to the balanced equation you wrote down earlier. This balanced equation tells you the ideal ratio of molecules: if you use this ratio, both reactants will be used up at the same time.

The left side of the equation is 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}}. The coefficients tell you there are 6 oxygen molecules and 1 glucose molecule. The ideal ratio for this reaction is 6 oxygen / 1 glucose = 6.0.

Make sure you list the reactants in the same order you did for the other ratio. If you use oxygen/glucose for one and glucose/oxygen for the other, your next result will be wrong.


, In a chemical reaction, one of the reactants gets used up before the others. This limiting reactant determines how long the chemical reaction can take place. Compare the two ratios you calculated to identify the limiting reactant:If the actual ratio is greater than the ideal ratio, then you have more of the top reactant than you need. The bottom reactant in the ratio is the limiting reactant.

If the actual ratio is smaller than the ideal ratio, you don't have enough of the top reactant, so it is the limiting reactant.

In the example above, the actual ratio of oxygen/glucose (9.0) is greater than the ideal ratio (6.0). The bottom reactant, glucose, must be the limiting reactant.


, The right side of a chemical equation lists the products created by the reaction. Each product has a theoretical yield, meaning the amount of product you would expect to get if the reaction is perfectly efficient.

Continuing the example above, you are analyzing the reaction 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} → 6CO2+6H2O{\displaystyle 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O}. The right hand side lists two products, carbon dioxide and water. Let's calculate the yield of carbon dioxide, CO2{\displaystyle CO_{2}}.


, The theoretical yield of an experiment is the amount of product created in perfect conditions. To calculate this value, begin with the amount of limiting reactant in moles. (This process is described above in the instructions for finding the limiting reactant.)

In the example above, you discovered that glucose was the limiting reactant. You also calculated that you started with 0.139 moles of glucose.


, Return to the balanced equation. Divide the number of molecules of your desired product by the number of molecules of your limiting reactant.

Your balanced equation is 6O2+C6H12O6{\displaystyle 6O_{2}+C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}} → 6CO2+6H2O{\displaystyle 6CO_{2}+6H_{2}O}. There are 6 molecules of your desired product, carbon dioxide (CO2{\displaystyle CO_{2}}). There is 1 molecule of your limiting reactant, glucose (C6H12O6{\displaystyle C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}}).

The ratio of carbon dioxide to glucose is 6/1 = 6. In other words, this reaction can produce 6 molecules of carbon dioxide from one molecule of glucose.


, The answer is the theoretical yield of the desired product in moles.

You started with 0.139 moles of glucose and the ratio of carbon dioxide to glucose is 6. The theoretical yield of carbon dioxide is (0.139 moles glucose) x (6 moles carbon dioxide / mole glucose) = 0.834 moles carbon dioxide.


, Multiply your answer in moles by the molar mass of that compound to find the theoretical yield in grams. This is a more convenient unit to use in most experiments.

For example, the molar mass of CO2 is about 44 g/mol. (Carbon's molar mass is ~12 g/mol and oxygen's is ~16 g/mol, so the total is 12 + 16 + 16 = 44.)

Multiply 0.834 moles CO2 x 44 g/mol CO2 = ~36.7 grams. The theoretical yield of the experiment is 36.7 grams of CO2.


, The theoretical yield you calculated assumes that everything went perfectly. In an actual experiment, this never happens: contaminants and other unpredictable problems mean that some of your reactants will fail to convert to the product. This is why chemists use three different concepts to refer to yield:

The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product the experiment could make.

The actual yield is the actual amount you created, measured directly on a scale.

The percent yield = ActualYieldTheoreticalYield∗100%{\displaystyle {\frac {ActualYield}{TheoreticalYield}}*100\%}. A percent yield of 50%, for instance, means you ended up with 50% of the theoretical maximum.


, If you performed the experiment yourself, gather the purified product from your reaction and weigh it on a balance to calculate its mass. If you are working from a homework problem or someone else's notes, the actual yield should be listed.

Let’s say our actual reaction yields 29 grams of CO2.


, Make sure you use the same units for both values (typically grams). Your answer will be a unit-less ratio.

The actual yield was 29 grams, while the theoretical yield was 36.7 grams. 29g36.7g=0.79{\displaystyle {\frac {29g}{36.7g}}=0.79}.


, The answer is the percent yield.

0.79 x 100 = 79, so the percent yield of the experiment is 79%. You created 79% of the maximum possible amount of CO2.

, The equivalent weight of the substance is equal to the molecular weight divided by the valence.

, Normality is the concentration of the substance of interest in a dissolving liquid. Therefore, normality is a property of the mixture, and will vary with the use of more or less dissolving liquid to place the substance of interest into a solution. Normality is the number of grams of the substance of interest divided by (the equivalent weight of the substance times the amount of dissolving liquid).

, Dissolve sodium chloride (NaCl) in water. Sodium chloride has a valence of 1 and a molecular weight of 58.443. Therefore, the equivalent weight is 58.443/1 or 58.443. 1 gram of NaCl is dissolved into 0.05 L of water, so the normality of the solution is 1/(58.443 x 0.05) or 0.342.

Note that the fruit of a cactus must be a one-celled berry.,
Look for at least two cotyledons (seed leaves) on each seedling plant.,
Note that cacti plants possess special organs called areolas.,
Look for the placement of the flower.,
Be aware that the stigma of a cactus plant is always divided into a number of lobes.

,
Note that cacti are perennial.,
Test your knowledge.",How to Understand the Characteristics of Cacti," The fruit of the cacti are made up of a flavored mass of pulp. Seeds are sprinkled throughout this mass. The one-celled berry may be dry or juicy, smooth, scaly, or spiny. Often the one-celled fruit is large and brightly colored.;
, On germination of a cactus plant, the cotyledons are the first to break through the surface of the ground. They remain attached for as long as it takes to provide nourishment to the seedling. It is the young plants with these seed leaves that provide the best information on determining the type of plant.

, On the fleshy, generally leafless stem there are latent points for growth. These usually bear cushions of wool or occasionally bristly hairs known as glochids. The spines, leaves (when present), roots, new joints, and flowers grow from the areolas.

, The flower's ovary, which will later become the fruit, must be below the point at which the petals are inserted. The flowers are usually showy and take the shape of a funnel, more or less. They also tend to have many petals.

,, More than one season is required for a perennial plant to reach maturity. Perennials do not die after flowering but continue for many seasons.

, Go to the local botanical gardens, backyard or hiking area and see if you can spot the features of cacti in local plants or in the botanical gardens' cacti section.

Identify the male and female parts of the flower.,
Collect pollen from one flower.,
Take the pollen to another flower.",How to Pollinate Flowers1," Flowers are the reproductive parts of plants. They have male parts called stamen and female parts called the pistil. The stamen produce pollen, and the pistil attaches to the ovule.








When pollen reaches the ovule, the flower is fertilized (or pollinated).;
, Touch the stamen of one flower with a small brush or cotton swab. Some of the pollen will stick to the brush. This allows you to transfer the pollen from that stamen to another flower.








If the flowers are far apart, scrape the pollen into a gelatin capsule. Gelatin capsules are clear tablets that you can separate and fill with herbs or powdery substances, such as pollen. When transferring pollen, you don't want to risk losing the pollen you collect.

, With your pollen coated brush or cotton swab, touch the stigma of the other flower. The stigma is the top of the pistil that is designed to collect pollen and transfer it to the ovule. Coat the stigma as best you can with the pollen.

Identify organs located on the flowers for self-pollinating plants.,
Collect pollen from the stamina.,
Transfer the pollen to the ovule.",How to Pollinate Flowers2," Each flower will have stamen to produce pollen, a stigma to collect pollen, and a pistil leading to the ovule. Identify these structures in the flower. This will allow you to collect and move pollen to and from the correct structures.The stamina (or stamens) look like little antennae that carry pollen.
The pistil is usually in the center of the flower, and the stigma is on top of the pistil.
The ovule can be found at the base of the pistil.

, Use a brush or cotton swab to touch the stamen of your flower. Be careful not to push too hard with your brush. Coat the brush as well as you can with pollen to ensure an effective pollination.







, Pollen reaches the ovule by travelling down the pistil. The stop of the pistil, or stigma, is designed to collect pollen and move it down to the ovule. Use your brush to transfer pollen onto the stigma."

Pollinate indoor plants.,
Transfer pollen to outdoor plants that are not getting pollinated naturally.,
Use hand pollination to create hybrid flowers.",How to Pollinate Flowers3," Plants have many natural pollinators. Bees, flies, and even wind serve to pollinate plants in their natural habitat. Indoor plants are sheltered from these animals and elements. To compensate for this, pollinate indoor plants by hand.

, If your flowers on fruit trees are dying before the fruit sets in, flower pollination may not be occurring. One reason for this might be that the pollinator that typically pollinates that plant (for example a particular species of moth) does not live in your area. This can happen if you have plants that are not naturally found in your region. You will need to pollinate these plants by hand., By hand pollinating, you can select exactly which two flowers you want to cross. This allows you to create flowers that exhibit specific traits. Hybrid flowers may be a new color, grow taller, or have some other feature that neither of the parent flowers has."

Get a suitable, see-through container, eg.,
A first, easy trial project could be done with an empty container left after eating a ""rotisserie chicken"" such as sold at grocery stores.,
In much of North America there are areas in the shade that are mossy.,
Snap the top of the rotisserie ""dome"" down onto the bottom base.,
If any plants or leafy parts are tight up against the very top or ceiling of the dome, they are too tall, and you may have to remove the top and redo after trimming them down a little.

,
The last step is to regulate the moisture and condensation inside you airtight dome.

,
You may notice that condensation forms almost right away, especially if you place the dome in much sunlight.,
By regulating the amount of direct sun on the dome, you can reach a balance of moisture and light that is right for the plants or grass.,
The secret to adding insects is tricky, and best done by cutting a trap door into the roof of the dome with a razor blade or exacto knife.,
This will get back to the 3 liter (0.8 US gal) bottle, in a bit, if you want to try that.,
You might have to buy and enjoy a large frosted cake to get one, but some stores will sell you just the container for your dome.,
Cut open the 3 liter (0.8 US gal) bottle, and put some compost in.,
Put some seeds of your choice in.,
Make sure the plants come from the same part of the world.

,
Avoid planting any of the following:


Cacti (they don't regenerate fast enough for insects to eat)
Carnivorous plants (you don't want your CO2 producers to be eaten)
Poisonous plants (again, you don't want to starve your CO2 producers because of the lack of edible food)
Tall plants (what if they get too big?),
Water the seeds, and leave the top of the container off for a bit until the seeds germinate.,
Get some insects from a pet shop or garden centre (crickets and beetles will do fine) but avoid ants, as they will have little to eat.

,
Put about 4 crickets or beetles in the container, water generously one last time, then put your lid back on and seal it with cellotape, making sure there are no holes.",How to Make a Self Sufficient Biodome," a plastic bottle. You can use any you like, but 3 liter (0.8 US gal) cider bottles would be better if you wanted a bigger biodome.;
, The heavy, black plastic bottom has groves which add strength to the bottom shape. The oval dome lid snaps tightly onto this bottom.


After enjoying the chicken, wash the container lid and bottom completely. (The big label sticker on the outside can be removed with a little Gumout or WD40). In the bottom fill the deeper grooves with coarse sand or fine, washed pea gravel.
Add real soil scooped out of your backyard with a spoon, building up about 1 inch (2.5 cm), patted down. Now, in your backyard or a city waste lot, find some small, low lying plants that are only a few inches high. Wet the area around each such wild plant with a cup of water. Then use a larger tablespoon to dig down and under the roots of the little plant you have watered, and gently lift it out.
Many common weeds that are mowed, burned over or stepped on are fine. 2 examples would be wild strawberry, ordinary grass, or plantain. Even newly emergent seedlings, if they are small enough, will work.
Taking care to keep as much of the roots and soil around them as possible when you lift them out, place them into the layer of soil you have put into the bottom. Now gather a few more such plants.

, Even shingles on a roof often have moss on them that can be carefully scraped off. So after adding some compost soil or topsoil put some moss on the top and arranged around the little plants as a top ground cover. If the plants wilt a little at first, they will be fine when you water them if you have gotten most of the fine roots into the soil. Now sprinkle water gently until the soil, moss and plants are well watered. Your bottom plastic base will let excess water, and eventually the plant roots drain down into the deeper grooves.

, Here you have to be careful no soil or plant parts are in the area you have to snap together. When you have snapped the lid. on correctly it will be tight and snug.

,,, So, with a heated sewing needle (from a candle flame or match) you are now going to punch the hot needle through the upper sides of the dome roof in clusters of about 6 - 10 needle sized holes. #*Do this at each upper end, and the middle of each upper side. This will allow some moisture to escape so that the entire dome doesn't cloud or ""fog"" up. (The needle holes will be too small for bugs to escape.)

, Once sealed up, these little biodomes will not need more water added for many months, even most of a year.

, Cut 3 sides of the door only, so that the door can be opened and closed as needed, and use a tab of mending tape to keep the lid closed. For bugs, try to avoid earthworms. Small beetles or crickets or sowbugs are fine. Lacewings are good, and fruit flies will work too, if you can catch them.

, Remember, you can also use a larger, fancy cake tray and dome that many grocery stores sell in the deli or bakery. The main thing with a larger such deli dome, is that you need the black plastic bottom tray to have enough rigidity and grooves for the sand and excess water.

, But, what the heck - even if you have to eat the whole cake, it only weighs 3 - 4 pounds. Invite someone to help you eat it.

, Firm it down to help stop bacteria.

, Consider putting in these plants:


Fruit producing plants
Perennial plants, plants that don't need much water
Self fertile plants
Plants that produce a large amount of seeds.

,,

, Then, leave the seedlings (you should have about 3 or 4 evenly spaced) until they have covered most of the compost.

,, If you want to be extra sure there are no gaps, put something like superglue around the joint.


The crickets or beetles will produce carbon dioxide that the plants will take in and give off oxygen as a by-product. The crickets will breathe the oxygen and the cycle goes on. The plants will be eaten slightly by the crickets, but, making sure they are fast growing, they will give the crickets or beetles the supply they need.
Of course, the plants will take in the water you gave them, and they will respire and the water will just evaporate and condense, and will give the give the crickets something to drink and the plant something to drink. The crickets or beetles will get rid of the water one way or another, so it goes on.
The plants will get energy from the soil and light, the leaves will die off through time (replaced by new ones) and will rot into the soil, recycling nutrients and giving back the water that was retained in the leaves.

Attempt to identify fresh rosemary in the store.",How to Identify Rosemary," Upright forms of rosemary can grow to 5 feet (1.5 m). (1.5m) in height. There are trailing forms of rosemary as well which grow low and spread on the ground.;
, However, the lower branches tend to droop to the ground unless they are pruned.

,, Their lengths vary from 0.8 to 1.6 inches (2 to 4 cm) long.

,, Healthy rosemary needles remain green all year.

, Check that the edges curl downwards. The undersides of the needles are somewhat fuzzy to the touch.

, Rosemary has a woodsy pungent aroma. Some think it has tones of pine and lemon. A hint of camphor might be detected. There is a resinous quality to the fragrance which is quite distinctive and remains on your hands when you pull the needles from the stem.

, Most rosemary blooms in the summer in mild climates, but plants growing where the winters are warm may bloom year round.

, Look for stems, sometimes still attached to the roots, where the needles are green and have a strong aroma, which indicate freshness.

Identify a palm by its stems.,
Examine the fronds.,
Examine the tree for fruit.,
Look at the trunk closely.,
Identify the tree's flowers.,
Estimate the tree's size.",How to Identify Palm Trees1," One thing that distinguishes a palm tree from other tree varieties is its unbranched stem with leaf tufts either on the end or on each side of the stem known as fronds. These bushy, often large, leaves on the stem are a most common identifier. , The best way to begin classifying your palm tree is based on the fronds. Feather-like fronds (pinnate) are found on some of the most popular and common palm tree types like the Areca Palm, Coconut Palm, Queen Palm, and Date Palm. If the tree has fan-like leaves, the most common are the Bismarck Palm, Mexican Fan Palm, and Windmill Palm. Both types of frond can range from green to blue-green to silvery. , Palm trees are commonly associated with tropics, but not for the fruit they bear. Coconuts, acai berries, and betel nuts are all from palm trees, so if you find these fruit, you can be sure you've found a palm tree. , Palms have either a solitary or multi-trunk, which appears like a cluster of trunks woven together. Typically multi-trunk palms are shorter and have a longer maturation period. Common multi-trunk varieties are the Needle Palm, Lady Palm, Areca Palm. These often appear more like shrubs than tall slender trees. Coconut or Date Palms are single trunk and much taller than the shorter, shrub variety. The surface of these trunks vary, too. Some are smooth whereas others are more layered. Most palm trees have straight trunks but other common varieties like the Coconut Palm have tapered trunks.

, Palm trees are distinguished by very discreet flowers that are usually yellowish-green to light green and generally grow in clusters along the stems. They are generally not very vibrant or flashy but if you find.


Some common distinguishable flowers include: the Areca Palm with bright yellow flowers, the Bottle Palm with small white flowers, and the Coconut Palm with sweet-scented yellow flowers. , Once you've narrowed down other distinguishing marks like the fronds and trunk, you can use the size of the tree to further narrow down the possibilities. There are some dwarf varieties that only reach 10 feet while others can grow as large as 100 feet. In order to distinguish from one variety to another, the tree will need to be mature. When palm trees are only a few months old they all virtually look the same. "
"
Check the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) hardiness zone for your area.,
Look for distinguishing features like drooping fronds or bright vivid fruit.,
Identify trees based on short size.,
Look for other common palm varieties that grow tall.",How to Identify Palm Trees2," Compare the characteristics of the palm with the descriptions of the palms that can be grown in your zone. Some palms will only thrive in zone 11, while some can be grown as far north as zone 7. , There are so many types of Palm Trees so it's important to first look for anything that may distinguish one variety from another. You can do this by first looking for anything that may really stand out and that makes a certain variety very unique. Coconut palms have single gray trunks and long pinnate leaves, but they are most distinguishable for growing coconuts, which they do all year long for up to 80 years. Wild coconut palms may grow up to 100 feet (30 meters) tall but they are much shorter when cultivated.
Chinese fan palms, or fountain palms, are known for the drooping ends of palmate fronds. They have short, fat trunks that are gray and marked with scars of old fronds. The petioles are thorny and the fronds range in color from blue-green to olive green. Fronds may be as much as 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide.
Carpentaria palms consist of pinnate leaves atop a slender gray trunk marked with scars of old fronds. They are most distinguishable by the bright red fruits that grow in clusters beginning when the palm is about 6 years old.

, The common image of a palm tree is a towering, slender tree found on beaches. However, some palms will never reach more than 10 feet tall. If you have a mature palm, you can narrow varieties down based on height.


Bottle palms or dwarf palms are so named because of their bottle-shaped trunks covered with the ends of old fronds. They seldom grow taller than 10 feet (3 meters) and are often seen in pots. Bottle palms have pinnate leaves.
Lady palms grow slowly to heights of 10 feet (3 meters) outdoors. They may be as wide as they are tall because of multiple trunks. They have bright green or dark green palmate fronds, but the fronds are deeply divided, making them look like almost pinnate. The petioles have no thorns.

, If you come across a towering tree, it is likely to be one of the more common, tall varieties. These trees usually have a long maturation and will not reach their height until they have had many years to grow. If you see a tree that is over twenty feet tall, you can be sure that it is an older tree and that it is a tall variety of palm. Queen palms grow as much as 6 feet (2 meters) a year to a maximum height of 40 feet (12 meters). Their trunks are singular, gray, and smooth with scars of old fronds. The fronds are dark green and pinnate, with doubled leaflets.
Royal palms grow relatively quickly to heights up to 70 feet (21 meters). Their trunks are singular, gray, and marked with the scars of old fronds. The fronds are pinnate, dark green and may be as long as 10 feet (3 meters).

Set the ruler at the base of the plant.,
Record the height of the plant.,
Calculate the average using the growth rate formula.",How to Measure Growth Rate of Plants1," Smaller plants can be measured with a ruler, while taller plants may require a measuring tape, yard stick, or meter stick. Make sure that the ruler begins at zero on the bottom.

If you are measuring a plant in a pot, the ruler should begin at ground level.;
, You will want to measure the plant from its base to its highest point. Write this down in a chart with both the date and the height recorded. Repeat every two to three days., You can see the average daily growth rate by taking the change in size and dividing it by the amount of time it has been growing.

The equation for the growth rate formula is (S2−S1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(S2-S1)}{T}}}where S1=first measurement, S2=second measurement, and T equals the number of days between each.This is an extremely general figure. Plant growth rate is extremely fluid and can be subject to major variations day by day. Currently, there is no way to accurately predict exact daily growth rate without the use of sophisticated laboratory equipment.

"
Create a chart.,
Count the leaves on your plant.,
Mark the length and width.,
Trace your plant's leaves on grid paper.,
Repeat measurements every two or three days.,
Create a growth template.",How to Measure Growth Rate of Plants2," Your chart should have rows for each date that you measure your leaves. The columns should be labeled “number of leaves,” “average length,” and “average width.” You should check your leaves every two to three days.
, Be extremely thoroughly, but make sure you do not count the same leaves twice. Include new leaf tips and sprouts in your count. Record the number of leaves down in your chart.
, Choose a random sampling of four or five leaves. Hold the ruler from the bottom to the tip of the leaf. Add up the measurements, and divide by the number of measurements you took. (For example, if you measured by five leaves, divide by five). This is the average leaf length for that day. Record this down in your chart.

 Repeat this process to find the width of the plant. 

Be as specific as possible; get the measurement down to centimeters and millimeters if you can.


, Keeping the leaf on the plant, draw around the leaf on grid paper. The grid should have squares that are one inch in area. Count the number of squares covered to get the surface area of each leaf.
, Leaves can grow quickly. Check the size of your leaves every few days to see how they are growing. You can use a modification of the growth rate formula for this purpose.

You can calculate the leaf number growth rate. This modification of the growth rate formula will tell you how many leaves are approximately growing per day. The equation for this growth rate is (L2−L1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(L2-L1)}{T}}}where L1=first leaf count, L2=second leaf count, and T equals the number of days between each.

The leaf size formula is the same as the plant height formula. Instead of height, the variable is the surface area. The equation for the growth rate formula is (S2−S1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(S2-S1)}{T}}}where S1=first surface area measurement, S2=second surface area measurement, and T equals the number of days between each., Once you have gathered a few weeks’ worth of leaf tracings, you can use those shapes to create a template. Take a piece of paper or cardboard. Take the smallest tracing, and create a circle roughly that size, starting from the bottom of the paper. Create up to six larger circles that contain all of the measurements up to the largest. These should form concentric rings outside of the first circle. Label each of these circles with a number. One should be the smallest and six, the largest.In the future, you can use this template to measure leaves with greater ease. Hold up the leaf at the bottom of the paper with it centered around the smallest circle. Mark the largest circle it fills without going over.

Wait a month before repeating.,
Calculate the growth rate formula.",How to Measure Growth Rate of Plants3," Ease a trowel around the edges of the pot. If it is planted in the ground, dig a wide circle around the plant. You do not want to touch the roots. Lift the plant up, and with your fingers, remove the large dirt clumps around the plant.Do not pull or yank the plant out.
, With a gentle stream of water, wash off dirt from the plant. You can use your fingers to gently ease clumps away. Pat your plant dry with a paper towel.
, Do not wait for it to lose its moisture. Place it on a scale. The scale should be able to read measurements as small as milligrams. Record the weight., Return it to its hole, and cover with fresh soil. If you are potting your plants, place some potting soil in the bottom of a pot before putting the plant back in. Cover with fresh potting soil, leaving an inch between the soil and the lip of the pot.Water the plant to replace any lost moisture.
, You should not weigh your plants often as this can harm the plant by slowing its growth or killing it. As long as you are gentle and do not touch its roots, you may be able to safely remove and weigh the plant a few times, but exercise extreme caution when doing so.
, After you have a second measurement, use the growth rate formula to calculate the daily average growth rate. The equation for this growth rate is (W2−W1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(W2-W1)}{T}}}where W1=first weight, S2=second weight, and T equals the number of days between each.

, With a gentle stream of water, rinse dirt from the plant. You can use your fingers to gently remove clumps. Pat it dry with a paper towel.
, A drying oven is ideal. Set the temperature to 140∘{\displaystyle ^{\circ }} Fahrenheit or 60-70∘{\displaystyle ^{\circ }} Celsius.  Heat the plants for at least 8 to 12 hours and up to two days to dry out the plants.If you do not have a drying oven, a food dehydrator set at the same temperature will also work.

A conventional oven with a convection setting may work as well. Set it at 140 Fahrenheit for six hours. It will dry out the plants well enough, although a little moisture may remain. Do not leave a conventional oven on overnight. 


, Pinch the zipper closed to prevent moisture from entering. This will keep the plants dry. Allow the plants to cool in the bag.

If leaves fall off during cooling, keep them. Place the detached leaves on the scale with the rest of the plant.


, When it is completely cool, place the plant on the scale. Record the weight. This particular plant is now completely destroyed. You may toss out the plant this point., You can take new measurements after a few days, but you may want to wait a week or two. Once you have the new measurements, you can compare them to the old. Use the growth rate formula to find an average change in weight.

The equation for this growth rate is (W2−W1)T{\displaystyle {\frac {(W2-W1)}{T}}}where W1=first dry weight, S2=second dry weight, and T equals the number of days between each.

Recognize the leaf shape of poison sumac.,
Learn the other attributes of the leaf.,
Identify poison sumac flowers.,
Identify the berries.,
Check for white berries or empty berry stems in winter.,
Avoid grey bark found in poison sumac habitat.",How to Identify Poison Sumac1," Poison sumac typically grows into a shrub or tree about 5–20 ft (1.5–6 m) in height, but may occasionally grow even taller. The branches may or may not be covered with leaves along their length, but either way the growth pattern of poison sumac tends to produce a fairly open result, rather than a thick bush of foliage.Large poison sumac trees, like other species of sumac, often grow long, thin branches that sag or tilt downward.;
, Before poison sumac grows into a full sized shrub or tree, it may be relatively upright, with small branches with red stems growing along the entire height of the trunk. In this case, its leaves and branches usually have a noticeable upward tilt, especially near the top of the tree., Poison sumac has a pinnate leaf structure, meaning that each stem has two parallel rows of leaves growing along its length. Each stem usually has between six and twelve leaves, plus an additional single leaf at the end.Young stems are typically red or red-brown, but this color may fade to brown or grey as the plant ages.


Technically, the leaves of a pinnate leaf are called leaflets, but these look like an ordinary leaf, roughly 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) long.

, The leaves of this plant have an oval or oblong shape, tapering to a wedge or point on each end. The sides of the leaf may appear wavy or smooth, but will not have the jagged ""tooth"" appearance of some non-poisonous sumac trees., Poison sumac is deciduous, so the leaves change color throughout the year. Newly grown spring leaves may be bright orange, becoming light green during spring and summer, changing to red during autumn, then falling off the plant entirely.The underside of poison sumac leaves, at any time of year, may be either smooth or hairy, making it a poor way to identify the plant.



Warning: The fallen leaves may still be poisonous to the touch. Never burn leaves or wood collected near a poison sumac tree, as inhaling poison sumac smoke can be dangerous or even fatal., During the spring and summer, poison sumac may have pale yellow or green flowers.These small flowers grow in clusters along their own, green stems, separate from the red leafy stems., During summer or fall, the plant may have replaced its flowers with small green or yellow berries. Over the course of the fall and winter, these will mature into clusters of white and grey berries, hanging down on stems up to 12 inches (30 cm) long.If the berries are red, and the rest of the plant fits the description above, the plant is most likely a non-poisonous member of the sumac family.The berries may be eaten by animals or fall off naturally during winter. Do not assume they will always be present.

, Poison sumac is still poisonous without its leaves, but it can be much harder to identify. If you're lucky, it will still have hanging clusters of white or pale yellow berries which you can use as a warning sign. After the first few weeks of winter, however, you are more likely to see thin, empty stems hanging from the branches, similar in appearance to light brown grape stems.

, Identifying the poisonous bark of poison sumac can be difficult once all the foliage and berries have fallen off. Use the habitat section below to know which areas sumac may grow in, and steer clear of any trees with rough, grey bark.

"
"
Know the regions where poison sumac can grow.,
Look for poison sumac in moist or flooded soils.,
Don't worry about poison sumac at high elevations.",How to Identify Poison Sumac2," Unlike its relatives, poison ivy and poison oak, poison sumac is restricted to a fairly small area of the world. If you are outside the following areas, your chance of encountering poison sumac is almost zero:Ontario, Quebec, and other eastern provinces of Canada
Minnesota, Wisconsin, and all U.S. states east of them, including all of New England
Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, and all U.S. states east of them, including all of the South
Texas, and all states east of it along the southern U.S. border, including Florida

, Poison sumac thrives in unusually wet soil, or even in standing water. If the surrounding area is dry throughout the year, there is little chance that poison sumac is present.


During dry weather, keep an eye out for empty riverbeds or dried mud that indicate the area may usually be wet.

, Poison sumac has trouble growing at 4,000 ft (1,200 m) above sea level or above.If you are above 5,000 ft (1,500 m), there is almost no chance of exposure to poison sumac.


Its relatives, poison ivy and poison oak, are also constrained to low elevations, reducing the need for caution concerning poisonous plant exposure at high altitudes.

"
Consider using a towel soaked in rubbing alcohol immediately after exposure.,
Wash in cold water.,
Treat the rash with antihistamines or lotions.,
Seek medical attention in severe cases.,
Wash exposed tools and clothing.",How to Identify Poison Sumac3," The rash or blisters may not appear until as late as 48 hours after exposure, so do not wait to do this. If you identify poison sumac and know you have been exposed, pour rubbing alcohol over the affected skin as soon as possible. Because the toxin, urushiol, will not fully dissolve in alcohol, using a paper towel or other solid material to rub the alcohol-soaked skin may be necessary to remove a significant amount of the toxin.Warning: the alcohol may temporarily make you more susceptible to further exposure, by removing the protective oils on your skin. Avoid areas where poisonous plants grow for the next 24 hours after applying alcohol, if possible.
A better alternative is using a good surfactant to bind the oils before they penetrate the dermis of the skin, Fels Naptha (old fashioned yellow soap available at a hardware store) or good ole Spic n Span, wash the affected areas well, scrub and rinse well. Repeat. Do not touch any affected clothing as the oil will remain on the surface and readily transfer to skin.
Wear disposable gloves during this process if your hands have not been exposed.

, Whether or not you applied alcohol, scrub the exposed area with lots of cold water. Do not use warm water because it will open your pores and make the exposure worse. You may also use soap, detergent, or specialized products such as Tecnu, but wash these off frequently so they do not dry on your skin along with any toxin they have picked up., If you develop blisters or a rash, you may take oral antihistamines to reduce the itching. You may also apply calamine, hydrocortisone lotions, or oatmeal baths for the same purpose.


If you develop large, oozing blisters, you may wish to visit a doctor for prescription-strength treatment.
Ooze from blisters does not contain the toxin, so it cannot spread the rash.

, If you suspect you inhaled poison sumac smoke, seek medical attention immediately even if symptoms have not developed. Other serious situations that may require a doctor's attention include a rash on your face or genitals, or a rash anywhere that fails to reduce in size after a week, as well as eyes that are swollen shut, or trouble breathing., If you leave the sumac oil on tools or clothing, they can spread the rash for months or years after the initial exposure. Put on disposable gloves and wash tools with soap and water, rubbing alcohol, or diluted bleach. Store clothes in disposable bags during transport, then wash them in soap and hot water.

"
"
Wait until the plant is flowering.,
Put on protective clothing.,
Use an herbicide that is absorbed through the leaves.,
Throw away all of the dead plant materials.",How to Identify Poison Sumac4," The best time of the year to remove poison sumac is between May and July, or when the plant is flowering.Wait until then to begin the process of removing the poison sumac., Before you get started, make sure to cover all of your skin. Wear a long sleeve shirt, pants that cover your legs completely, socks and shoes that cover your feet, and gloves. This will help to reduce your chances of exposure.

Do not wear rubber or latex gloves because they will not protect you from the urushiol in the poison sumac., An herbicide like Roundup is a good choice. Cut the tree or bush down to about one foot above ground level, then apply the plant spray immediately. Make sure to spray all areas of the plant including the roots, vines, and leaves. You may have to do several treatments. Continue to spray the plants until no new growth appears.

Keep in mind that spraying the plants with herbicides may kill other plants in the area., Once the sumac tree or bush is dead, collect all of the plant remains including any leaves that have fallen off the plant. Place the dead plant materials in trash bags and put the bags out with the trash.

Do not burn any of the plant materials because the smoke can irritate your lungs and cause a rash if it comes into contact with your skin."

Look closely at the color of the leaves.,
Count the lobes.,
Look closely at the edges of the leaf.,
Examine how the leaves grow out from the twig.,
Measure the leaves.,
Look for three main veins in the leaf.",How to Identify Sugar Maple Trees1," Sugar maple leaves will have a dark green color on the outside, and a lighter green on the underside.In the fall, sugar maple leaves will lose their green color and take on a beautiful orange, yellow, or red., Sugar maple leaves are segmented into 5 lobes. There should be three large, main lobes and one smaller lobe on either side.The lobes are characterized by sharp teeth, and are connected by shallow, U-shaped notches.


Some underdeveloped or stunted sugar maple leaves will have only three or four lobes. If you see a leaf with fewer than five lobes but suspect the tree is a sugar maple, look around and find other leaves, which may be better specimens.
The leaves of the Silver maple (Acer saccharinum) can be distinguished from those of the Sugar maple. Silver maple leaves have very deep margins between the five lobes, and the underside is silver or white in color., Sugar maple leaves have smooth, U-shaped margins between points.The leaves should also be round at the base.


While many other maples also have smooth margins, the extremely common red maple (Acer rubrum) has sharp points and serrated or toothed margins between the lobes. This can be a useful distinguishing feature.The sugar maple leaf stalk (also called a “petiole”), which connects the individual leaves to the branch they grow on, should be the same length as (or slightly shorter than) the blades of the leaves.

, Look for leaves that grow perpendicular, or at a right angle, from the twig, in pairs.This is called an opposite orientation. Leaves will grow in “sets” of two, with one leaf always across from another on every twig and branch.


Only one leaf should grow from each individual stem.

, Mature leaves on a sugar maple average between 3 inches (7.72 cm) and 5 inches (12.7 cm) long, and are equally as wide.If you won’t have a ruler with you in the woods, but are planning to examine tree leaves, measure a segment of one of your fingers. This can serve as an approximate ruler in the field. For example, from the tip of your thumb to the first joint may measure one inch.

, There will be one vein running through each main lobe, but the two smaller lobes on either side of the leaf will not have a vein running through them. These veins are detectable on the underside of the leaf, but lie smooth on top.


On the underside of the leaves, the veins may appear slightly “hairy.”"
"
Look for brown, furrowed bark.,
Examine the edges of the bark.,
Inspect the tips of the twigs.",How to Identify Sugar Maple Trees2," The bark of sugar maple trees changes color as it ages. The bark of younger trees will be grayish-brown in color. As the sugar maple trees mature, the bark will deepen to a dark brown. It is characterized by vertical grooves that are closely spaced.The bark can be described as “furrowed,” and has deep rifts or valleys between each plate of bark.Sugar maple trees are often confused with Norway maples (Acer platanoides) in Europe and western Asia. The two are most easily distinguished by their bark: the bark of a young Norway maple is one thin layer. Over time, Norway maple bark will develop vertical fissures, but they are not as deep and pronounced as the fissures of the Sugar maple, and do not lift up as much around the edges of the bark plates. , The edges of the plates of bark gradually lift as a sugar maple gets older, and the plates flake away from top to bottom once the tree has reached maturity.Mature sugar maple trees may appear “shaggy” from a distance, due to the exaggerated peeling plates of bark that the trees develop., Twigs are the small, thin branches that grow out of larger branches, and off of which the individual leaves grow. Look for twigs that are narrow, sleek, and a reddish-brown color.The small buds at the ends of each twig should be covered with tiny brown-colored scales.During the winter months, you may find brown, cone-shaped buds growing along the length of the twigs, in an opposite orientation, and 1 larger bud growing straight out from the terminal end of the twigs.Twig buds are also useful in distinguishing Sugar maples from Norway maples. The buds of the Norway maple are larger than those of the Sugar maple. Norway maple buds are covered in larger purple scales, which form a rounded tip."
"
Pick one of the small fruit.,
Measure the fruit.,
Identify the paired seed structure.",How to Identify Sugar Maple Trees3," Look for fruit that are green, turning brown when mature in the fall. The leaves are “horseshoe” shaped, meaning that each fruit has two leaves that grow from opposite sides of the fruit. The flowers form double-leafed, wing-shaped fruits.The paired “wings” connect at the fruit and are oriented to each other at a 60 to 90 degree angle., The fruit should measure about 1 inch (2.54 cm) long, including both “wings.” The wings of a sugar maple grow parallel to one another. The fruit are technically referred to as “samara,” and may also be referred to as a “key.”These fruits are sometimes referred to as “seeds.” However, fruit is the correct designation, as the seeds are located inside the fleshy tissue of the sugar-maple fruit.

, Each sugar maple fruit, located between the two horseshoe-shaped leaves, will have a paired structure. Two distinct fruits, each the size of a small pea, will look as though they have been fused together in the center of each fruit."
"
Familiarize yourself with local trees.Before you can begin to identify a specific tree, you need to know which trees are most likely to appear in the geographic area you are currently in.,
Look at the leaves.Examine the needles or leaves of the tree you are trying to identify.,
Examine the bark.Look at and touch the bark to determine its texture.,
Pay attention to the branches.,
Note any fruit or flowers.,
Study the overall shape and height.,
Get expert help.,
Study often.,
Get a book.,
Print a chart.,
Find an app for that.,
Go online.,
Identify a pine tree.,
Spot a fir tree.,
Know what an oak looks like.,
Familiarize yourself with the maple tree.",How to Identify Trees," Having this knowledge will narrow down you options and make it easier to reach the right conclusion.


There are more than 700 tree species in the United States alone. You will vastly improve your chances of correctly identifying trees if you focus your efforts on local trees instead of trying to memorize over 700 varieties.
When choosing study resources, stick with resources that are limited to your geographic region or state. If you cannot find ones that are this specific, at least stick with guides that are limited to your half of the country.;
, Look at the shape of the leaf, the color, the size, and the vein pattern. This information should narrow down your selection even further.


Needles are thin, bluntly-pointed leaves that usually appear in bunches.
Scales are broader than needles, but also have a pointed tip and also appear in clusters. Scales overlap one another.
Broad, flat leaves have a wide shape and lie flat.
Simple leaves can either be broad or narrow, but they are typically flat with smooth edges. By contrast, jagged or serrated leaves are similar to simple leaves except for the fact that they have pointed ridges along the sides.
Lobed leaves are broad leaves with large bumps or ""hills and valleys"" along the perimeter.
Palmate leaves have multiple skinny leaves coming off one stalk, while pinnate leaves have multiple skinny leaves attached to their own stalks.

, Factor this data in with the information you have already gathered.


Ridged or grooved bark tends to be one of the most common types. Deep indentations run up and down along the bark of the tree in no apparent pattern.
Scaly bark also has deep crevices, but these crevices appear to form small blocks of overlapping bark along the tree.
Smooth bark has few if any ridges. The ridges or indentations smooth bark has are fairly shallow.

, In particular, look at the pattern of the branches and the manner in which the twigs at each end are arranged.


Sharply ascending branches are fairly spread apart but rise up at a sharp angle. In contrast, ascending branches are spaced apart in a similar way but rise up at a less severe angle.
Spreading and open branches are spaced far apart. They rise up slightly but are nearly horizontal when viewed from above.
Ascending spreading, or recurved, branches start to angle upward before bending and turning down or straight across.
Crowded branches have sharply ascending angles, but the branches themselves are closely packed together.

, Look at the type of fruit the tree produces. If the fruit is not yet ripe, you could look at the flowers on the tree, instead. Also pay attention to the arrangement of the buds on the tree.


Cone or catkin fruit consists of a cluster of woody, scale-like pieces formed into a conical or cylindrical mass.
Flesh or soft fruit tends to include berries or edible fruit, like apples and pears. The flesh is soft and has a little ""give"" when pressed.
Hard or woody fruit has a tough exterior. Acorns and nuts are included in this category.
Pod fruits contain several seeds or hard masses inside a single protective pod or enclosure.
Winged fruit consists of a hard seed at the center of the fruit with lightweight, paper-like skin surrounding and coming off of that seed.

, The size of the tree is the final piece of data you need to identify it, along with its overall shape profile.


Conical or spire trees are narrow and tend to have pointed tops. The side profile looks similar to a triangle.
Spreading trees have broad, wide shapes, and the branches tend to extend out far from the trunk of the tree.
Upright trees are similar to spreading trees, but the branches do not spread out as far, giving the tree a more narrow look.
Weeping trees have branches and leaves that curve downward and hang low.

, You can learn a lot about identifying trees on your own, but if you are really serious and want to learn more about trees and how to identify them, taking instruction from a local expert can provide you with the knowledge you need more quickly and more thoroughly.


Look for local courses and workshops. You can improve your knowledge of the trees in your geographic area if you take a class taught by an expert. Look for classes and workshops provided by universities and community colleges, as well as any offered by environmental organizations, hiking organizations, agricultural extension offices, and local, state, or national parks.
Spend one-on-one time in the field with an expert. While a formal class is likely to teach you all you need to know and offer some fieldwork experience in the process, you might be able to learn just as much if you can arrange to meet with an expert on site at a park or arboretum.

, Whether you have some form of professional education or learn everything on your own, one of the key components in improving your accuracy and ability to identify trees is thorough knowledge of a wide variety of trees in your area, especially those which appear most often. The only way to obtain such thorough knowledge is to frequently study the characteristics of such trees.


Your studying should include plenty of field practice. You can study books and other resources, as well, but field practice will likely help you learn identification practices at a quicker pace.
Initially, you will need to take resources—like books, charts, and cell phone apps—with you into the field to help you identify trees on the spot. As you gain more experience, though, you might reach a point at which you can identify most local trees without such resources.

, Invest in a picture encyclopedia of trees. The best books will use easy-to-understand language, and the trees in the book should be categorized according to their identifying characteristics rather than being identified by name.


Take a good look at the drawings found in the book. They should be detailed but easy to interpret.
Avoid books weighted down with technical descriptions at this stage. If you want to know more about the technical side of things once you have gained experience and polished your skills, you can come back to these books later.

, As a general rule, it can be a good idea to print a basic chart of trees in your area. A chart is more portable than a heavy, thick book, so you can keep it with you even and do a little unplanned identification when you find an interesting specimen you do not recognize.


You can make your own chart based on other resources, or you can look for one from a book, manual, or online source.
Butler University has a small chart you can look at for basic reference. Use it to identify trees or as an example chart from which you can create your own. Take a look at it here: http://www.butler.edu/herbarium/treeid/idchart.html


, Nowadays, there are smart phone apps that can help you identify trees as you come across them. Research which one suits your needs best or test a few out before picking one.


A few tree identification apps worth checking into include:


What Tree Is That?, which asks you identifying questions to narrow down which tree you are describing.

Leafsnap, which requires you to take a picture of the leaf or bark of a tree so that it can identify it from its built-in database.Each app works differently, so you will need to read the instructions or play around with each one to determine how to use it.

, If you do not have a smart phone or cannot find an app that works for your purposes, you might have better luck looking online for answers. Do an Internet search for “tree identification” and browse through the results until you see a website that will help you narrow down the specimen you spotted according to its identifying characteristics.


Websites that allow you to filter your results according to certain characteristics tend to be more helpful than broad indexes or alphabetical listings.
You can also access the What Tree Is That? app online if you do not wish to use the mobile app.
The University of Wisconsin also has a helpful tree identification tool you can access online: http://www.uwsp.edu/cnr-ap/leaf/Pages/TreeKey/treeToIdentify.aspx?feature=Main

Kew Gardens has another online app you can use to help you identify trees: http://apps.kew.org/trees/?page_id=17


, There are multiple types of pine trees, but as members of the same broad family, they tend to share similar characteristics.


Loblolly pine trees are tall trees, usually reaching heights between 98 and 115 feet (30 to 35 m). These trees have needles that are usually found in bunches of three, and the trees produce cone-type fruit. The bark is scaly, and the branches are largely clustered at the top of the tree.
Lodgepole pine trees are thin, narrow trees reaching heights of 130 to 160 feet (40 to 50 m). The top of the tree tends to be flattened, but they also have needles and that come in clusters of two and cone-type fruit.

, As with pine trees, there are a few different variations of fir tree within the fir species, even though most do share similar traits.


Douglas fir trees are one of the tallest tree types in the world, reaching heights between 200 and 246 feet (60 and 75 m) on average. The bark is thin and smooth on young trees but thick and corky on old trees. These trees produce cone-like fruit with a narrow shape and red-brown scales, and the needle-like leaves are arranged in spirals, lying flat along the shoots. The top of the tree is somewhat cylindrical.
Balsam fir trees are a smaller variety, reaching heights between 46 and 66 feet (14 and 20 m). The top of the tree is narrow and pointed, giving the overall shape a conical appearance. The bark is smooth ad gray on young trees but rough and scaly on old trees, and the leaves are needle-like. The cones ripen to a brown color but disintegrate and release winged seeds in the fall.

, Oak trees are usually divided into a white oak group and a red oak group, but other variations exist, as well.


White oak trees have simple, lobed leaves without bristled tips. They produce acorns, and the bark is usually a light gray color with a scaly appearance.
Red oak trees also produce acorns, but they have lobed leaves with bristled tips. The bark is scaly and a dark red-gray to red-brown color. The branches are thin and initially appear bright green before turning dark red and, eventually, dark brown.

, Maple trees are all fairly similar, but there are also multiple types within the broader species.


Sugar maple trees have five rounded leaf lobes. In the spring and summer, the leaves are green, but they turn bright yellow, orange, or bright red-orange in fall, and the fall coloring tends to be uneven. The bark has ridges in it and the fruit it produces is winged.
Silver maple trees have sharp leaf lobes that are deeply cut. While vibrant green during the summer, the leaves are only a pale yellow in the fall. The bark tends to be smooth and silver on young trees but gray and shaggy on old trees.
Red maple trees have sharp leaf lobes that are shallowly cut. The leaves are green during the summer but usually turn a vibrant shade of red during autumn. The bark of the tree is smooth and pale gray in young trees, but older trees get darker bark with a plate-like texture. Red maple trees also produce double-sided winged fruit.

Pull down a branch from the tree so that you can view it more easily.,
View whether the branches have opposite branching.,
Find the buds for new branches.",How to Identify an Ash Tree1," You can also pick up a dead stick that has already fallen to the ground.;
, This means that branches originate from the same point when they extend from the main branch. Other trees have alternate branching, with branches alternating left and right as they grow from the main branch.Boxelder, Dogwood and Maple trees also have opposite branching.
Hickory, Butternut, Oak, Cottonwood and Quaking Aspen trees have alternate branching., They should be directly across, or opposite, from each other. Occasionally, a bud with die and fall off, causing it to lose a mate."
"
Find a branch with leaves on it.,
Combine the opposite branching and compound leaves to decide if the tree is an Ash.,
Find light green or brown clusters of seeds.",How to Identify an Ash Tree2," An Ash tree has a compound leaf structure, rather than a single leaf structure. Look for the thickened base of the stem, called a petiole, and decide whether there is a single leaf or 5 to 11 smaller leaflets that branch out from that point.


These 5 to 11 leaflets compose a single leaf.A Maple tree is an example of a single leaf tree that has one large leaf extending from the petiole.

, The only other tree that shares these two characteristics is a Boxelder tree. Yet, the Boxelder tree has three to five leaflets instead of five to 11., They are paddle shaped and look like small delicate leaves. They hang down in large groupings from the tree.Don’t assume a tree without seeds is not an ash tree. Some types of ash are seedless. Seed clusters only form in late fall and early winter.
Boxelder seeds are also clustered; however, they look like wings, rather than paddles.

Find your location on a map to identify which redwoods are common to that area.,
Look near areas that get a lot of rain or have a moist environment.,
Look up nearby Redwoods.,
Look for the tallest trees.",How to Identify a Redwood Tree1," Redwoods do not grow everywhere, so make sure to look only in the areas where they are found.Giant Redwoods were first discovered in Sierra Nevada and can be found in National Parks throughout California.
Coast Redwoods are the tallest redwoods and are only seen along the California coastline. #*Dawn Redwoods are primarily located in remote areas of China.;
, Redwoods need near constant water and moisture to grow.Redwoods need a mild winter to grow; otherwise, it will be too cold for them to survive.
A foggy summer is also good for Redwoods. It protects them from severe sunlight and keeps the tree moist.

, Redwoods live for a long time, so you can likely find places where the trees grow easily.


Ask your local park service about nearby Redwoods. They can point you to places where Redwoods grow.
Find Redwoods online. Redwoods are protected trees in many areas, since they are so old. You can easily find where they may be located on the Internet.

, Redwoods are famously tall trees; some grow as tall as a football field is long.


Other trees, such as the Douglas fir or the Mountain Ash, can also grow very tall. The other distinguishing features of the Redwood should allow you tell to the difference between these other trees and Redwoods.

"
"
Look at the tree from afar to notice its trunk shape.,
Inspect the bark for thickness and flakiness.,
Pull off a piece of the bark.,
Pay attention to the size of the tree.",How to Identify a Redwood Tree2," It should have a cone-like shape to the trunk if it is a Giant Redwood. In contrast, the Coast Redwood is taller and leaner, with a straight trunk.


Giant Redwoods have a very stout trunk that grows in a column. The base usually has a lot of tapering.
Coast Redwoods have a parallel base, rather than the conical shape of the Giant Redwood.
Dawn Redwoods have a generally straight trunk that tapers quickly as it grows taller., The bark of the redwood tree is relatively thick; up to 2 feet (0.61 m) thick in mature trees. The thick bark protects the tree from fire and insect infestation.


Bark on a Giant Redwood is usually more spongy to the touch, while the bark of a Coast Redwood is fibrous.
Dawn redwoods also have spongy bark that is generally fluted as well. Fluted bark has many ridges that cover the outside of the tree bark.

, On redwood trees, the outer bark pulls away easily to reveal a soft, fibrous bark underneath the surface.

, Size is the most prominent feature of all redwoods, which are all quite large.


Coast Redwoods are the tallest redwood and can grow as high as 400 feet (120 m). However, these trees are relatively thin.
The Giant Redwood is thicker in girth, but not quite as tall, growing up to around 300 feet (91 m) when it is fully mature.
Sequoia trees are often confused for Redwoods because of their similar height. However, Sequoias have a spiral and twisted trunk that's very different from the trunk of a Redwood."
"
Examine the leaves and cones of a Giant Redwood.,
Identify the leaves and cones of a Dawn Redwood.,
Inspect the leaves and cones of a Coast Redwood.",How to Identify a Redwood Tree3," A giant redwood has unique leaves and cones. In particular, its small cones are an excellent way to identify a Giant Redwood.The leaves of a Giant Redwood are broad and long. This allows them to breathe in air the most easily. The leaves look very much like needles, but are not as sharp as other evergreen trees.
Be careful not to confuse the leaves of a Japanese cedar with that of a Giant Redwood. Though their leaves are similar, the cedar has a more tangled appearance in its leaf structure than the Giant Redwood.Cones of a giant redwood are relatively small, especially considering its rather large size. Often, they will fit in the palm of your hand and are about the size of a golf ball.

, Dawn Redwoods can occasionally have different color leaves, especially during the fall and winter. Its cones are also rather small and usually only common in places with warmer summers.


The leaves of a Dawn Redwood are flattened and relatively fine. They are generally symmetrical and have opposing needle-like structures.
These leaves also change color in the fall and winter. In contrast, the leaves for other species of redwood are evergreen. Dawn Redwood leaves will be an orange and yellow color when they are changing.The Larch or Swamp Cypress can often be confused for the Dawn Redwood. However, Dawn Redwood have each leaf connected to the same spot of the stem, whereas these other trees have leaves with alternate arrangement.Cones of a Dawn Redwood are spiky and produce 16-28 scales in four rows. These tree can also have male and female cones. Since cones are generally female, the male cones look more like green pearls.A Dawn Redwood is a deciduous tree, which means its leaves do change color. It is the only redwood species whose leaves do so.

, Since the Coast Redwoods are so tall, they grow two different type of needles. While you can spot the highest type on the ground, you’ll most likely be able to examine only the lower needles. Additionally, their small cones form a unique spiral pattern that’s easy to identify.The highest leaves of a Coast Redwood have tight spikes. These spikes help them to conserve water, since there's not a lot of surface to allow for evaporation.
Lower leaves of a Coast Redwood have mostly flat needles. These leaves are arranged in a similar pattern of leaf connection as the Dawn Redwood, where the leaves connect to the same spot of the stem.
Cones from a Coast Redwood come out in the fall and are about one inch long. The scales have a spiral pattern around the cone."

Discuss how plants create oxygen.,
Point out that plants create carbohydrates.,
Mention that photosynthesis occurs mostly in plants.",How to Explain Photosynthesis1," Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert the sun’s energy into chemical energy. The series of reactions used to do this conversion (referred to collectively as photosynthesis) creates molecular oxygen, O2. This oxygen, which is critical for all other life on the planet, is released into the atmosphere.If you are teaching children, you can summarize this by saying that plants take in the carbon dioxide that we breath out, and turn it into oxygen.;
, Carbohydrates are molecules that are built primarily of carbon and hydrogen. They are used by plants to store the energy collected from the sun. During photosynthesis, the plant takes carbon dioxide, CO2, and water, H2O, to create a carbohydrates to store energy.Not only are carbohydrates used by the plant to store energy, but that energy is transferred to animals that consume the plant as food.
For children, you can explain that plants make sugars and starches out of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.

, While photosynthesis is carried out by some some other organisms, the process is primarily utilized by plants. Even carnivorous plants (e.g. the venus flytrap) obtain their energy from photosynthesis and use their prey as a way to collect the materials to build cells (e.g. proteins, nitrogen, etc.). It is important that the person trying to understand photosynthesis keep the process in perspective as the way that plants, and some organisms such as certain bacteria, produce energy.Young children typically associate photosynthesis only with plants. Only mention other lifeforms if the child is old enough to know what they are.

Choose your cloning container.,
Decide whether you want to clone the plant in rockwool or soil.,
Decide whether or not you want to use a root hormone.,
Fill the pot or container with soil or rockwool.,
Water the soil.,
Make a diagonal cut on the stem of the plant using a sharp knife or scissors.,
Dip the stem in root hormone (if you've that decided root hormones are right for your plant).,
Put the stem of the plant into the hole in the soil or rockwool.,
Cover the container in plastic or glass.,
Keep the container in a warm area where it can get SOME sunlight.,
Add a little water to the soil every day, keeping the soil moist (but not drenched) while it begins to root.",How to Clone Plants," The type of container you choose will depend upon how large the plant will be once it grows and how many plants you’re trying to clone in one container. Do a little research on your plant first to determine how big your container should be.


Some people prefer to use pots for plant cloning, while others will use something as simple as a plastic cup with holes poked into the bottom.
A translucent container is usually best so you can see when and where the plant is taking root.;
, When you clone plants, you put a piece of a plant into soil or rockwool so that it can take root and grow.


Rockwool is more complicated and requires more preparation than soil. It’s needs to be soaked overnight in water with a PH balance of 4.5, and it doesn’t contain the same nutrients that natural soil does.You also need to take the time to cut a hole in the center of a rockwool block so that it’s not too big and not too small for the plant you’re cloning.
Potting soil, seed starting mix, or well composted garden soil can all be used for your plant. Normal soil dug up from your garden may not be ideal.

, Root hormones are used in the cloning process to encourage plant cell growth. Plants naturally contain hormones called auxins, which help plants determine whether or not they should develop more leaves versus more roots. When you purchase a root hormone in a bottle, you’ll be using a synthetic auxin. When the auxin is applied, the plant will think it needs to grow more roots, and the cloning process begins. If you’re an organic gardener, root hormones may not be your friend. Many root hormones contain fungicides and chemicals that might not be earth friendly. If you are concerned about the use of chemicals in your gardening, you may want to opt for natural alternatives, such as willow tea, cinnamon, or diluted apple cider vinegar.Plants like tomatoes are easily cloned because they produce a lot of natural auxin, but other plants may only put out roots from the original root ball at the tip of the stem — which may make it difficult to get the plant to root without a synthetic hormone.Do some research on your plant before making any decisions to see what’s right for the situation.
Never dip your plant matter into your container of hormone. Take out the amount of hormone you need and apply to the plant per the instructions included. This is too avoid contaminating your supply.

,


If you’ve chosen to use soil, fill the container to the top. Poke a hole through the center, all the way down to the bottom of the container.
If you’ve chosen to use rockwool, you can simply insert the chunk of rockwool into the container.

, Pour enough water into the soil that it’s wet, but not drenched. If you’re using rockwool, it would already have been soaked overnight, so adding more water is not necessary.

, You’ll want to select a lateral stem to cut, not a terminal stem. Terminal stems are the main stems that come up from the ground, while lateral stems protrude from the sides of the terminal stems. After you’ve made your cut, look at the stem and remove any leaves or flower buds from its base. When there are too many leaves or buds on a plant cutting, they suck most of the water from the base of the stem and may keep your plant from rooting. , Root hormones can be in liquid or powder form. If you’re using a powder, dip the stem in some water and then apply the powder to the end, so it sticks. Do not coat the whole stem in root hormone. Focus on lightly coating the very bottom of the stem.

, Try to put about one-third of the stem into the hole..

, A plastic bag can often work well for this if you have nothing else. When you cover the plant, it keeps the moisture and allows the plant to continue living while it attempts to produce roots. What you use to cover the plant will depend upon the container you’ve chosen to house your clone.

, If you put the plant in a place where it gets direct sunlight all day, that may put too much stress on the cutting and kill it., After about a week or two, your plant should begin to form roots. Hooray! Clonage achieved.

Break down the chloroplasts.,
Discuss the two photosystems.,
Know the products of the light dependent reactions.",How to Explain Photosynthesis2," The chloroplast is an organelle within plant cells that allows for photosynthesis to occur. The light dependent phase of photosynthesis uses the energy from the sun to create energy storing molecules that are needed later in the photosynthetic process.This is made possible by a substance in the chloroplasts, called chlorophyll, that absorbs electromagnetic energy (in the form of light) from the sun.It is appropriate to mention chlorophyll to children, but keep it very basic.

, The light dependent reactions take place in two phases. First, the light activated photosystem II splits water molecules. This creates creates molecular oxygen, O2 and H+ ions (also known as protons). Some of the protons are utilized, to form adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP). The remaining protons are transferred from photosystem II to photosystem I, and there they are used to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ion (NADP+) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADPH.Photosystem II and photosystem I are too complicated for most children to be interested. It is okay to leave this out when teaching photosynthesis to kids.

, The primary products of the light dependent reactions are oxygen, ATP, and NADPH. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the ATP and NADPH are utilized by the plant for the next phase of photosynthesis - the light independent reactions (also known as the Calvin Cycle). No carbohydrates are produced during the light dependent phase of photosynthesis."

Show the products of light independent reactions.",How to Explain Photosynthesis3," ATP is a molecule used to store and exchange energy. NADPH is a molecule used to transport electrons. Both will be needed during the light independent phase of photosynthesis to provide energy for carbon fixation to occur.The light independent reactions can be carried out by the plant in the light or in the dark, whereas the light dependent reactions can only happen in the light., Carbon fixation is the process by which carbon atoms or carbon based molecules are bonded to (or fixed to) other carbon atoms or molecules. Carbohydrates, such as glucose, are constructed in this manner. This process requires a lot of energy that is supplied by ATP and NADPH.You can tell young learners that the plant “sticks together” carbons from carbon dioxide.

, The light independent reactions are the last set of photosynthesis reactions. Through carbon fixation, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is produced. G3P is a small carbohydrate that can be converted into longer carbohydrates such as sucrose or starch.Sucrose is used by the plant for energy.
Starch is stored in the chloroplasts as an energy reserve.

Color your drawing.",How to Draw Botanical Plants," Sketch in a 5-point star. Inside that draw a small circle, and another smaller one inside that. Refer to the image at the right to help you.

, Each petal starts at the point where our star's triangular points connect with each other. If you are trying to draw a plant of specific family, then the size, shape, and number of petals will vary depending on the type of flower it has. And don't worry if you overlap the petals - that will add realism to the drawing.

, Draw in 3-6 pointy ovals of differing sizes that start at the center of the flower. Again, the way your leaves look will depend on your plant. Note: looking at a picture of the plant in question will help you with your accuracy.

, Draw additional lines inside the leaves, starting from the center of each leaf. Draw the leaf lines going away from the flower and not towards it.

, Erase the overlapping guidelines. Be careful not to erase any of your detailing, though (it’s easy to mistake leaf veins and the contours of petals for unnecessary lines).

, Try to use as bright of a color as possible, since there won't be too much variety within one plant and you want your drawing to really pop!

, Draw the top of the tree by forming large triangle shape using squiggly lines instead of three straight lines. Add also bushes of grass below the trunk of the tree.;
, Add small dots on each pot.

, Make the stems of the flowers wavy as if they're dancing with each other. To draw the flowers, draw a large circle in the middle of the stem and then surround it with smaller ovals (petals).

, This can be done simply by drawing three small triangles.

,, Illustrate the wind by creating thin and long crescent moons. Draw leaves on them to make it seem as though the winds are blowing.

, Erase pencil lines to make everything look nice and tidy.

, You can copy the colors used on the accompanied illustration or use your imagination.

Collect some houseplant reference books, making sure that they cover houseplants and not just native plants or garden plants. Some of these helpful references are listed below.
Try the library for plant reference books you can look at for free.
Ask nurseries and greenhouses if they have references you can look at.
The County Extension offices in many US states may also have references you look at or purchase at a nominal fee.

, Try to look at a complete specimen with leaves, stems, roots and any flowers, fruits or seeds.

, Use a hand magnification lens if needed.


What color and shape is the flower, seed or fruit?
Does the flower have male and female sex organs in each flower or flowers with only one type of sex part. See the Tips section for sex part identification.
How many petals does the flower have? If it has too many to count, just use the term multiple.
Does the flower have sepals--the little green leaf-like structures sometimes found on the back of flowers?
Split open fruit or seed pods and see if there are sections inside and what the seeds look like if there are any.
What shape and size is the leaf? Are the leaves divided into lobes or leaflets?
What is the shape of the leaf’s edge? Is it smooth, or does it have small “teeth” or big jagged “teeth”?
How do the leaves attach to the stem? How do the branches attach to the trunk (if it has any)? Are they arranged opposite each other or alternately on the stem or is there no visible stem?
Does the leaf have hairs?
What color is the leaf on the front and back?
Look at the shape of the stem and its color.
Look at the root system to see if it is fibrous, tap rooted, or does it have bulbs or tubers.

Know the basic formula for calculating molarity.,
Examine the problem.,
Divide the number of moles by the number of liters.,
Write your answer.",How to Calculate Molarity1," Molarity is equal to the number of moles of a solute divided by the volume of the solution in liters.As such, it is written as: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution


Example problem: What is the molarity of a solution containing 0.75 mol NaCl in 4.2 liters?;
, Finding molarity demands that you have the number of moles and the number of liters. If the problem provides each of these figures, no preliminary calculations are needed.


Example problem:

Moles = 0.75 mol NaCl
Volume = 4.2 L



, The resulting quotient will give you the number of moles per liter of solution, otherwise known as molarity.


Example problem: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.75 mol / 4.2 L = 0.17857142

, Round off the number of digits after the decimal point to two or three, depending on your instructor's preference. When you write out the answer, abbreviate ""molarity"" with ""M"" and state the chemical abbreviation of the solute involved.


Example problem: 0.179 M NaCl

Know the basic formula for calculating molarity.,
Examine the problem.,
Find the molar mass of the solute.,
Convert the grams into moles.,
Divide the number of moles by the number of liters.,
Write your answer.",How to Calculate Molarity2," Molarity expresses the relationship between the number of moles of a solute per liters of solution, or the volume of that solution. In formula form, molarity is expressed as: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution


Example problem: What is the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 3.4 g of KMnO4 in 5.2 liters of water?

, Finding molarity demands that you have the number of moles and the number of liters. If you are not provided with the number of moles but you do have the volume and mass of the solution, you will need to use these two figures to calculate the number of moles before continuing on.


Example problem:

Mass = 3.4 g KMnO4

Volume = 5.2 L



, In order to calculate the number of moles from the mass or grams of solute used, you must first determine the molar mass of the solute. This can be done by adding together the separate molar masses of each element found in the solution. Find the molar mass of each element using the periodic table of elements.


Example problem:

Molar mass of K = 39.1 g
Molar mass of Mn = 54.9 g
Molar mass of O = 16.0 g
Total molar mass = K + Mn + O + O + O + O = 39.1 + 54.9 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 158.0 g




, Now that you have the molar mass of the solute, you need to multiply the number of grams of solute in the solution by a conversion factor of 1 mole over the formula weight (molar mass) of the solute. This will give you the number of moles of the solute for this equation.


Example problem: grams of solute * (1/molar mass of solute) = 3.4 g * (1 mol / 158 g) = 0.0215 mol

, Now that you have the number of moles, you can divide this value by the number of liters of solution in order to find the molarity.


Example problem: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.0215 mol / 5.2 L = 0.004134615

, You should round off the number of digits after the decimal point to the place requested by your instructor. Usually, this will be two or three places after the decimal point. Additionally, when you write out the answer, abbreviate “molarity” with “M” and state the solute involved.


Example problem: 0.004 M KMnO4

Divide the number of moles by the number of liters.,
Write your answer.",How to Calculate Molarity3," In order to find molarity, you need to calculate the number of moles of solute for a solution per liter of solution. Milliliters cannot be used. The general formula used to express molarity is written as: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution


Example problem: What is the molarity of a solution containing 1.2 moles CaCl2 in 2905 milliliters?

, Calculating molarity requires you to have the number of moles and the number of liters. If you are provided with the volume in milliliters instead of liters, you will need to convert the volume into liters before continuing on in your calculations.


Example problem:

Moles = 1.2 mol CaCl2

Volume = 2905 ml



, Note that you could also simply move the decimal point to the left three places.


Example problem: 2905 ml * (1 L / 1000 ml) = 2.905 L

, Now that you have the number of liters, you can divide the number of moles of solute by this value in order to find the molarity of the solution.


Example problem: molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 1.2 mol CaCl2 / 2.905 L = 0.413080895

, Round off the number of digits after the decimal point to the amount requested by your instructor (usually two or three places). When you write out the answer, you should also abbreviate “molarity” with “M,” and state the solute.

Find the molarity of a solution made by dissolving 5.2 g of NaCl in 800 ml of water.,
Find the molar mass of NaCl.,
Multiply the mass of the solute by its molar mass conversion factor.,
Divide 800 ml of water by 1000.,
Divide the number of moles of solute by the number of liters of solution.,
Tidy up your answer.",How to Calculate Molarity4," Identify the values provided to you in the problem: mass in grams and volume in milliliters.




Mass = 5.2 g NaCl
Volume = 800 ml water



, Do this by adding together the molar mass of sodium, Na, and the molar mass of chlorine, Cl.


The molar mass of Na = 22.99 g
The molar mass of Cl = 35.45 g
The molar mass of NaCl = 22.99 + 35.45 = 58.44 g

, In this instance, the molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g, so the conversion factor is 1 mol / 58.44 g.


Moles NaCl = 5.2 g NaCl * (1 mol / 58.44 g) = 0.08898 mol = 0.09 mol

, Since there are 1000 milliliters per liter, you will need to divide the number of milliliters in this problem by 1000 in order to find the number of liters.


You could also look at it as multiplying 800 ml by a conversion factor of 1 L / 1000 ml.
To hasten the process, you could simply move the decimal point three places to the left instead of multiplying or dividing anything.
Volume = 800 ml * (1 L / 1000 ml) = 800 ml / 1000 ml = 0.8 L

, In order to find the molarity, you need to divide 0.09 mol, the number of moles of the solute NaCl, by 0.8 L, the volume of the solution in liters.


molarity = moles of solute / liters of solution = 0.09 mol / 0.8 L = 0.1125 mol/L

, Round your answer off to two or three decimal places and abbreviate molarity with “M.”


Answer: 0.11 M NaCl

Culture an interest in herbalism.,
Obtain recognized training as an herbalist.,
Choose your location wisely.,
Consider entering a partnership.,
Take precautions.,
Study the relevant knowledge areas of knowledge that distinguish a professional herbalist.",How to Become an Herbalist," It is not impossible to begin training in herbal studies without prerequisites, but a basic understanding of herbs and other botanical systems will allow a helping hand through your future. If you are still in high school, pay attention to your biology classes. Likewise, an interest in other aspects of science and a love of the outdoor environment are wise paths to travel before engaging in this career path.;
, A career in herbalism can be pursued formally or informally, depending on the way in which you intend to practice herbalism.


If you're pursuing recognition as a folk herbalist within a limited or informal group of people (such as an indigenous group), find out what the standards are as set by the group and fulfill them.
If you wish to become a professional herbalist with broadly recognized credentials, there are many courses and diplomas offered around the world by leading universities and other educational facilities that you are able to choose from and work towards. No matter which path you choose, verify beforehand that the coursework can be applied towards certification by a peer-reviewed organization such as:
The Natural Healing College Master Herbalist & Holistic Health Practitioner
The American Herbalists Guild, Registered Herbalist (RH) designationThe National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, Diplomate in Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM)"" or ""Diplomate in Chinese Herbology (NCCAOM)"" designation
National Institute of Medical Herbalists (UK)


You can also practice herbalism as a naturopathic physician by passing a series of rigorous exams and fulfilling academic and clinical requirements similar to those of a medical doctor (versus a traditional naturopath, who has no widely recognized standards to meet).

, You might be tempted to stay in the town or city where you were trained as a herbalist, but competition there is likely to be fierce.

, You can practice alone or with other herbalists or healers. Income potential is higher if you practice alone, but so are costs. Starting a private practice can cost between $5,000 and $10,000 and it may be up to three years before you turn a profit, whereas in a joint partnership you get support from your colleagues, increased referrals (if you work in a clinic), and shared overhead, health insurance, malpractice insurance, and other costs.

, What will happen if a patient sues you? Consider professional liability insurance (malpractice insurance). Also make sure you have general liability insurance that covers such things as slips and falls. If you work from home, consider zoning regulations in your neighborhood.

,



The foundation of the herbal theory; the first uses of plants for medicinal purposes through anthropological history. Evidence from 60,000 years ago suggests Neanderthals used medicinal plants. More recently, written records from 5,000 years ago describe the well-established use of plants such as thyme and caraway as natural medicine. Today, traditional Chinese herbology still occurs from the times of the dynasties.

Specific remedies for different conditions; herbal therapeutics; the use of food and herbs in health and healing. There are many scientific orders, classes and families to understand and master. A typical herbalist prescribes specific herbs in tincture, fluid extract, capsule or tea form and may suggest dietary changes, exercises and other therapies to help the healing process. We can also inadvertently treat our body with herbs. The ingredient caffeine that gives us a mild lift which is familiarized with the cola/coke soft drink , for instance, is from the herbal motif of alkaloids. On the other hand, different types of alkaloids such as datura can lead to severe intoxication and eventually death. Remember, constructing a career in herbalism requires a concise background of biological origins.

Providing essential principles of herbs including diet and energy; teaching the principles of disease and diagnosis within multiple frameworks of medical systems; teaching herbal preparation, therapeutics and formula. Herbalism is all about how to use herbs for yourself and for everyone's good, and is a lifelong process. Herbs are a natural way to treat illnesses, and most taken for treatment will pass harmlessly through the system if needed for our body. We can't say the same for prescription drugs which are stored in the liver and other organs, and eventually our bodies stop responding to certain drugs that may have been lifesavers if used for emergency treatment only. The uses and effects of herbs in medicinal practice are important principals. Signatures play a main part in determining the characteristics in herbs, and these can be color, root structure, fissures in the bark of certain trees and vines which are considered good herbs to use to remedy the blood system. Sometimes, just the name alone can indicate particular herbs, such as heartsease , eyebright, cancer root and throat root. Principals of herbs are a major source of the spiritual qualities of herbs and what defines a medicine.

Learn other forms of poison oak.,
Learn what causes the rash.,
Recognize the rash.,

Keep the rash from spreading to others.,
Seek medical help.",How to Identify Poison Oak," Poison oak is similar to its close relatives poison ivy and poison sumac because they are all members of the same botanical family. The most common type of poison oak, known as western poison oak, grows most commonly along the Pacific coast in Oregon, Washington, and California. It can grow as a small shrub in open spaces or as a climbing vine in shaded forest areas.Other varieties of poison oak include Atlantic poison oak, which grows in the southeast US. This variety is much less common than the western poison oak.;
, A good way to avoid a poison oak rash is to never touch a plant that you think may be poison oak. In order to get close enough to the plant to identify it, use a stick or a gloved hand to examine it more closely.


If it turns out to be poison oak, make sure anything that has come into contact with the plant is washed with soap and water.

, Poison oak, whether it is growing as a shrub or a climbing vine, has a trifoliate leaf structure. This means that the leaves grow in sets of threes off the stem. The edges of the leaves have a wavy or scalloped appearance.


As the name suggests, the leaves look a bit like oak leaves., The top side of the leaves are typically a glossy green color. They can also be yellowish, reddish, or brownish depending on the health of the plant and the season. On the underside of the leaf, there is less sheen, less green, and more of a velvety appearance., Stems tend to be a bit greyish in color, though, given the lighting in some forested areas, this can be difficult to see. The stems will also be covered in tiny hair or thorn-like structures., Poison oak has yellowish-green small flowers in the spring. The plant will also produce light green berries throughout the summer and into the fall.This will help you rule out other plants by noting what it doesn’t have. If it doesn’t have pointed leaves and it doesn’t have thorns, it isn’t poison oak.

,


In the winter, it loses its leaves and looks like reddish-brown sticks (sometimes a few poking up from the ground, sometimes a big clump) with alternating stubs.
You can also find it as a thick vine climbing up a tree, sometimes (depending on the season) with small poison oak leaves coming out of it.

, Both the leaves and the stems of poison oak contain urushiol, an oily plant substance that triggers an allergic reaction in the form of the poison oak rash. Urushiol can also be found in the roots and even in the dead plant.In addition, urushiol can become airborne if the plant is burned and is easily transported from one object to another.
The rash from poison oak is not contagious in the standard sense, but if someone has the urushiol on their hands and touches another person, that second person can react as well.
All parts of the poison oak plant contain the toxin urushiol. Even when the leaves fall off in winter, the plant is not safe to touch., A rash from exposure to poison oak can vary depending on the person because some people are more sensitive to urushiol than others. In general, the rash will be very itchy and very red, with red bumps that may blister and ooze fluids. The rash can be streaky and patchy and can range from relatively mild to very severe., When you are exposed to poison oak, first rinse off any exposed area with soap and warm water as soon as possible, hopefully within 30 minutes.Also wash any clothing or tools that may have been exposed to the plant., In order to help relieve the itching of the rash, apply calamine lotion to the site. You can also apply topical steroids such as clobetasol or systemic steroids and antihistamines. Also try a cold compress or an oatmeal bath.To make an oatmeal bath, pour two cups of oatmeal into a nylon sock or stocking and tie it onto the tap so that warm bath water runs through the oatmeal. Soak in the tub or soak the affected areas for at least 30 minutes.
You can also use baking soda in a warm bath., Be aware that urushiol can be easily passed to another person, animal, or object. Make sure anything or anybody that may have come into contact with poison oak is carefully washed with soap and water.Most rashes will heal in five to 12 days, but the rash can last as long as a month or more., Call emergency services if the reaction to the poison oak is severe. You should also call is you or the infected the person has trouble swallowing, breathing, or has severe swelling at the site of contact or anywhere on the body."

Do an image and information search on the Internet for ""Stinging Nettle"" or Urtica dioica.,
Take a look at the entire plant.,
Look at the stems.,
Notice the type of root this plant has.,
Study the leaves.,
Look for the flower cluster of the plant.,
Understand where you are most likely to find this plant.,
Use the steps above to distinguish from other similar species.",How to Identify Stinging Nettle1," The latter name will give you the best results of what stinging (or common) nettle looks like in order to better help you identify the species out in the field. Also, some extra information to know may be useful:


U. dioica is known by several other common names, including ""Common Nettle"", ""Bigsting Nettle"", ""Tall Nettle"", and ""Slender Nettle."" There are actually 35 to 40 different species in the Urtica genus in Family Urticaceae.
All true nettles are a part of the Nettle Family Urticaceae. There are many other species of plants with the common name ""nettle"" attached to it, but may not be part of the aforementioned taxonomical family. One such exemplary species is Hemp Nettle, Galeopsis tetrahit, which actually belongs to the Mint Family, Lamiaceae.
It may be of interest to note that not all species of stinging nettle have literal stinging properties. There are six subspecies of stinging nettle, five of which have stinging properties. This species, along with its subspecies, is distributed all over the world, from Africa to Europe and in North and South America. Stinging nettle is native to western North America, Europe, Asia, northern Africa, and introduced elsewhere.
The medicinal properties of nettles were first harnessed in medieval Europe. The plant has been shown to cleanse the body of metabolic waste and increase production of red blood cells. Even today, nettles are steamed and dried for stews and tea. However, this plant is often also seen as a noxious weed that dominates disturbed areas in or near forests, or in clearings with moist, fertile soil.;
, Stinging nettle is primarily single-stalked, and a perennial. A single plant you may find in an area will have been borne from a seed, whereas a group of plants are typically from rhizomatous colonies. The perennial nature of stinging nettle is due to the growth points found on these rhizomes., Stinging nettle stems (singular, never branched) can get as tall as about 1.5 feet (0.46 m) to 9 feet (2.7 m). The stems are sharply angled (typically 4-angled), often with bristly-pubescent stinging hairs. Occasionally the stems may be smooth.

Some stinging nettle subspecies may have green stems, whereas other subspecies may have purple stems.

, The roots are predominantly rhizomatous, with a parent plant capable of creating large colonies that can expand up to 8.2 feet (2.5 m) in diameter per year. This rhizomatous nature can also make these plants quite long-lived. Some colonies have been found and estimated to be as much as 50 years old or more. While the plants themselves are not long lasting, it's the rhizomatous nature and the pink buds that form on the roots that allow it to proliferate., Leaves are arranged as opposite on the stem. They are typically oval to lance-shaped and 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 4.5 inches (11 cm) long, and around 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) to 1.2 inches (3.0 cm) wide. Both upper and lower surfaces of the leaves are covered in stinging hairs, and have coarsely serrated edges. The stipules (membraneous structures at the base of each leaf) are 0.2 inches (5.1 mm) to 0.5 inches (13 mm) long. Stalks are around 0.4 inches (10 mm) to 0.5 inches (13 mm) long., These branching clusters are borne on the axils of the leaves, and bear green flowers, with only sepals, no petals. The sepals are 0.04 inches (1.0 mm) to 0.08 inches (2.0 mm) long. These flowers come as two types: Male and female. Flowers are wind-pollinated.

Male flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with 4 sepals and 4 stamens.
Female flowers are more green, with 4 pubescent (hairy) sepals and 1 pistil.

, Stinging nettle is primarily found in moist wooded, open, and disturbed areas, including pastures, farmyards, and roadsides., The next part below shows some species that are commonly confused with U. diocia, from those related to a couple completely unrelated to this species."
"
Take note of the several species that can be confused with Stinging Nettle.,

Distinguish from Clearweed (Pilea pumila).,Distinguish from Self Heal (Prunella vulgaris).,Distinguish from Hedge Nettle (Stachys palustris).",How to Identify Stinging Nettle2," There are several different species found in many areas that can be easily mistaken for Stinging Nettle. Several of these are in the Urticaceae family, others are not. These similar species or look-alikes include:

False Nettle (Boehmeria cylindrica)
Horse Balm (Collinsonia canadensis)
White Snakeroot (Eupatorium rugosum)
Hemp Nettle (Galeopsis tetrahit)
White Deadnettle (Lamium album)
Wood Nettle (Laportea canadensis)

Horehound (Marrubium vulgare)
Spearmint (Mentha spicata)
Pellitory (Parietaria officinalis)
Clearweed (Pilea pumila)
Self Heal (Prunella vulgaris)
Hedge Nettle (Stachys palustris)

, False nettle has finer toothing along the margins of the leaves, and the leaves themselves tend to be a little more bigger at the base. The stems of each flower cluster are erect and angle upward from the stem, unlike stinging nettle (which are droopy). There are no stinging hairs on any part of this plant. This is despite the fine hairs found on the leaves and stems.,, This plant is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae), therefore does not have stinging hairs. This plant is relatively shorter than stinging nettle, growing around 1.5 feet (0.46 m) to 3 feet (0.91 m) in height. Stems are light green to tan, and usually hairless. Leaves are larger than stinging nettle, about 5 inches (13 cm) long and about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) wide, and are arranged alternate along the stem. Leaf size decreases as they ascend the stem. They are typically darker green on top (light below). Leaves have serrated edges, and heart-shaped near the bottom, and lance-shaped closer to the top. Flowers are white and divided into branching clusters primarily top of the plant, though some flowers also branch out from the base of the leaf.,,, This plant also contains stinging properties like Stinging Nettle, and is in the same family (Urticaceae). Plants are generally shorter than stinging nettle, reaching only 4 feet (1.2 m) tall at the most. However, wood nettle is distinguished by its larger and wider leaves. These leaves are generally 6 inches (15 cm) long and about 4 inches (10 cm) wide. They appear almost egg-shaped or oval, though like stinging nettle has a sharp tip and is serrated at the edges. Leaves have a wrinkled appearance, especially at emergence; this becomes less so as the leaves reach maturity. Leaves are alternate along the stem, unlike stinging nettle which has opposite leaf arrangement.

Flower clusters are droopy like stinging nettle, but they are born on cymes (branching flower clusters). Male flowers are borne from the axils of the leaves, whereas female flowers are at the top of the plant. Wood nettle will have branching flower clusters at the top of the plant, unlike stinging nettle.

,,,,, This is a non-stinging annual that is a part of the Nettle family (Urticeae). The most interesting and defining characteristic of this plant is the translucency of the stems (particularly as plants get older, or as the growing season progresses), hence the common name. Stems may be reddish-green, grey-green or light-green in appearance. It grows shorter than stinging nettle (growing as high as only 0.5 feet (0.15 m) to 2 feet (0.61 m) tall), and leaves and stems are hairless, smooth, and with a shiny appearance. Leaves are smaller, 0.75 inches (1.9 cm) to 4 inches (10 cm) long and half as wide. Each leaf has a thin, membraneous texture (as in they feel smooth almost like human skin) with a prominent mid-vein and two visible side-veins, one on either side of that main vein. Clearweed leaves are more oval or ovate.

Flowers of clearweed are in narrow racemes that are shorter than stinging nettle, at only about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. There is also some branching on each flowering stem.

Look at the needles of the spruce.,
Examine the cones.,
Feel the branches.,
Look at the shape of the branches.",How to Identify Spruce Trees1," Before trying to narrow down the species of spruce tree, first make sure that you are not looking at a fir or pine. Examining the needles of the trees is the easiest way to make the distinction between them. The needles of a spruce tree are attached individually to its branches, as opposed to being in clusters. They also have four sides and roll easily between your fingers.The needles of pine trees grow in clusters, which makes them immediately distinguishable from spruce trees.
Like spruce needles, the needles of fir trees also grow individually. However, while spruce tree needles are sharply pointed and easy to roll between your fingers, fir needles are flatter, less pointy and can’t be rolled between your fingers.;
, The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend. Pine cones have scales that are thick, rough and woody, which makes the cones inflexible., The needles of spruce trees grow out of small woody pegs from the branches. When the needles fall from the tree, these pegs are left behind, giving the branches a rough feel. The pegs look like little three-dimensional dots along the surface of the branch. The branches of fir and pine trees lack these stalks, and therefore feel smoother than those of spruce trees., Spruce trees are bushy and full, and have upturned branches. Fir trees, on the other hand, have downturned branches, making them easily distinguishable. Pine trees also have upturned branches but they have fewer branches which makes them look slightly sparser than spruce trees."

Identify any unknown oaks using a Field Guide by the US Forestry Service.",How to Identify Oak Leaves1," Oaks, which all fall under the genus (Quercus) are wide-spread trees found in temperate climates the world over. There are over 600 known species of Oak, with 55 found in the continental United States. Because there is such a wide variety of oak trees in the world, it can be hard to find characteristics that unite them all. However, they do exist:



Acorns are the easiest way to spot an oak tree. If the tree produces acorns, it's an oak.

Lobed leaves are leaves that have rounded or pointed knobs extending out from the center line. While a few oaks do not have lobes, all of the leaves are generally symmetrical around a clear median line.

Small, scaly bark. Bark on oak trees is variable, but it is generally made up of small, hard, and scaly bits of bark. This is unlike the large, flaky chunks of pines or the wallpaper-like bark on birch trees, and is much more cracked and grooved.;
, Lobes are the bits of leaf that extend out to each side from the center of the leave, like points on a star. White oaks have rounded lobes while red oaks have pointed ones. This is an important distinction that will cut the number of potential trees you're trying to identify in half.On red oaks, the vein of the leave extends all the way out to the edge, creating this point., Each area has its own assortment of oak species, which is often drastically different from other areas. The species of oak you will encounter changes great depending on where you are in the world, as it is rare for an oak found on the east coast to be found in the west, a southern oak in the north, etc. You can generally figure out your region with a few criteria (examples here are for Continental US):


General location -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, Southwest
Inland or coastal.
Mountainous or flat terrain., The lobes are the sections that extend out from the center of the leaf's stem on both sides. If possible, compare multiple leaves to find the average number of lobes. A few species such as the willow oak have no lobes at all, but most oaks have multiple lobes.Count at least 4-5 leaves when identifying, as this will help when you turn to the field guide.

, Look at the area between the lobes and determine whether the indentations are deep or shallow. White oak leaves often have variable indentations that alternate randomly between shallow and deep, where red oaks can have dramatic, sharp indentations or none at all.

, The leaves of evergreen oaks are shiny and dark green all year, but most oaks will turn colors in autumn. Some oaks, such as scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), sport brilliant colors in the fall. White oaks and chestnut oaks are often a dull brown when color comes around.


If it's summer, look at whether the leaves are dark green or light green, and whether they're shiny or not, to help determine the species.

, Evergreen oaks and a couple red oaks such as scrub oak have smaller leaves while most red oaks and nearly all deciduous white oaks have much larger leaves (at least 4 in.). This is one of the more important distinguishing features between similar species of oak.

, Using the data you've collected, identify your oak tree using a tree manual or field guide. There are dozens and dozens of oak trees out there, and you can't he expected to know them all by heart. Use the above criteria to narrow down your choices, then use the guide to find what oak you're looking at. You can look through the collection of common oak trees below, or consult a Field Guide, found through the US Forestry Service.


Turn to the appropriate section. Most guides are divided into a red oak section and a white oak section
Narrow your selection down to the oaks specific to your area. A good guide should have distribution maps for each species.
Once you have a list of possibilities, look at the pictures for each one to determine your tree.

Ask the nursery to identify a Christmas spruce.",How to Identify Spruce Trees2," Certain kinds of spruce trees are common to certain locations. Note where the tree is located and research the kinds of spruce trees native to the area. Find an illustrated guide of trees in your region to help you identify the species of spruce.


The Colorado Spruce is common throughout the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest.
The Red Spruce, The Black Spruce and The Blue Spruce are all common varieties that typically grow in the Northeast.
The White Spruce and the Norway Spruce are prevalent both in the Northeast and the Northwest.
There are also several varieties of spruce that are native to countries in East Asia, Turkey and areas of Western Europe.

, Different spruce species flourish in different conditions. Some spruce trees tend to grow only near water sources or places with rich soil, while others do well even in harsh climates. Take into account the area in which the spruce is growing.


The Colorado spruce grows best in environments that have rich, gravely soil like the areas around rivers or streams.The Black Spruce typically grows in bogs and swamps, which is why it is also referred to as the Bog Spruce.The Red Spruce is often found in cool forests alongside other conifers.The White Spruce tends to grow in moist acidic soil around rivers or streams and often grows around other coniferous hardwood trees.The Norway Spruce can grow in a variety of cooler climates, but flourishes in moist and acidic soils., If you are trying to identify a Christmas tree, you may not know where the tree came from. If you are trying to identify what kind of spruce your Christmas tree is, ask the nursery you purchased it from. If you didn’t purchase it from a store or nursery, you will have to look closely at the tree to identify it.


The most common spruces used as Christmas trees are the Colorado Spruce and the White Spruce."
"
Examine the needles.,
Look at the cones.,
Look at the bark color.,
Consider the shape of the spruce.",How to Identify Spruce Trees3," The needles of the spruce differ among the various species of the tree. The color of the needles, their measurements, and even the smell when the needles are crushed can be helpful factors in identifying the tree.


The Colorado Spruce has blue or blue-silver needles that are quite sharp and are ¾ to 1 ½ inches long.
The Black Spruce has stubby needles that are only about ½ long.
The Red Spruce has yellow-green needles around ½ - 1 inch long that give off the scent of orange rind when they are crushed.The White Spruce has bluish green needles that give off an unpleasant scent of skunk when crushed.The Norway Spruce has dark green needles that are about 1 inch long., The cones of spruce trees often vary between different species. Particularly pay attention to the measurements and the color of the cones. If the cones of the spruce do not match the descriptions of the most common spruces listed below, use a tree identification guide to help you narrow down the tree specie.


The Colorado Spruce has dark brown cones that are around 2-4 inches long.The Black Spruce has roundish dark-purple cones that are ½ to 1 ½ inches long. The cones grow around the top of the tree.The Red Spruce has reddish-brown cones that are around 1 ½ inches long and are rough in texture.The White Spruce has thin cones that are about 1 ¼ to 2 inches in length. Its cones are light brown and very flexible.The Norway Spruce has very large distinctive cones that grow about 4-7 inches and are light brown in color., Spruce trees also have subtle variations in bark color among species. Though it may not give you an answer by itself, the bark color is also an additional factor to consider when identifying the tree.


The Colorado Spruce has thin bark that forms in small scales. The bark turns from pale grey to brown as the tree ages.The Black Spruce has thin, scaly bark that is dark green-brown in color.The Red Spruce has bark with a reddish hue which is especially visible between the scales of the bark.The White Spruce has ash-brown, sometimes grayish bark.The Norway Spruce has scaly bark that is a gray-brown., For several species of spruce, the shape of the tree is the most obvious distinguishing feature. You can also use the height of the tree to narrow down the specie, but remember that the tree may not be fully grown.


The Colorado Spruce has a squat, pyramidal shape. Mature trees grow 70-80 feet tall.The Black Spruce has a narrow shape and often has a stalk-like top, since the branches at the top of tree are quite short. It grows up to 50-70 feet tall.The Red Spruce grows straight and tall and is conical in shape/ It grows from 60-80 feet tall.The White Spruce has a broad base is often somewhat asymmetrical, especially toward the top off the tree. It grows 60-90 feet tall.The Norway Spruce grows very symmetrically, and often has branches that skim the ground, obscuring the trunk. It typically grows 80-90 feet tall. "

Identify the Black Oak.",How to Identify Oak Leaves2," There is not only a category for all white oaks, there is actually a White Oak (Quercus alba) as well. It is distinguished by scaled, wart-like marks on the acorns and lightly colored bark. The leaves have:


5-7 lobes, fanning out wider as you get to the tip of the leaf.
Indentations roughly halfway to the center.
Bright, light green color.

, This Midwestern oak has dark bark and distinctive leaves:


Usually 5 lobes.
Wide, cross-like lobes.
Leathery, dark texture and color.

, Bur oaks, also found in the Midwest, have enormous leaves and distinctive acorns, which have an enormous cup (the little hat on the end) that almost covers the entire thing.


Leaves can get up to 1ft long
Wide, almost flat-ended lobes.

, Found often in rocky terrain, this widespread tree has reddish-brown acorns, dark brown, furrowed bark.


The edges of the leaves look like a serrated knife, but the veins don't go all the way to the points.
Leaf is wide on top, then gets smaller near the base.
Leaves between 4-9"" long and 4"" wide., The common red oak has flat-topped acorns, like it was wearing a pork-pie hat.


Light-green leaves with 6-7 lobes.
Indented roughly midway to the center.
Pointed lobes may have two smaller points on either side.

, The cup of the egg-shaped acorn only covers 1/4 of the whole nut, and the bark is long and light colored. A tall tree, it can get over 100 feet in height.


Leaves are dark green.
Lobes divide at the end into many bristle-tipped teeth.
Deep indentations.

, A common decorative tree, these fast-growing oaks have small, distinctive acorns with a saucer shaped cap and smooth, gray bark.


Thin leaves with deep indentations, making the leaf look skinny.
5-7 lobes, each with multiple points at the end.
Very bright, vibrant fall coloring to leaves.
The northern Pin Oak has similar leaves, but a much longer acorn.

, Black oaks have indistinctive leaves, but they do have a bright orange under-bark that you can often see in cracks on the tree.


Dark green leaves.
Large leaves, up to 12-inches long, that are wider at the ends than the base."

Behold the breadth of the oak family.,
Understand which oak species grow in your region.",How to Identify Oak Trees1," There are approximately 600 individual species listed in the Quercus (Oak) genus--most are trees, though a few are shrubs. Some are deciduous, some evergreen, some semi-evergreen.Oaks are mostly native to woodlands in the Northern Hemisphere, but they vary widely, from cold and temperate forests across North America and Europe to the tropical jungles of Asia and Central America.
Some evergreen oak trees (particularly certain American Species) are commonly called ""Live Oak"". This grouping name describes several species with an evergreen growth pattern, and it does not reflect any taxonomic classification group--in some cases, these species are only distantly related. Thus, evergreen oaks (Live Oaks) can be considered as a type of oak tree, but only insofar as they're an evergreen oak variety.;
, Find an illustrated field identification guide to take with you to the woods; pictures will help you immensely in your quest to name specific species of oak.


In North America, oak trees are split into two main groups: ""red oak"" and ""white oak"". Red oaks tend to have darker bark, and lobed leaves that come to a point; white oaks tend to have lighter bark, and leaves with rounded lobes.Common ""white oak"" species include chinkapin oak (found in limestone-rich soils), live oak, blackjack oak (found on dry ridges), shingle oak (found on moist slopes), swamp chestnut oak (found in wetlands), white oak (found in various ecosystems), swamp white oak (found in wetlands), and overcup oak (found on stream-banks, in marshy bottomlands).Common ""red oak"" species include water oak (found near stream-banks and lowlands), northern red oak (found in various habitats), southern red oak (found on moist and dry slopes), scarlet oak (found on dry slopes), willow oak (found on moist slopes), pin oak (found in wetlands), and cherrybark oak (found near moist slopes and bottomlands)."

Learn to identify oak leaves.,
Look closely.,
Look for green leaves in summer, red leaves in fall, and brown leaves in winter.,
Use the fall foliage to tell between red and white oaks.",How to Identify Oak Trees2," Look for a ""lobe and sinus"" pattern on the oak leaves--the blades of the leaf and the indentations in between.


The lobes of the leaf are the rounded and pointed protrusions that give the leaf its shape. Think of these lobes like ""leaf fingers"", or extensions of the stem. Different species of oak may have either pointed or rounded lobes. Red oaks tend to have pointed lobes, and white oaks tend to have rounded lobes.
Between each lobe is a sinus, which is an indentation in the leaf that accentuates the lobes. Sinuses may be variably deep, shallow, wide, or narrow.

, Oak leaf shapes can vary across a single tree. You may need to inspect a number of leaves to make an accurate classification.If you can't tell the species from the leaves alone, consider other characteristics, such as the acorn, the bark, and the location--both in terms of terrain and geographic location.
Oak leaves grow in a spiral pattern along the branch, meaning that a fan of leaves will rarely appear ""flat"" or parallel in the way that, say, palm fronds grow.
Oak branches tend to divert from a straight line, and they do not have opposing growth on the branches: imagine that you're looking at a fork with multiple branches originating in the same place.

, Most oak tree leaves sport a deep green hue during the summer months, but transform into red and brown colors for the fall.


The oak tree is one of the most colorful fall trees, which is another reason they are popular in many types of landscaping today. Some oak leaves also emerge in a red or pink shade in early spring, but quickly change to their standard green color by summer.
Oaks tend to lose their leaves late in the season, and younger trees or branches will hold their dead brown leaves all the way into spring. They will begin to fall when new leaves start to grow in the spring.
A telltale sign of an oak in the winter is a tree with dead brown leaves. Oak leaves have a longer decay rate and will stay around longer than most other leaves. You can usually find them near the base of an oak tree, but be careful, as leaves can blow around on a windy day.

,


White oak species may yield reddish-brown leaves when autumn comes, but red oaks tend to boast the most dramatic fall foliage. Red oak leaves turn to a deep, rich red which bursts out boldly from the late-autumn forest.Red oaks are often mistaken for maples. Maples tend to show their fall colors earlier in the season, and they've mostly exhausted their pigment by the time the oak foliage comes into full swing. You can also tell maples by their large, distinctive leaves.

"
"
Understand the function of the acorn.,
Look for acorns on branches or around the base of the tree.,
Measure the length and diameter of the nut.,
Note the characteristics of the acorns.",How to Identify Oak Trees3," The acorn contains the ""seeds"" of the oak tree, and an acorn buried in the right location may eventually sprout into a towering oak in its own right.


The acorn develops within a cup-like structure called a cupule. The cupule delivers the nutrients that flow from the roots and leaves all through the tree, along the branches, and through the stem into the acorn. When the acorn rests with its point facing down, the cupule should look like a sort of cap atop the nut. The cap is not a part of the acorn, technically, so much as a protective covering.
Each acorn typically contains one oak seed, although the occasional nut contains two or three. An acorn takes 6 to 18 months to mature into a sprouting oak seedling; acorns sprout best in a moist (but not too moist) environment, and their growth is naturally activated by the cold-snap temperatures of a Northern Hemisphere winter.Acorns have evolved to be deliciously appealing to deer, squirrels, and other woodland creatures. When animals eat the acorns that litter the forest floor, they take tiny oak seeds on board. When they excrete the digested acorn seeds--or, in the case of squirrels, compulsively hide acorns and then forget about them in the springtime--they spread the oak's seeds throughout their ecosystem. Most seeds do not survive to become full-fledged oak trees, but the ones that do survive eventually begin to produce acorns of their own.
When an acorn falls to the ground, it has roughly a 1 in 10,000 chance of becoming a full-fledged oak tree--so you can imagine why it behooves the oak to produce so many!

, Acorns may vary in size and color, but most are characterized by a bumpy ""cap"" and a smooth, pointed bottom. The following measurements may help you gather information about a tree:


Observe the stem on which the acorn grows. Notice the length of the stem and how many acorns grow from it.
Note the appearance of the cupule. The nut of the acorn grows from a woody cup, which may remind you of a head wearing a hat. Cupules may be scaly and include wart-like hairy growths which may take the form of a fringe, or may be characterized by color changes such as concentric rings.

, Some species have long nuts, while others are fat and almost spherical. Measure how much of the acorn the cupule covers.


As a general rule, full-grown red oak acorns are slightly larger: 3/4 to 1 inch long, with the cupule covering about 1/4 of the nut.Full-grown white oak acorns tend to be slightly smaller: 1/2 to 3/4 inch long.

, Note the color of the nut, whether it has a pointed end, and whether it has any other distinguishing features like ridges or stripes.


Red oak acorns tend to take on a rich reddish-brown color, while white oak acorns tend to favor pale-gray hues.
White oak species produce acorns on a one year cycle; these acorns contain fewer tannins and taste better to the woodland creatures--deer, birds, and rodents--that eat them, but they are more sporadic from year to year in acorn production.
Red oak species take two years to mature an acorn, but they reproduce yearly, and they commonly provide a reliable crop on a yearly early basis. Although the red oak acorns contain more tannins and, in theory, don't ""taste as good"", this doesn't seem to deter woodland creatures from gobbling any acorns they can find.
Red oak acorns usually contain large amounts of fats and carbs, but white oak acorns contain the highest carb content.

"
"
Consider the bark.,
Consider the size of the tree.,
Identify oak wood once it's been cut.",How to Identify Oak Trees4," Look for hard, grey, scaly bark with deep grooves and ridges.


The ridges and furrows often mingle with flattened gray areas on the larger branches and the main trunk.
The color of the bark may fluctuate somewhat between oak species, but is is nearly always a shade of gray. Some oak bark is very dark, approaching black, and some bark is nearly white.

, Old-growth oaks, particularly, are distinctive for their impressive size, and in some areas (such as California's ""golden hills"") these behemoths dominate the landscape.


Oak trees tend to grow fairly large and round, with some reaching heights of 100 feet (30.5 m) or more. Oak trees are full and balanced, and it is not uncommon for an oak's width (including branches and foliage) to match its height.
Oak trunks can be massively thick: some species commonly boast a girth of 30 feet (9.1 m) or more. Oak trees can live for more than 200 years--some have been known to live for more than 1000 years.For the most part, the thicker the trunk, the older the tree.
The canopy of the oak tree tends to be relatively broad, which makes this tree a popular provider of shade and privacy during the summer months.

, If a tree has been felled, cut, and split, you may need to consider characteristics like the color, the smell, and the look of the grain.


Oak is one of the hardest trees, which is why its wood is a popular choice for furniture, flooring and other household amenities. Dry oak logs are prized as firewood, as they burn slowly and thoroughly.
Again, there are many species of oak, so it helps to know where the tree was felled. If you don't know where the wood came from, you may only be able to tell whether you're dealing with red or white oak. This knowledge should suffice for most non-scientific purposes.
Red oak wood will have a red tint and will dry to a slightly deeper red. White oak wood will be lighter in color.
Oak wood is often mixed up with maple, but you can distinguish the two by their scent. Maple has a sweeter smell--hence maple sugar--and oak has a heavier, smokier smell.

Identify oaks in the Pacific Northwest.",How to Identify Oaks by the Acorns," The nut of the acorn grows from a woody cup, which may remind you of a hat. The small scales that make up the cup may be thin and flat, or thick and forming wart-like growths (tubercles). This variation is a great start for narrowing down the possible species.All oaks native to North America and Europe have a spiral of overlapping scales on the cup. Some (but not all) East Asian oaks have scales that form concentric rings instead. These are called ring-cupped oaks, and belong to the Cyclobalanopsis subgenus.;
, Acorns come in many shapes, but you can divide them into two rough groups.Some are round (""globose""), or nearly round with a blunt tip. Others are elongated (""ovoid"" or ""oblong"") and usually taper to a point (""fusiform"").


The acorns of some species have parallel ridges (striations) running between the two points. This can vary within one species, so a smooth acorn isn't always diagnostic.

, Mature acorns can be light brown, dark brown, black, or chestnut red. If the acorn is still green or greenish-grey, it probably fell off the tree early.

, Acorns range in size from nubs less than ½ inch (1.25 cm) long, to behemoths the size of your palm. Most acorns within a single species and region are similar in length within about ½ inch (1.25 cm). One important exception is the cork oak of the Mediterranean, which drops large acorns in autumn and a smaller batch in winter.The size and shape of the cup is also useful, and you can easily eyeball it by comparing it to the nut. For example, the Northern red oak has a cup that sits flat at the top of the nut, while the overcup oak and bur oak wrap almost the entire nut in a cup.The length of the stalk the acorn grows on can also help identification.

, The cup of some acorns have hairs on the inner and/or outer surface. You can also look for hairs on the inner surface of the shell, after cracking it open. Botanists describe this hairy material with these terms:Woolly: long, matted hairs. Some species only have hair near the tip of the acorn, so check there.
Pubescent: short, fine hairs.
Glabrous: smooth.

, If an acorn on the ground is sprouting through its shell, it must belong to a species that germinates at this time of year. In North America, oaks are divided into white oaks, which sprout in fall right after the acorns drop, and red oaks, whose acorns spend the winter dormant and sprout in spring.Here, we're talking about the white and red oak categories. These include the specific species ""white oak"" and ""red oak,"" but there are many more possibilities.
Most acorns lose their cup before sprouting. The Asian ring-cupped species are the main exceptions., There are about 400 species of oak worldwide, and over 200 in North America.This guide only covers a few of the most common species in the United States. A tree identification guide for your region or state will help for the species that are less common or limited to smaller areas.

, This guide is divided by the region where the oaks grow. Note that many species only grow in a smaller area within this region.



Central and Eastern United States: East of Minnesota in the north and Texas in the South. Florida is included, but many species do not grow there.

Western United States: This covers the entire Midwest and Pacific coast.


, These acorns have the classic oblong or ovoid acorn shape. Their nuts are light brown or dark brown in color, with few to no red tones. Here are the most common species that fit this description in this region, and their identifying characteristics:White oak (Quercus alba): short, light grey cup with warty scales; cup covers about ¼ of nutChinkapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii): thin cup with fine grey hairs and moderately warty scales; cup covers ¼ to ½ of nutScarlet oak (Quercus coccinea): glossy, dark reddish-brown cup; nut has a blunt tip
Willow oak (Quercus phellos): shallow, flattened cup with hairs inside and out; nut is less than ½"" (13 mm) long
Northern red oak (Quercus rubra): cup scales are reddish-brown, hairy, often with dark margins; inside of cup is smooth or has ring of hair around the scar; nut may have grey stripesShumard oak (Quercus shumardii): Similar to Northern red oak, but scales often have pale margins; some have a deeper, bowl-shaped cup, but not all, These species produce acorns that are round or have a distinct color or shape:Bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa): The largest acorns on the continent, about 1.5 inches (4 cm) long with a very deep cupule that covers at least half of the nut
Water oak (Quercus nigra): shallow cup with fine hairs; round, blackish nut
Southern red oak (Quercus falcata): thin, reddish-brown cup with fine hairs; nut sometimes have lines and hairs near tip.
Pin oak (Quercus palustris): thin, smooth, reddish-brown cup; light brown nut is often striped, and can be either round or ovoid
Post oak (Quercus stellata): thin cup with grey, hairy scales; light brown nut ¾"" (19 mm) long or less, sometimes with faint dark brown stripes; nut can be round or ovoidBlack oak (Quercus velutina): reddish-brown, hairy cup with a knob on top and a fringed edge; hair inside cup as well; light reddish-brown, ovoid nut with faint stripes


, California is dominated by oaks of many species, and naturally occurring hybrids.Here are some of the most common in various parts of California:California black oak (Quercus kelloggii): found throughout the state. Nut usually at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) long, cup varies but scales at margin are usually loose and may be wartyCoast live oak (Quercus agrifolia): found along the coast. Variation makes identification by acorn tough, but cup scales have loose tips and are never warty.Blue oak (Quercus douglasii): found mostly in north and central California. Cup is extremely shallow with thin scales.Engelmann oak (Quercus engelmannii): found in the extreme south. Light brown, oblong nut. Cup has grey hairy scales, warty at the fringe, Scattered oaks are found throughout this region, but of course they are only plentiful in forested sub-regions:Bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa): Found in the northeast Great Plains. 1.5 inch (4 cm) acorns with a cup that covers more than half the acorn.
Post oak (Quercus stellata): Found in the Cross Timbers region. No more than ¾"" (19 mm) long, light brown; grey, thin, hairy cupBlackjack oak (Quercus marilandica): Also in the Cross Timbers. Narrow nuts about ½"" (13 mm) wide, half covered by the cup., Much of the oak habitat in this region has disappeared. These three are the remaining species:Oregon white oak / Garry oak (Quercus garryana): The only oak in Washington state, and the most common one in Oregon.Nut is large (1 inch / 2.5cm+) and cup is shallow with yellowish or reddish brown scales.California black oak (Quercus kelloggii): found in southern Oregon.

Look at the leaves.Features that differentiate hickory leaves from the leaves of other types of trees are:


Several long, narrow leaves that grow from each stalk.,
Look at the shape of the stalks.,
Look at the bark.,
Look at the nuts.,
Look at the pith.,

Leaf size. Depending on the species, a hickory leaflet may be anywhere between 2 inches (5.08 cm) to 8 inches (20.32 cm) long.
Serrated edges. Some may have sharply-pointed teeth, others more rounded serrations.;
, Hickory leaves grow from a distinctive stalk, or rachis. Hickory rachis features include:


Anywhere from 5 to 17 leaves.
Leaves that grow in directly oppositional pairs, perpendicular to the stalk, with a single leaf protruding straight from the end.
Visibly larger leaves near the end of the rachis.

, Hickory trees have bark that forms ridges in a vertical pattern. These ridges may be shallow or deep, far apart or close together, but always vertical. Additionally, some hickory bark becomes raised at the plate edges as the tree matures, and eventually flakes off, from top to bottom.

, Hickory nuts have a woody outer shell, or husk.This husk starts out green but will harden to dark to light brown with a seam around the middle. The thickness of the husk can vary depending on species, but the nut inside will be white or tan and roughly the size of a gumball., The pith of a tree is the central column of its branches. All hickory tress have a solid, tan, 5-sided pith.Look at the end of the branch where you cut it from the tree. If you see a 5-sided or star-shaped tan center, the branch meets two of a hickory's requirements. To see if the pith is solid, cut off a small living branch and slice it in half along its length.If the branch is solid with no midsection that looks like a sponge or a honeycomb, the pith is solid.

, The southern shagbark grows in limestone soils.Its leaflets are jagged-edged and come to sharp points, and grow 5 to a rachis. Shagbark twigs are thick and brown, and the bark is scaly and raised at the edges, giving it a shaggy appearance. The fruit of the shagbark, which grows to between 1.2 inches (3 cm) and 2 inches (5 cm) long, is oval and round, and is covered in a thick, dark husk. The shagbark nut meat is sweet.

, This species grows in moist forest, also called steam banks. The leaflets, which grow 9 to a rachis, are broad and smooth around the edges. The bitternut hickory fruit grows to be between 0.8 inch (2 cm) and 1.6 inches (4 cm) long, and is enclosed in a thin, dark brown husk. The kernel is bitter, as the plant's name suggests.Bitternut twigs are slender and green, and have distinctive yellow buds. The bark of a bitternut is light grayish-brown, and does not split deeply enough to flake.

, Pignut hickory trees grow on broad ridges. Their leaves consist of 5 sharply pointed, serrated edged, dark green and shiny leaflets on a short rachis. The thin pignut husk is light brown, and the round fruit, which grows to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long by 0.8 inch (2 cm) wide, is a similar light brown. Twigs are slender and a dark purple to a light green. The bark of a pignut is deeply recessed and scaly, but does not flake at the plate edges.

, The shellbark grows in wet, bottomland forests. Its leaflets are waxy and medium green, and come at least 9 to a rachis. At between 1.8 inches (4.5 cm) and 2.6 inches (6.5 cm) long and 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) wide, the fruit of the kingnut is the largest of the hickory species, and is enclosed by a thick, dark brown husk. The kingnut produces a sweet kernel. The twigs are thick, with round bulbs. The bark of the kingnut forms long, narrow vertical scales, which peel off from the top and bottom.

, The red hickory grows on slopes and forest ridges. Its leaflets are green and red, slender and tapered, and grow 5 or more to a rachis. The edges of the red hickory leaflets are smoothly serrated, as opposed to the sharp teeth of the pignut and southern shagbark. Red hickory nuts are 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1.2 inches (3 cm) long and 0.8 inch (2 cm) wide, round, light brown and thin-shelled, and have a sweet taste. The husks are thin and dark brown. Red hickory bark is rough and deeply ridged into narrow vertical strips, but the bark does not scale or flake.

, Shagbark hickory trees grow in various environments, although they thrive in drained areas. The leaflets are light green, short and rounded, with pointed tips, and grow 5 or 7 to a rachis. The nuts of a shagbark hickory are 1.2 inches (3 cm) to 2 inches (5 cm) long, light brown, thin-shelled and sweet tasting, and are enclosed in a thick, brownish-black husk. As the name suggests, the shagbark tree is characterized by thick, scaly bark, giving the trunk a shaggy appearance.

, The sand hickory has matte, light green, narrow, pointed and smooth-edged leaflets. The nuts are the smallest of the hickory species, averaging only 0.5 inch (13 mm) to 1.45 inches (37 mm) long, with thin husks and shells and light colored nut meat. They are also round and covered with fine hairs. The nut meat of a sand hickory is sweet. Sand hickory bark is relatively smooth, and forms a compacted network of shallow furrows.

, Mockernut hickory trees grow in dry land, on slopes and ridges. The leaflets are waxy, medium green, wide and rounded, and grow 7 or more to a rachis. The edges of mockernut leaflets are softly serrated, with dull-edged teeth. The fruit of the mockernut is relatively small, at only 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) to 2 inches (5 cm) long, and contained by a thick, dark brown husk. Mockernut bark is characterized by deep, vertical furrows that are close together. The bark may also begin to furl at the edges and flake away as the mockernut reaches full maturity

Look for trifoliate leaves, or formations with 3 leaflets attached at each node.,
Look for egg shaped, medium green leaves.,
Touch the leaves to see if they are fuzzy.,
Look for long vines covered in small, brownish bristles that trail across the ground, climb any vertical surface, and form dense bunches of foliage.,
Look for purple or reddish purple flowers arranged in clusters.,
Measure the seed pods with a ruler.,
Look for hairs covering the seed pods.

,
Cut open a seed pod and check that the seeds are small and kidney shaped.

,
Look for seed pods that are greenish-bronze, fading to a dull brown when dried.

",How to Identify Kudzu," All 3 leaves will be attached to the stem on their own petiole, or stalk. The central leaf's petiole will be about 3/4 inch (19 mm) long, while the 2 outer leaves have much shorter petioles.;
, Generally, the central leaflet will have 3 lobes, or rounded projections. The outer 2 leaflets often have 2 lobes. However, kudzu's lobe structure can vary, with many leaves having no lobes at all. Leaves can grow quite large, often to about 5 or 6 inches (12 - 15 cm) long.

, Kudzu leaves have very small hairs, making them fuzzy to the touch.

, The key characteristic of kudzu vines is their tremendous growth rate; they can gain a foot (30 cm) of length per day in peak conditions. Kudzu can often be seen entirely covering tall trees, utility poles, or other structures. As they mature, vines may become thick and woody. Kudzu vines are capable of climbing nearly any type of support, and will also snake across the ground, rooting at each node.

, Kudzu produces flowers in late summer, usually in August or September in the southern United States. The flowers form a cluster (called a raceme) that can grow up to 8 inches (20 cm) high and emerge from the central petiole of a leaf arrangement.

, Kudzu produces small seed pods, usually about 2 inches (5 cm) in length. T

Look for a sprawling plant.,
Identify the small white flowers.",How to Identify Chickweed1," The leaves for common chickweed begin as small ovals with a pointed tip. As the plant matures, the leaves grow larger and begin to ruffle slightly. The ruffles form around the edge of the oval and looks like a different shape.;
, One characteristic detail of the chickweed’s stem is the direction of the hair. If you examine the stalk’s hair, you’ll notice that the hairs change position at each node. The node is the knot-like location where the leaves extend out of the stalk., Another characteristic feature of the common chickweed is the inner-core, underneath the stalk. You can reveal the inner-core by pulling the stem of the plant. The inner-core happens because plant develops multiple stalks from the same root system.This is also the reason that a mature plant will sprawl.

, Chickweed grows in a sprawling fashion. It has a weak stem and each side of the stem has a single line of hairs. Younger plants won’t sprawl quite as fully as a matured plant. Instead of looking for a tall plant, seek out a flat sprawling plant.


Since there are so many stalks coming from the root system, many weaker plants will become engulfed by chickweed. This is the reason why many lawn owners dislike chickweed.

, These appear in the spring and summer time. Each flower has five petals and the deep notching on the flowers makes it appear like 10 petals.

Know chickweed’s climate.,
Look for chickweed’s common areas.,
Identify areas prone to flooding.,
Check lawns or croplands.,
Seek common chickweed in other areas.,
Harvest the chickweed.",How to Identify Chickweed2," Stellaria Media, or common chickweed, translates to little star of the mist. Common chickweed is found throughout the world, and has been reported in every American state. The plant is an annual, meaning it blooms in the spring and dies in the winter. Common chickweed has a high resilience to cold weather, and sometimes will last through a mild winter.


Since it is so common and strong of a plant, it can be found in almost every climate.

, Look for it where it grows. Common places include the roadside, gardens, vacant lots, and grasslands. It is one of the most common weeds found in lawns.

, Common chickweed prefers low-leveled areas that accumulates water easily. You're even more likely to find common chickweed in a wooded area that's prone to flooding. Check around your house or neighborhood for low leveled areas that fit this description.

, Common chickweed is an invasive species that prefers areas with a history of disturbance, similar to poison ivy.Areas with a history of disturbance include places where the natural ecology has been disturbed like: farming areas, lawns, trails, or fielded areas.

, Common chickweed prospers in nutrient-rich areas that may be disturbed or receives plenty of water. Other areas that chickweed is commonly spotted is on walls, new plantations, sewage plants, and near animal manure.It has also been reported along coastal strand-lines of beeches and lakes.

, The entire plant is edible and can be used in salads or cooked with other meals. The top of the plant is the best, as the base is woody or stringy. There are also topical benefits from the plant, such as helping a rash.Crush up the plant and rub onto areas of your skin, such as a rash or breakout. If you are experiencing an allergic reaction, chickweed won’t substitute proper medical support.

Identify star chickweed.,
Find mouse-ear chickweed.,
Identify field chickweed.",How to Identify Chickweed3," Star chickweed, or stellaria pubera, is a less known variant of chickweed that is mostly found on the east coast. The flowers are very similar to common chickweed, but star chickweed doesn’t sprawl as heavily. One distinguishing feature of the star chickweed is that its hairs extend onto the flower section.


The stalk of star chickweed is stronger than the common chickweed, but it is still possible to expose the inner-core., Mouse-ear chickweed, cerastium vulgatum, is another variety of chickweed that has distinguished dark green leaves. Mouse-ear chickweed is a perennial weed, meaning it lies dormant through the winter and blooms in the spring. This weed also has more hairs that cover the leaves instead of a single line of hairs.


The name “mouse ear,” is derived from the fuzzy leaves resembling little mouse ears.
You aren’t supposed to eat mouse-ear raw, and instead should cook it like you might cook matured spinach.

, Field chickweed, or cerastium arvense, is a native North American plant that’s more of a flower than a weed. The leaves are dark green like mouse-ear chickweed, but are shaped more narrowly than other chickweeds. Mouse-ear grows more commonly as an invasive species.The flowers of field chickweed are almost identical to the other types of chickweed.
The field chickweed doesn’t take over other plants.

Double check.",How to Identify Knotweed1," Knotweed grows in moist, partly shaded environments. They typically are found along roadsides and stream banks or other disturbed areas, but they are not limited to those habitats.;
, Leaves can be found in a mixture of heart- and spade-like shapes. They range from 4"" – 16"" in length. Leaves found on common knotweed are slender and very small reaching up to 4/5"" long.

, Stems of a knotweed plant can be reddish-brown and resemble that of a cane. Common knotweed can be mat like and grow close to the ground reaching up to 8"" tall.

, They have a rhizome root system that can grow up to 65' long laterally, or there is a taproot system penetrating more than 18"" deep.

, Sometimes elderberry can be confused for shrubby knotweed due to the stem similarities. One way to make sure that it is not an elderberry plant is to break off a piece of the stem. If the inside is hollow it is knotweed. If it has a whitish grey pith it is probably elderberry. If it is hollow, proceed to the next step to learn the distinct features of the knotweed species. Common knotweed can also be confused with spotted spurge. A way to distinguish the two is by looking for white sticky sap escaping from a broken stem. If you see this sap you've encountered a spotted spurge plant.


Elderberry also is shorter than knotweed plants.

, Stems are numerous, wiry, slender, and highly branched. They form mats of biomass up to 8"" high. They have swollen nodes and membranous sheaths.

, Taproot system that can penetrate more than 18"".

, The flowers are small and inconspicuous, ranging from white to green with the occasional pink tint. It has fruit that is three-sided, 1/8"" long, dark brown, and matte (not shiny).

, Common knotweed ranges from 4"" to 8"" in height.

, These should be spade-like, up to 4"" long and 2/3 as wide, and thick with a pointed tip. They are hairless on the underside but do have bumps on their veins; these are visible with a hand lens.

, These should be cane-like, hollow between each node, green to reddish-brown once matured and die after the growing season.

, They should have a rhizome structure, up to 65' long laterally, and are similar throughout the knotweed species.

, These should be from creamy to greenish white, small clusters of iridescent flowers that grow longer than the leaf. They branch from the leaf axil near base of the stem.

, These can grow anywhere from 4' 10"" to 8' 2"".

, Of the knotweed species, the leaves of the giant are the largest, growing up to 16"" long and 2/3 as wide. They are deep and heart shaped with an abrupt point. On the underside of the leaf are diagnostic, multicellular hairs that are long, thin, wavy, and sparse. These fall off towards the end of September, and you might need a hand lens to see them.

, They will be smooth, hollow, light green, and sparingly branched.

, These will have a rhizome structure, up to 65' long laterally, and are similar throughout the knotweed species.

, These will be small, creamy-white to greenish-white, and shorter than the leaf. Three-sided shiny black fruit can also be found.

, Giant knotweed can grow anywhere from 9' 9"" to 19' 8"".

, These can be any mixture of those of the Japanese (spade-like) and those of the giant (heart-like). Look for heart-shaped leaves towards the base of the stem and spade-shaped towards the end of the branch. These leaves have triangle shaped hairs found on the underside of the leaf, mid-vein. They have thicker bases and can be seen best with a hand lens.


If you find both heart and spade shaped leaves the plant is probably Fallopia x bohemica. All other species will have one or the other, but not both.

Look for wheat in winter and spring.,
Barley is grown in similar areas as wheat, but is more prevalent in more northern areas.,
Find corn, or maize, in regions that enjoy hot summers.,
Watch for oats in late spring or early fall.,
Rice is a crop grown in water paddies, where seeds are sown, then the field flooded for a long period of time until the seed head starts to show.,
Seek out rows of spinach during spring or fall, when cooler temperatures prevail.,
Identify crops of potatoes in late spring in cooler climates and early fall in warmer climates.,
Watch for broccoli in the spring.,
Find fields of alfalfa sprouts in early spring.,
Seek out cotton crops in hot climates.",How to Identify Farm Crops," Exceptions are in North America, where wheat can commonly be distinguished from other crops in late summer to fall. Wheat generally grows in cool weather and is harvested when the weather gets warm, though this is often not the case in the USA and Canada, where seeds are sown in cooler periods like that in spring, and harvested in the fall when the weather gets cool. In cooler climates like in North America, farmers or producers grow spring wheat, which is planted in the spring and harvested in late summer or fall. In warmer climates like that near the Mediterranean, farmers plant winter wheat in the fall and harvest it in the spring.


Wheat looks much like grass when it's young or in the vegetative stage, except the leaves tend to be a bit wider than your average lawn grass. When wheat is near harvest time, it grows a brush-like seed head and turns a golden-brown at harvest time.

Do not confuse wheat with barley. Barley has a similar seed head as wheat does, except the awns or ""beard"" of the head is much longer than wheat, and the head itself is not as coarse.

;
, Canada and Russia are known for growing barley, though barley has its origins in the same area as wheat: in the Fertile Crescent which is off the Mediterranean and Red Seas. In warmer countries, it is sown in the fall and harvested in the spring. In northern climates where no plants grow during the winter, it is sown in the spring and sown in the fall.


Barley can be identified by the long beard or awns, finer seed head and lighter gold colour at harvest time.

,


Corn grows as tall as 15 feet (3 meters) and have thick stems, long thin leaves and a head that looks like a yellow tassel. Close to harvest time, the tassel turns brown and you can see ears of corn with protruding brown or maroon silk growing among the leaves.
Corn kernels aren't visible because they are covered by the husk, which is made up of several modified leaves.
Corn is planted in rows several times during a single growing season, so you may see plants in different stages of growth.

, Oats grow very quickly and must be harvested quickly before the kernels start to fall off the plants. The seed-heads of oat plants are what are called racemes, which are seeds that hang off of thin ""stems"" that are bent over from the weight of the oat kernels.


Oats are more of a brownish than gold colour at harvest time, though some plants can be still a little green at that time as well.

, The field is drained, dried and allows the plant to reach full maturity before being harvested. The seed heads are similar to oats, with more and smaller seeds per seed head than oats. Rice grows quite quickly, and, like oats, must be harvested quickly to prevent the seeds from falling off upon being harvested.

, Spinach are short, bushy plants with dark green leaves. Some varieties may have ruffled leaves.


Spinach plants eventually bolt, which means they grow tall stems with heads that spread seeds. Plants that have bolted have bitter leaves and are no longer considered useful.

, Potato plants grow 2 to 3 feet (60 to 100 cm) high. Although they are planted in rows, their growth often obscures the space in between.


Potatoes have small white flowers if the weather has been cool and damp. If you see what seems to be dead plants, the potatoes, which grow underground, are ready to harvest.

, Broccoli plants are short with large, ruffled leaves. Broccoli plants first grow a central head containing a cluster of small, unopened flower buds. Farmers typically cut the central head off, which encourages side heads to grow.

, Young alfalfa plants are very small with clusters of oval/heart-shaped leaves, often in clusters of three at a time. The plant itself is made up of more than one stem, not on one stem like most plants listed here, and can put down a deep taproot, especially since it is not tilled and resown like all other crops mentioned in this article, except when harvesting sprouts for salads. When alfalfa is nearing maturity, it can achieve a height of 3 to 4 feet and puts out yellow or purplish flowers, depending on the cultivar. These flowers are very similar, but much smaller, to flowers of a pea or bean plant, and grow in a cluster of 6 or more. Alfalfa is commonly harvested as a forage crop for livestock, particularly as hay.


Alfalfa is actually related to peas and beans, because all three are considered as legume crops.

, Cotton is a twiggy shrub about 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. It blooms with a white flower that turns pink and then falls off in about 3 days. The cotton grows within the seed pod (boll) until it bursts open.

"
Look thicker, sturdier stalks with fewer leaves on male plants.,
Check your plants regularly from July to September to sex them.,
Check the joints on the stalk for male flowers.,
Know that hermaphroditic (both sexes) plants exist, and should be treated as males.,
Throw out or remove male plants unless you specifically want seeds.",How to Identify Female and Male Marijuana Plants1," A male plant, compared to a female plant of the same strain, generally has a thicker stalk. That is because it gets taller than female plants and needs to be able to support the weight. They also have fewer leaves than female plants., If male plants are allowed to pollinate, they will severely lower the potential crop of your female plants. That's because, once fertilized, female plants spend energy producing seeds instead of THC, leading to a smaller harvest. If you are growing indoors you will likely be visiting your plants regularly, so the following checks should be easy to do.


You need to check every plant to determine if it is male or female, as one rogue male can wreck your harvest.
In general, male plants show their sex 7-10 days (indoor) or 3 weeks (outdoor) before female plants., The little balls that grow on the joints of the stalk (where the other branches meet the main stalk) are the main indicators of male plants. These flowers release pollen and need to be removed for a better crop.If you're trying to create new plants or reproduce, you need to leave these balls undisturbed.
Female plants will have these bulbs too, but will also have long, translucent hairs on them. If you only see 1-2 on a plant, wait and see if more develop before cutting them.

, Marijuana plants can grow both sex organs. If you see any of the tell-tale male buds, you should trim them like you would a normal male plant. They will still release pollen that can ruin your crop.""Hermies"" are generally undesirable plants, and they can ruin a small crop with their pollen if you're not careful.

, Once you've determined a plan is male, you need to get rid of it or it will ruin your crop. Do not try and remove the buds by hand, as missing even a few will significantly decrease your crop. While most growers simply throw the plants out, a few keep them around for breeding purposes. If you do, put them in a separate room from the females, and make sure you don't track pollen in from the male room to the female room on your clothes or hands."
"
Let the plants grow for roughly six months before sexing them.,
Note fuller bodies of leaves, when compared to males, on a grown female plant.,
Check the joints for of the stalk for small, translucent hairs.,
Separate your females from any males, as only females create buds.",How to Identify Female and Male Marijuana Plants2," Marijuana plants, male and female, will be identical in the first 6 weeks of life. It is only after they've begun developing their sex organs later on that you'll be able to differentiate them.


You can purchase ""feminized"" seeds as well, which usually create close to 100% female plants. However, there are occasional errors, and you should still keep a close eye on your plants to make sure there are no rogue males., If you're trying to sex mature plants, one of the easiest indicators is how bushy they get. Male plants have thicker, sturdier stalks and very few leaves. A female of the same strain will be shorter and bushier, with more leaves, especially near the top.

, Once the plant has matured enough, a female will begin flowering. At the joints where the branches meet the main stalk, you'll see small, translucent hairs, known as pistols, coming out of a small, tear-shaped bud tucked in the joint. Frequently, there will also be ""growth tips,"" which are new branches and groups of leaves, growing as well.


Male plants will have the small buds (pollen sacs) but will not have the associated hair growing out of it.Plants can grow both pollen sacs and pistols. If it does, it is hermaphroditic and should be treated like a male.

, Only female plants will produce enough THC to be used as medicine, but they won't create much if they become fertilized. The pistol is meant to attract pollen. If it gets it, it will create a seed, and all the plants energy and nutrients will be spent making seeds, not making big, THC-full buds. Your female plants are the only ones that will produce a crop, but only if they stay away from the males."
"
Study the flowers.,
Examine the petals.,
Count the styles.,
Examine the fruit.",How to Identify Cherry Trees1," Cherry tree flowers are either white or pink in color, and they do not have a scent.They grow in clusters, with each flower stalk emerging from one central point. Cherry tree flowers also have long stamens that poke up from the flowers.


This distinct clustering flower growth pattern is a key way to distinguish cherry trees from trees with similar traits. For example, peach trees grow single flowers, and almond tree flowers grow in pairs.
Cherries are likely to flower early in the spring. They produce clusters of pale green berries later on in the spring.;
, On cherry trees, each single flower has 5 petals. Semi double flowers have 6 to 10 petals, and double blossoms have 10 petals or more.Cherry tree petals each have a small cleft, while plum petals are rounded., Cherry tree styles are the long tubes that connect to the flower’s ovary, distinct from the stems. The ovary is the part of the tree that becomes the fruit. Each cherry tree blossom has only one style.Some trees, like crab trees that flower, look a lot like cherry trees. However, in flowering crab trees, each flower has four to five styles. Apple and pear trees have two to five. Mespil trees have five.
If you look more closely at the tree and notice that the flowers are attached to only one style, that’s a good sign it’s a cherry tree.

, Ornamental cherry tree varieties do not produce fruit. Fruiting cherry trees have hanging fruit that grows in pairs or clusters. The fruit hangs where the flowers did before. The fruit will be small, pale and green in late spring. In late summer, the cherries get larger and redder. Some cherry trees produce fruit that is yellow or black instead of red.If you take a close look at the fruit, you should be able to distinguish cherry trees from other fruiting trees, such as cherry plum trees or apple trees. Cherry fruit is rounder in shape than either of these.
A good rule of thumb is that if the fruit is smaller than ¾ of an inch, it is probably a cherry. Cherry plums and regular plums are usually bigger, about 1 inch or larger.

Study the leaves.,
Study the bark.,
Notice the shape of the tree.,
Look for grafts.",How to Identify Cherry Trees2," The cherry tree’s leaves are toothed. They are oval shaped, and they have a point at the tip.There are serrated margins on the leaves. The leaves are 2 to 5 inches long. Most cherry trees have large, shiny green leaves arranged alternately on branches. The bottom leaves are usually medium green. Up higher, the leaves turn paler yellow.
In the fall, cherry tree leaves turn yellow with a hint of red. Cherry trees are deciduous, so they lose their leaves in the fall.

, The cherry tree's bark is commonly brown, gray, or a shade in between. The bark of a cherry tree has what are called horizontal lenticels. These are marks in the bark that look like small cuts that are darker or lighter than the rest of the bark.In some cherry trees, the bark peels back in places. Underneath it, you can spot a darker mahogany color.
Cherry tree bark is not shaggy, but very hard, making it useful as building material. The bark is softer toward the top of the tree.

, Mature cherry trees take on an umbrella shape. The branches are ""spreading,"" meaning the top of the tree looks wider than the bottom. In contrast, plum trees look round or oval, and pear trees look oval or teardrop-shaped., Fruit trees are often grafted so they will produce fruit. On cherry trees, you'll find the graft placed on the trunk, near where the first branches emerge. Other fruit trees usually have grafts on the branches, making them look knotty."

Identify Japanese cherry trees.,
Identify black cherry or choke cherry trees.,
Identify agricultural cherry trees.,
Distinguish between plum and cherry trees.",How to Identify Cherry Trees3," Japan alone has over 100 varieties of cherry trees.They are also commonly seen at cherry blossom festivals around the United States, and they are designed to have very showy flowers.


Japanese cherry blossoms are as large as carnations. Kwanzan cherry trees produce white or pink double blooms, and Yoshino cherry trees produce white single blooms.
Japanese cherry trees do not produce fruit. They are grown for their beauty, not their bounty.

, These trees are native to North America. They can grow very large and they are usually quite straight. Their flowers are smaller and white.The flowers will appear in long narrow clusters after the leaves come out in the spring.
If you see orange colored fuzz along the midrib of various leaves, it’s probably a black cherry tree. Otherwise, it’s likely a chokecherry., These trees are used to produce the cherries sold commercially. Sometimes these trees are called sweet cherry or sour cherry trees. They have small, white flowers with 5 petals that bloom before the leaves grow completely in the early spring.Sweet cherry trees have more leaves than sour cherry trees. Sweet cherry trees have leaves with more than 8 pairs of veins for each leaf. Sour cherry tree leaves have fewer than 8 pairs of veins per leaf.

, People often mistake plum trees for cherry trees, especially when they start blossoming. Here are the main distinctions:


Cherry trees' smell is faint, if not non existent. Plum trees are fragrant.
Cherry blossoms have clefts at the tips of the petals, while plum blossoms are oval.Cherry tree bark has horizontal lines. Plum blossom bark is darker than cherry tree bark and does not have horizontal lines.
Cherry buds are oval. Plum buds are round.
Cherry tree leaves are green or copper. Plum leaves are purple.

Look for peeling bark.,
Search for “camouflage” colors in the bark.,
Look for a massive, dome-shaped canopy.,
Inspect the width of the trunk.,
Find zig-zagging twigs.",How to Identify a Sycamore Tree1," The bark of a sycamore tree is brittle and can’t withstand the rapid growth that sycamores experience. So the bark peels off frequently, and this results in a patchy, flaky appearance., Because the older bark peels off and reveals younger bark beneath, the bark of sycamores will be a variety of colors – brown, green, tan, and white. This gives the tree a distinctive pattern that resembles army camouflage., The crown, or canopy, of a sycamore tree can grow to over 60 feet (18 meters) wide and 80 feet (24 meters) tall. The branches and leaves fill out this space so that it creates a wide dome., While not the tallest tree, the sycamore grows to a larger diameter than any other tree in the eastern United States, so look for a trunk diameter of 3-8 feet (1-2.5 meters)., The twigs that grow off the branches will go in one direction, and then switch directions just after a bud pops out. This creates a zig-zig shape that looks a little like a lightening bolt."
"
Count five distinct lobes.,
Search for a single leaf attached at one location.,
Feel for a somewhat ragged edge.,
Look for a dark green or yellow color.",How to Identify a Sycamore Tree2," A lobe is a separate section of the leaf that radiates off the central point, kind of like the fingers on your hand. Most sycamore leaves will have five large lobes, each with its own distinct vein running along it.Some sycamore leaves may only have three lobes, but five is more common.
From the tip of one lobe to the to the tip of the one across from it, sycamore leaves are often well over 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide., Sycamores have alternate leaves, which means a single leaf attaches to the stem in one spot, and the leaves alternate from side to side as you move along the stem.This is opposed to two leaves attaching at the same location on a stem, which is referred to as having opposite leaves.

, The leaves will have many rounded “teeth” along the edges and will look slightly serrated., In spring and summer, the leaves will be dark green. Then in the autumn they turn yellow before falling off for the winter."
"
Inspect the tree for small, woody balls.,
Search for “helicopter” seeds.,
Look for small, yellow-green flowers.",How to Identify a Sycamore Tree3," In autumn, the sycamore produces a small, woody ball on a long stem, which is its fruit. The American sycamore produces these as single, pendulum-like growths, while non-native hybrid relatives may have two or three of these hanging from one stalk., Sycamore seeds are arranged in V-shaped pairs that are often nicknamed helicopters because of the way they swirl and spin when they fall from the tree. This allows the tree a larger area of seed dispersal since they can flutter farther away. Look for them in clusters at the end of twigs, or on the ground beneath the tree., Sycamores have both male and female flowers on the same tree, though they grow on different stalks. They have a white stamen and very small, thin petals, which are a light green or yellow."
"
Look for the vine with clusters of three leaves.,
Learn the phrases: ""Leaves of three?,
Check for fruit.,
Be aware that even when poison oak or ivy changes color, it is still harmful.,
Inspect vines before touching, brushing against them or walking through them.,
Remain vigilant even during the winter months.,
Avoid confusing poison oak with other plants.,
Even if other animals eat an unidentified plant, that does not mean it is safe.",How to Identify Poison Ivy," Poison ivy always has clusters of three leaves. Use this as the defining characteristic, as this plant is not so obvious in most other ways. Poison ivy is remarkable with its ability to grow in a variety of ways. Although it is called ""poison ivy"" it can not only grow upwards clinging to surfaces like an ivy, but can also, grow as a bush or single plants.


If growing in rocky places, it tends to take over from all other vegetation. If growing near something like a tree or a fence, it will twine itself around the object as it grows, creating a dense mass of vegetation which cannot be crossed.;
, Let them be!"" or ""One, two, three? Don't touch me."", as these plants have a cluster of three leaves at the end of a long stem. More identifying indicators of leaves include:


Look for three leaflets connected closely together on each stem. The tip of each leaf should be pointy.
The leaflets are broad, and the two lateral (side) leaflets are smaller than the terminal (end or middle) leaf.
The center leaf usually (almost always) has a small stem, wheres the two side leaves grow directly from the vine and do not have small stems.

The leaves tend to be a bright to dark, waxy green when viewed from above. When viewed from underneath, they appear lighter and fuzzier. In spring, the leaves are usually a bright green, while in fall, they turn red (poison ivy) or bright red or orange (poison oak).
However, while these leaves usually appear shiny, they won't always. In particular, do not rely on shininess as an indicator after it has rained recently.
""Hairy vine, no friend of mine."", and also:""Longer middle stem; stay away from them."" -- the middle leaflet has a long stem while the two side leaflets attach almost directly.
""Ragged rope, don't be a dope!"" Poison ivy vines on trees have a furry, ""raggy"" or ragged appearance.
""Berries white, run in fright"" and ""Berries white, danger in sight.""
""Red leaflets in the spring, it's a dangerous thing."" -- new leaflets sometimes are red in the spring. Later, in the summer, the leaflets are green -- while in autumn they can be reddish-orange.
""Side leaflets like mittens, will itch like the dickens."" This refers to the shape of some poison ivy leaves, where each of the two side leaflets has a notch that makes the leaflet look like a mitten with a ""thumb."" (Caution: all parts of the plant can cause itching, not just these leaves.)




, If either plant has berries, these will appear as follows:


Translucent for both plants
Poison oak fruit tends to be hairy
Poison ivy berries are white or cream-colored
The fruit tends to stay on the plants all through winter and spring.

, Despite the color change, the urushiol oil still stays on the leaves.

, When growing as a vine, poison ivy can snake its way along trees. When it grows like this, it is tons of little poison ivy plants growing out of a vine. Always inspect a vine if you need to go near it, and see if it has plants growing out of it.

, Poison oak drops its leaves in winter, leaving a bare stem of a vine hanging down. But for sensitive individuals, this can still cause a rash.

, Some other plants have two or three similar-looking leaves. Such other plants may have spines on the leaf tips (holly or Mahonia) or thorns on the stems (blackberry). However, it is better to avoid plants that resemble poison ivy.


If you see a plant that has all the characteristics, but have regular, uniformly shaped leaves, or sharp tips on the edges, it's not likely to be poison ivy. Poison ivy has tips that are more randomly spaced and somewhat curved between the tips along the edges.

, Toxic plants are not poisonous to all creatures. Deer and other grazing animals may happily eat poison ivy.

Know where the best food is, depending on where you live.,
Pick up a local plant guidebook.,
Start with the number-one habitat for wild edible plants — your lawn.,
Visit other areas that are regularly cleared.,
Berries:Look for berries on ornamental shrubs, such as this silverberry.,
Look for berries on trees.,
Check out ornamental trees.,
Look for nuts beneath trees.,
Find fruiting trees.,
Look for plants that grow in wet areas.,
Nibble on safe flowers.,
Check out thorny brambles for food.,
Learn your vines so that you can distinguish grape.,
Find deciduous leaves.,
Pick the new growth off conifers in the spring.",How to Find Wild Edible Plants," Keep in mind that if you live in a humid region, the majority of wild food will be in the sun - whether clearing or 'edge'. In a dry region, such as the Southwest, most of the wild food will be near water.;
, Get guides to the most common edible plants in your area, typically referred to as ""weeds."" Learn the top 20 or 25 and try to memorize them — they might come in handy later., Any place that is regularly cleared is loaded with weeds such as dandelion, chickweed, plantain, wild onion, violets, wood sorrel, henbit, clover, dead-nettle and sow thistle — all of which are 100% edible.

Start with grass. All grass is edible. (although it is not advisable for those with a weak stomach) Anything under 6"" is easy to chew and digest. The flavor ranges from intensely sweet to mild to bitter - anyone who's tasted a shot of wheatgrass knows just how sweet grass can be. Grass that's over 6"" can either be chewed for juice and spit out, or run through a manual wheatgrass juicer for a healthy shot.







, Try roadsides (note warning below), fields, parks, and so on. They will also have tons of edible plants. Chickweed can be picked by the bucketful. Here's what to look for:
Dandelion (taraxacum officinale): The young unfolding greens in the center are great raw. The entire plant can be steamed. The flower is the best part. Pick it off the stem, and with your fingers pinch off the green base of the flower, so there's no white sap (the sap is very bitter). You're left with a sweet, meaty, filling wild food that can be found in incredible abundance. Also, you can throw a few of them into a pot to boil some dandelion tea.






Chickweed (stellaria media): The entire plant can be eaten raw. It has a sweet, grassy flavor. If you want to avoid the stems, and eat mostly the new growth, pluck off the tops and eat those.






Wood Sorrel (oxalis spp): The whole plant is great raw - it has a nice acid flavor, refreshing. The flowers of the cosmopolitan weeds are yellow, but many varieties grow in the wild with pinkish flowers. If you eat it, try the stem, but not the red part as it and the leaves are bitter. This is a plant extremely common not only in lawns and cleared areas, but also deep in the wilderness. It should not be consumed in great quantity as it contains relatively high levels of oxalic acid, which, while is vital for humans, may cause the gastrointestinal upset or illness when consumed in large amounts.






Henbit (lamium amplexicaule): Another plant entirely edible raw. It's a Lamium, a very mild mint. Like chickweed, it has a sweet, grassy flavor - pluck off the tops to avoid the stems. This plant will form huge carpets in places, very early in the year, with an understory of chickweed beneath it.






Dead-nettle (lamium purpureum): Another Lamium, just like henbit. It's eaten the same way - and will also form huge carpets covering the ground, especially in spring.






Plantain (plantago lanceolata): Young leaves in the center are good raw - have a slight salty flavor. There's both a common and an English plantain, that are very similar.






Sow thistle (sonchus spp): The young leaves are decent - treat it like dandelion, and try to avoid the bitter latex sap. Sow thistle has excellent yellow flowers very similar to dandelion, yet even better, that's prepared the same way and eaten raw. Unlike dandelion, sow thistle has an upright stalk and a more prickly-looking thistle-like appearance.






Wild onion (allium spp): Very common in areas that are mowed. A very mild onion that is excellent raw. Harvest bunches of it and use it just like scallions.






Cress (cardamine spp): This is one of the many wild plants in the mustard family common in cities. When young, the leaves are excellent raw, with a mild mustard flavor. As they get older the full plants can be steamed, just as you would prepare mustard greens at home.







, Ebbing's silverberry is frequently planted in cities as bushes and hedges - but it will escape into any disturbed habitat and form thickets. The stems, foliage, and berries are all speckled with silver. The red berries are excellent when fully ripe.

, Even in the dead of winter, such as on this laurelcherry. Like most wild cherries, these have a long ripening process and aren't fully ripe until the fruit starts to soften and shrivel.

, These are planted for their showy flowers — those flowers can lead to fruit, such as cherries or crab apples or plums. They may be small, but can be very tasty.

, Walnuts and hickory nuts can be smashed open with a rock and the edible flesh picked out. Fresh nuts are wet and filling and easy to digest, with a lot of flavor. Acorns are abundant beneath oaks — if the oak has round-lobed leaves, the acorns will need minimal to no processing. Some white oak acorns will have no tannin at all. And keep in mind you get used to it and stop noticing it after the first few — it's how pigeons eat so many acorns., Check roadsides (note warning below), forest edges, and beside water for fruiting trees. Fruit needs sun to ripen - there's not much fruit in deep woods. The 'edges' of any environment are the most productive - trees are fertilized and keep a moisture and humidity from the forest behind them, but have access to full sun at the edge of a clearing or waterway. This is where you will find fruit like persimmons, wild apples, mulberries, autumn olives, hackberries, and so on. Below are persimmons.

, Search bodies of water for signs of cattail, bulrush, and watercress. Cattail typically needs an area of stagnant water to thrive, though it will grow in streamsides. Cattail can be in preposterous abundance in lakes and bays. The shoots are wonderful raw, and the pollen in early summer tastes like cake flour. You can gather whole bags of it. Pollen is so nutritious it's considered a ""superfood.""

, Sample the flower petals of plants you know to be nonpoisonous. Flowers are often very mild to sweet and full of antioxidants. Some excellent blooms are daylilies, violets and honeysuckle. DO NOT EAT AZALEAS! Azaleas are deathly poisonous.

The base of flowers can be strong to bitter — it's better to break off petals and not eat the green material.

, Rose, blackberry, raspberry, and greenbriar are good examples. Rose has edible hips (the common weedy thicket-forming multiflora rose is the best - the hip is small and tangy), blackberry/raspberry has berries, and greenbriar shoots and tendrils, as well as berries that are rather tasteless but still edible. Below is a multiflora rose.
, Wild grapes are found throughout the U.S. and are one of the best wild foods. There's a variety which you will see everywhere throughout the South called ""muscadine"" — the grapes are thick-skinned and very large, with a flavor like bubble gum. Wild grapes have both edible leaves and tendrils as well as fruit — the leaves can be steeped in apple cider vinegar and used to make dolmas. Muscadine leaves are tougher and benefit from a week-long glass jar ferment. Grape vines also make very sturdy baskets., Try the deciduous leaves of trees like linden, sassafras, Boxelder, sourwood - all are excellent raw. Beech leaves are also highly edible when young, for the first 2 to 4 weeks. You can pull whole salads off the trees. Linden leaves are so large they can be used as tortillas., The young green shoots at the tips of the branches are great raw - a pleasant acid taste. The male pollen cones on conifers are also edible - some are very sweet. And again, it's pollen - extremely nutritious. Many species of pine have edible nuts in the cones in late summer to fall.

Get field guides to your local trees.,
Avoid ornamentals, if you're a novice.,
Go for a walk, and take some guides with you.,
Focus on trees that stand out, rather than going methodically from tree to tree.,
Look for leftover growth up in the branches.,
Look for short spiny spur branches, the sure mark of a plum, pear or apple - a fruiting tree in the rose family:

,
Learn your families, rather than isolating trees by species.,
Look for very peculiar bark, such as the warty trunk of this hackberry, common along river bottoms (though different varieties can also be found on mountaintops).,
Look for anything flowering, even in the dead of winter (especially in the American South), such as this silverberry, with its silver-speckled foliage, flowers, and immature fruit:


Red maple (acer rubrum) is usually the first tree to flower in the spring - in the American South that's in February.,
Look for leftover fruit, as it can sometimes remain far into the winter, like on this ornamental crabapple:


Or the cherries on this laurelcherry, a southern native, still not yet ripe:

,
Search for trees with giant buds, such as the upright rack of huge velvety buds on this Princess-tree, a common weed tree .,
Look for trees still holding on to their dead leaves throughout the winter, a common habit of beech:

,
Don't forget the conifers, almost always evergreen, with easily identifiable needles .,
Use the internet, where possible, to finish the identification process.,
Take photos, and save them in a file with both the label of the tree and time of year the picture was taken.,
Collect samples, and put them in a scrapbook.",How to Identify Trees in Winter," It's good to have both a general regional guide, as well as a more specific guide for your area. You can never have enough field guides - the more images you have the easier it will be to identify a particular tree. Field guides can be obtained for free at your local library. Used bookstores can be another good source, where guides can be bought at about half the price. Another great resource is a plant identification terminology book. This will help you understand the language in the guide. If you're just starting out, focus on using mostly photos of leaves and bark and flowers and fruit to identify trees. Then move on to using keys and drawings, which are more technical and precise. Various guides can also provide fascinating anecdotal information about different trees.;
, Anything planted in a garden, lawn, roadside, park, is often an ornamental. Ornamentals are garden varieties of native species that are dissimilar enough to throw you off, and make pinpointing an exact species very difficult. If you want to learn your area ornamentals, there are many guides for the horticulturist about planting and growing trees that will have enough images that you might just find your tree. There are not that many different native trees in a specific area, and they are easy to learn. But if you include the city ornamentals, you're talking up to a thousand trees planted from all over the world.

, If you have the time to sit at the base of a tree you want to learn, and pore over field guides - great. Identification takes a lot of patience and concentration. It may take at least 30 minutes of studying various guides before you've found it. If you cannot sit with the tree, take some photos and samples home with you.

, Pick a tree that has at least one, if not two easily identifiable characteristics - such as a leaf or flower or fruit. Bark is not so easy to go by, nor buds, or scars, or growth habit. Leaves are the easiest to use. Start with an evergreen. There are very few native evergreen broad-leaved trees in the U.S. This magnolia with its large glossy evergreen leaves in the South is a dead giveaway:

, The tulip tree with its huge vertical trunk and papery upright flowers, that remain all through the winter, is very common and easy to identify (the 'flowers' are the remains of the fruit axis, not actually blooms). It gives the tree a candelabra effect.

,, A peach, a cherry, a plum, a hawthorn, a juneberry, a pear, are all in the same family, with edible fruit - the rose. Trees with pods are in the legume, (or bean) family, such as silk tree, mesquite and locust. There are not that many different tree families in any temperate region of the world - if you can group your trees in their respective families you'll be better able to understand them, and know their characteristics. Beech and oak and chestnut are all in the same family (the beech), and produce edible nuts. Cottonwood is really a gigantic member of the willow family, growing beside water and having deeply fissured bark, just like other willows.


And the tulip tree is in the magnolia family - it has large showy flowers, just like magnolia, and look at a comparison of the fruit:

, Hackberries are in the elm family, and both the seed and flesh of the prolific berries is edible - they're much like candy, and can persist on the tree deep into winter in some varieties and locales:


Or the flaky peeling bark of this river birch:

, The scarlet flowers stand out beautifully against the smooth gray bark. Red maple's twigs are also red. Its red keys typically don't last that far into winter:

,, . . there are also old woody capsules from the previous year's fruit:

,, . . and often holding on to their cones, such as the tiny 1/2"" cones on this hemlock:

, There's an incredible amount of information about various tree species online, as well as lots of images - you should arrive at a dead certainty about the identification of your tree at this point. You will also find a wealth of anecdotal information, as well as what possible uses the tree has and any toxic or edible parts. Always cross-reference and verify from multiple sources the edibility of a certain tree - don't go by one opinion alone. That having been said, there are very few trees in the U.S. that are actually poisonous, such as buckeye and yew.

, Ultimately you'll create your own database of area trees, and become an expert. It will become an excellent reference source for you year after year, and you will come to know your trees from all angles, in all habitats, in all seasons.

, This is a great project for kids, and it spurs their interest in trees."

Understand molar mass.,
Find the relative atomic mass of the element.,
Multiply the relative atomic mass by the molar mass constant.",How to Calculate Molar Mass1," Molar mass is the mass (in grams) of one mole of a substance.Using the atomic mass of an element and multiplying it by the conversion factor grams per mole (g/mol), you can calculate the molar mass of that element.;
, An element's relative atomic mass is the average mass, in atomic units, of a sample of all its isotopes.This information can be found on the periodic table of elements. Locate the element and find the number underneath the symbol for the element. It will not be a whole number, but will have decimals.


For example, for hydrogen, the relative atomic mass is 1.007; for carbon, it is 12.0107; for oxygen, it is 15.9994; and for chlorine, it is 35.453.

, This is defined as 0.001 kilogram per mole, or 1 gram per mole. This converts atomic units to grams per mole, making the molar mass of hydrogen 1.007 grams per mole, of carbon 12.0107 grams per mole, of oxygen 15.9994 grams per mole, and of chlorine 35.453 grams per mole.


Some elements are only found in molecules of 2 atoms or more. This means that if you want to find the molar mass of elements that are composed of 2 atoms, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, then you'll have to find their relative atomic masses, multiply them by the molar mass constant, and then multiply the result by 2.
For H2: 1.007 x 2 = 2.014 grams per mole; for O2: 15.9994 x 2 = 31.9988 grams per mole; and for Cl2: 35.453 x 2 = 70.096 grams per mole.

Find the chemical formula for the compound.,
Find the relative atomic mass of each element in the compound.,
Calculate the molar mass of each element in the compound.,
Add the molar masses of each element in the compound.",How to Calculate Molar Mass2," This is the number of atoms in each element that makes up the compound. (This information is given in any chemistry reference book.) For example, the formula for hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) is HCl; for glucose, it is C6H12O6. Using this formula, you can identify the number of atoms of each element that makes up the compound.


For HCl, there is one atom of hydrogen and one atom of chlorine.
For C6H12O6, there are 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.

, Using the periodic table, locate the relative atomic mass for each element. It is the number located beneath the symbol for the element. As we did in the first method of calculating the molar mass of an element, we will also multiply these masses by 1 gram/mole.


The relative atomic masses of the elements in hydrochloric acid are: hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol and chlorine, 35.453 g/mol.
The relative atomic masses of the elements in glucose are: carbon, 12.0107 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 g/mol.

, Multiply the element's atomic mass by the number of atoms of that element in the compound. This will give you the relative amount that each element contributes to the compound.For hydrogen chloride, HCl, the molar mass of each element is 1.007 grams per mole for hydrogen and 35.453 grams per mole for chlorine.
For glucose, C6H12O6, the molar mass of each element is: carbon, 12.0107 x 6 = 72.0642 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 x 12 = 12.084 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 x 6 = 95.9964 g/mol.

, This determines the molar mass for the entire compound. Take the products you obtained in the previous step and add them all together to calculate the molar mass of the compound.


For hydrogen chloride, the molar mass is 1.007 + 35.453 = 36.460 g/mol. 36.46 grams is the mass of one mole of hydrogen chloride.
For glucose, the molar mass is 72.0642 + 12.084 + 95.9964 = 180.1446 g/mol. 180.14 grams is the mass of one mole of glucose.

Examine the leaves of the tree.,
Look at the bark.,
Check for overall height and width.,
Look at the trunk.,
Consider the tree’s location.",How to Identify an Elm Tree1," Elm leaves alternate along two sides of the stem. The leaf is oval in shape and comes to a point at the end. The edges of the leaf are jagged and the veins are prominent. The base of the leaf is slightly asymmetrical.Many varieties of elm leaves are smooth on top and fuzzy on the bottom.The leaves of an American elm are typically 10-15 centimeters (4-6 inches) long.Leaves of the English Elm are usually ten centimeters (four inches) long and seven centimeters (two and a half inches) wide. They sport 10 to 12 veins.European White Elms have up to 17 veins on the front of the leaf and 14 on the bottom.;
, The bark of an elm is rough and coarse, with intersecting ridges. The color is a light grey to dark greyish-brown. The bark will be deeply furrowed.The Siberian elm is an exception, and often has exfoliated bark that is green or orange in color.
The bark on the European White Elm, unlike most other species, remains smooth even into maturity.Cedar elms have lighter purplish-grey bark than most other varieties.

, Mature elms reach a height of about 35 meters (115 feet) with a trunk diameter of around 175 centimeters (68 inches).Depending on the species or cultivar, they can reach 9 to 18 meters (30-59 feet) in width. Many American species of elm will actually become larger, with some growing to 39 meters (128 feet) in height and 37 meters (121 feet) in width.


Elms will usually have a vase or fountain shape., Elm trees often have split or branching trunks.There might be two or more trunks branching up and away from the main trunk.If you see a tree with a single, central vertical trunk, it is not an elm., Use the location of the tree to determine if it could be an elm. Different varieties of elms grow in different places. For instance, American elms are common in the eastern half of the United States, from the Rocky Mountains eastward.They are less common west of the Rockies, though the can be found in California.


Siberian elms (also known as the Asiatic, Lacebark, or Chinese elm) are common in Central Asia, Mongolia China, Siberia, India, and Korea.
European elms are common across Europe. Before Dutch elm disease arrived, English elms were also common across Europe, but they are now confined primarily to Portugal, France, Spain, and England.
If you know there are many elm trees in a certain area and the tree matches approximate descriptions of elm trees, you probably have an elm tree. Look for areas likely to contain thriving elm trees.
Elms adapt to a variety of climates and planting situations, including poor or mildly salty soil, extreme cold, atmospheric pollution, and drought.However, they prefer areas that are in full sun to part shade with well-drained, but moist, soil.

"
"
Identify what creatures the tree attracts.,
Look for visible roots.,
Look for sick trees.",How to Identify an Elm Tree2," Many animals, bugs, and birds share the ecosystem with elms. For instance, the American elm attracts birds and mammals (mice, squirrels, and opossums) that feed on its buds.Deer and rabbits will chew the bark and small branches of younger trees.If you see a host of animals and bugs hanging around a tree, it could be an elm.


Caterpillars might be found munching on the leaves.
Woodpeckers, raccoons, squirrels, and chickadees are commonly found living in elms.
Slippery elms also attract birds, who like to snack on the tree’s fruit and buds., The base of an elm is reinforced with a visible, shallow root system with a broad reach.The bark of the roots will have the same general texture and color as the bark on the rest of the tree. While it might not be present in young elms, look for roots that are visible along the ground.

, Elm trees are commonly afflicted with Dutch elm disease. As its name implies, the disease only affects elm trees, so if you see a tree with the symptoms of Dutch elm disease, you can safely conclude it is an elm. Look for:Dead leaves that have not fallen off the tree
Yellowing or other discoloration in fall or spring
Wilting leaves and young shoots present at the same time

"
"
Look for flowers.,
Look at the seeds of the elm.,
Examine elms in the fall.,
Examine the tree in the winter.",How to Identify an Elm Tree3," Depending on your species of elm, you may or may not have flowers in the spring. European White Elms, for instance, sprout small purple flowers in early spring.Wych Elms have similar reddish purple flowers that sprout at the same time.The Caucasian Elm, by contrast, has small green flowers that also emerge in spring.English Elms sprout red flowers in small clusters early in spring.Flowers may be hidden behind the leaves of the elm if the tree has already produced leaves, so look closely before deciding whether a tree is an elm or not.

, Elm seeds form and fall from the trees in springtime soon after flowering. They are distinctive in appearance. Elm seeds are round, flat and covered by a thin, paper-like casing that hooks at the top.


Most elms bear single seeds about the size of a pea.
The seeds are encased in a green, thin, ovular case the resembles an insect wing called a samara.When mature, the seeds will change from green to a hay-like yellow-brown tone.

, Check trees in autumn when the leaves are changing colours. Many species of elm trees have leaves that will turn a bright yellow in fall, and sometimes a yellowish-purple colour. For instance, leaves on the Wych Elm and English Elm are renowned for turning bright yellow in autumn.The leaves often may be hiding blooms that are still present from late summer, so look carefully before judging whether a tree is an elm or not.

, Elms are deciduous, meaning they shed their leaves once each year, starting in the fall.By the winter, they will be bare of leaves, and then in the spring they will start to re-grow their leaves. If you notice this foliage pattern, you might have an elm.

As they mature they form a ""stem""--which is not a true stem like with woody- and broad-leaf species of angiosperms and gymnosperms--or a culm that ends with an inflorescence or seed-head with multiple small, green, inconspicuous flowers. Grasses and grass-like plants belong in a large group called Monocotyledons. Besides those in the Gramineae family, there are many other plants that resemble a grass, because of the leaf structure. The differences begin with flowering characteristics. Orchids, irises, lilies, cattails, bur-reeds, and arrow-grasses are such monocots, the first three have showy, non-petal-like flower parts, and the latter are tightly condensed flowers without the typical lemmas, glumes, and florets that form a spikelet, or even the perigynium, typical of sedges and most rushes.;
, Using the basic identifying characteristics described in the above step, find a plant in your garden or flower bed that obviously shouldn't be growing in there and looks suspiciously like a grass.

, Grasses have several parts: Leaves or blades, stems, collars, and inflorescences. Below ground, they often have fibrous, spreading roots. Many weed grasses are able to spread with production of tillers from the ""mother plant"" which sends out multiple spreading rhizomes. Quackgrass is especially notorious for this. There are also bunchgrass grasses, but these are not the kinds of grasses likely to become weeds due to their inability to spread out quickly like with rhizomatous, sod-forming grasses such as Quackgrass and Kentucky Bluegrass.



Leaves and stems (culms): Grasses in their vegetative stage will be mainly leaves, with no visible stem. The true stem of grasses is only 1 to 2 millimeters long, and at the very base of the plant. This is also where the main growth point or apical meristem is located, and where the plant's leaves and inflorescence originate from. Most species' leaves emerge rolled, and they all emerge from the base of the plant, one leaf blade at a time.

Leaves of grasses are long, slender, and narrow with parallel veins. Tips of leaves vary from boat-shaped tips (typical of Poa species like Kentucky Bluegrass), to sharply pointed. Leaves themselves range in characteristics including parallel sided, needle-like, twisting, tapered, or constricted at the base. Leaves can also be stiff, lax, flat, rolled, or even folded. They may have a waxy coating, or glossy on either sides. You'll need to pay attention to all potential characteristics that a leaf blade may or may not have, including length and width.
Most culms or stems of grasses are rounded, though several species can also be elliptical or flat . While the crown is the inflorescence, the entire culm is hollow except where leaves join the culm, forming the. the collar. The collar, aside from the blade consists of the node, sheath, auricles, and ligule. The collar is the best way to identify a grass plant if an inflorescence has not emerged. While the node is the point where the next leaf begins, the culm of the grass elongates as the plant pushes up the seed head from inside the hollow culm, and the space between each leaf blade lengthens as the plant reaches maturity.



Inflorescence:The inflorescence that eventually emerges up through the culm and which forms the last section of the entire plant, hence the ""crown,"" is essentially a grouping of several floret units called spikelets. Each spikelet is arranged on a main axis that may be stalked or stalkless. The stalked spikelets may be branched or not branched. Thus, grass inflorescences come in three different arrangements: spikes, racemes or panicles, respectively.


Spikelets: Each spikelet has two glumes, which are simply flowerless bracts below or subtending the spikelet, and may be larger, smaller, or equal to the length of the bottom-most florets. A spikelet may have as few as one floret or as many as seven or eight in some species. Some spikelets may have one or more awns (a long appendage sticking out from a floret), and ""callus hairs"" at the base inside the glumes. Flowering spikelets have anthers exposed out to the wind and insects to disperse pollen, and these tiny anthers are often yellow in colour. Once flowering has finished, seeds form in the spikelet, not in a pod or fruit like with many broad-leaved weeds shown below.


Sedges are also common weeds found in lawns and gardens and in various conditions, from very wet to dry areas. They are not part of the Gramineae family, but they share many attributes with grasses. Some sedge weeds are rare in some areas compared with others, for instance sedge weeds are much more common in Florida, USA than in Alberta, Canada. That said, there are far more species of grass weeds than sedge weeds in all of North America, which may explain their rarity in many locations.

Sedges can be identified by feeling for a three-sided or triangular stem--often thick forming from a basal, fibrous and often rhizomatous root stem. All sedges have an erect, three-sided stem with aerial inflorescences at the top and basal leaves remaining at the base.



, Using the information provided above as well as that from an accompanying weed or plant identification book, look at the various anatomical features of the plant to help you determine the name of that particular plant.


Note that not all grasses nor grass-like species can be identified using the presence of inflorescences or seed-heads. Many grass weeds that should be eliminated from the garden or flower bed as early as possible are still in their vegetative stage, and an ID on them cannot wait until they finally flower. This is especially true in the spring when weeds tend to be most prolific and are in greatest competition with newly planted garden plants or germinating seedlings.

For cases like these, it's highly recommended to look at the features of the collar region of the plant. As mentioned above, look for the ligule, auricles, and the shape characteristic of the sheath. (For definitions of some of the terms used here, please refer to the Terminology section below.)



, Most who are new to identifying plants feel most comfortable referring to the common name of a plant, and choose to learn the species' scientific, Latin or Greek taxonomic names later.


However please note that it's very common for a single plant to have more than one common name, depending on location and the language of those referring to a particular plant, so use of common names exclusively in identifying any plant, weed or not, is discouraged especially in the world's scientific community. This is because many plants have one taxonomic name, and that one taxonomic name is often the name that is easily recognized in all languages in by many people in all regions.

, Several key features to remember when identifying these herbaceous plants: Leaves are often broad (similar length and width measurements), with veins often netted or angularly perpendicular to the main axis. Stem characteristics vary, though many are branching, erect, singular with branching to flowers, or horizontal and spreading from a crown or rosette. Plants also spread via stolons or rhizomes. Flowers are distinct because they are often colourful, however size in comparison to the rest of the plant is variable. Seeds are found in a pod or encapsulated in a fleshy fruit.


Interestingly, most broad-leaved weeds have their growth points at the top or tip of the plant, not at the bottom. They also have true, full stems that branch out to leaves and flowers. Stems may be erect or spreading.
Unlike grasses above, broad-leaved plants, otherwise known as forbs, do not fall into one single taxonomic family, but rather many families. You may recognize a few family names such as Asteraceae (family that contains daisies, thistles, dandelions and sunflowers), and Geraniaceae (well known for geraniums), just to name a couple.
Because most garden plants are forbs (few are shrubs or woody plants, mentioned below, and even fewer are ornamental grasses and sedges, mentioned above), knowing the characteristics of a weed that sets it apart from other ornamental forbs is important even in the seedling stages. As mentioned in grasses, weeds are often highly prolific and equally competitive at that time with germinating and/or newly planted garden plants, and if left unchecked can take over a entire cultivated area.

It's highly recommended to know the characteristics of a forb weed before they produce flowers because elimination of such weeds shouldn't wait until they are big enough to produce flowers. Although it's hard to pick weeds when they're just germinating--first putting out their cotyledons, and not yet their first leaves--it's good to know what a weed is even when it has just began to get into their second- to fourth-leaf stage so that it can be removed.


All forbs and broad-leaved weeds are dicotyledons. This means that the when these plants first emerge from a seed, they send up two primary embryonic leaves or cotyledons (also called ""seed leaves""), unlike the monocotyledonous grass and grass-like species above. Trees, shrubs, and other woody plants are also dicotyledons, as are all garden or cultivated forb species grown for aesthetics, food, fibre, feed, and medicine.

, Using the basic identifying characteristics described in the step above, find a plant in your garden or flower bed that obviously shouldn't be growing in there and you suspect may be a broad-leaved weed of some kind.

, Forbs have several parts observed above ground: Leaves, stems, flowers, and growth form. Below ground, most forbs will have either a tap root, or fibrous roots similar to grasses. Forbs can propagate from a large seed bank of tiny seeds deposited the year before, or from rhizomes spreading out from the parent plant creating daughter plants via asexual reproduction. For example, White Dutch Clover plants will propagate through both methods.



Leaves and stems: The diversity in leaf type and structure is more complex than most people think. Leaves come in a wide variety of structural differences, and it's these differences that can make it relatively easy for someone with enough experience with plant ID to correctly identify a broad-leafed plant just by looking at a single leaf, or a set of composite leaves. There are structural differences between leaves of various species of forb weeds. The most common structural differences many people look for are leaf shapes, leaf attachment and leaf arrangement.


Leaf shapes come in two primary types, simple and composite.


Simple leaves come in fifteen primary shapes: Linear, lanceolate, oblanceolate, oblong, elliptical, oval, ovate, obovate, spatulate, cuneate (wedge-shaped), deltoid (triangular), cordate (heart-shaped), reniform (kidney-shaped), orbicular (circular), and peltate (shield-shaped). Simple leaves are just one leaf attached to a petiole or ""stem"" which attaches to a branch or along the true stem of the entire plant.

Composite leaves come in eleven main types: Pinnately lobed, pinnately divided, palmately lobed, palmately divided, palmately much divided, odd pinnate, even pinnate, interruptedly pinnate, compound pinnate, compound pinnate, trifoliate, and digitate.

Composite leaves are a set of many leaves called leaflets, or a simple leaf that is shallowly or deeply indented, as with the first five types. Pinnate is a shape reference to that of a bird's feather. Palmate is a shape reference to a human hand.





Leaf attachment to the stem: Leaves attach to the main stem in several manners. They can be as following:


Clasping (base of the leaf almost surrounds the stem);

Decurrent (clasping but the leaf base extending down along the stem)

Ocreate (sheathing stipules [stipules being a ""minor"" leaf form at the junction between the stem and the petiole);

Perfoliate (leaf with margins entirely surrounding the stem so that the leaf appears to be joined and surrounding the stem);

Petiolate or petioled (has petiole or leaf stalk); and

Sessile (directly attached to the stem without supporting stalk).



Leaf arrangement: The most popular arrangement that everyone would and should know about is alternate and opposite arrangements.

Others exist though, including basal (arising from the base), cauline (leaves that arise from the stem above ground level), decussate (similar to opposite except leaves are on the stem in pairs with each pair at right angles to the pair above or below), rosette (dense radiating cluster at or near ground level), or whorled (parts arranged in whorls, or rather a leaf arrangement with three or more leaves coming from a single node).





Flowers: As diverse in structural differences as leaves, flowers of weedy forbs vary from a single, tiny bloom to a large head that contains many flowers or florets. Flower symmetry is of somewhat importance, but majority of weed flowers are noted as ""regular"" or, radially symmetrical (all parts are similar in size and arrangement on the receptacle ). Irregular flowers are only bilaterally symmetrical. Other important things to know of flowers are flower parts, insertion of floral structures, some important perianth parts, and some perianth types. There are many other structures that are more advanced for botanists to know and use to identify a plant by its flower structure, but these are too complex to mention here.


Flower parts: There are some important floral parts to know before we get to the other bullets below. Flower parts include more than just petals and stamens, there are numerous other more scientific terms that may come in handy to know when trying to identify a weed. The perianth, mentioned above and below, is the collective parts of the flower, especially the calyx and corolla when they are similar in appearance.

The calyx is the outer perianth whorl, or the collective term for all the sepals of a flower.
A corolla is the collective name for all the petals of a flower, or the inner perianth whorl. Most people would understand that a petal is an individual segment or member of the corolla which is usually coloured or white.
A sepal, on the other hand, is the segment of the calyx, and is the green ""leaves"" of the flower that reside underneath the petals.
The pedicel is the stalk of a single flower in an inflorescence (remember inflorescence is a term referring to the flowering part of a plant, be it a flowering cluster, or the arrangement of flowers on a flowering axis).
A peduncle is the stalk of a solitary flower or flower cluster arranged on an axis. The receptacle of a flower is the portion of the pedicel which the flower parts are born or, as in the flowers of Asteraceae, it's the part of the peduncle where the flowers of the head are born (a ""flower"" of a dandelion, for instance, is actually made up of many tiny flowers). The receptacle is also known as a torus (plural: tori).
Finally, as we all know, the pistil is the female reproductive organ of the flower consisting of a stigma, a style and and ovary, and the male reproductive organs are the stamens which consist of an anther and a filament. The collective term for all female reproductive organs of a flower is called gynoecium, and androecium is a collective term for all male parts of a flower.



Insertion of floral structures: The whole structure of a flower actually differs with regard how the reproductive parts of a flower are attached to the ovary. Botanists have identified three types:


Epigynous, is a term used to describe a flower's stamens, petals and sepals attached to the top of the ovary, with the ovary inferior (or below) to the other floral parts.

Hypogynous means that the ovary is superior to other floral parts (above where the sepals are, generally), and the stamens, petals and sepals are all attached below the ovary.

Perigynous is a little more tricky because it refers to the stamens, petals and sepals attached to a calyx tube (also called a hypanthium) which surrounds but is not actually attached to the superior ovary. You can only find out of a flower is of the very latter by dissecting it under a strong magnifying glass or a dissecting microscope, especially with small flowers.



Perianth parts: Different flowers of different species have different parts, and some parts may have more than one name.

Pea flowers, for instance are made up of the banner, the ala, and the keel. The banner is the upper and largest (usually) petal of the pea-type flower, and may also be called the vexillum. The ala (pl. alae) is one or two lateral petals of the pea-type flower (also called the ""wing""), and the keel is the lower two united petals of that same flower.
Of a petal itself, there is the blade (broad portion) and the claw (narrowed base of some petals and sepals).
In flowers of the Asteraceae family, each floral head is made up of several ray or disk flowers which have a ligule (the flattened part of the ray corolla, not quite like the ligule of grasses above), pappus (modified calyx consisting of awns, scales or bristles at the base of the ""achene"" ) or squama (pl. squamae; scales of some pappus types).



Perianth or flower types: When you get to looking at the flower itself, you'll find there are many different types. The photo below (still to come as of 10/11/16) shows you some of the common types of types you'll discover with broad-leaf weeds.



Growth forms: Not all weedy forbs are going to be up-right flowers that children often draw when they think of a plant, or even a weed! Growth forms of broad-leaved weeds do include erect, but also refer to those that grow along the ground or are creeping. Lax forms are also common.

, Most who are new to identifying plants feel most comfortable referring to the common name of a plant, and choose to learn the species' scientific, Latin or Greek taxonomic names later.


However please note that it's very common for a single plant to have more than one common name, depending on location and the language of those referring to a particular plant, so use of common names exclusively in identifying any plant, weed or not, is discouraged especially in the world's scientific community. This is because many plants have one taxonomic name (though arguably many plants do have several ""synonymic"" scientific names), and that one taxonomic name is often the name that is easily recognized in all languages in by many people in all regions.

, Woody plants share very similar attributes and growth characteristics with forbs above, and many forbs actually share the same families as woody plants. For instance, caragana mentioned below is in the same family as the clover species and black medic mentioned above, which is Fabaceae, or the Legume (Peas and Beans) Family. The only thing that sets woody plants apart from their herbaceous counterparts is that the stems are not annual (grow up from seed or root growth points every year) like forbs are. The stems also form secondary tissues, primarily xylem, on the interior of the stem, and its these xylem cells, with their very strong and rigid structures, are what make up what we know as ""wood."" In trees and shrubs subject to seasonal changes, rings develop in the woody tissues in response to growth patterns that occur in the spring and summer. Tropical trees, however, do not form rings because the cambrium (tissue that can grow due to cell division, and makes up xylem and phloem , of a plant stem) experiences active growth all year round. Flower and leaf characteristics mentioned above also apply to woody plants, exceptions are those gymnosperms, largely as coniferous plants like spruce and pine trees.

, Using the basic identifying characteristics described in the step above, find a plant in your garden or flower bed that obviously shouldn't be growing in there and you suspect may be a woody weed of some kind.

, Woody plants are characterized by structure of the leaves, flowers, seeds or fruit, stems, and growth form.

, Most who are new to identifying plants feel most comfortable referring to the common name of a plant, and choose to learn the species' scientific, Latin or Greek taxonomic names later.


However please note that it's very common for a single plant to have more than one common name, depending on location and the language of those referring to a particular plant, so use of common names exclusively in identifying any plant, weed or not, is discouraged especially in the world's scientific community. This is because many plants have one taxonomic name, and that one taxonomic name is often the name that is easily recognized in all languages in by many people in all regions.

Understand the Beer-Lambert law for absorbance, A = ɛlc.,
Rearrange the Beer-Lambert equation to solve for molar absorptivity.,
Obtain values for the variables in the equation using spectrophotometry.,
Plug in the values for the variables and solve the equation for molar absorptivity.",How to Calculate Molar Absorptivity1," The standard equation for absorbance is A = ɛlc, where A is the amount of light absorbed by the sample for a given wavelength, ɛ is the molar absorptivity, l is the distance that the light travels through the solution, and c is the concentration of the absorbing species per unit volume.Absorbance can also be calculated using the ratio between the intensity of a reference sample and the unknown sample. It is given by the equation A = log10(Io/I).Intensity is obtained using a spectrophotometer.
The absorbance of a solution will change based on the wavelength that is passed through the solution. Some wavelengths will be absorbed more than others depending upon the makeup of the solution. Remember to state which wavelength is being used for your calculation.;
, Using algebra we can divide absorbance by the length and the concentration to get molar absorptivity on one side of the equation: ɛ = A/lc. We can now use this basic equation to calculate molar absorptivity for a given wavelength.


Absorbance between readings can vary due to the concentration of solution and the shape of the container used to measure intensity. Molar absorptivity compensates for these variations., A spectrophotometer is a piece of equipment that passes a specific wavelength of light through a substance and detects the amount of light that comes out. Some of the light will be absorbed by the solution and the remaining light that passes through can be used to calculate the absorbance of that solution.


Prepare a solution of known concentration, c, for analysis. Units for concentration are molar or moles/liter.To find l, measure the length of the cuvette. Units for path length are centimeters.
Using a spectrophotometer, obtain a measurement for absorbance, A, at a given wavelength. The unit for wavelength is meters, but most wavelengths are so small, they are actually measured in nanometers (nm).Absorbance has no units.

, Using the values you obtained for A, c, and l, plug them into the equation ɛ = A/lc. Multiply l by c and then divide A by the product to solve for molar absorptivity.


For example: Using a cuvette with a length of 1 cm, you measured the absorbance of a solution with a concentration of 0.05 mol/L. The absorbance at a wavelength of 280 nm was 1.5. What is the molar absorptivity of this solution?


ɛ280 = A/lc = 1.5/(1 x 0.05) = 30 L mol-1 cm-1

Measure the intensity of transmitted light through varying concentrations of solution.,
Plot the concentration versus absorbance on a graph.,
Determine the slope of the line-of-best-fit through the data points.,
Divide the slope of the line by the path length (depth of the cuvette) to calculate molar absorptivity.",How to Calculate Molar Absorptivity2," Make up three to four concentrations of one solution. Using a spectrophotometer, measure the absorbance of one concentration of solution at a given wavelength. Start with the lowest concentration of solution and move to the highest. The order isn’t important, but keep track of which absorbance goes with which calculation.

, Using the values obtained from the spectrophotometer, plot each point on a line graph. For each individual value, plot the concentration on the X-axis and absorbance on the Y-axis.Draw a line between each of the points. If the measurements are correct, the points should form a straight line indicating absorbance and concentration are proportional to Beer’s Law., To calculate the slope of the line you take rise divided by run. Using two of your data points, subtract the X- and Y-values from each other, then divide Y/X.


The equation for the slope of a line is (Y2 - Y1)/(X2 - X1). The point higher on the line is given the subscript 2, while the lower point is given the subscript 1.
For example: The absorbance at a .2 molar concentration is 0.27 and at 0.3 molar is 0.41. The absorbance values are Y-values, while concentrations are X-values. Using the equation for a line (Y2 - Y1)/(X2 - X1) = (0.41-0.27)/(0.3-0.2) = 0.14/0.1 = 1.4 is the slope of the line.

, The final step to calculating molar absorptivity with data points is to divide by the path length. The path length is the depth of the cuvette used in the spectrophotometer.


Continuing our example: If 1.4 is the slope of the line and the path length is 0.5 cm, then the molar absorptivity is 1.4/0.5 = 2.8 L mol-1 cm-1.

Understand that chemical bonds occur when atoms share electrons.,
Understand how electronegativity affects the electrons in the bond.,
Use an electronegativity table as a reference.,
Remember electronegativity trends for easy estimations.",How to Calculate Electronegativity1," To understand electronegativity, it's important first to understand what a ""bond"" is. Any two atoms in a molecule that are ""connected"" to each other on a molecular diagram are said to have a bond between them. This means that they share a set of two electrons with each atom contributing one electron to the bond.


The exact reasons for why atoms share electrons and bond are a little beyond the scope of this article. If you want to learn more, try this article on the bond basics or WikiHow's own How to Study the Nature of the Chemical Bond (Chemistry).;
, When two atoms share a set of two electrons in a bond, they don't always share them equally. When one atom has higher electronegativity than the atom it's bonded to, it pulls the two electrons in the bond closer to itself. An atom with very high electronegativity may pull the electrons all the way to its side of the bond, barely sharing them at all with the other atom.


For example, in the molecule NaCl (sodium chloride), the chloride atom has a fairly high electronegativity and the sodium has a fairly low one. Thus, the electrons will get pulled towards the chloride and away from the sodium.

, An electronegativity table of the elements has the elements arranged exactly like in a periodic table, except that each atom is labeled with its electronegativity. These can be found in a variety of chemical textbooks and technical articles as well as online.



Here is a link to an excellent electronegativity table. Note that this uses the Pauling electronegativity scale, which is most common.However, there are other ways to measure electronegativity, one of which will be shown below.

, If you don't have an electronegativity table handy, you can still estimate an atom's electronegativity based on where it is located on a normal periodic table. As a general rule:


An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move to the right in the periodic table.
An atom's electronegativity gets higher as you move up in the periodic table.
Thus, the atoms in the top right have the highest electronegativities and the atoms in the bottom left have the lowest ones.
For example, in the NaCl example from above, you can tell that chlorine has a higher electronegativity than sodium because it's almost all the way in the top right. On the other hand, sodium is far to the left, making it one of the lower-ranking atoms.

Find the electronegativity difference between the two atoms.,
If the difference is below about 0.5, the bond is nonpolar covalent.,
If the difference is between 0.5-1.6, the bond is polar covalent.,
If the difference is over 2.0, the bond is ionic.,
If the difference is between 1.6-2.0, check for a metal.",How to Calculate Electronegativity2," When two atoms are bonded together, the difference between their electronegativities can tell you about the qualities of their bond. Subtract the smaller electronegativity from the larger one to find the difference.


For example, if we're looking at the molecule HF, we would subtract the electronegativity of hydrogen (2.1) from fluorine (4.0). 4.0 - 2.1 = 1.9


, Here, the electrons are shared almost equally. These bonds don't form molecules that have large charge differences on either end. Nonpolar bonds tend to be very difficult to break.For example, the molecule O2 has this type of bond. Since the two oxygen's  have the same electronegativity, the difference between them is 0.

, These bonds have more of the electrons at one end than the other. This makes the molecule a little more negative at the end with the electrons and a little more positive at the end without them. The charge imbalance in these bonds can allow the molecule to participate in certain special reactions.A good example of this is the molecule H2O (water). The O is more electronegative than the two Hs, so it holds the electrons more tightly and makes the entire molecule partially negative at the O end and partially positive at the H ends.

, In these bonds, the electrons are completely at one end of the bond. The more electronegative atom gains a negative charge and the less electronegative atom gains a positive charge. These sorts of bonds allow their atoms to react well with other atoms and even be pulled apart by polar atoms.


An example of this is NaCl (sodium chloride). The chlorine is so electronegative that it pulls both electrons in the bond all the way towards itself, leaving sodium with a positive charge.

, If there is a metal in the bond, the bond is ionic. If there are only non-metals, the bond is polar covalent


Metals include most of the atoms on the left side and the middle of the periodic table. This page has a table that shows which elements are metals.Our HF example from above falls in this range. Since H and F aren't metals, they have a polar covalent bond.

Find the first ionization energy of your atom.,
Find the electron affinity of the atom.,
Solve the Mulliken electronegativity equation.",How to Calculate Electronegativity3," Mulliken electronegativity is a slightly different way of measuring electronegativity than is used in the Pauling table above. To find Mulliken electronegativity for a certain atom, find that atom's first ionization energy. This is the energy requires to make the atom discharge a single electron.


This is something you'll probably have to look up in chemistry reference materials. This site has a good table you may want to use (scroll down to find it).As an example, let's say that we're trying to find the electronegativity of lithium (Li). In the table on the site above, we can see that its first ionization energy is 520 kJ/mol.

, This is a measure of the energy gained when an electron is added to an atom to form a negative ion. Again, this is something you'll need to look up in reference material. This site has resources you may want to browse.The electron affinity of lithium is 60 KJ mol-1.

, When you're using kJ/mol as units for your energies, the equation for Mulliken electronegativity is ENMulliken = (1.97×10−3)(Ei+Eea) + 0.19. Plug your values into the equation and solve for ENMulliken.


In our example, we would solve like this:



ENMulliken = (1.97×10−3)(Ei+Eea) + 0.19
ENMulliken = (1.97×10−3)(520 + 60) + 0.19
ENMulliken = 1.143 + 0.19 = 1.333

Define the equation for mass percent of a compound.,
Calculate the total mass of the compound.,
Identify the mass of the chemical-in-question.,
Plug the variables into the mass percent equation.,
Calculate the mass percent.",How to Calculate Mass Percent1," The basic formula for mass percent of a compound is: mass percent = (mass of chemical/total mass of compound) x 100. You must multiply by 100 at the end to express the value as a percentage.Write the equation at the beginning of every problem: mass percent = (mass of chemical/total mass of compound) x 100.
The mass of the chemical you’re interested in is the mass given in the problem. If the mass isn’t given, refer to the following section about solving for mass percent when the mass is not given.
The total mass of the compound is calculated by summing the masses of all of the chemicals used to make the compound or solution.;
, When you know the masses of all the elements or compounds being added together, you simply need to add them together to calculate the total mass of the final compound or solution. This will be the denominator in the mass percent calculation.Example 1: What is the percent mass of 5g of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 100g of water?

The total mass of the compound is the amount of sodium hydroxide plus the amount of water: 100g + 5g for a total mass of 105g.


Example 2: What masses of sodium chloride and water are needed to make 175 g of a 15% solution?

In this example, you are given the total mass and the percentage you want, but are asked to find the amount of solute to add to the solution. The total mass is 175 g.



, When asked to find the ""mass percent"", you are being asked to find the mass of a particular chemical (the chemical-in-question) as a percentage of the total mass of all elements. Write down the mass of chemical-in-question. This mass will be the numerator in the mass percent calculation.Example 1: The mass of the chemical-in-question is 5g of sodium hydroxide.
Example 2: For this example, the mass of the chemical-in-question is the unknown you are trying to calculate.

, Once you have determined the values for each variable, plug them into the equation.


Example 1: mass percent = (mass of chemical/total mass of compound) x 100 = (5 g/105 g) x 100.
Example 2: We want to rearrange the mass percent equation to solve for the unknown mass of the chemical: mass of the chemical = (mass percent*total mass of the compound)/100 = (15*175)/100.

, Now that the equation is filled in, simply solve to calculate the mass percent. Divide the mass of the chemical by the total mass of the compound and multiply by 100. This will give you the mass percent of the chemical.


Example 1: (5/105) x 100 = 0.04761 x 100 = 4.761%. Thus, the mass percent of 5g of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 100g of water is 4.761%.
Example 2: The rearranged equation to solve for mass of the chemical is (mass percent*total mass of the compound)/100: (15*175)/100 = (2625)/100 = 26.25 grams sodium chloride.

The amount of water to be added is simply the total mass minus the mass of the chemical: 175 – 26.25 = 148.75 grams water.

Calculate the total mass of the compound.,
Identify the mass of the element-in-question.,
Plug the variables into the mass percent equation.,
Calculate the mass percent.",How to Calculate Mass Percent2," The basic formula for mass percent of a compound is: mass percent = (molar mass of element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100. The molar mass of a compound is the amount of mass for one mole of an element while the molecular mass is the amount of mass for one mole of the entire compound.You must multiply by 100 at the end to express the value as a percentage.Write out the equation at the beginning of every problem: mass percent = (molar mass of element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100.
Both values have units of grams per mole (g/mol).
When you aren’t given masses, you can find the mass percent of an element within a compound using molar mass.
Example 1: Find the mass percent of Hydrogen in a water molecule.

Example 2: Find the mass percent of carbon in a glucose molecule.


, If you are not given the chemical formulas for each compound, you will need to write them out. If you are given the chemical formulas you may skip this step, and proceed to the ""Find the mass of each element"" step.


Example 1: Write out the chemical formula for water, H2O.
Example 2: Write out the chemical formula for glucose, C6H12O6.

, Look up the molecular weight of each element in your chemical formulas on the periodic table. The mass of an element can usually be found underneath the chemical symbol. Write down the masses of every element in the compound.Example 1: Look up the molecular weight of Oxygen, 15.9994; and the molecular weight of Hydrogen, 1.0079.Example 2: Look up the molecular weight of Carbon, 12.0107; Oxygen, 15.9994; and Hydrogen, 1.0079.

, Identify how many moles (mole ratio) of each element are in your chemical compounds. The mole ratio is given by the subscript number in the compound. Multiply the molecular mass of each element by this mole ratio.Example 1: Hydrogen has a subscript of two while oxygen has a subscript of 1. Therefore, multiply the molecular mass of Hydrogen by 2, 1.00794 X 2 = 2.01588; and leave the molecular mass of Oxygen as is, 15.9994 (multiplied by one).
Example 2: Carbon has a subscript of 6, hydrogen, 12, and oxygen, 6. Multiplying each element by its subscript gives you:

Carbon (12.0107*6) = 72.0642
Hydrogen (1.00794*12) = 12.09528
Oxygen (15.9994*6) = 95.9964



, Add up the total mass of all the elements in your compounds. Using the masses calculated using the mole ratio, you can calculate the total mass of the compound. This number will be the denominator of the mass percent equation.Example 1: Add 2.01588 g/mol (the mass of two moles of Hydrogen atoms) with 15.9994 g/mol (the mass of a single mole of Oxygen atoms) and get 18.01528 g/mol.
Example 2: Add all of the calculated molar masses together: Carbon + Hydrogen + Oxygen = 72.0642 + 12.09528 + 95.9964 = 180.156 g/mol.

, When asked to find the ""mass percent"", you are being asked to find the mass of a particular element in a compound, as a percentage of the total mass of all elements. Identify the mass of the element-in-question and write it down. The mass is the mass calculated using the mole ratio. This number is the numerator in the mass percent equation.Example 1: The mass of hydrogen in the compound is 2.01588 g/mol (the mass of two moles of hydrogen atoms).
Example 2: The mass of carbon in the compound is 72.0642 g/mol (the mass of six moles of carbon atoms).

, Once you have determined the values for each variable, plug them into the equation defined in the first step: mass percent = (molar mass of the element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100.


Example 1: mass percent = (molar mass of the element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100 = (2.01588/18.01528) x 100.
Example 2: mass percent = (molar mass of the element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100 = (72.0642/180.156) x 100.

, Now that the equation is filled in, simply solve to calculate the mass percent. Divide the mass of the element by the total mass of the compound and multiply by 100. This will give you the mass percent of the element.


Example 1: mass percent = (2.01588/18.01528) x 100 = 0.11189 x 100 = 11.18%. Thus, the mass percent of Hydrogen atoms in a water molecule is 11.18%.
Example 2: mass percent = (molar mass of the element/total molecular mass of compound) x 100 = (72.0642/180.156) x 100 = 0.4000 x 100 = 40.00%. Thus, the mass percent of carbon atoms in a molecule of glucose is 40.00%.

Multiply the bond energies by the number of bonds formed.,
Add up all of the formed bond energies.,
Subtract the formed bonds from the broken bonds.,
Determine whether the entire reaction was endothermic or exothermic.",How to Calculate Bond Energy," Bond energy is defined by the sum of all of the bonds broken minus the sum of all of the bonds formed: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). ΔH is the change in bond energy, also referred to as the bond enthalpy and ∑H is the sum of the bond energies for each side of the equation.This equation is a form of Hess’s Law.
The unit for bond energy is kilojoules per mol or kJ/mol.;
, When given an equation simply written with chemical symbols and numbers, it is helpful to draw this equation out, illustrating all of the bonds formed between the various elements and molecules. This visual representation will allow you to easily count all of the bonds that break and form on the reactant and product sides of the equation.


Remember, the left side of the equation is all of the reactants and the right side is all of the products.
Single, double, and triple bonds have different bond energies, so be sure to draw your diagram with the correct bonds between elements.For example, draw out the following equation: H2(g) + Br2(g) ---> 2 HBr(g)
H-H + Br-Br ---> 2 H-Br

, In most cases, the bond energies you will be using for these calculations will be averages.The same bond can have a slightly different bond energy based on the molecule it is formed in; therefore, average bond energies are generally used..


A single, double, and triple bond are all treated as one break. They all have different bond energies, but count as only a single break.
The same is true for the formation of a single, double, or triple bond. It will be counted as single formation.
For our example, all of the bonds are single bonds.

, The left side contains the reactants. These will represent all of the broken bonds in the equation. This is an endothermic process that requires the absorption of energy to break the bonds.For our example, the left side has 1 H-H bond and 1 Br-Br bond.

, The right side contains all of the products. These are all of the bonds that will be formed. This is an exothermic process that releases energy, usually in the form of heat.For our example, the right side has 2 H-Br bonds.

, There are many tables that have information on the average bond energies for a specific bond. These tables can be found online or in a chemistry book. It is important to note that these bond energies are always for molecules in a gaseous state.For our example, you need to find the bond energy for an H-H bond, a Br-Br bond, and an H-Br bond.
H-H = 436 kJ/mol; Br-Br = 193 kJ/mol; H-Br = 366 kJ/mol.To calculate bond energy for molecules in a liquid state, you need to also look up the enthalpy change of vaporization for the liquid molecule. This is the amount energy needed to convert the liquid into a gas.This number is added to the total bond energy.

For example: If you were given liquid water, you would need to add the enthalpy change of vaporization of water (+41 kJ) to the equation., In some equations, you may have the same bond broken multiple times.For example, if 4 atoms of hydrogen are in the molecule, then the bond energy of hydrogen must be counted 4 times, or multiplied by 4.


In our example, there is only one bond of each molecule, so the bond energies are simply multiplied by 1.
H-H = 436 x 1 = 436 kJ/mol
Br-Br = 193 x 1 = 193 kJ/mol

, Once you have multiplied the bond energies by the number of the individual bonds, you need to then sum all of the bonds on the reactant side.For our example, the sum of the bonds broken is H-H + Br-Br = 436 + 193 = 629 kJ/mol.

, Just as you did for the bonds broken on the reactant side, you will multiply the number of bonds formed by its respective bond energy.If you have 4 hydrogen bonds formed, you would need to multiply that bond energy by 4.


For our example we have 2 H-Br bonds formed, so the bond energy of H-Br (366 kJ/mol) will be multiplied by 2: 366 x 2 = 732 kJ/mol.

, Again, like you did with the bonds broken, you will add up all of the bonds formed on the product side.Sometimes you will only have one product formed and can skip this step.


In our example, there is only one product formed, so the energy of the bonds formed is simply the energy of the 2 H-Br bonds or 732 kJ/mol.

, Once you have summed all of the bond energies for both sides, simply subtract the formed bonds from the broken bonds. Remember the equation: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed). Plug in the calculated values and subtract.


For our example: ΔH = ∑H(bonds broken) - ∑H(bonds formed) = 629 kJ/mol - 732 kJ/mol = -103 kJ/mol.

, The final step to calculating bond energy is to determine whether the reaction releases energy or consumes energy. An endothermic (one that consumes energy) will have a final bond energy that is positive, while an exothermic reaction (one that releases energy) will have a negative bond energy.In our example, the final bond energy is negative, therefore, the reaction is exothermic.

Know the formula.,
Know that the higher the bond order, the more stable the molecule.,
Consider a simple example.",How to Calculate Bond Order in Chemistry1," In molecular orbital theory, bond order is defined as half of the difference between the number of bonding and antibonding electrons. Bond order = /2.

, Each electron that entered a bonding molecular orbital will help stabilize the new molecule. Each electron that entered an antibonding molecular orbital will act to destabilize the new molecule. Note the new energy state as the bond order of the molecule.

If the bond order is zero, the molecule cannot form. The higher bond orders indicate greater stability for the new molecule.


, Hydrogen atoms have one electron in the s shell, and the s shell is capable of holding two electrons. When two hydrogen atoms bond together, each completes the s shell of the other. Two bonding orbitals are formed. No electrons are forced to move to the next higher orbital, the p shell – so no antibonding orbitals are formed. The bonding order is thus (2−0)/2{\displaystyle (2-0)/2}, which equals 1. This forms the common molecule H2: hydrogen gas.
"
"
Determine bond order at a glance.,
Consider how atoms come together into molecules.,
Draw Lewis dot structures.",How to Calculate Bond Order in Chemistry2," A single covalent bond has a bond order of one; a double covalent bond, a bond order of two; a triple covalent bond, three – and so on.In its most basic form, the bond order is the number of bonded electron pairs that hold two atoms together.
, In any given molecule, the component atoms are bound together by bonded pairs of electrons. These electrons revolve around the nucleus of an atom in ""orbitals,"" each of which can only hold two electrons. If an orbital is not ""full""—i.e., it only holds one electron, or no electrons—then the unpaired electron can bond to a corresponding free electron on another atom.

Depending on the size and complexity of a particular atom, it might have only one orbital, or it might have as many as four.

When the nearest orbital shell is full, new electrons start to gather in the next orbital shell out from the nucleus, and continue until that shell is also full. The collection of electrons continues in ever-widening orbital shells, as larger atoms have more electrons than smaller atoms., This is a handy way to visualize how the atoms in a molecule are bonded to one another. Draw the atoms as their letters (e.g. H for Hydrogen, Cl for Chlorine). Illustrate the bonds between them as lines (e.g. – for a single bond, = for a double bond, and ≡ for a triple bond). Mark the unbonded electrons and electron pairs as dots (e.g. :C:).Once you've drawn your Lewis dot structure, count the number of bonds: this is the bond order.

The Lewis dot structure for diatomic nitrogen would be N≡N. Each nitrogen atom features one electron pair and three unbonded electrons. When two nitrogen atoms meet, their combined six unbonded electrons intermingle into a powerful triple covalent bond."
"
Consult a diagram of electron orbital shells.,
Know the difference between bonding and antibonding orbitals.",How to Calculate Bond Order in Chemistry3," Note that each shell lies further and further out from the nucleus of the atom. According to the property of entropy, energy always seeks the lowest possible state of order. The electrons will seek to populate the lowest orbital shells available.
, When two atoms come together to form a molecule, they seek to use each other's electrons to fill the lowest possible states in the electron orbital shells. Bonding electrons are, essentially the electrons that stick together and fall into the lowest states. Antibonding electrons are the ""free"" or unbonded electrons that are pushed to higher orbital states.Bonding electrons: By noting how full the orbital shells of each atom are, you can determine how many of the electrons in higher energy states will be able to fill the more stable, lower-energy-state shells of the corresponding atom. These ""filling electrons"" are referred to as bonding electrons. 

Antibonding electrons: When the two atoms try to form a molecule by sharing electrons, some electrons will actually be driven to higher-energy-state orbital shells as the lower-energy-state orbital shells are filled up. These electrons are referred to as antibonding electrons."

Determine how much citric acid you need to buy.,
Look for citric acid at your local supermarket.,
Check natural food stores for citric acid.,
Shop at a restaurant supply store.,
Find a store that sells home brewing supplies.,
Shop online.",How to Buy Citric Acid1," The amount you need will determine where you should shop for citric acid. Smaller quantities can generally be purchased at the grocery store, while larger quantities may need be purchased at a bulk store or online.


Consult the instructions for your activity or recipe to see how much citric acid they indicate you need to use for your project.
Increase the amount of citric acid if you plan to make multiple batches of a recipe or want to have an ample amount for repeating the activity. For example, if you plan to use citric acid for cheese-making, and you want to make your own cheese on a regular basis, you will want to buy enough citric acid for multiple uses.;
, Food grade citric acid is normally available in a powder form. Typically, it is best to buy citric acid at a grocery store when you need a small amount, for example, a bottle with 3 to 5 ounces (85 g to 142 g).


Check for citric acid in the canning section. It is often located near the pectin and other canning ingredients and materials.Look for citric acid under the name sour salt in the kosher section or in the spice aisle., Health food stores often carry citric acid and may have a greater range of sizes available than standard grocery stores. Call the store before stopping by to make sure they have the amount you need in stock.

, Restaurant supply stores, especially baking or candy-making supply stores, are likely to carry citric acid. These types of stores will likely have quantities available in bulk as well. If you need a large amount, check here first.


Plan to purchase at least 1 pound (.45 kg) of citric acid. Smaller quantities may not be available.

, Home brewers often use citric acid, for example to adjust to acid level in fruit wines.A store that caters to home brewers may also have knowledgeable staff that can provide detailed information on how to use citric acid for your particular project.

, Online retailers sell small to large containers of citric acid and many online stores sell it by the pound. You can skip the shopping and have the citric acid delivered right to your door. If you are using the citric acid in something that will be consumed, remember to order food grade citric acid.


Take into account that shipping costs may make it more expensive to buy citric acid online than at a local restaurant supply or warehouse store. However, online prices are generally more competitive than supermarket prices per ounce.

Choose which form of citric acid you want to purchase.,
Check craft stores for citric acid.,
Buy citric acid through a chemical supply company.",How to Buy Citric Acid2," Citric acid is available as a monohydrate and in anhydrous form. Anhydrous means there is no water, so the citric acid is more powdery than the monohydrate form that has water.Anhydrous citric acid is usually used in bath bombs, but the monohydrate form will also work.
Unless the project specifies the use of one form over the other, either one should work.

, Anhydrous citric acid may be available in the soap making section of craft stores as it is a common ingredient in fizzing bath bombs. Call the store before going there to make sure they have the quantity in stock you need.

, A chemical supply source will provide the greatest number of options in terms of grade, texture, quantity and form. Read through your supplier's definitions of the grades they sell. Many suppliers also create their own grade labels to indicate the quality of the chemical. Citric acid is available in different grades including:


Food Chemical Codex (FCC)- food gradeAmerican Chemical Society (ACS) grade- the substance meets the standards set forth by the ACS for reagent chemicals in their publication.United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade- a substance that meets the specifications in the ""Reagents, Indicators and Solutions"" section of the USP."

Understand how atomic mass is represented.,
Locate atomic mass on the periodic table.,
Understand that periodic table values are an average atomic mass for an element.",How to Calculate Atomic Mass1," Atomic mass, the mass of a given atom or molecule, can be expressed in standard SI mass units - grams, kilograms, etc. However, because atomic masses, when expressed in these terms, are incredibly small, atomic mass is often expressed in unified atomic mass units (usually shortened to ""u"" or ""amu""). The standard for one atomic mass unit is equal to 1/12th of the mass of a standard carbon-12 isotope.Atomic mass units tell the mass of one mole of a given element or molecule in grams. This is a very useful property when it comes to practical calculations, as it allows easy conversion between the mass and moles of a given quantity of atoms or molecules of the same type.;
, Most standard periodic tables list the relative atomic masses (atomic weights) of each element. This is almost always written as a number at the bottom of the element's square on the table, under its one or two letter chemical symbol. This number is usually expressed as a decimal rather than as a whole number.


Note that the relative atomic masses listed on the periodic table are average values for the associated element. Chemical elements have different isotopes - chemical forms that differ in mass because of the addition or subtraction of one or more neutrons to the atom's nucleus.Thus, the relative atomic mass listed on the periodic table is suitable as an average value for atoms of a certain element, but not as the mass of a single atom of that element.
Relative atomic masses, as listed on the periodic table, are used to calculate molar masses for atoms and molecules. Atomic masses, when expressed in amu, as on the periodic table, are technically unitless. However, by simply multiplying an atomic mass by 1 g/mol, a workable quantity is obtained for an element's molar mass - the mass (in grams) of one mole of an element's atoms.

, As has been noted, the relative atomic masses listed for each element on the periodic table are average values of all of an atom's isotopes. This average value is valuable for many practical calculations - like, for instance, calculating the molar mass of a molecule comprised of several atoms. However, when dealing with individual atoms, this number is sometimes insufficient.


Because it's an average of several different types of isotopes, the value on the periodic table isn't the exact value for any single atom's atomic mass.
The atomic masses for individual atoms must be calculated by taking into account the exact number of protons and neutrons in a single atom.

"
"
Find the atomic number of the element or isotope.,
Find the number of neutrons in the nucleus.,
Add the proton and neutron count.",How to Calculate Atomic Mass2," The atomic number is the number of protons in an element, and never varies.For example, all hydrogen atoms, and only hydrogen atoms, have one proton. Sodium has an atomic number of 11 because its nucleus has eleven protons, while oxygen has an atomic number of 8 because its nucleus has eight protons. You can find the atomic number of any element on the periodic table - in nearly all standard periodic tables: it's the number above an element's one-or-two-letter chemical symbol. This number will always be a positive whole number.


Let's say that we're working with the carbon atom. Carbon always has six protons, so we know its atomic number is 6. We can also see on the periodic table that the square for carbon (C) has a ""6"" at the top, signifying that carbon's atomic number is six.
Note that an element's atomic number doesn't have any direct bearing on its relative atomic mass as listed on the periodic table. Though, especially among elements at the top of the periodic table, it may seem that an atoms' atomic mass is about twice its atomic number, atomic mass isn't ever calculated by doubling an element's atomic number.

, The number of neutrons can vary among atoms of a certain element. While two atoms with the same number of protons and differing numbers of neutrons are both the same element, they are different isotopes of that element. Unlike the number of protons in an element, which never changes, the number of neutrons in atoms of a certain element can vary often enough that the average atomic mass of the element must be expressed as a decimal value between two whole numbers.


The number of neutrons can be determined by the isotope designation of the element. For example, carbon-14 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon-12. You will often see an isotope designated with the number as a superscript before the element symbol: 14C. The number of neutrons is calculated by subtracting the number of protons from the isotope number: 14 – 6 = 8 neutrons.
Let's say the carbon atom we're working with has six neutrons (12C). This is by far the most common isotope of carbon, accounting for nearly 99% of all carbon atoms.However, about 1% of carbon atoms have 7 neutrons (13C). Other types of carbon atoms with more or less than 6 or 7 neutrons exist in very small amounts.

, This is the atomic mass of that atom. Don't worry about the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus - their combined mass is very, very small, so, in most practical cases, it won't significantly affect your answer.


Our carbon atom has 6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12. The atomic mass of this specific carbon atom is 12. If it was a carbon-13 isotope, on the other hand, we would know that it has 6 protons + 7 neutrons = an atomic weight of 13.
The actual atomic weight of carbon-13 is 13.003355, and is more precise because it was determined experimentally.
Atomic mass is very close to the isotope number of an element. For basic calculation purposes, isotope number is equal to atomic mass. When determined experimentally, the atomic mass is slightly higher than the isotope number due to the very small mass contribution from electrons.

"
"
Determine which isotopes are in the sample.,
Determine the relative abundance of each isotope in the sample.,
Multiply the atomic mass of each isotope by its proportion in the sample.,
Add the results.",How to Calculate Atomic Mass3," Chemists often determine the relative proportions of isotopes in a given sample by using a special tool called a mass spectrometer. However, at student-level chemistry, this information is often provided for you on school tests, etc., in the form of established values from scientific literature.


For our purposes, let's say we're working with the isotopes carbon-12 and carbon-13.

, Within a given element, different isotopes appear in different proportions. These proportions are almost always expressed as percentages. Some isotopes will be very common, while others will be very rare - at times, so rare that they can barely be detected. This information can be determined through mass spectrometry or from a reference book.


Let's say that the abundance of carbon-12 is 99% and the abundance of carbon-13 is 1%. Other carbon isotopes do exist, but they exist in quantities so small that, for this example problem, they can be ignored.

, Multiply the atomic mass of each isotope by its percent abundance (written as a decimal). To convert a percentage to a decimal, simply divide it by 100. The converted percentages should always add up to 1.


Our sample contains carbon-12 and carbon-13. If carbon-12 makes up 99% of the sample and carbon-13 makes up 1% of the sample, multiply 12 (the atomic mass of carbon-12) by 0.99 and 13 (the atomic mass of carbon-13) by 0.01.
A reference book will give percent proportions based on all the known amounts of an element's isotopes. Most chemistry textbooks include this information in a table at the end of the book. A mass spectrometer can also yield the proportions for the sample being tested.

, Sum the products of the multiplications you performed in the previous step. The result of this addition is the relative atomic mass of your element - the average value of the atomic masses of your element's isotopes. When discussing an element in general, and not specific isotopes of that element, this value is used.


In our example, 12 x 0.99 = 11.88 for carbon-12, while 13 x 0.01 = 0.13 for carbon-13. The relative atomic mass of our example is 11.88 + 0.13 = 12.01.

Learn to identify poison ivy or oak before collecting leaves.,
Choose leaves that range from very young to at their prime maturity.,
Choose leaves that are in good condition, with no bruising, tears, or insect damage as these flaws will be more prominent when dried.",How to Press Leaves1," Although these leaves will give you a nasty reaction, they're really quite beautiful. If you want to press these, always wear latex gloves when you're collecting them and when you're handling them. Once pressed you will need to seal them with clear acrylic sealer so you don't get a rash.;
, If you wait until they're too mature and on the drier side the color will be more prone to fading.


Your leaves can be collected any time of the year, but if you want to keep them as green as possible you should collect them earlier in the season, before they're exposed to hot summer temperatures that can damage chlorophyll.

, That said, also take a good look at any leaves that the insects have been feasting on. These can have a nice lacy, naturally skeletonized look, either fully or partially, and lend a nice touch to your project.

Make or buy a press.,
Fill the press.,
Remove the leaves from the press when they're dry.",How to Press Leaves2," Presses are simple devices made with wood, cardboard, paper, and either metal screws, heavy weights, or straps that buckle. The idea is to dry the leaf under pressure. They are available for purchase at craft and hobby stores, on-line, or you can make your own.


To make your own press, follow this process:

Buy two pieces of plywood that are 9"" x 12,"" and about ½ "" (2.5 cm) thick; or any size that works for you. Stores that sell lumber usually will cut this for you.
Drill holes for bolts in each corner of both pieces of wood. It’s best to measure the placement of your holes to ensure they will line up no matter which way you put it together.
Place bolts through the four holes in one piece of wood, with washers between the bolt and the wood.


Cut clean cardboard and paper to the size of the press. These should be clean, so replace them when needed. Recycle cardboard boxes to cut your own to size. If the press is not square, cut your cardboard so the channels run in the direction of the shorter side for better air circulation.

, For each layer in the press, you will need two pieces of cardboard and several sheets of absorbent paper cut to size.


Put the bottom wood on your work surface. Place a piece of cardboard on it, followed by paper, then the leaves, another sheet of paper, and finally a piece of cardboard.
Repeat as many times as you’d like. It’s fine to let the leaves overlap unless there’s really prominent veining. Don’t let stems lie on top of leaves as this will make ugly lines in the dry leaf.

, Check the leaves after a couple of weeks. Place your hand on the top paper in a layer… if it feels cool, the leaves are not yet dry. Put them back in the press to finish drying. There’s no need to change the paper when pressing leaves.

"
"
Choose a heavy book to use as a press.,
Cut pressing papers.,
Fill the Press.,
Stack more books on top of the book.,
Remove the dried leaves when they’re completely dry.",How to Press Leaves3," Use an old book that you don't mind getting a bit wrinkled or stained; the moisture from the leaves could damage the pages slightly. The book should be as large, or larger than your leaves. Thicker books are best, but any book will do as long as you add weight on top of it. Weight can be in the form of a pile of books; these will not get damaged so it’s okay to use books you want to keep.

, Measure your book and cut papers the same height of the book. Paper should be cut to double the width, of the book, and then folded.

, Open the book and add one piece of pressing paper. Arrange your leaves on one side of the paper, close the fold in the pressing paper, then close the book and set it aside with a couple of books or weight on top until the leaves are dry. If you’re layering more than one sheet of leaves in the book, leave about a quarter inch (0.6 cm) of pages between layers.

, Place it under several other heavy books, or another heavy object. Stack this in a dry place.

, They’re ready for your project.

Gather either two large ceramic tiles or two pieces of heavy cardboard.
For a ceramic press, cut two pieces of cardboard and some pressing papers For a cardboard press, cut pieces to the same size.
Find a couple of strong rubber bands large enough to wrap around the ceramic tiles or cardboard.

, Lay a ceramic tile or cardboard on your work surface. Lay a couple sheets of pressing paper on the tile or cardboard. Arrange your leaves and then cover them with a couple more sheets of pressing paper, a piece of cardboard, and the second tile if using tiles. Band the press together with the rubber bands.

, Place the filled press in the microwave and set it on low for no longer than a minute. Remove the press and open it to let out steam. Once it cools, put it back together and put it back in the microwave for 30 seconds. Continue microwaving the press in 30-second increments until the leaves are dry, venting and cooling after each zap. Always vent and cool to avoid cooking your leaves. The idea is to dry them flat, cooking is never a good idea.

Look for a sufficient level of accuracy.,
Look for a pH meter with at least 2-point calibration.,
Choose a unit with the appropriate style of electrode for your testing needs.,
Look for a durable unit.,
Look for automatic temperature compensation.,
Consider a pH meter that connects to a computer.,
Shop for the best price.",How to Buy a pH Meter," Meters used to measure pH in scientific research are accurate to within 0.002 pH units. If you're buying a pH meter to test the acidity of food, you'll most likely want a unit with an accuracy of 0.01 to 0.02 units, although you can get by with a pH meter with an accuracy of 0.2 units if the pH of the food item you're making won't exceed 4.0.


For certain foods where the sugar-to-acid ratio is important, such as jellies, jams, and preserves, you'll want a more accurate meter, regardless of the pH of the food, as the pH will affect the temperature at which the food jells and how well it sets. For other flavor-sensitive foods, using a less accurate pH meter could cause you to add acid when you don't need to and so alter the food's flavor.
Using a less accurate pH meter with foods whose pH can exceed 4.0 runs the risk of allowing foods with an unsafely high pH (4.6 or higher) to go on the market.
Your pH meter should not only be accurate, but its results should also be consistent from reading to reading. If it gives widely different results a minute apart, it's not reliable.;
, To ensure accuracy, the pH meter must be calibrated to ensure its readings are accurate. Calibration is done with standard solutions of known pH. There are 3 standard solutions: pH 4, pH 7, and pH 10. If you are buying a pH meter to test acidic foods, you need to have 2 points of calibration, pH 4 and pH 7. If you are buying a pH meter for scientific research, then you'll also need the pH 10 calibration standard solution.


Calibration solutions are color-coded for easy identification. The pH 4 solution is usually red, the pH 7 solution is usually yellow, and the pH 10 solution is usually blue.
You should calibrate your pH meter at the same temperature as the item you're testing to ensure accuracy.

, If you're pH-testing foods with little or no oil, or foods where oil can be added later or separated out, you can get by with standard glass-tipped electrodes. For foods with a high-oil content where the oil cannot be separated out, such as salad dressings, you will need electrodes that won't be clogged by the solution they're immersed in.


Some pH meters come with several types of electrodes, while other meters require you to buy the electrode you need separately.
If you are going to use the pH meter in a number of places, choose a meter where the electrode isn't permanently attached. If the electrode breaks, your meter will be useless.

, Your pH meter should be rugged enough to stand up to the environment or environments you'll be using it in. A unit designed to be taken into the field should be resistant to dirt and possibly also to harsh chemicals. If you test for acidity on just-cooked foods, your pH meter should be able to withstand a temperature of at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).

, Because pH readings are affected by temperature, buying a pH meter with automatic temperature compensation is helpful if you produce a large amount of food items that need to be tested and don't have the time to let the food cool to room temperature before testing. The temperature compensation feature should have a range that covers the temperature at which your sample is to be tested.


If you use a pH meter without temperature compensation, you can either test samples only at room temperature or use a temperature compensation chart to determine the correct pH.

, This kind of meter automatically transfers a sample's pH and temperature readings to the computer, useful if you routinely test a large number of samples at a given time. This feature adds about $75 to $100 to the overall cost of the pH meter, however, so if you test only a small number of samples at a time, you may not be able to justify the additional cost.

, You can buy a pH meter from a scientific supply company or directly from the manufacturer' website. Prices range from under $100 to over $1,000; to get the best deal, assess your needs and ask the company's representatives about the capabilities and features of their pH meters before you buy.

Hunt during the season.,
Go where the ginseng grows.,
Look for companion plants.,
Identify the ginseng plant.,
Harvest only mature plants with red berries.,
Dig carefully.,
Wash and dry the root(s).",How to Hunt for Wild Ginseng1," The harvest of wild ginseng is regulated in 19 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin),and is restricted or prohibited in all other states where it occurs. All of the 19 states have a designated harvest season, which is from September 1 to November 30. Plan your harvesting accordingly.


If you have questions, contact your state natural resource or agriculture department for more details. The American Herbal Products Association is also a resource for state laws and regulations.In Canada, it is illegal to harvest wild ginseng, and it is classified as endangered both nationally and in Ontario and Québec. The export of wild roots in Canada is prohibited.;
, Ginseng is native to hardwood forests of North America, from southern Canada (Ontario and Quebec), west to South Dakota and Oklahoma, and south to Georgia. It usually grows in well-shaded areas (especially north- or east-facing slopes) of moist hardwood forests.The more mature the forest (with large hardwood trees and a full canopy that shades out most shrubs, briars, etc.), the better for ginseng, as a thick understory of smaller plants will overshade or compete with ginseng plants.


If you are interested in a certain area, check the USDA mapto see if ginseng has ever grown there before. This will greatly increase your chances of finding some ginseng.
Remember that the combination of shade and moisture create the best environment for ginseng to grow.Go to forests that have Beech Trees, Maple Trees, Hickory trees, Oak Trees, Basswood Trees, and Tulip Poplar Trees. Ginseng grows well in the shade of these trees.If you begin to harvest late into the season, you may have more difficulty finding ginseng.
Look for deep, dark soil that is loose and covered with leaf litter., One indicator that you may be in an area where ginseng grows is the presence of ""companion plants."" These plants favor the same habitat conditions as ginseng and are sometimes found growing among ginseng. Finding these plants does not guarantee that you'll also find ginseng, but it is a good place to start.


These companion plants include trillium (Trillium spp.), bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis), cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides -blue, Actaea racemosa-black), jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum ), wild yam (Dioscorea villosa), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), and Solomon’s seal (Polygonatum biflorum).
Poison Ivy is not considered a companion plant.

, The ginseng plant has a single stem that ends with a whorl (i.e. single point that the leaves originate from) of 1 to 4 leaves. Each leaf usually has 3 to 5 leaflets (i.e. smaller leaves).If the plant is mature, you will see a cluster of 6 to 20 whitish green flowers. The flowers will eventually produce red berries.Ginseng can be hard to spot. However once you find the first plant, it will be easier to find more.Ginseng changes as it develops. If the plant is immature, you will see a single stem with only 3 leaflets total. As the plant matures, each leaf will consist of 3 to 7 leaflets. A ginseng patch will have plants of all different stages of growth.You can find ginseng in both small groups and as solitary plants.It may be helpful to look at pictures of the ginseng plant before you go hunting or take a more experienced hunter with you.

, If harvesting wild ginseng is allowed in your state harvest only mature plants with 3 or more prongs (leaves), and only when there is a sizeable population (leave at least 2/3 so that they can continue to reproduce, as well as any immature plants). Because wild ginseng is threatened, make sure to pick any ripe, red berries and plant them, separately, 1/2"" to 1"" deep in loose soil, 2 to 10 feet from the parent plant. You should protect these plants from other harvesters by clipping the stems from all 2-, 3-, and 4-pronged plants (making sure to plant any ripe berries).


For more information on sustainable harvesting methods, see:, When you find a mature plant with 3 prongs (i.e. leaves) (or 4 prongs (leaves) in Illinois), carefully dig the root out so as not to damage it and the neck. Use a pitchfork or needle-nose spade to dig under the plant, and leave plenty of space (about 6 inches/15 cm) between the plant and where you push the pitchfork or spade into the ground.Be respectful of nearby plants and try not to disturb them. If the plant is close to immature ginseng plants, use a smaller tool such as a stout flat blade screwdriver about 8 or 10 inches (20.3 or 25.4 cm) long, and work with extra care.
If there is any risk of damaging the roots of adjacent immature ginseng plants, do not attempt to harvest the plant.
After you have dug the root out, squeeze the red fruits into the palm of your hand and plant the seeds about 1 inch (2.5 cm) under the soil near the harvested plant. Never remove ginseng seeds or immature plants from the woods., When you get back home, briefly soak the roots in a bucket of cool water to remove excess soil. Do not wash them under a sink faucet or with a hose. Do not scrub them or wash them vigorously as some soil is desirable by the buyer and the surface of the root can easily be damaged. Then place the roots in a single layer on a screen tray or wooden rack to dry.Make sure the roots are not touching and let them dry on a wooden rack or screen tray in a well-ventilated room between 70–100 °F (21–38 °C).
Never dry your roots in the oven, microwave, direct sunlight, or in a car window (i.g. placing the root near the back window of your car).
Check your roots periodically as they are drying. If you see any mold or discoloration, adjust the temperature or airflow.
Roots should easily snap into two pieces when they are completely dry.
It will probably take 1 to 2 weeks to dry your ginseng roots.

Get a permit or license, if necessary.,
Identify mature ginseng plants.,
Sell and export your ginseng.,
Export ginseng internationally.",How to Hunt for Wild Ginseng2," Some states require you to have a state-issued permit to harvest.If you are harvesting on private property, get permission from the property owner before you start.Always take your permit with you when are out harvesting. You are required to show your permit if you are requested to do so.


Some U.S. Forest Service National Forests issue harvest permits for wild ginseng while other National Forests prohibit the harvest of ginseng. Check with the National Forest in your area to know whether ginseng harvesting is allowed.The harvest of wild ginseng on U.S. National Parks is strictly prohibited.

, You are only permitted to harvest mature ginseng plants. Mature ginseng plants are at least 5 years old and have 3 or 4 prongs. Also, look for plants with red berries. You can also count stem scars to determine the age of the plant.For every year of growth, a stem scar will appear on the root neck of the plant. The plants you harvest should have at least 4 stem scars.
You don't need to remove the plant from the ground to count stem scars. Simply, remove the soil from around the area where the root neck is.If the berries are still green, the plant isn't ready for you to harvest.

, You will need a license to sell and/or export your ginseng. If you plan to ship your ginseng out of state, it must be certified by the State or Tribe where you harvested the roots. If you plan to ship your ginseng internationally, apply for an export permit from the US Fish & Wildlife Service.Your international shipments will only be permitted if you harvested the roots according to all regulations and the shipment is not detrimental to the survival of the American ginseng population.

, If you plan to export your ginseng, you must apply for a permit through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.There is a form for multiple commercial shipments and a form for for a single shipment. In addition to your permit, you must have State or Tribal documents that certify that you legally harvested the ginseng.Once your application is approved, your Master File is established. You will then have to get single-use permits for each of one your exports.
Your application to export wild ginseng will be valid for one year.

Avoid ingesting the roots or sap.,
Keep your livestock safe.,
Know that the results can be deadly.",How to Identify Water Hemlock," The latter name will give you the top results of what water hemlock looks like, and will help you understand what to look for when identifying this species.;
, Water hemlock grows 0.6 m (2.0 ft) to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) tall; stems are erect, stout, hollow mostly of the lower portion, occasionally branching, and mostly hairless. Leaves are below the flowers, and come from the base and along the stem. Roots are with thickened tuberous and chambered bases; a number of the true roots are also often thickened.

, The leaves are the most important part of the plant to make a positive identification, and distinguishes itself from other species. As mentioned in the previous step, leaves are basal (come from the base), or cauline (grow up along the stem), and develop alternately along the stem.


Leaves are two to three-times odd pinnate (pinnate = arranged like a long feather; odd = single leaf at top), with leaflets lanceolate-ovate to narrowly lanceolate. Each leaflet is around 3 cm (1.2 in) to 10 cm (3.9 in) long, and 1 cm (0.39 in) to about 2 cm (0.79 in) wide.Leaflets are also coarsely toothed.
Leaves themselves are around 45 cm (1.48 ft) and about 20 cm (0.66 ft); the longer leaves are found closer to the bottom of the plant. Each division typically contains 3 to 7 leaflets. Lateral veins of the leaflets extend to the notches between the teeth instead of to the tips along the leaf margins. Few other plants in the family Apiaceae in North America have this characteristic.

, Apart from what was already mentioned above, C. maculata typically has stems that is reddish-purple to purplish from the nodes. Some of this purplish colour extends down the stem or up from the base of the leaves. Stems also have a whitish film that can be rubbed off when touched.


There may be some spotting seen on the stems, although inconspicuous; streaking of reddish purple is more obvious.

, As mentioned before, the roots are quite fleshy, tuberous and thickened, and the base is often bulbous. Cutting a cross-section of the root reveals that it's chambered and hollow.

The sap that comes from cut stems and roots is oily and yellowish, and has a bit of a fowl odour; almost like that of mice or raw parsnip.

, The inflorescence is a compound umbel, and there should be about 1 to several per plant. The primary umbel (the largest inflorescence on the plant) will have 18 to 28 rays (with umbellets), and the secondary (smaller) umbels have 12 to 25 rays. Compound umbels are at most 6 in (15 cm) wide, and dome-shaped on top.


Individual umbellets are comprised of 12 to 15 flowers clustered together.

Each flower is whitish-green, with five small petals, and unequal to subequally symmetrical.



, Water hemlock is native to North America, and common in moist to wet areas. This includes shores, along streams, in marshy/swampy areas (bogs, sloughs, fens, riparian areas, etc.), and in wet ditches.

, The next part below shows some species that are commonly confused with C. maculata, from those related to a couple completely unrelated to this species., There are surprisingly quite a few species, and most of these species are found in the Carrot Family (Apiaceae). These similar species, described more in the steps below, include:

Angelicas (Angelica spp.)
Cow Parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris)
Caraway (Carum carvi)
Bulbous Water Hemlock (Cicuta bulbifera)
Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum)
Giant Hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum)
Cow Parsnip (Heracleum maximum)
Wild Carrot (Daucus carota)
Red Elderberry (Sambucus racemosa)
Water Parsnip (Sium suave)
Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla)

, There are over 180 recognized species of Angelicas in the world, and all fall under the same family as water hemlock. Most species are similar in leaf structure from each other. Exemplary species of mention are White Angelica (Angelica arguta) and Yellow Angelica (Angelica dawsonii).



A. arguta is probably one of the most likeliest of Angelica species to be confused with water hemlock, primarily because of the similarly-looking umbel. However, there are some very distinguishing features of white angelica; there is a large, conspicuous sheathing base at the base of each leaf, and the leaves themselves, while also pinnately-compound, are ovate-lanceolate (wider than water hemlock), and irregularly lobed. Leaflet-edges are also spiny-toothed.A. dawsonii can be more easily distinguished by the yellow flowers, plus the conspicuous whorl of slashed or toothed bracts. The leaves, compared with white angelica, are slightly more finely toothed, more lanceolate (almost similar to C. maculata), and less irregularly-lobed.Great or Purple Angelica (Angelica atropurpurea) is another species that may be thought of as being very similar in appearance to water hemlock; however the leaves tell a much different story; The leaves are actually what botanists call bipinnate. This means that there are double the pinnate leaves on a single leaf; rather, leaflets are divided into subleaflets, still keeping that pinnate shape from each leaf lobe. Water hemlock is ""2 or 3 times pinnate"" which means there is an additional one or two leaves in addition to the main leaflet that would normally make up a true pinnate (feather-shape) leaf.Mature purple angelica are also predominantly purple (the stems), where water hemlock only has purple streaks running down from the nodes. It has the characteristic sheath found at the base of each leaf, and tends to grow much taller; to 8 ft (2.4 m) tall. Flowers are greenish-white to pale yellow.


The vast majority of angelicas are non-poisonous, rather seen as medicinal plants. The only species that is known to be poisonous is Angelica lineariloba or Sierra Angelica. The best way to distinguish this plant is by its narrow, feathery leaves, conspicuous sheaths at the base of each leaf and petiole (from where flowers are borne), and that it prefers higher elevations and rocky soil in the Sierra Nevadas than wetland areas typical of water hemlock., Another member of the Carrot Family, cow parsley can be distinguished from water hemlock by its noticeably finely-divided, fern-like leaves. With mature plants, the stalks are predominantly red to reddish-purple, unlike the reddish or purplish streaking from the nodes you find with water hemlock.

, Caraway is a cultivated plant of the carrot family, but can also grow wild as a weed. This species has leaves that are very finely divided, looking very similar to carrot leaves.

, Closely related to water hemlock not only by family, but genus as well, bulbous water hemlock can be distinguished by its much more feathery, linear leaflets, which are sparsely toothed. Upper leaves are smaller and simple, with small bulbs (bulblets) produced in their axils. This species is also poisonous.

, All parts very poisonous. A European native that is easily confused with water hemlock simply by name. Because water hemlock is also poisonous, some people also call it ""poison hemlock"" even though this other similar species in the family Apiaceae carries that same common name! You will need to focus primarily on the distinguishing features that set these two species apart:



C. maculatum is generally taller, has notable purplish splotches on the stems, sheaths or stipules that narrow into a point as it goes up the leaf stem. The leaves themselves are much more divided than Cicuta maculata; called ""pinnately compound."" This means that each leaf is made up of several leaflet pairs arranged on opposite sides of the main leaf stalk. Each leaflet is segmented and around 1⁄8 inches (0.32 cm) to 1⁄4 inches (0.64 cm) long.







, Giant hogweed is an introduced noxious weed from Asia, and one that grows to be much larger than water hemlock. It too is within the family Apiaceae, and actually can be more easily confused with cow parsnip (see below) than water hemlock due to size and leaf structure. H. mantegazzianum grows to over 18 ft (5.5 m) in ideal conditions. The first year it will produce vegetation, or continue to produce vegetation until 2 to 5 years later where it will produce flowers, then die afterwards. Giant hogweed produces a single hollow stem that may be as wide as 6 in (15 cm) at the base. These stems also have purple blotches and stiff hairs arising from blisters or bumps that appear along the stem.
The leaves of H. mantegazzianum are huge. They measure 10 ft (3.0 m) long and over 5.5 ft (1.7 m) wide. The leaves themselves are alternate, 3-part compound (or with 3 deeply cut leaflets), with deep irregular palmate lobes, and sharp, coarse teeth on all margins. Further up the stem in flowering plants the leaves are smaller but similar shape and often not divided but still deeply 3-lobed. Vegetative plants form rosettes of these huge leaves.Flowers are also enormous, umbels measuring from 2.5 ft (0.76 m) to almost 4 ft (1.2 m) across. They are also white.
This plant has serious toxic qualities that causes severe photodermatitis. Skin exposed to the plant's sap first, then the sun, will cause severe skin rashes, blisters, and possibly permanent scarring or discolouration., Cow parsnip is also rather large, and like water hemlock, native to North America. It does not get as tall as giant hogweed, only growing 3 ft (0.91 m) to 6 ft (1.8 m) tall. Stems are large and woolly-hairy. Leaves are 3-part compound, palmately compound, coarsely toothed, and almost heart-shaped. They are also quite large, 16 in (41 cm) long and 12 in (30 cm) wide. Leaflets are not as deeply divided as giant hogweed, but more ovate, and divided into 3 or 5 lobes, with broad acute tips.Flowers are in large compound umbels, which are flat-topped, and white.

, This plant has hairy stems, and leaves that are lace-like, finely-dissected and hairy; the look much like garden carrot leaves. Roots are edible, whitish in colour, and look very much like a typical garden carrot. The umbel, when it dries and goes into seed, folds into itself into the shape of a bird's nest. A distinct characteristic of most plants is that in the center of flower umbels, there is a small, red flower.

, The young shoots of this species can be easily confused with water hemlock. Red elderberry is a rather large shrub in its more mature form. But with young stalks, where the leaves of water hemlock are alternate, red elderberry is opposite. Elderberry leaves are more rounded (less lance-shaped), and are not with 2 or 3 extra leaflets on a several-times pinnate leaf. Leaf margins are also smoother.

, Probably the most-often mistaken species for water hemlock. Water parsnip is found in the same areas as water hemlock, and is also a native species to North America, but in order to differentiate this species from water hemlock, look carefully at the leaves. The leaves of water parsnip are only once pinnate, and usually with more narrow leaflets than water hemlock.

, Western Hemlock looks nothing like water hemlock; in fact, it's a large coniferous tree (grows 30 m (98 ft) to 50 m (160 ft) tall) found in the West Coast from Oregon to British Columbia. It was named so because it has a similar smell to the European forb poison hemlock.

, Water hemlock is most toxic when the roots are eaten or the sap is ingested. The oily sap contains a cicutoxin that affects the central nervous system, causing extremely violent convulsions and death from respiratory failure within a few hours. Small doses of this sap are lethal, and symptoms of poisoning occur rapidly within 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion., Livestock have been known to eat the leaves of water hemlock without significant adverse effects, however it is not recommended to go ahead and allow animals to graze on these plants when the risk of pulling up and eating the roots is quite high., Rabies can be confused with ingestion of water hemlock due to the classic frothing at the mouth. This is followed by tremors, uneasiness, and severe pain in the abdominal area. Grinding of the teeth and clamping of the jaws often occur, with the tongue likely becoming lacerated as a result. These seizures may come in bouts, with relaxation periods in between where loss of muscle control and laboured breathing are experienced. Death soon follows by a matter of a few hours. Larger doses can kill a human or large bovine in a matter of minutes.

Find a patch of clover.,
Scan over the patch.,
Identify any four-leaf varieties.,
Mark the patch.,
Preserve your lucky clovers by following the instructions in How to Press Leaves.

,
If you want more of a good thing, gently remove a strand of the multi-leaf clover, about 4-5 heads worth, and set in in water in a place with indirect sunlight.,
Pick the flowers from this clover once they turn brown.,
Care for the clovers.",How to Find a Four Leaf Clover," If you find a patch in which many of the plants have four leaves, it's probably a clover look-alike, such as Marsilea quadrifolia (leaves have a triangular shape with rounded corners, grows in wet soil and water) or Oxalis tetraphylla/deppei (purple in the center, where the four leaflets meet). What you want to look for is a patch of white clover (Trifolium repens, identified by white flowers) because they're more likely to produce a four-leaf plant than other types of clover.;
, When you are starting out, don't stare down every single clover. Brush over the clover gently with your foot so that you can see them all. This should catch the more conspicuous clovers. Your eyes will naturally go to the odd one out. If you find 3 or more in less than 3 minutes, you probably have a hot spot. Mark this place and visit it often, because the mutation will happen again. You can usually get 10 or so out of a well-sized ""hot spot"" with close inspection.

, Most four-leaf clovers have one leaf that is smaller than the other three. Some leaves have white or red or no lines. The leaves can be rounded or heart-shaped.

, It is commonly thought that 4-leaf clovers are actually caused by a genetic defect in the root of the clover plant. Most clovers in patches are either growing from one plant or a network of plants. So, the chances are that if you've found one defected clover, there's likely to be more there. Place a small flag or the like to mark it so you can check the rest of the areas.

,, When it starts growing roots, plant it in a clear area in your yard. It spreads fast, and the patch will have the same genetics as the original.

, Store the seeds until the next spring, or refrigerate them. Plant them, and wait until each young plant has several dozen heads to determine whether it has the multi-leaf gene.

, Clovers don't appear to do well in containers, such as pots; it is better to transplant them to a raised bed (or your lawn) as soon as possible. They are also very sensitive to dehydration, and severe dehydration can cause the plant to revert to its three-leaf state, even once it is hydrated and spreading again.

Try to find out when it was planted.,
Count the tree's whorls.,
Multiply the diameter by the growth factor.A tree's growth factor is the measurement of the width it gains annually.",How to Determine the Age of a Tree1," This is the only way to know for certain how old a tree is, since all of the other methods are simply estimates. If possible, conduct research to find out when the tree might have been planted. Ask older residents of the neighborhood or look at old photographs to try to date the tree.






;
, Some species of trees, such as particular conifers, produce annual branch whorls. Counting branch whorls can be used to estimate the tree's age. This method is not as accurate as cutting down the tree and counting the rings, but it's a way to estimate the tree's age without having to kill it.








Count the number of branch whorls above chest height.













Add 1 to your total to account for the tip of the tree.














, If you know the average annual width of tree ring for that species, you can multiply it by the diameter of the trunk to estimate the tree's age. Different species' growth factors are dependent on their environment - for example, forest trees grow faster than city trees - so this method for determining a tree's age is truly an estimate.

Measure the circumference of the trunk in inches. Use the trunk width at 4.5 feet (1.4 m) off the ground.
Calculate the diameter (circumference divided by pi).
Multiple the diameter and the tree species' average growth factor. This will give you the approximate age of the tree in years. You can figure out a tree's growth factor by searching online or measuring the rings of a dead tree from the same species."
"
Fell the tree and count its rings.,
Use an increment borer.",How to Determine the Age of a Tree2," If the tree is already dead, you can count the rings on the exposed stump. The number of rings indicates the number of years the tree lived.









Keep in mind that most trees produce a two-colored ring per year, within the annual ring the thinner strip is the phloem and the thicker is the xylem. Thinner rings represent colder years whereas thicker rings represent warmer years.














, This will take a small sample from the tree bark to the pith (tree centre). It's a way to count the tree's rings without cutting down the tree. The length of the borer should be at least 75% of the tree's diameter.









Position the borer at average chest height (1.3 m) from the ground.













Drill a sample.













Confirm that your sample contains pith. If not, you will need to re-drill.












Count the number of rings.
